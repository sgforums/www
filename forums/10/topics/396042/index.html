              First, let us read what objective parties have to say about Chiam See Tong's departure from the SDP.
              
              "Conventional wisdom has it that Chee Soon Juan was the power keg that caused the SDP to break up. Chee succeed Chiam as secretary-general, and his more confrontational approach certainly drew heavier PAP fire than the SDP was used to. However, the truth behind the SDPâ€™s downfall is a lot more complex. Internal differences were simmering before Chee appeared, and probably would have boiled over even without him. The partyâ€™s problems have more to do with its leadersâ€™ inability to manage its own growth and success.
              
              This is the inevitable conclusion one would have to draw from the curious events of 1993. That May, Chiam resigned as secretary-general in a fit of pique, after he failed to persuade the rest of his central executive committee to censure Chee for his hunger strike. When the CEC members failed to coax him back and announced his departure to the press, Chiam proceeded to bad-mouth them openly, provoking them into holding a disciplinary hearing that expelled him from the party. The renegade MP took the CEC to court. Justice Warren Khoo said that Chiam had brought his problems upon himself, but since the partyâ€™s hearing had been carried out in an â€œinept manner,â€� the sacking was unlawful. Chiam was ordered to be reinstated as a cadre member, which he remained until he quit before the 1997 General Election."
              
              - (Cherian Georgeâ€™s Singapore: The Air-Conditioned Nation)
              
              "Furthermore, Chiam started to bring his own symphathizers who attempted to change the SDP constitution to prevent CEC members from holding paid positions at the town councils run by the SDP (these suggestions were thrown out by Ling after he won the SDP chairmanship). Whatever the case, the refusal by the CEC to condemn Dr Cheeâ€™s hunger strike struck a nerve with Chiam, who then immediately resigned without allowing himself to be persuaded by his own CEC to be reasonable. Not long after his resignation as Secretary-General, Chiam attacked his own party at a Singapore Press Club event, during which he said:
              
              I had to disassociate myself from people who are definitely going in the wrong direction.
              
              Nothing about being â€œforced outâ€� there. Hmm."
              
              Taken from: http://dlzj.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/chiam-gate-part-deux/
              
              Now let us examine the facts of the matter.
              
              Fact #1: Problems were already brewing between Mr Chiam and his CEC colleagues even before I had joined the SDP. This was revealed in court when he sued the SDP in 1993.
              
              Mr Chiam: "To me, the problems started in 1988, when Wong Hong Toy and about 15 other Workers' Party members joined the party...there was backbiting and other problems..."
              
              Former SDP chairman Mr Ling How Doong confirmed this: "In my view, all the troubles between Chiam and Wong Hong Toy started after the 1991 General Elections, when Wong came to help me full-time."
              
              Mr Ashleigh Seow (Mr Francis Seow's son), then a CEC member, testified: "Most people have had a difficult time with [Mr Chiam] at one time or another." Mr Seow was referring to the period between 1988-1991 and to CEC members like Messrs Jimmy Tan, Cheo Chai Chen, Francis Yong and himself. 
              
              Fact #2: Mr Chiam did not like the idea of collective leadership, which is what a CEC of a political party and democracy are about. 
              
              I can only wonder why he is in Parliament as an Opposition member when he is against the idea of collective leadership in the first place. By the way, Mr Lee Kuan Yew of the PAP isn't too fond of the idea of collective leadership either...
              
              Mr Chiam: "Collective leadership is nonsense."
              
              Mr Ling: "You're talking of dictatorship."
              
              Fact #3: Mr Chiam first resigned as the secretary-general of the party on 17 May 93. When the CEC refused to support his motion to censure Chee Soon Juan for going on a hunger strike, Mr Chiam tendered his resignation on the spot.
              
              Fact #4: Mr Chiam's demands to the SDP in exchange for his return to the party was undemocratic and against the party's constitution. He insisted that he would return as secretary-general only if the CEC gave him sole power to appoint and dismiss CEC and cadre members. He also wanted the SDP to sack Mr Wong Hong Toy, then vice-chairman. 
              
              Fact #5: The SDP tried negotiating with Chiam See Tong and kept his resignation made on 17 May 93 under wraps for a month.
              
              Taken from: http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/truth-about/3552-part-1-the-truth-about-chiam-see-tongs-departure
              
              Fact #6: Chiam See Tong admitted himself that he was not 'forced out'.
              
              The Straits Times quoted Mr Chiam as saying: "I had to disassociate myself from people who are definitely going in the wrong direction." 
              
              He had to DISASSOCIATE. Nothing about being 'forced out'.
              
              Fact #7: Chiam See Tong broke his own oath.
              
              The attack by Mr Chiam at the SPC was especially difficult to take given that it was he, when he was secretary-general, who had made CEC members sign an oath and a deed to "prevent high-ranking officials from disparaging the party." 
              
              Fact #8: 11 of the 13 CEC members voted to expel Chiam See Tong.
              
              Clearly, it wasn't Chee Soon Juan who 'ousted' Chiam. It was Chiam See Tong's own CEC members who voted in a democratic manner to expel him.
              
              Fact #9: Even after the CEC voted to expel Chiam, overtures were made by them to seek reconciliation. Chiam See Tong was the one to turn down the olive branches.
              
              Fact #10: Former High Court Judge, Warren Khoo, was quoted as saying: "It may be fairly said that [Mr Chiam] brought the disciplinary proceedings and court action on himself." 
              
              Taken from: http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/truth-about/3564-part-2-chiams-expulsion-what-really-happened
              
              Fact #11: Heavy-weight PAP members such as Goh Chok Tong and Wong Kan Seng openly supported Chiam See Tong.
              
              Fact #12: Chiam See Tong was willing to force a 3-corner fight in the 1997 General Elections, pitting the SPP against the SDP, which was not only his former party but a fellow opposition party as well.
              
              Fact #13: Chee Soon Juan behaved like a gentleman and refused to be goaded into mudslinging his fellow opposition politician when contacted by SPH.
              
              Taken from: http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/truth-about/3569-part-3-goh-chok-tong-without-chiam-harder-to-destroy-chee
              
              In conclusion, we can safely say (without fear of defamation) that Chiam See Tong was not 'forced out' of the SDP by any one single person. Records will show that the CEC voted overwhelmingly to expel him. 
              
              Also, even after Chiam See Tong announced his resignation, SDP CEC members were still willing to negotiate with him, but it was Chiam See Tong who made unreasonable demands that went against the party's constitution. And even after those demands were made, and after the CEC voted to expel him, several olive branches were extended to Chiam only to be rejected.
              
              We now know that Chiam See Tong himself made CEC members swear an oath not to criticize the SDP, but he himself broke that oath when he attacked the SDP, not in private but in front of the whole nation when he gave an interview to SPH. 
              
              Throughout the whole saga, Chee Soon Juan and his party members in the SDP acted like perfect gentlemen and refused to be goaded into a mudslinging match with a fellow opposition politician. But the recent interview given by Mrs Chiam showed that the PAP was not willing to let the matter rest, and that they are perfectly willing to keep using this lie, supported partly by Mr Chiam See Tong himself, to attack the SDP.
              
              And thus, Chee Soon Juan is forced to speak up and let the truth be known. Had he maintained his silence, I am sure the PAP media will keep on using the Chiams to attack the SDP as the General Election approaches.

              <p>it has gotten to the point that the devil we don't know is better than one we do know...................voting for opposition is a no-brainer..................but since PAP controls the balloting process and the media...........will we know who actually won ?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>First, let us read what objective parties have to say about
                  Chiam See Tong’s departure from the <span>SDP</span>.</p>
              <p>“Conventional wisdom has it that Chee Soon Juan was the power
                  keg that caused the <span>SDP</span> to break up. Chee
                  succeed Chiam as secretary-general, and his more confrontational
                  approach certainly drew heavier <span>PAP</span> fire than
                  the <span>SDP</span> was used to. However, the truth
                  behind the <span>SDP</span>’s downfall is a lot more
                  complex. Internal differences were simmering before Chee appeared,
                  and probably would have boiled over even without him. The party’s
                  problems have more to do with its leaders’ inability to manage its
                  own growth and success.</p>
              <p>This is the inevitable conclusion one would have to draw from
                  the curious events of 1993. That May, Chiam resigned as
                  secretary-general in a fit of pique, after he failed to persuade
                  the rest of his central executive committee to censure Chee for his
                  hunger strike. When the <span>CEC</span> members failed to
                  coax him back and announced his departure to the press, Chiam
                  proceeded to bad-mouth them openly, provoking them into holding a
                  disciplinary hearing that expelled him from the party. The renegade
                  MP took the <span>CEC</span> to court. Justice Warren Khoo
                  said that Chiam had brought his problems upon himself, but since
                  the party’s hearing had been carried out in an “inept manner,” the
                  sacking was unlawful. Chiam was ordered to be reinstated as a cadre
                  member, which he remained until he quit before the 1997 General
                  Election.”</p>
              <p>- (Cherian George’s Singapore: The Air-Conditioned Nation)</p>
              <p>“Furthermore, Chiam started to bring his own symphathizers who
                  attempted to change the <span>SDP</span> constitution to
                  prevent <span>CEC</span> members from holding paid
                  positions at the town councils run by the <span>SDP</span> (these suggestions were thrown out by Ling after he won the
                  <span>SDP</span> chairmanship). Whatever the case, the
                  refusal by the <span>CEC</span> to condemn Dr Chee’s
                  hunger strike struck a nerve with Chiam, who then immediately
                  resigned without allowing himself to be persuaded by his own
                  <span>CEC</span> to be reasonable. Not long after his
                  resignation as Secretary-General, Chiam attacked his own party at a
                  Singapore Press Club event, during which he said:</p>
              <p>I had to disassociate myself from people who are definitely
                  going in the wrong direction.</p>
              <p>Nothing about being “forced out” there. Hmm.”</p>
              <p>Taken from: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dlzj.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/chiam-gate-part-deux/">http://dlzj.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/chiam-gate…</a></p>
              <p>Now let us examine the facts of the matter.</p>
              <p>Fact #1: Problems were already brewing between Mr Chiam and his
                  <span>CEC</span> colleagues even before I had joined the
                  <span>SDP</span>. This was revealed in court when he sued
                  the <span>SDP</span> in 1993.</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam: “To me, the problems started in 1988, when Wong Hong
                  Toy and about 15 other Workers’ Party members joined the
                  party…there was backbiting and other problems…”</p>
              <p>Former <span>SDP</span> chairman Mr Ling How Doong
                  confirmed this: “In my view, all the troubles between Chiam and
                  Wong Hong Toy started after the 1991 General Elections, when Wong
                  came to help me full-time.”</p>
              <p>Mr Ashleigh Seow (Mr Francis Seow’s son), then a <span>CEC</span> member, testified: “Most people have had a difficult
                  time with [Mr Chiam] at one time or another.” Mr Seow was referring
                  to the period between 1988-1991 and to <span>CEC</span> members like Messrs Jimmy Tan, Cheo Chai Chen, Francis Yong and
                  himself.</p>
              <p>Fact #2: Mr Chiam did not like the idea of collective
                  leadership, which is what a <span>CEC</span> of a
                  political party and democracy are about.</p>
              <p>I can only wonder why he is in Parliament as an Opposition
                  member when he is against the idea of collective leadership in the
                  first place. By the way, Mr Lee Kuan Yew of the <span>PAP</span> isn’t too fond of the idea of collective leadership
                  either…</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam: “Collective leadership is nonsense.”</p>
              <p>Mr Ling: “You’re talking of dictatorship.”</p>
              <p>Fact #3: Mr Chiam first resigned as the secretary-general of the
                  party on 17 May 93. When the <span>CEC</span> refused to
                  support his motion to censure Chee Soon Juan for going on a hunger
                  strike, Mr Chiam tendered his resignation on the spot.</p>
              <p>Fact #4: Mr Chiam’s demands to the <span>SDP</span> in
                  exchange for his return to the party was undemocratic and against
                  the party’s constitution. He insisted that he would return as
                  secretary-general only if the <span>CEC</span> gave him
                  sole power to appoint and dismiss <span>CEC</span> and
                  cadre members. He also wanted the <span>SDP</span> to sack
                  Mr Wong Hong Toy, then vice-chairman.</p>
              <p>Fact #5: The <span>SDP</span> tried negotiating with
                  Chiam See Tong and kept his resignation made on 17 May 93 under
                  wraps for a month.</p>

              <p>Fact #6: Chiam See Tong admitted himself that he was not ‘forced
                  out’.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times quoted Mr Chiam as saying: “I had to
                  disassociate myself from people who are definitely going in the
                  wrong direction.”</p>
              <p>He had to <span>DISASSOCIATE</span>. Nothing about
                  being ‘forced out’.</p>
              <p>Fact #7: Chiam See Tong broke his own oath.</p>
              <p>The attack by Mr Chiam at the <span>SPC</span> was
                  especially difficult to take given that it was he, when he was
                  secretary-general, who had made <span>CEC</span> members
                  sign an oath and a deed to “prevent high-ranking officials from
                  disparaging the party.”</p>
              <p>Fact #8: 11 of the 13 <span>CEC</span> members voted to
                  expel Chiam See Tong.</p>
              <p>Clearly, it wasn’t Chee Soon Juan who ‘ousted’ Chiam. It was
                  Chiam See Tong’s own <span>CEC</span> members who voted in
                  a democratic manner to expel him.</p>
              <p>Fact #9: Even after the <span>CEC</span> voted to expel
                  Chiam, overtures were made by them to seek reconciliation. Chiam
                  See Tong was the one to turn down the olive branches.</p>
              <p>Fact #10: Former High Court Judge, Warren Khoo, was quoted as
                  saying: “It may be fairly said that [Mr Chiam] brought the
                  disciplinary proceedings and court action on himself.”</p>
              <p>Taken from: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/truth-about/3564-part-2-chiams-expulsion-what-really-happened">http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/truth-about/35…</a></p>
              <p>Fact #11: Heavy-weight <span>PAP</span> members such as
                  Goh Chok Tong and Wong Kan Seng openly supported Chiam See
                  Tong.</p>
              <p>Fact #12: Chiam See Tong was willing to force a 3-corner fight
                  in the 1997 General Elections, pitting the <span>SPP</span> against the <span>SDP</span>, which was not
                  only his former party but a fellow opposition party as well.</p>
              <p>Fact #13: Chee Soon Juan behaved like a gentleman and refused to
                  be goaded into mudslinging his fellow opposition politician when
                  contacted by <span>SPH</span>.</p>
              <p>Taken from: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/truth-about/3569-part-3-goh-chok-tong-without-chiam-harder-to-destroy-chee">http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/truth-about/35…</a></p>
              <p>In conclusion, we can safely say (without fear of defamation)
                  that Chiam See Tong was not ‘forced out’ of the <span>SDP</span> by any one single person. Records will show that the
                  <span>CEC</span> voted overwhelmingly to expel him.</p>
              <p>Also, even after Chiam See Tong announced his resignation,
                  <span>SDP CEC</span> members were still willing to
                  negotiate with him, but it was Chiam See Tong who made unreasonable
                  demands that went against the party’s constitution. And even after
                  those demands were made, and after the <span>CEC</span> voted to expel him, several olive branches were extended to Chiam
                  only to be rejected.</p>
              <p>We now know that Chiam See Tong himself made <span>CEC</span> members swear an oath not to criticize the
                  <span>SDP</span>, but he himself broke that oath when he
                  attacked the <span>SDP</span>, not in private but in front
                  of the whole nation when he gave an interview to <span>SPH</span>.</p>
              <p>Throughout the whole saga, Chee Soon Juan and his party members
                  in the <span>SDP</span> acted like perfect gentlemen and
                  refused to be goaded into a mudslinging match with a fellow
                  opposition politician. But the recent interview given by Mrs Chiam
                  showed that the <span>PAP</span> was not willing to let
                  the matter rest, and that they are perfectly willing to keep using
                  this lie, supported partly by Mr Chiam See Tong himself, to attack
                  the <span>SDP</span>.</p>
              <p>And thus, Chee Soon Juan is forced to speak up and let the truth
                  be known. Had he maintained his silence, I am sure the <span>PAP</span> media will keep on using the Chiams to attack the
                  <span>SDP</span> as the General Election approaches.</p>

              <p>Most of your facts are extracted from SDP website. So the accuracy is hard to believe as well (Same as source taken from SPP/PAP, if any)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, is there a chance that Chee manipulate the CEC to vote Chiam out. If there is a such possibility, then it is neither democratic in any sense, and also, this is forced Chiam out, which is what I believed anyway.</p>
