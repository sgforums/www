But today, such values are giving way to american's own interests, its own security in fighting the terrorists, its own economy in securing supplies of oil and the issue of steel import, its own industrialization in dealing with international treaties such as Kyoto Protocol, just to name a few. a bit out of topic but I have no doubt about the truth of what is said (about freedom in spore), neither do I suspect his intention to want to speak something good, I question the effectiveness of such statement and I certainly feel that much more can be done, could have been done, if there is a true intention asking for changes.<br><br>In other words, I won't look at a yellow piece of s h i t and shout "Gold !".<br><br>I don't know about historical facts or about US, I am talking about HERE in Singapore, if the US embassador does have lunches with our oppositions members, and if the government does not make noise, then they have indeed become more "magnanimous". But, the US embassador must first invite the opposition members leh. No lunch how can we know if the PAP has become more tolerant?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> (I am also waiting for ppl to buy me free lunch <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).<br><br>It is immaterial whether you or I think such lunches are "as perfectly in order and not interfering in our internal affairs". The US embassador lunches with many hushands and wives and who is to say if he were interfering in somebody's domestic affairs?<br><br></div>

PAP definitely did a great job in building up and keeping Singapore, and america did a great job in "warding off the threats of communism and imperialism.....Â” and "uphold peace, progress and human values for suppressed nations in the world" for so many years. But these are all things in the past.<br><br>Now PAP is the only power in Singapore and America is the only superpower in the world. PAP's power in singapore cannot be checked and america is also the only world power capable of going against the UN, attacking any country who are against American interests, exploiting poorer nations (in name of globalization), protecting their own interests (even if it is at the expense of global environment).
