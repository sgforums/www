              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>do you know of business people who some how will ask his employees to buy things for charities and he present to them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>do you know of businessmen who preach religion to his staff?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and once he starts talking his book of teachings, he nebber stops?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i heard my cousin have such a boss. I never have such a boss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, I was kinda amuzed there are such preachers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they seem to want to influence employees with religion and make themselves known in society by being 'generous' and charitable?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think being charitable and religious is not bad thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i am not sure how i would feel if someone like this mix work with religion and preach to his staff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hope it is not  business motivated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>do u know of such businessmen?</p>

              <p>Have come across boss who is nasty and kept inviting people to his church.   There are some who told me he is such a bad person yet dare ask people to church, what a shame.</p>
              <p>Tell you, not all but some christians will resort to anything to fulfil their calling of converting people to christians.   So be wary even on forums there are such people I came across.   Some will keep talking about devil and use devil to cover up their flaws, sins.  </p>
              <p>Bosses that do what you mentioned are really despicable and have no respect for other people's religions.</p>

              <p>a person preaching and persuading others to convert</p>

              <p>Honestly, what i see is that many into religion</p>

              <p>Major Religions we know have good teachings.</p>
              <p>But I see that many so-called very religious people</p>
              <p>are not wise enough to comprehend the basics of the teachings.</p>
              <p>they appear to be very against other religion. i expect religion to teach tolerance and respect for different practices and rights of others to co-exist with different believes. this is basic child-level education. I am not sure if religions teach this .</p>

              <p>A grandfather passed away. his grandchildren all grown up. the grandfather is taoism. the grandchildren somehow got into another religion. At the wake, traditional chinese custom is to hold josssticks and pray at the deceased. that religion is so strict that it forbids all the grandchildren from holding a josstick. Its clearly 'political' act of anti-other-religion-by-showing-disrespect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>no matter what, out of respect , they should have just obliged and hold a jossstick and bow 3 times, thats all. they din. That was such an insult. It should not be regarded as a religious act but a tradition. Holding the jossstick and bowing is an act of respect in chinese culture and tradition.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think there is something wrong. i thus suspect how good can such religions be, really. it has wrong fundamentals.</p>

              <p>Think respect is the word here.   What you said above are true, but they can argue on the fact that by respecting the dead does not mean holding joss stick to pray to them, they claim there are other ways to show respect.   I understand why they don't hold joss sticks becos this is the teaching from their religion.</p>
              <p>What annoys me most is they can just go round condemning others and their religions.   Many times when they are in the wrong, they conveniently push the blame on the devil, evil and Satan and thus they don't turn over a new leaf.   They fail and refuse to take personal responsbility when they are in the wrong. </p>
              <p>Lastly, so what if I am not a christian and when I die I go hell, so what!   </p>

              <p>I think you don't understand religion.</p>
              <p>It's human nature to try to understand our environment and where we lack the science or the knowlege, we make up stories. Religion starts off as an explanation of things that cannot be explained.</p>
              <p>Stories make things easy to understand and as our world view gets more complex so does our religions and its practices. Some people interprete religion as a refuge from science, that people who are too stupid to understand science take refuge in religion.</p>
              <p>What aetheists don't sympathize with is that humans need something to fill the gap before they understand the science. It's used to quell the fear of the unknown. It's used to provide us with a moral yardstick. It's used to shape many of our laws and our interpretation of laws. It's used to govern our social relationships.</p>
              <p>Sadly, in our modern era it has taken on more ominous roles, to forment wars, to incalcate blind loyalty, to motivate through fear, to encourage ignorance and to enforce obedience. Things which should have been done though our own understanding of the world and how it works.</p>
              <p>A religion can be very helpful in putting the world in some sort of mental framework to help one make decisions. It can also be very dangerous when people take advantage of it to manipulate others. Ultimately each person has educate themselves as to how the world works.</p>
              <p>Aetheists believe that they have done so and reject God as a sign of their freedom from these restricted views. However it does not necessarily follow that they have a superior world view framework on which they make decisions. They can still be as easily fooled and manipulated as any other religious person by someone who understands how to fool them.</p>
