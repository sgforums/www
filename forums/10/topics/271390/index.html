It has to carry responsibilities of food safety. FDA is doing its job of ensuring the public are eating stuff that are safe.<br><br>Look at the fake medication that was reported in the US.  Tamiflu, Viagara, lowering Blood pressure medication and cholestrol lowering medication are Fake, there are no active ingredient in the pills, and are finding into the main stream distribution channel.<br><br>I think this is OUT of Control.  So i think a tightening of regulation to ensure public safety is not a conspiracy.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Mad Cow Disease Another Ugly Side of Beef </strong><br><br>When Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell addressed the British House of Commons on March 20, 1996, he was ashen-faced for good reason. Like numerous other government representatives, for years Dorrell had been reassuring the nervous British public that the beef in their hamburgers, kidney pies and Sunday roasts was as safe and sound as the Pound sterling. Dorrell had also steadfastly insisted that no connection existed between any human illness and Mad Cow Disease, the incurable dementia that has killed 160,000 British cows since 1985. On March 20, however, a somber Secretary Dorrell faced the legislative body, and the nation, and proceeded to eat his very words. A government advisory committee, he explained, had concluded that Mad Cow Disease was indeed the "most likely" cause of a recent outbreak in young British adults of a similar fatal disease.<br><br>The announcement was an embarrassing about-face for the government. It stunned and angered the British people, and sent shockwaves through Europe and around the world. Beef went untouched in supermarkets by alarmed shoppers, and the chairman of the governmentÂ’s advisory committee said that victims could number in the hundreds of thousands.<br><br>In the US, government and livestock industry representatives did their best to allay public concern, insisting that domestic herds were free of Mad Cow Disease (known formally as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE) and that adequate safeguards were in place. Few of these reports mentioned, however, that the very practice that caused and fostered Mad Cow Disease in EnglandÂ—namely feeding cattle the processed remains of other livestockÂ—is altogether commonplace on American farms. In 1989 for example, approximately 800 million pounds of slaughterhouse remains were fed to US beef and dairy cows as an inexpensive Â“protein supplementÂ” designed to boost milk and meat production.<br><br>Safety concerns aside, forcing cows and other livestock to eat animal remains makes natural herbivores into carnivores and often into cannibals. Unless the US government acts swiftly to outlaw this practice, many now believe that a major outbreak of Mad Cow Disease in the US is possible, even likely.<br><br><strong>Still Crazy After All These Years </strong><br><br>In an international news release issued in March, EarthSave joined with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) in Washington, DC to draw attention to Mad Cow Disease. The release also sought to counter the mistaken, albeit widely reported notion that beef can be safe if only we somehow purge the meat supply of contaminants and contagions, such as the infectious agent responsible for Mad Cow Disease. Safe? The fact is, even when cows are healthy, eating them isnÂ’t. According to numerous studies by noted researchers, too many people worldwide are already suffering and dying from deadly substances found in beef, as well as in poultry, pork, fish and dairy products. These ingredients, including saturated fat and cholesterol, occur almost exclusively in foods of animal origin, and have been implicated time and again in the epidemic of heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes and obesity that plague Western nations.<br><br>To stimulate discussion in the heart of AmericaÂ’s cattle country on Mad Cow Disease and meat consumptionÂ’s human toll, EarthSave and PCRM attempted to place in the Des Moines [Iowa] Register newspaper an ad discussing this situation. The newspaper refused to print the $1,000 ad, however, deeming it unsuitable for their publication. Did the fact that the Register accepts great sums of advertising dollars each year from the meat industry influence the publisher's decision?<br><br>While the ad didn't play in Des Moines, it did have a far-reaching effect. Columnist Colman McCarthy, a member of EarthSaveÂ’s Board of Advisors, responded with a column entitled Â“Eating Cows is the Real MadnessÂ” that appeared in the Washington Post and the International Herald Tribune, newspapers with a combined readership of well over one million. In his column, McCarthy wrote, Â“If Mad Cow Disease can cause an international panic and political heartburn in the British Parliament because 10 Brits may possibly have contracted a rare nerve disorder from tainted beef, it should follow that the heavens themselves would be shaken by humanityÂ’s outcry over the proven deadliness of meat thatÂ’s available everywhere.Â”<br><br>Another mainstream newspaper was also having a beef with beef. Â“Meat-eaters learned more in the past week than they ever wanted to know about the origins of a hamburger," the Wall Street Journal reported. "The British experience of Mad Cow DiseaseÂ—and its links to commercial livestock feed and human illnessÂ—forever dispelled the image of contented cows grazing on sweet grass and hay. Modern agribusiness isn't like Â‘Green AcresÂ’... Most Americans are unfamiliar with farm life and were shocked to find that modern agriculture had made cattle into carnivores [and cannibals], fattened on meat and bone from sheep and cows.Â”<br><br></div>

The pesticide can cause humans to be poisoned within the first hour of exposure.<br><br>Ingestion of foods contaminated with low levels of aldicarb may cause flu-like symptoms (nausea, headache, blurred vision), which disappear quickly, usually within five or six hours, according to the California agency. At higher levels of ingestion, aldicarb-contaminated food can also cause dizziness, salivation, excessive sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle stiffness and twitching, and difficulty in breathing.<br><br><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56923" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56923</a></div></blockquote> So what is this Aldicarb sulfoxide?<br><br>Its trade names: Temik, ENT 27093, OMS 771, Sanacarb, UC 21149, Ambush<br><br>Pesticide type: systemic insecticide, nematicide, acaricide.<br><br>Current registration in U.S.: <span style="color: red;">restricted use only on potatoes</span>, citrus, cotton, peanuts, sorghum, soybeans, sugar beets, sugarcane, coffee, sweet potatoes, pecans, and various other crops. Use on bananas was revoked during special review process due to concerns about high residues.<br><br>Aldicarb is very highly toxic to birds and other organisms. Aldicarb is persistent and may remain in soils and plant material over the entire growing cycle.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Aldicarb is highly soluble in water and highly mobile in soil,</span> making it a pesticide of concern for ground and surface water contamination.<br><br>So the Chinese farmers had used this pesticide but the application left much of the residue on the ginger. I believe pesticides are used on much of the vegetable we import from Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. What our government does is to inspect and ban batches of vegetables that has high residue of pesticides, any pesticides.<br><br>We also know that before use of vege, wash thoroughly, if I am not wrong, all pesticides, like Aldicarb sulfoxide, are highly soluble.<br><br>If you are really scared, then don't eat ginger at all, and make sure the food you eat in hawker centers, restaurants all don't use ginger.<br><br>I don't like conspiracy theory, but I won't be so quick in jumping to say "yes" to everything the americans say.<br><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
