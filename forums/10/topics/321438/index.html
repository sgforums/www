The following is the text of the interview.
              <p> </p>
              <p>Q: In fact, democracies don't produce great statesmen anymore. Why?</p>
              <p>A: You now have, and I don't know how long this phase will last, mass media domination, owned by a group of media barons who want constant change for their balance sheets.</p>
              <p>Q: <span style="color: #ff6600;">So how do you see the future of capitalism?</span></p>
              <p>A: As chairman of the equivalent of our Sovereign Wealth Fund, we examine and decide where to invest our money, in equities or bonds or what have you. Our fund managers are paid five times what I get. Why? Because they have had good track records in growing our fund and we know what they could command in the private sector. They are dealing with billions of dollars every day and must be compensated accordingly.</p>
              <p>Unbridled capitalism, winner takes all like in America, does not work unless you can cope with an underclass.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> So here we also stay with the losers</span>, make sure they have enough to live on, with healthcare, equal education opportunities for their children whose parents can no longer afford it. It's very important they not feel abandoned. So we have workfare and ingenuous ways to keep them working as we don't want layabouts doing nothing. We also subsidize homes which they would not be able to buy. A society can only survive if there is a sense of equity and fair play.</p>

              <p>A: As chairman of the equivalent of our Sovereign Wealth Fund,
              we examine and decide where to invest our money, in equities or
              bonds or what have you. Our fund managers are paid five times what
              I get. Why? Because they have had good track records in growing our
              fund and we know what they could command in the private sector.
              They are dealing with billions of dollars every day and must be
              compensated accordingly.</p>
              <p>Unbridled capitalism, winner takes all like in America, does not
              work unless you can cope with an underclass. <span style="color: #ff0000;">So here we also stay with the losers</span>, make
              sure they have enough to live on, with healthcare, equal education
              opportunities for their children whose parents can no longer afford
              it. It's very important they not feel abandoned. So we have
              workfare and ingenuous ways to keep them working as we don't want
              layabouts doing nothing. We also subsidize homes which they would
              not be able to buy. A society can only survive if there is a sense
              of equity and fair play.</p>
