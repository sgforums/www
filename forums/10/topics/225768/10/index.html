I would see this as a black mark on his values, the values of being in the government, which is to serve the people.</blockquote>Ah...changing your position already? You equated the statements of the MP to Opposition party members who have been sued for defamation:<br><br>"Look at the recent issues on Wee Shu Min, just because her dad is a MIW means that her dad can say anything. Opposition? Be prepared to get sued and condemned."<br><br>Now you concede that he was not doing anything against the law, unlike the illegal actions of Opposition Party members....well, better you concede the error than dig in your heels.<br><br>Everyone is entitled to an opinion in a democratic society, subject to the law. You are free to attack his ideas whilst others are perfectly free to support his views. That's the basis of true freedom of speech. It is ironical that those who lambast the government for the lack of freedom of expression should be most zealous in trying to curb it.<br><br>There is a difference between attacking an idea in political debates and attacking a person, which is defamation. Opposition party members and supporters seem unable to grasp the difference. And until they do, Singapore is not ready for western-style democracy...people do not respect the boundaries of the law.<br><br><blockquote>Perhaps he could be arrested for sedition should he be an opposition memberÂ… for incitement of unrest amongst the elites and the commoners? </blockquote>Pure speculation, as you yourself admit or as they say, NPNT. The Sedition Act is designed for a specific purpose and we have all seen how it is used against the blogger who made racist remarks, and rightly so. If it is used to curb legitimate political debates I will be the first to criticize the government for it. That has not happened, has it?</div>

Many Singaporeans fail to understand that whilst cost of services are lower in China and Malaysia, so do the salaries.

Many Singaporeans fail to understand that whilst cost of services are lower in China and Malaysia, so do the salaries. A haircut costs less in Malaysia, but that also means the barber there earns far less than theor counterpart in Singapore. The foreign worker is better off living in JB and commuting to work in Singapore every day. It's a hard life, but financially worthwhile.<br><br>Many Singaporeans are not as hungry as these foreign workers.</div></blockquote>I remember a lecturer of mine told us during a class one of his frens bought a house in JB, Malaysia n also had a familiy. He decided to bring his<br><br>familiy to stay in JB, Malaysia n cross over to Spore to work like Malaysian working in the Republic. The toll of crossing everyday really got on him.<br>His property also rented out n he decided to buy an HDB flat. I heard there also many of these Sporean staying in JB, MAlaysia crossing into Spore to work.</div>

It accuses those who query current policies of being ungrateful for the past achievements of the leaders.<br><br>But what an increasing number of people appear to recognize is that other economies in East Asia have done at least as well over that period - Hong Kong under an undemocratic but liberal colonial-style bureaucracy, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand under both democratic and authoritarian regimes.</blockquote><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/10/opinion/edbowring.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/10/opinion/edbowring.php</a></div>
