Do take into account that by 40 he probably has to send his kids to school, feed the family, settle the housing loans, take care of parents.<br><br>Survival is definately not a problem, please people in africa are surviving on just scraps, but are we a third world country?

You should not treat CPF contributions as savings interest rate account (which is what the gov is doing), first of all savings account or current account has flexibility, which means you can withdraw money when you need it (that's why for the benefits of liquidity, it pays less interest), CPF account is more like an insurance, you cannot withdraw till you are above the retirement age, which might mean above 40 years of contribution.<br><br>http://www.uob.com.sg/pages/personal/insurance/lifeassurance/uoblifeassurance/endowmentplans_smartsaver.html<br><br>CPF interest rate is not fixed and the government will adjust it according to the inflation rate.

I hope you will come down from your "oh so high up loft" and experience what the masses are experiencing. Let me ask you something, as a boss if you are to choose between:<br><br>1. 40 years old. Degree. Singaporean. Asking for $4k<br><br>OR<br><br>2. 24 years old. Masters. China/india, what have you. Asking for $1.6k<br><br>Who will you choose? The answer is obvious isn't it?<br><br>Do you think the 40 years old guy will be able to provide his family with a comfortable life? Do take into account that by 40 he probably has to send his kids to school, feed the family, settle the housing loans, take care of parents.<br><br>Survival is definately not a problem, please people in africa are surviving on just scraps, but are we a third world country? Do you want to compare with a third world country? Do you know many people are struggling to make ends meet here in modern Singapore? I really urge you to step out of your shell and learn more about those around you and stop making such sweeping remarks before understanding what's REALLY happening around you.</div></blockquote>1) Stop making assumption about who I am and where I came from because that has got nothing to do with this thread.<br><br>2) It really depends on the position.

Do you know what is the prevailing interest rate for endowment insurance? 3.75%! You should not treat CPF contributions as savings interest rate account (which is what the gov is doing), first of all savings account or current account has flexibility, which means you can withdraw money when you need it (that's why for the benefits of liquidity, it pays less interest), CPF account is more like an insurance, you cannot withdraw till you are above the retirement age, which might mean above 40 years of contribution.<br><br>http://www.uob.com.sg/pages/personal/insurance/lifeassurance/uoblifeassurance/endowmentplans_smartsaver.html</div></blockquote>I am wondering why you didnt quote that the following<br><br>1) 3.75% p.a. is <strong>"subject to change".</strong><br>2) As bonus rates are <strong>not guaranteed</strong>, the actual return may vary according to the future performance of the participating life fund.<br>3) What is the penalty to terminate your policy before maturity?<br><br>CPF is not an insurance, it is a compulsory saving scheme. And you can use them to pay housing, education, and investment in gold, stock and approved investment funds. Unfortunately CPF doesnt allow you to buy car, plasma, iPod, latest N series Nokia.<br><br></div>

Anyway have you really attempted to talk with them or is this just an assumption?<br><br>2) Which means you still have a choice. Right? Why create this situation in the first place? Globalisation is good, but too much foreign talents to the point of it displacing locals is not good.

Anyway if those in the 40s are retrenched and they don't try to find a job that pays reasonably well, who will help them pay for children's upbringing, housing loans, look after their parents?
