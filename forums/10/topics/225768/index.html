            <div class='col-md body'>Last month i went to Taipei, a under a supposed "inferior form of governance" for a short holiday, I was surprised that it was better than Singapore in many ways.<br><br>1.The streets are relatively free of litter despite the fact it does not have fines for littering.<br><br>2. The transport system is relatively good and cheaper than Singapore.<br><br>a) The bus has a Flat fee of 15 Yuan ($0.70) which you can take from one end to another end.<br><br>b) MRT fare starts from 20 Yuan ($0.95)<br><br>There can be further discounts if you use an Ez link card like Singapore.<br><br>3. The service standard is better. The sales staff are polite and every 7-11 Store you go, they would greet you with "Huan Yin Kuan Ling" This could be due to cultural influence from Japanese.<br><br>4. The Taiwanese give seats to elderly readily. When using escalators, people naturally keep to one side, to give way to those who want to climb. When entering the MRT doors, the people give way to passengers who are leaving.<br><br>5. Because Taiwanese do not legislate laws at their whim and fancies, the authorities are better at persuading its people to change. They get celebrities like Jolin Tsai and Lin Yilain to record Radio ads to persuade people to give seats to elderly.<br><br>6. Taiwan has a more entrepreneur friendly environment. Because they are a little more chaotic, itÂ’s easier to set up a street stall and be rich from doing small business. In Singapore, the hawkers and shops owners give most of their takings away in rent. Its also easier and cheaper to make your business known as billboards are plastered all over the country.<br><br>7. Taipei is the first Asian city that has a comprehensive wireless nationwide network while Singapore is playing catch-up.<br><br>Can Â“good governanceÂ” produce these results?

No tall buildings and the attitude there towards customers is excellent.<br><br>As usual, no where is perfect. My tour guide in a few instances started to talk about their country. He started to scold and criticize his government. Citing that his country every year has a poll. He mention that the finance minister is a nut promoted just because he helped the president before.

We are neither here, nor there. When people ask about your race, you say Chinese. When they heard of your "something-wrong" English, then ask you to say a few word in Mandarin, you knew nothing.

(yes, I use the word "procreation") No choice, bring the FTs in, to make the situation worse. Then we have unhappier citizens because they have to worry about rising cost of living, their old age issues and their child's education fee.<br>6)We have a one-party rule.
