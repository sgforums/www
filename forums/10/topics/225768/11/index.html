In addition, there r a lot of underground radio stations like to stirring up unrelated issues of the locals and immigrants, their MPs r thus in order to win the election this year. they hve to be seen that they r flighting for the ppls and attracting enough attention to be made known to the ppls there, that why they behaved in TW's Parliament like that.<br><br>It is a show of MPs' performance in Taiwan  same as our MPs hip- hop dancing at Orchard Road.<br><br>My advice to u is that dont judge a book just by the cover!!!!</div>
