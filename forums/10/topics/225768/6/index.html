They will not come after you. For saving insurance policy, you need to continue your monthly pay regardless if you have money or job. If you terminate before maturity, BANG!! you pay penalty.<br><br>3) To invest or not, that is up to individual. Even if you do nothing, you are still get the 2.5%.<br><br></div></blockquote>1)Ermmm....Since when I make comparison between interest rate and inflation rate? Don't be duff!!! You make the comparison then draw me into it. You made a challenge to all your post as being accurate, you claimed that inflation is less than 2.5% a year, I just pointed out to you that inflation was 2.64% a year.<br><br>2)Since you say job is applenty if you are willing to work. There should be no problems with getting a job to make payments to the insurance policy. So insurance works alot like our CPF. Then they should pay insurance rates instead of 2.5% p.a.<br><br>3)Yes to invest or not to invest is up to the individual, the less educated who don't know how to use the funds will be exploited by the CPF board. The CPF board will profit the difference between 3.75% and 2.5%, a profit margin of 50%, I would say it's good business.<br><br></div>
