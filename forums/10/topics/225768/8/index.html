Silly as it sounds, most of them are afraid that voting for the government will have some detrimental effect on their iron rice bowl.</blockquote>NPNT...btw, if you continue this line of argument, you can be sure that the Opposition will always lose.

Shooting yourself in both feet? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote><br>1) why bring up the threat of withdrawing HDB upgrades?</blockquote>The Opposition parties voted AGAINST HDB upgrading when it was first proposed by the government. If you vote for them, you indicate that you prefer their policies. So why kpkb when you don't have the upgrading you were against in the first place? Sheer hypocrisy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>2) why not make all constituencies single seat wards? Are they afraid of somethings?</blockquote>Ya...afraid that the racists in Opposition parties will damage the social cohesion of the nation. Why do you think it was the minority vote in marginal constituencies that tilted the balance in favour of PAP during the last Election? With GRCs, they have a voice. If the Opposition runs the show, there may not be a single minority MP in Parliament unless minorities group together geographically.We do not want ghettos divided by race and religion in Singapore.<br><br><blockquote>3) why offer sweets before the election? why introduce stupid policies after the election? are they afraid of something?</blockquote>Tell me one party that does not offer sweets if you vote for them? It's politics, silly. The policies introduced after the election are not studpid, they are designed to help the poor. You people talk alot about helping the poor but do nothing. Unlike Opposition parties who can only rant about it, the government is doing something active to get the funds to help them.<br><br>4) are you sure that every singaporeans voted?<br>You know well the reason why many could not vote was because of the walkovers. This is the most ridiculous of all. If you cannot even find enough people to stand for election, do you expect to find people to vote for you? If Opposition party supporters are not convinced by their own policies to stand for election, how can you convince your voters?<br><br>Next you will be saying that the government should help Opposition Parties get elected into Parliament  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>[/code]</div>
