Traffic jams can be avoided if people carpool or wake up earlier than the usual peak hours to get to work.<br></blockquote>I disagree that road hoggers are safe driver. If they can road hog, that means they are not giving enough attention to the surronding, especially what is happening behind them. I believe if a driver does not intend to travel fast, he or she should just keep to the 2nd or 3rd lane, not road hog just for the sake of being safe.  (That is selfish)<br><br>In the first place, we are not even talking about speeding above the speed limit or 100 or 110km/h, we are talking about moving 10km/h faster than the usual crawling traffic during peak hour.<br><br>When we have to wake up earlier than the usual to use the road, that is being inefficient and that is not call problem solving.<br></div>

Road hogger causes unnecessary bumper to bumper traffic, which can cause chain collison.<br><br>I believe this can be done easily. Just fix a camera on the overhead bridges along the expressway and record the movement of traffic. If they find a car that is holding back a chain of traffic after a stretch of about 2 km, he should be booked.<br><br>In Singapore FINE is the only way to educate its people.<br><br></div>
