I found out from my teacher that this is not true. The government doesn't really listen to people. He's a PAP supporter, but whenever he raises suggestions, the suggestions get turn down. Never mind then. He wrote a letter to them, and no replies come back. Either that, they say they will consider his suggestions but none of them are ever implemented. And I don't think just listening alone will help them win elections. When PAP just started, it won people's hearts because it was multi-racial and leaders were more willing to listen. As the years progress, multi-racial is still the factors (I believe), but listening doesn't seem to. My teacher's experience is one example.<br><br>Pseudo intellectuals? I don't think so.
