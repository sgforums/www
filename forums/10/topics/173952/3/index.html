You can either call WP at 6298 4765 or email them at wp@wp.sg.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Introduction to WP Manifesto 2006 - You Have A Choice<br><br>As a political party, the long-term goal of the Workers' Party (WP), is to be an alternative government. While in opposition, we will play an active role as a check and balance on the ruling party. WP is Pro-Singapore and believes national interest should precede party interest.<br><br>As such we would be prepared to support government policies if they are for the common good of the nation. However we will also not hesitate to take a confrontational stand against the ruling party when there is a need to do so.<br><br>Our Manifesto and Policy Ideas<br><br>To begin with, WP is pleased to note that some of the ideas from our 1994 Manifesto have been implemented by the government. For instance, in the area of education, the government has implemented compulsory primary education and 10 years of formal education to equip citizens with basic knowledge and academic skills. WP also proposed reducing the class size to 20 and is pleased that MOE is reducing the class size to 30 today.<br><br>In the 1994 Manifesto, WP warned that Medisave and Medishield were not the answer to the problem of escalating health care costs and instead, a public health insurance scheme through pooling of risk should be implemented. WP has now noted the belated overhaul of the Medishield scheme.<br><br>In this Manifesto, WP updates our proposals on government policies, based on our beliefs in diversity, respect, human dignity, multiculturalism, tolerance and equal opportunity as the underlying philosophy of governance.<br><br>The ideas contained in this Manifesto also revolve around the theme of giving Singaporeans a meaningful stake in the country. It is consistent with the theme WP has championed over the years Â– Power to the People.<br><br>Our Philosophy<br><br>WP believes that there must be competition in political office. As the base of power comes from the people, people must be empowered to elect their representatives so that they can also participate in the decision-making process of shaping and developing our society.<br><br>WP believes that development must be for the benefit of a humane and civil society but too often the harsh reality of economic competition and political control make it otherwise. The consequential effect of a free market economy is income disparity. The better-educated and younger members of our society will have more bargaining power in the policy formulation process. Those with economic power tend to congregate with those with political power resulting in a power elite network. The consequence of such a structure could result in imbalance in policy formulation.<br><br>To build a humane society, it is important that the government places human dignity, diversity, multiculturalism, tolerance, respect and equal opportunity as the principle considerations in policy formulation and implementation.<br><br>WP Â– A Platform for People to Exercise Their Political Rights<br><br>All citizens have the right to choose their representatives and government in a parliamentary democracy. However they will only have the means to exercise their political right when there is active participation in the electoral process by different political parties.<br><br>WP provides you with an opportunity to voice your concerns through the ballot box. This will make the government more accountable as it has to be mindful of the political consequences it has to face during elections.<br><br>Politics is not just holding elections every few years; it is a continuous dynamic process. Political competition results in better service for the people; it also makes the government more sensitive to the needs from the ground and more responsive to public sentiment. However, this is only possible if you have a choice!<br><br>WP's participation in the elections enables citizens to exercise their political rights and creates an environment for good governance. WP protects the democratic process.<br><br>We urge every citizen to be involved as much as possible in issues and decisions that will affect our lives and that of our future generations.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People People....just let it bark.<br><br>Atobe you are spot on..somewhere along the line it became obvious that creating actually sense of insecurity was much more viable than actually lead by achievement and merit. If it was the case, we should have seen people take responsibility for major errors of judgement and step down from thier position taking ownership for the misjudgement or the total lack of it. But our system is such that everyone else is to blame..the people for not saving for retirement although they put away 20% deligently their entire working life.

Our Ministry of National Development manages the Urban Renewal Authority - with both rationing the land parcels put up for public auction at arbitrary prices which they fixed with a high minimum price. On top of the High Minimum Price for the piece of land, all developers will have to pay a HIGH DEVELOPMENT FEE fixed at 30% (??) of the development cost, and also a HIGH STAMP FEE on top of those other charges, besides the FINAL 5% GST that is also payable.<br><br>Before the land becomes a developed commercial property available for sale, all these high fees imposed onto the Developer will have to be paid, and SUBSEQUENTLY PASSED ON to the Singaporean Home Buyer and CONSUMER - either when purchasing the property, or paying for the goods and services that are sold by the owners occupying these High Priced Properties.<br><br>The above are two simple causes of our present misery and taken from a long list of political failures by the Ruling Party which has brought us to this present situation.<br><br>The last few Economic Review Committee formed during each economic crash - 1987, 1995, 2002 - had identified several weakness in Government Political, Economic and Social Policies. The Ruling Party a.k.a the Singapore Government boasted loudly that 'all HOLY COWS will be slaugthered - and no stones will be left unturned' to prepare us for the Twenty First Century.<br><br>We are already into the Twenty First Century, yet we are floundering like a fish out of the water, searching for a new path ahead.<br><br>We are still led by 'HOLY COWS' and with quite a few "old political stones that continue to roll in front of us trying to gather no moss" but obstructing our smooth path into the Twenty First Century - as the Ruling Party feel that some "old stone are best left in place, even if those stones are worn and broken" - with the real reason being their insecurity and non-confidence in walking a new path DESPITE the firm MONOPOLISTIC grip on the Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Life of Singapore.<br><br></div>

Our neighbours have a standard of living which is lower than us. If they are doing the same amount of work for $1000, and you expect us to get the same amount, how are we going to survive?<br><br>Electrical bills? Water bills? How about our parents?
