We look at the issues seriously, explore policy options on many issues, state our positions and give our policy statements on certain government issues."<br><br>The Workers' Party said that in the next election, it is targeting the single wards of Hougang, Nee Soon East and Joo Chiat as well as 4 GRCs - Sembawang, East Coast, Ang Mo Kio and Aljunied.<br><br>Foreign Minister George Yeo, who is leading the PAP team in Aljunied, says he welcomes the challenge.<br><br>He said: "They wanted to compete in Aljunied the last time, although there were some problems with forms. I expect them to come back. They have been canvassing the ground sporadically. I think they will come back and I am not surprised."<br><br>The Workers' Party said it is aware the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also has its eyes set on East Coast GRC.<br><br>Mr Low said he intends to talk to the DPP to prevent a three-cornered fight. - CNA/ir</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have been looking forward to this for a long time.<br><br>I hope this new manifesto will also set out in some detail the feasibility of their plans. In the 1994 Manifesto, there were commitments to reduce taxes and raise tax allowances. However, there were no figures on the impact on revenue loss and how the WP will make up for it. It is no good to say that tuition fees for universities should be kept to a minimum without explaining how they would pay the salaries required to attract top academicians.<br><br>In a word, I am looking for credibility. The other ideas in the previous manifesto are pretty decent but I cannot quite believe that they have carefully thought through the ones involving the economy.<br><br>The Conservatives lost the recent election in the UK (in which I voted) despite promising tax cuts and more funding for services. One main reason is because the figures don't add up....we cannot see how they can deliver better services with less revenue. The new Conservative leader has apparently learnt from his mistake. Having written the Conservative manifesto opposing University tuition fees, David Cameron is now in favour of tuition fees. Let this be a lession for the WP as well...</div>

And not only do you not have any talent, initialtive, entrepreneurial spirt, or creativity, worst, you have a bad attitude.<br><br><blockquote><br>This is the RESULT of how Singapore WAS worked for the last FORTY YEARS - and you dare to claim that those who criticize in this forum DO NOT UNDERSTAND "how Singapore works" ?</blockquote>Yes indeed, you people have no idea how Singapore works.

I found out from my teacher that this is not true. The government doesn't really listen to people. He's a PAP supporter, but whenever he raises suggestions, the suggestions get turn down. Never mind then. He wrote a letter to them, and no replies come back. Either that, they say they will consider his suggestions but none of them are ever implemented. And I don't think just listening alone will help them win elections. When PAP just started, it won people's hearts because it was multi-racial and leaders were more willing to listen. As the years progress, multi-racial is still the factors (I believe), but listening doesn't seem to. My teacher's experience is one example.<br><br>Pseudo intellectuals? I don't think so.

Thats why I get to run circles around you during debates on issues.</div></blockquote>Speaking from a student's point of view, I don't really understand how Singapore works. What seems to be good isn't really good when it is implemented. Take the increase in GST for example. Financial experts believe it will help Singapore's economy, but it is worsening Singaporeans' financial situations. In the short term, I have definitely seen the results. But in the long term, I don't quite see anything. Newspapers have been reporting of Singaporeans' financial woes and make worse by outsourcing and retrenchment due to relocation to cheaper places like China and India.<br><br>While it's true that some of them don't spend their money wisely, how about those who already have financial problems even when money is spent wisely?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When the government has refused to listen to the people's feedbacks such as posted in the "20 major problems" thread, it will continue to experience general unhappiness of the people such as the following:-<br><br>(1) collecting the highest fees e.g. profiteering in sale of HDB flats (double charge on land already paid for by the taxpayers) and oppressive triple taxation on vehicles (excise, COE and ERP) and medicare, utility and transport costs.<br><br>(2) investing people's monies in shares and businesses overseas without any specific criteria to use reserve for job creations the citizens or generating profits to lower people' high costs of living etc,<br><br>The underlying cause of unhappiness should be addressed not the symptoms.<br><br>Because the government keeps practising denial of problems and only seems to be only nterested in self-righteousness and egotism, the 20 major problems as posted have today remained unsolved.<br><br>Particularly serious is its narrow-minded method of government - without creativity or entrepreneurhsip but only resorted to sucking monies from the people thereby stifling the growth and vibrancy of the economy.<br><br>Fundamental problems of such nature is a matter of poor and incorrect attitude. As long as it is not willing to listen to people and change these past erroneous policies and attitude and as long as it continue to engage in self-justifications and grossing over problems or blaming them on the people for being too demanding or without ideas of how government works or such like excuses, there will be white elephants in Buangkok and all kinds of silent protests and general unhappiness regarded as "ungratefulness"<br><br>People will not be happy until undamental problems and issues are objectively and openly and accountably settled. This kind of problem can only be solved by fundamental solutions and elimination of roots of the problems - bad attitude.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear oxford mushroom,<br><br>You remind me about the reporter from New Paper who wrote quite sarcastically on this perspective but he did not raise his doubts or questions during the press conference.<br><br>First of all, we are not in the position to have all the financial data of the govt to do a simulation on the impact on the proposal we have made. However, I could assure you that the Manifesto when looks in totality, is sustainable.<br><br>There are "subtle" suggestions on cutting spending in Defence and be prudent on this particularly, not to initiate arm race in this region. Defence spending alone in Singapore's budget takes up about 20% or more. The second biggest spending I think is education.<br><br>For Healthcare portion, the newspaper only highlighted "subsidies" but did not mention or emphasize about the medical insurance or hospital insurance that we proposed to help finance the healthcare cost. On top of that, we actually suggested that private hospitals should be included in the scheme as well, so that citizens could use their Medisave on private healthcare providers.<br><br>As for the transport cost section, New Paper reporter did not mention the most important part of our proposal: Public Transport provider should not be profit orientated but they should cover their cost and depreciation cost. Thus we are not asking the govt to subsidize the whole operation of the public transport system but merely on the initial set up cost of infrastructure and equipment. In fact we have suggested that transport companies should be allowed to utilize the land they own to generate rental income to cross subsidize operation costs.<br><br>I guess you will need to read the whole Manifesto to get the whole idea. We are responsible and prudent enough to put up ideas that are not about all spending and tax cuts. GST, whether you like it or not, is a regressive taxation on the population; basically it means that it put a heavier burden on the lower income group. To take away GST from daily necessity would dampen such tendency. We are prudent enough not to suggest the total abolishment of the GST but takes balance approach in this issue.<br><br>Thus I think you will have to get a copy of our Manifesto, read it in totality before you can come to the conclusion whether we are irresponsible in our approach.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">I have been looking forward to this for a long time.<br><br>I hope this new manifesto will also set out in some detail the feasibility of their plans. In the 1994 Manifesto, there were commitments to reduce taxes and raise tax allowances. However, there were no figures on the impact on revenue loss and how the WP will make up for it. It is no good to say that tuition fees for universities should be kept to a minimum without explaining how they would pay the salaries required to attract top academicians.<br><br>In a word, I am looking for credibility. The other ideas in the previous manifesto are pretty decent but I cannot quite believe that they have carefully thought through the ones involving the economy.<br><br>The Conservatives lost the recent election in the UK (in which I voted) despite promising tax cuts and more funding for services. One main reason is because the figures don't add up....we cannot see how they can deliver better services with less revenue. The new Conservative leader has apparently learnt from his mistake. Having written the Conservative manifesto opposing University tuition fees, David Cameron is now in favour of tuition fees. Let this be a lession for the WP as well...</div></blockquote></div>
