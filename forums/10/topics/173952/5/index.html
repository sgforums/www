HDB ETHNIC QUOTA SCHEME</strong><br><br>For over THIRTY YEARS, since the HDB began building houses for Singaporeans, it was only during the late 1970s - as a result of the manner in which concentrations of certain racial groups responded to certain electioneering candidates from a certain racial group - that the Government responded by diluting concentrations of any one racial groups that vote along ethnic lines.<br><br>This HDB policy was successful in dismantling the minority Malay Community, but it did not resolve ethnic politics practised by the larger and majority Chinese Community.<br><br>This policy had actually acted against the MINORITY ETHNIC GROUPS - in that the choice of buyers in the resale market is restricted only to members from the minority group.<br><br><strong>3. GROUP REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUENCIES</strong><br><br>With the successful implementation of the ETHNIC QUOTA SYSTEM in controlling any one concentration of any minority group that can vote along ethnic lines, the GRC was implemented to ensure that the Minority Race will be proportionally represented in Parliament, and in Government when possible.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Ruling Party exploited the success of the GRC in ensuring a 'walk-over' for new and untested candidates from the incumbent Ruling Party, and began to expand the GRC - from its original four constituencies in one group - into six constituencies into one Group.<br><br>However, with all the supposedly good intention of having racial harmony and social integration, has the HDB ETHNIC QUOTA SYSTEM and the GRC actually achieve its goal of social integration, or has the gap between the different ethnic groups widen ?<br><br>With HDB neighbors seldom going beyond the courtesy greetings when meeting each other in the common areas, and with PRIVACY being valued more accutely amongst HDB residence, has there been any social integration amongst the races ?<br><br>Has the minority Member of Parliament in any GRC been any more effective in representing the views from their constituents, when it is Party Politics first over the Singapore Electorates and the Constituents.<br><br><strong>4. THE ELECTED PRESIDENCY</strong><br><br>This post was first created, it had its role clearly marked out as the KEEPER of the SECOND KEY that unlocks the National Reserves.<br><br>When this <strong>'Second Key' </strong>concept was tested by the late Ong Teng Cheong it caused so much acrimony from within the Ruling Elite that it resulted in a RETHINK to the original role planned for it.<br><br>This was made necessary, as for the Elected President to perform its role conscientiously, it required the complete revelation in the accounting of the National Reserves - as managed by the Ministry of Finance, Government Investment Corporation, Temasek Holdings, and a string of Government Related Agencies, Statutory Boards, and Government Linked Companies operating with funds from the Singapore Government.<br><br>This resulted in inconvenience to the Ruling Elite, and it required a SECOND THOUGHT to the limited powers already given to the Elected Presidency - and further clipped his wings in having any authority to effectively perform his role as the <strong>Guardian of the National Reserve</strong>.<br><br>The Elected President will hold the KEY, but will not be in any position to seek any more information than what has been made known for him to look after.<br><br>The Elected President is no more then acting according to the will of the Ruling Elite.<br><br>What does this mean for the future of Singapore ?<br><br>Can the same Elected President be any more effective in being a GUARDIAN of the National Reserves - if ever a situation should arise that ANOTHER POLITICAL PARTY happen to replace the present RULING POLITICAL PARTY ?<br><br>The Ruling Party has not been infallible in their vision, and they have set off a few time bombs during their monopolistic arrogant grip on political power in Singapore.<br><br>The biggest time bombs are from their Family Planning Policy and the fact that they have removed competitive spirit of Singaporeans by the sheer dominance of the Ruling Party and its Government Linked Companies in wiping private enterprise and competition in Singapore.<br><br></div>
