            <div class='col-md body'>The comments in today's TODAY regarding the manifesto was extremely 'enlightening'.<br><br>It seems that while the caption clearly printed :<span style="color: red;"><strong>THE WORKER'S PARTY ON THOSE 4 'TIME BOMBS'</strong></span>, the article itself was marginalised into a tit-for-tat spat with the ruling party. In fact, the article seemed to focus instead on PM Lee's added weight to the initial comments made by Khaw Boon Wan and Ng Eng Hen, with some background support by 'parrot' MP Charles Chong, thereby rendering the article to little more than: <span style="color: indigo;"><strong>FURTHER REBUTTALS BY THE RULING PARTY.</strong></span><br><br>It is however, interesting to note that Charles Chong's comments on the RC and CCC were based on the impression that the WP intended to completely dismantle these committees, rather than consider the possibility of restructuring and re-organising them. It also seems his comments belly the 'nanny mentality' of our govt , thinking that relinquishing or reducing the influence of these committees will lead to widespread anarchy and 'survival of the fittest'.<br><br>Has the dearth of creativity caused a 1-tracked dependent mind instead of the supposedly cream of the crop elite who deals in 3-dimensional thinking?<br><br>In fact, the paranoia is further illustrated by additional interviews with various committee members from Bedok CCC Patrick Tay, and ending off with PM Lee's challenge that the WP either revise their manifesto or standby it, all intended to poke holes and completely discredit the WP even before they have a chance to defend themselves.<br><br>Deja vu anyone?<br><br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/pdf_main.asp?pubdate=20060123" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/pdf_main.asp?pubdate=20060123</a></div>

HDB ETHNIC QUOTA SCHEME</strong><br><br>For over THIRTY YEARS, since the HDB began building houses for Singaporeans, it was only during the late 1970s - as a result of the manner in which concentrations of certain racial groups responded to certain electioneering candidates from a certain racial group - that the Government responded by diluting concentrations of any one racial groups that vote along ethnic lines.<br><br>This HDB policy was successful in dismantling the minority Malay Community, but it did not resolve ethnic politics practised by the larger and majority Chinese Community.<br><br>This policy had actually acted against the MINORITY ETHNIC GROUPS - in that the choice of buyers in the resale market is restricted only to members from the minority group.<br><br><strong>3. GROUP REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUENCIES</strong><br><br>With the successful implementation of the ETHNIC QUOTA SYSTEM in controlling any one concentration of any minority group that can vote along ethnic lines, the GRC was implemented to ensure that the Minority Race will be proportionally represented in Parliament, and in Government when possible.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Ruling Party exploited the success of the GRC in ensuring a 'walk-over' for new and untested candidates from the incumbent Ruling Party, and began to expand the GRC - from its original four constituencies in one group - into six constituencies into one Group.<br><br>However, with all the supposedly good intention of having racial harmony and social integration, has the HDB ETHNIC QUOTA SYSTEM and the GRC actually achieve its goal of social integration, or has the gap between the different ethnic groups widen ?<br><br>With HDB neighbors seldom going beyond the courtesy greetings when meeting each other in the common areas, and with PRIVACY being valued more accutely amongst HDB residence, has there been any social integration amongst the races ?<br><br>Has the minority Member of Parliament in any GRC been any more effective in representing the views from their constituents, when it is Party Politics first over the Singapore Electorates and the Constituents.<br><br><strong>4.
