              <p><strong>The Times Of India, 6 Jun 2009</strong><br> <br> NEW DELHI: With former Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) chairman Sudipto
              Ghosh being arrested by CBI recently in a major defence scandal, the
              defence ministry has blacklisted seven companies, including major ones
              from Israel, <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Singapore</strong></span> and Poland, named in the case. <br> <br> Keen to curb the widespread murky wheeling and dealing in arms deals,
              defence minister A K Antony has directed that all acquisition cases and
              projects in the pipeline with the seven companies "be put on hold till
              further orders".<br> <br> While the foreign firms are Israeli Military Industries (IMI),<span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Singapore Technology</strong></span>,
              Media Architects (Singapore) and BVT Poland, the Indian ones are HYT
              Engineering, R K Machine Tools and T S Kishan and Company Pvt Ltd.</p>
              <p>All the seven firms were named in the CBI FIR registered on May 17
              against Ghosh, M S Sawhney, a Vasant Vihar-based defence dealer, Ramesh
              Nambiar, an additional general manager with Air India, and three
              middlemen, Ashish Bose, Pradeep Rana and Kanhai Lal Das.<br> <br> IMI, incidentally, had inked a contract with OFB, worth around Rs 1,200
              crore, to set up an ordnance complex of five plants at Nalanda in
              Bihar, in the run-up to the general elections in March.<br> <br> The plants were to manufacture 155mm Bi-Modular Charge Systems (BMCS)
              and other propellant charges for heavy calibre artillery ammunition for
              Army's Bofors howitzers and other guns.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Singapore Technology, one of the
              biggest aerospace and land systems company in Asia, in turn, was a
              strong contender in tenders for 155mm artillery guns for Army.</strong></span><br> <br> While Media Architects is said to be supplying video-editing software
              to Indian armed forces, BVT Poland is said to be engaged in marine
              engineering and naval architecture.<br> <br> As for the Indian companies, T S Kishan and Company apparently supplies
              spares and accessories for Army's T-72 and T-90S main-battle tanks,
              while Pune-based HYT Engineering provides some components of missiles
              produced within the country. Ludhiana-based R K Machine Tools, in turn,
              supplies spares for vehicles and machinery produced by Defence PSU
              Bharat Earth Movers Ltd.<br> <br> "While CBI is yet to file the chargesheet, there is concrete evidence
              about money transfers to personal accounts of the persons named in the
              FIR. The defence ministry has sought a detailed list of equipment and
              material that these blacklisted companies provided to the armed forces.
              It is still awaited," said an official.<br> <br> The blacklisting of the seven companies comes four years after the
              South African arms firm, Denel, was banned for allegedly paying Rs 20
              crore as kickbacks in five contracts for supply of 700 anti-material
              rifles and ammunition as well as transfer of technology to OFB.<br> <br> But, interestingly enough, Israeli Aerospace Industries and Rafael,
              named in the kickbacks case in the original Rs 1,160-crore Barak-I
              anti-missile defence system deal inked in 2000, have not been
              blacklisted on the ground that it would be "counter-productive" due to
              the several crucial defence projects underway with them.<br> <br> The Nalanda project, on its part, has had a convoluted past. The
              project was first kicked off during George Fernandes' tenure as defence
              minister in the NDA regime, with the proposed factory complex at Rajgir
              in Nalanda located in his earlier Lok Sabha constituency.<br> <br> Later, the NDA regime identified Denel for the Nalanda project. But
              after Denel's blacklisting, the construction of the Nalanda complex, on
              which an initial Rs 306 crore was spent, had come to a grinding halt.<br> <br> The UPA government, after coming to office, later constituted an
              "expert committee" to review the entire project. Subsequently, a global
              tender was floated after the green signal from the "expert committee"
              and the Cabinet Committee on Security had approved IMI's participation
              in January this year.<br> <br> ---------------------------------<br> <span style="color: navy;"><strong>Latest updates at <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">Singapore News Alternative</a></strong>:<br> <br> 1.
