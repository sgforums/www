            <div class='col-md body'>Well, although there are more Christians among the MPs, or for that matter, even if the majority of the MPs come from a religious group, and their views may be influenced by  their religious background, I think, if the majority of Singapore's multi religious society view the policies as morally acceptable, I dont think it matter that much.<br><br>But then again, this was never a big problem. The problem, as seen from the current affairs and discussions in SC, is whether the people's views are heard at all or not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Besides, lets not forget, despite the protests even from the religous groups and some ministers, projects such as the IR one went ahead.

Any MPs who are truly religious whether as Christians, Buddhists or Muslims will be keepers of people's collective social and moral conscience.<br><br>If they will practise such values and beliefs, equity, justice and caring for citizens' welfare and wellbeing as taught in their religions, they will help to bring about greater social cohesion and vibrancy and stability of society.<br><br>Now because of many years of pushing our over-pragmatic policies, many such values are no longer being practised. We will not be too surprised today if we still hear MPs or ministers dismissing such values as idealism or worse permissiveness. It is about time to change our core values to centre more on justice and equity, care and share and less on confrontation and legalistic control which will only one day split the people into souless and selfish individuals.<br><br>A society which upholds such values as practised will be less self-centred and individualistic and more likely to uphold equity and justice to look after the citizens.</div>
