I got the impression the confiscator wanted to just brush it off fromt he posts. Not sure if he went to the principal. but then again i wonder if going to the principal will be sufficient to correct such a situation. I don't think its a rare situation that confiscated items get misplaced or whatever and perhaps so spotlight on it would help. main issue is that its not about revenge.<br><br>about the teacher having to pay, well i think its fair. thats if theres no like central depository to put confiscated items. afterall, even if you are doing your job when you take that item(and its not cheap) you should take care of it. well thats unless reasonable action has been taken to safeguard like putting in locked drawer.</div>
