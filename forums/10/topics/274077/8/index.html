You cannot use "Modern scientific person" becoz there is no such person in that time. It's like you asking people from the year 3030 to come back to 2007 now to ask you to provide scientific standards OF THEIR TIME to convince them. Your argument is at best, flawed<br><br>The fact remains that Galileo provided a theory, and he just wasn't able to convince the MASS OF THAT TIME of his theory. And thus, it remained then as just a theory, nothing else. On hindsight, you now say he provides convincing proof <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It's just like you in this current era. You belong to the Mass population of this time, and you wouldn't believe anyone who doesn't provide sufficient scientific proof to convince you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Ghost hunters use EM radiation and hot and cold spots to determine the existence of supernatural presence, but you wouldn't believe that coz they aren't convincing enough to you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
