In a more restricted sense, science refers to a system of acquiring knowledge based on the scientific method, as well as to the organized body of knowledge gained through such research"<br><br>As such, this definition of Science means that its more a human practice of acquiring knowledge, and is more subject to the human discovery.<br><br>So perhaps you might want to explain what you mean by "Science has always being present before the advent of Man".
