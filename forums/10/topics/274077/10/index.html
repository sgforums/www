            <div class='col-md body'>if everyone thinks like our very special Andrew Yap, ie everything beyond scientific proof is superstition, then everyone will not explore beyond into the unknown and adopt the attitude of waiting until someone else do the dirty work of proof for him.<br><br>that someone else wont be Andrew, i am sure.  Because he is so adamant that everything beyond scientific proof is superstition and hence no motivations to work on the proof.<br><br>one major distinction between an animal and human being is that human being is capable of imagination, animals are incapable of imaginations.  I think Andrew's attitude is incapable of imaginations because he will not imagine anything beyond concrete scientific proof and hence he will have no imaginations.

What we dont know, we should not discard as superstition.<br><br>Ships, airplanes physically disappeared mysteriously in the bermuda triangle.  So should we discard them as superstition because our scientists are unable to explain it?  Or should we explore and keep trying to understand these weird phenomena ?<br><br>Are you one of those who think our science is highly developed already so that it can explain most things and therefore those things which it cannot explain are bullsh.it superstition?<br><br></div>

Why is it that no two human beings are 100% perfectly identical?  Science cannot fully explain this weird phenomena, so you discard it as superstition.
