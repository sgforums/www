            <div class='col-md body'>Peace, peace, peace...please....<br><br>This thread would have been a very good intellectual exercise if not for all the name-callings and flaming. Flame would only result in counter-flame, and at the end of the day is unconstructive.<br><br>I may disagree with the stance of the counter-rationalist, but I nevertheless feel he/she has the right to his/her opinion in an open debate.<br><strong>I may attack the belief, but I will not attack the believer. </strong><br><br>Let's look at it this way.....<br>There are many schools of thought in the world and certainly none of them can claim absolute perfection and 100% certainty. No science, religion, social science, art, spiritual movement, etc can claim perfection.<br><br>I have friends who are theists (from dif religions), deists, atheists and agnostics. We may debate passionately, but at the end of the day we should not let our ideologies get in the way of friendship.<br><br>I am a strong supporter of rationality and science, but I have no personal hatred against people of faith or even superstition (unless you are a fundamentalist who believes in perpetrating violence against those who don't follow your ideology).<br><br>If I criticise your beliefs, I do so only because I am exercising my intellectual rights to do so and wish to share with you that in this world there is an alternative to supernaturalism.<br><br>Of course I'm not so naive as to believe I can convince the other party...because I know that people cherish nothing more deeply than their personal beliefs (especially if they were brought up in an environment that encourage such beliefs).<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Anyway, just to clarify one point:<br><br>I see religion as distinct from supernaturalism<br><br>A person can be a theist [believer in god(s)] and a believer in supernaturalism, but alternatively.....<br><br>A person may believe in god(s) but yet not believe in supernatural happenings that violate natural laws. An example is deism (which accepts god(s) but rejects supernatural events including even scriptural accounts):  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism<br><br>And....<br>Normally, an atheist does not believe in god(s) and also not in supernaturalism, but alternatively...<br><br>An atheist who rejects the idea of god(s) can nevertheless believe in some aspects of the supernatural (eg. psychic events, ghosts, spirit possession, etc)....<br><br>Finally here is an interesting (and I believe true) thought:<br><br><strong>Â“I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.Â” (by Stephen F Roberts)</strong><br><br><strong>Which basically means that everyone is an atheist....<br>i.e. One may be a believer in the monotheistic God, but by rejecting the other gods in other religions (such as Zeus, Ra, Thor, Odin, etc, etc), you too are an atheist in the eyes of the other party! </strong><br></div>

I think these people bring shame to Science.<br><br>Coming back to your points, they are valid, and as I said, I respect your points. Similarly, I do not attack you the person.<br><br>I also say again that I am a Science person as well, just that once I studied astronomy, I see the limitations of Science which is only able to explain a negligible part of the universe.<br><br>I wish to bring up the points below:<br>1) Supernatural does not just relate to ghosts, afterlife, and all things that you think belong to 7th Month. I think most of you think that way.<br>Supernatural is also a classification for explanations which invoke explanative contructs that in principle are beyond human conception, understanding or verification<br>So perhaps in a loose way, you can say dark matter and dark energy (which are proven to exist by Science) are supernatural in a way, because its beyond our understanding what their composition and characteristics are.<br><br>2) Education of youths<br>I agree only to a certain degree what you mentioned.<br>Science may give a sound grounding to youths, but it is also Science that will limit their scope, their ability to go beyond that, which can be seen, hear or touched. The current achievements of Science are mostly materialistic and physical.<br>Yet, since there is no better way to start than by Science, and since I cannot see any other alternative (as you mentioned, exposure to supernaturalism may mislead them), then I will have to agree with you.<br><br>By the way, we were taught in secondary school that Newton's Laws of Gravity is totally correct. It was the truth and nothing but the truth. We were told to accept what was taught to us from Primary to JC.<br><br>It was only in University, that we are allowed to fully question.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some more ideas about Supernatural which does not just talk about things that go bum in the night<br><br>Supernatural is a "another part of a larger nature"<br><br>This is a view largely held by monists and process theorists. According to this view, the "supernatural" is just a term for parts of nature that modern science and philosophy do not yet properly understand, similar to how sound and lightning used to be mysterious forces to science. Materialist monists believe that the "supernatural" are just things in the physical universe not yet understood by modern science while idealist monists reject the concept of "supernatural" on the grounds that they believe "nature" is the non-material. Neutral monists maintain that "nature" and "supernature" are artificial categories as they believe that the material and non-material are both either equally real and simultaneously existent, or illusions that stem from the human mind's interpretation of reality.</div>
