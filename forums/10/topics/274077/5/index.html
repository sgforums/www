As Chris Mooney writes:<br><br>That doesnÂ’t mean that scientific consensus is right in every instance. There are famous examples, in fact, of when it was proved wrong: Galileo comes to mind, as does a lowly patent clerk named Einstein. In the vast majority of modern cases, however, <strong>scientific consensus can be expected to hold up under scrutiny precisely because it was reached through a lengthy and rigorous process of professional skepticism and criticism.*</strong><br><br>Contrarians are particularly active in the areas of climate change and other environmental issues, but they have been active in many other areas as well, such as tobacco and health issues. Contrarians demand endless analysis of issues to prevent any action from being taken rather than to ensure that the most reasonable conclusion be arrived at. Polluters and anyone else opposed to government regulations are well served by the contrarian's paralysis by analysis. <strong>Contrarians often refer to their endless demands for more study and their claims that doubts still remainÂ—no matter what the consensusÂ—as "sound science," a bit of doublespeak that is the scientific equivalent of the filibuster.</strong><br><br><strong>Rather than demanding we dig deeper in order to clarify issues, the contrarian simply wants to throw dust in people's eyes so they can't see what's really going on. The function of contrarians is to arouse fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) and promote the false notion that "sound science" is science where you can't find a contrary view. </strong>The contrarian philosophy is Orwellian doublespeak at its best: Some of the best science available is labeled "junk science" by contrarians simply because there are contrary views that may be held by a very small minority.<br><br>http://www.skepdic.com/contrarian.html<br><br></div>

You automatically assume that just because science (and indeed all bodies of knowledge) is not 100% correct (what do you mean by "correct"? Do you define it as "verifiable"?) due to it being driven by "imperfect" Man, it is inherently untrustworthy.<br><br>No field of knowledge in this physical plane of existence is 100% verifiable. However, this doesn't mean we get "paralysed by analysis" and begin to doubt the soundness of existence. In the case of science, yes indeed it is not 100% "perfect" but it is the best methodology available to Man to study the natural world. It may not be 100% "foolproof" but it certainly is the most trustworthy of all the thinking tools available to Man. The greatest strength of science is its lack of dogmatism and its ability to correct its body of knowledge upon discovery of errors.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Some important features of the nature of the science that shows its strength and trustworthiness:</strong></span><br><br><strong>Scientists think critically about claims. Empirical evidence is their ultimate standard.<br><br>Scientists use a variety of methods: hypothesis, for instance, as well as analogy and induction. Some collect observations; others creatively recognize patterns in data. Imagination, logical reasoning, chance, and interdisciplinary thinking can all be important.<br><br>Observation is sometimes enhanced by quantitative measurement, by comparisonÂ—especially with controls that isolate the effect of individual variables or help distinguish correlation from causationÂ—and by graphical representation and statistical analysis summarizing patterns in the data and the chances for error.<br><br>Data does not speak for itself. Rather, scientists interpret findings, and sometimes those interpretations are biased by theoretical or cultural perspectives.<br><br>Scientific claims vary in their level of certainty. No method guarantees answers or absolute certainty, yet multiple lines of evidence help reinforce many claims. Even important problems may remain unresolved. In some cases, scientists may justifiably disagree.<br><br>Science is a human enterprise. Some scientists are motivated by curiosity or a passion to solve problems, others by profit or ambition. Some collaborate; others compete.<br><br>Knowledge develops historically. Sometimes concepts change dramatically.<br>Science resolves only problems of fact, not values. Nonetheless, the practice of science and its results have moral dimensions.<br><br>Science generally aims to map and explain the world. Technology differs in that it aims to adapt that understanding of the world. </strong><br><br>With ref to: <a href="http://www.actionbioscience.org/education/allchin2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.actionbioscience.org/education/allchin2.html</a></div>

Even each of the other "less powerful" 5 senses (taste, smell, touch, sight, hearing) have names and properties of their own.....so how about this wondrous "6th sense" that you seem to exalt so highly?<br><br></div></blockquote>Again, someone fails to see my point.<br><br>You posted so many replies about me, but I will just summarize what I say, instead of replying to your misconception of me<br><br>1) I in no way openly declare and claim that Science is 100% untrustworthy (which is what you imply of me). I merely am using Discrete Mathematics, which is one of the areas of Science, to prove that Science cannot be 100% believable. This, no matter how much you post, you cannot deny<br><br>2) Science is human-driven. Therefore, there is always room for error, and thus you cannot say that its 100% trustworthy.<br><br>3) Please read up on the 6th sense. Being a person who goes about quoting so many articles, I am very sure you can find out some info on the 6th sense.<br><br>4) Its not my business at the end whether you want to think Science is the holy grail or not. I merely just wish to remind everyone of the possibility of that 1% or 0.1% or 10% or how many % possibility that Science can be wrong. And this possibility can NEVER be 0%, given points (1) and (2)<br><br>And to your point above on the Korean scientist, its NOT a matter of WHO catches him, or WHEN he is caught. Its a matter of WHAT IF he is not caught for a period of time? Let us assume that what if he is not caught for a period of time (one month, one year, one decade, etc), that his proofs are so solid that other scientists are not able to locate the lie?<br>Then during this period (one month, one year, one decade), his study would be acknowledged by the scientific community that its correct and valid, and this will result in what I mention, a 'lie' or 'incorrect science', that will be considered as correct and as a fact.<br>Do not forget that before he was caught, he had won numerous awards, and being honoured by many in the scientific community.<br><br>And yes you are correct, I like to question, because I like to find out more. I do not think there's anything wrong with keeping an open mind. You cannot deny that Science was wrong in many counts during the course of history. Its part and parcel of what Fingernolin mentioned, but because of that, its also not 100% believable then.</div>
