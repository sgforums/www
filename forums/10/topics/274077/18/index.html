Like I said, I know this kid, coz the aunt is a good friend of mine. So only the people close enough to them will know of this situation. They wouldn't want to look 'superstitious' by letting others know they had to approach a medium at the end.<br><br>Coming back to your question, I will see a doctor. As I mentioned, there's nothing wrong with Science. But if all else fails, of course we could try other solutions. Faith leads to substance. Sometimes with faith, your mind becomes more powerful and can overcome the illness in the body. "Mind over body" the statement has some credibility to it. People who are depressed and negative tend to be more prone to illnesses. I think this is proven by Science.<br><br>Let me go back to my secondary school days. There was a time when I developed very strange rashes, huge big patches that spread thru the whole body, and only appears at night. By day, I had zero problems, but once night comes, the irritation was so unbearable.<br><br>Went to several doctors, used numerous types of cream, medication, etc. There was nothing that could stop the rashes from coming at night. The doctors I went to had no idea what caused it after repeated visits. It was my grandmother that did a ritual at a cross-road junction, that killed the problem totally immediately after that ritual<br><br>Till today, I don't know what happened, maybe you can say its superstition and that we should believe only in Science. But if you are suffering every night and for months there is no solution from Science, you might change your mind.</div>
