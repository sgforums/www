I merely ask you, define what is TRUTH. Again, another useless jumping to conclusions in a feeble attempt to quote something.<br><br>And yes you ARE immoral and unethical, based on the fact that you are rude, obnoxious and mean.<br><br><strong>[quote]<br>Your positions are untenable but apparently you have no idea why because you have no idea of the Law of Non-contradiction.<br></strong>If you can't even get your understanding right, I would suggest you stop quoting articles to embarrass yourself. Your initial assumption was already screwed up, of course the results of your observations are all wrong.<br><br>Again, I stick to my belief that it is a fortune to mankind you are not in research. People like you jump to conclusions too easily (thereby you were insulting yourself in your previous postings, coz you were saying people should get the observations, facts, info right before concluding), therefore, any research results from you are more prone to error than anything else.<br></div>
