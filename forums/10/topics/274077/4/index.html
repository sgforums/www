Discoveries being announced to the world is done only after some intense trial and error has been performed (and subject to the commercial and pragmatic limitations of society), but that doesn't mean that it is 100% error-free. We all know there are many announced discoveries that were proven to be incorrect sometime later.<br><br>For (2), things that Science cannot explain, doesn't mean it cannot be done, or it doesn't exist. For example, ghosts. Who dare say with 100% certainty that ghosts do not exist because science cannot prove it? Also, many of the great researchers of the past had to struggle with their repeated failures, before finally being able to prove or perform something.<br>So if they had given up inventing the light bulb, for instance, would the believers of Today's Science then say that its not possible to create the light bulb?<br><br>Science is THE way to explain MANY things, but its important for one to keep an open mind in order to understand things beyond Science's explanation.</div>

Calculating the gravitational attraction between two masses is ok enough, but when you are talking about precision, relativity has to be used.<br><br>It's fine enough to teach students this, but when you get to more precise calculations, you have to use relativity.<br><br>In any case, you certainly cannot teach relativity to kids.
