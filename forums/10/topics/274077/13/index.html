There is no one single philosophy that is correct or wrong<br>2) Ethics is a philosophy. Therefore Ethics is subjective.<br>3) Science, with its requirement for proof or evidence, is objective<br>4) Andrew's statement, "If there is no proof or evidence, its delusional", means in Mathematics that ANYTHING that has no proof or evidence is delusional.<br>5) Since Ethics is subjective, it cannot be proven by any scientific method, therefore based on point (4), ethics is delusional.<br><br>No wonder you cannot understand something called Respect of Fellow Humans (which is an ethic), since Ethics to you is delusional. With your rude and obnoxious behavior, no matter how good you are with your head at certain fields, you will never be able to succeed in whatever you do, coz you do not respect others.<br><br>Feel free to argue some more.
