So this spread should narrow back in.  Given a bullish outlook for equities, i would view a long nikkei 225 as a relatively good short term strategy.<br><br>for next few years, it depends on how the equity markets play out.<br><br>I think buy and hold strategy works best when one starts buying during recession times (sounds like talking c.ock) , ha ha!!<br></div>
