            <div class='col-md body'>I'd like to use an example taken from today's news as a "thought-demonstration":<br><br>The following news article dated 18 Sep 07 can be found at http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20838944/?GT1=10357<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Villagers fall ill after fireball hits Peru<br><br>A fireball fell from the sky and slammed into southern Peru over the weekend, creating a huge crater that emitted a sickeningly smelly gas, local authorities said. More than 600 villagers fell ill, the Peruvian radio network RPP reported Tuesday. Video reports from the scene, near the remote Andean village of Carancas along Peru's border with Bolivia, showed what appeared to be a 100-foot-wide (30-meter-wide), 20-foot-deep (6-meter-deep) impact crater with a bubbling pool of water at the bottom. Authorities said that the crater was made Saturday by a falling meteorite. Agence France Presse quoted a local official, Marco Limache, as saying that "boiling water started coming out of the crater, and particles of rock and cinders were found nearby."<br><br>Limache told RPP that the gases emanating from the crater caused nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and stomach pain Â— so much so that authorities were considering calling a state of emergency. Villagers decided not to drink the water in the area because they regarded it as contaminated in the wake of the impact, RPP reported. Experts from Peru's Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Institute, or Ingemmet, were reportedly on their way to the village in the country's Desaguadero region to evaluate the health risk.<br></span><br><br>A scientific process would involve researchers going to the site of the crash to take physical samples of the rock, water, ground, etc. There will be lab examination of the samples and evaluation of the health threat posed to the villagers due to toxic fumes emanating (as a result of natural physical and chemical processes) from the crash site. Apart from chemical and human health studies, biologists can determine threats to wildlife in the area, astrophysicists can research upon the physical properties and pre-crash dynamics of the meteorite. The scientists (fr various fields of specialisations) will adopt a methodological process to determine the cause and effect of this phenomenon.<br><br>However.....<br><br>In contrast to the above, a non-scientific or pseudo-scientific process will not involve methodological studies as I've outlined.<br><br>Most likely a person with little/no knowledge of scientific methodology (e.g. a victim of cultist superstitions) will jump to conclusions and make wild proclamations/speculations. Quacks may see this incident to be the sign of the apocalypse and that this meteorite is a herald of Wormwood. Or the quack will give other wilder speculations like the gods are wrathful or that the heavens are trying to "teach Mankind" a lesson for their arrogance. Or 'pseudoscience' quacks will exclaim that this "space rock" contain alien lifeform that is a precursor of an invasion.....without bothering to first study the "rock" and verify their wild hypothesis. Such false "prophets" spread wild rumours that can very well forment unrest among susceptible villagers....or worse, they can con people into subscribing to irrational beliefs.<br><br>In fact this is happening as can be seen in the following quack sites:<br><a href="http://www.theapocalypsetimes.com/bloggin/&lt;br%20/&gt;http://www.rr-bb.com/showthread.php?s=a6c70a2533f1cb95d42ee2fcbf0e1de8&amp;t=14461&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.theapocalypsetimes.com/bloggin/<br>http://www.rr-bb.com/showthread.php?s=a6c70a2533f1cb95d42ee2fcbf0e1de8&amp;t=14461&amp;page=2</a><br>(most likely more such unsubstantiated "paranormal postings" will appear on the Net in the days to come)<br><br>Science, on the other hand, takes a well-reasoned approach. Science does not jump to wild speculations or invoke superstitious beliefs to "fill the gaps" in explaining the natural world. Of course, at times technical errors may be made, but at the end of the day, science is self-correcting and when more/better data comes in, improved hypothesis can be formulated.<br>Science is certainly more trustworthy than paranormal beliefs.</div>
