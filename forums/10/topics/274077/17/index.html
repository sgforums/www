(crit) Natural selection serves as a means of conservation, not one of creation. It explains survival of a species, not arrival of a species. Here's an illustration: You work in a car factory. Your job is quality control - make sure the cars work like they are supposed to. You kick the tires and slam the doors, drive the cars around, etc. You identify and remove defects (an arbitrary selection with the same final result as natural selection). How long would it take for this selection process to turn one of those cars into an airplane naturally over time? It won't happen.</blockquote>This is the shiit.</div>

If u show the website from religious sources, then u just prove tat intelligent design is not scientific and only religious. And being religious, they can believe in things u will not commonly see in everyday life so much so tat non believers will classified it as fantasy.<br><br><blockquote>And your point of needing to say who this intelligent designer is, what if I walk through the woods, and come across an ancient pyramid like structure, I would infer that it is built by an intelligent civilization, but I don't know who they are.

We might not know which "intelligent civilization" but we do know that because the Ancient Egyptians built pyramids it is likely that "an intelligent civilization" built the one that we stumbled across in the forest.<br><br>If we find on it unknown elements (metals) that are not found any where else on earth, we might conjecture that it was deposited there by aliens.<br><br>Because there are pyramids in the desert of Egypt, and there are no evidence of deposits by aliens, we say... that the better explanation is that "an intelligent civilization" built it and we don't know why there are unknown elements on it.<br><br>There is also a problem with your example. Evolution deals with living things and we all know that the DNA of living things change, mutate, and evolve.<br><br>There is no evidence that non living things (a pyramid) can simply pop up from nowhere.<br><br>So you are not comparing apples with apples when you compare a living cell with a pyramid.<br><br>ID deals with "eliminating" possibilities and then makes a leap of faith.

I am not agitated in anyway that there are people trying to debunk Christianity or all religions.  My response was due to the pompous pseudo-intellectual who has not contributed anything to this thread and who seemed to be riding on your coat-tail, labelling Christians as "piteous" and arrogantly warned us that what he was about to write will shake our belief.

It said the "intelligent design" view defended by some United States conservatives was an updated version of creationism.<br><br>Creationism says God made the world in six days as depicted in the Bible. Intelligent design argues some life forms are too complex to have evolved according to Charles Darwin's theory and needed an unnamed higher intelligence to develop as they have.<br><br>Anne Brasseur, an Assembly member from Luxembourg who updated an earlier draft resolution, said the report showed how creationists -- most recently a shadowy Turkish Muslim writer Harun Yahya -- were trying to infiltrate European schools.<br><br>"The purpose of this report is to warn against the attempt to pass off a belief -- creationism -- as a science and to teach the theses of this belief in science classes," she said.

An Assembly committee took up the issue because Harun Yahya has been sending his lavish Islamic creationist book "Atlas of Creation" to schools in several countries.<br><br>Supporters of intelligent design want it taught in science class alongside evolution.

            <div class='col-md body'>At least the leaders of Europe and wise to note the dangers of irrational fundamentalism dn take steps to safeguard their children against such nonsense.<br><br>The below extract taken from:<br><strong>The dangers of creationism in education<br><br>Report<br>Committee on Culture, Science and Education<br>Rapporteur: Mrs Anne BRASSEUR, Luxembourg, ALDE</strong><br><br>1.       For some people the Creation, as a matter of religious belief, gives a meaning to life. Nevertheless, the Parliamentary Assembly is worried about the possible ill-effects of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies. <strong>If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the Council of Europe. </strong><br><br>2.       Creationism, born of the denial of the evolution of species through natural selection, was for a long time an almost exclusively American phenomenon. Today creationist ideas are tending to find their way into Europe and their spread is affecting quite a few Council of Europe member states.<br><br>3.       The prime target of present-day creationists, most of whom are Christian or Muslim, is education. Creationists are bent on ensuring that their ideas are included in the school science syllabus. Creationism cannot, however, lay claim to being a scientific discipline.<br><br>4.       Creationists question the scientific character of certain items of knowledge and argue that the theory of evolution is only one interpretation among others. They accuse scientists of not providing enough evidence to establish the theory of evolution as scientifically valid. On the contrary, they defend their own statements as scientific. None of this stands up to objective analysis.<br><br>5.       We are witnessing a growth of modes of thought which, the better to impose religious dogma, are attacking the very core of the knowledge that we have patiently built up on nature, evolution, our origins and our place in the universe.<br><br>6.       There is a real risk of a serious confusion being introduced into our childrenÂ’s minds between what has to do with convictions, beliefs, ideals of all sorts and what has to do with science, and of the advent of an Â“all things are equalÂ” attitude, which may seem appealing and tolerant but is actually disastrous.<br><br>7.       Creationism has many contradictory aspects. The Â“intelligent designÂ” idea, which is the latest, more refined version of creationism, does not deny a certain degree of evolution but claims that this is the work of a superior intelligence. Though more subtle in its presentation, the doctrine of intelligent design is no less dangerous.<br><br>8.       <strong>The Assembly has constantly insisted that science is of fundamental importance. Science has made possible considerable improvements in living and working conditions and is a not insignificant factor in economic, technological and social development. The theory of evolution has nothing to do with divine revelation but is built on facts.</strong><br><br>9.       <strong>Creationism claims to be based on scientific rigour. In actual fact the methods employed by creationists are of three types: purely dogmatic assertions; distorted use of scientific quotations, sometimes illustrated with magnificent photographs; and backing from more or less well-known scientists, most of whom are not specialists in these matters</strong>. By these means creationists seek to appeal to non-specialists and sow doubt and confusion in their minds.<br><br>10.       <strong>Evolution is not simply a matter of the evolution of humans and of populations. Denying it could have serious consequences for the development of our societies. Advances in medical research with the aim of effectively combating infectious diseases such as AIDS are impossible if every principle of evolution is denied. One cannot be fully aware of the risks involved in the significant decline in biodiversity and climate change if the mechanisms of evolution are not understood. </strong><br><br>11.       Our modern world is based on a long history, of which the development of science and technology forms an important part. However, the scientific approach is still not well understood and this is liable to encourage the development of all manner of fundamentalism and extremism. <strong>The total rejection of science is definitely one of the most serious threats to human rights and civic rights. </strong><br><br>12.       The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right-wing political movements. The creationist movements possess real political power. The fact of the matter, and this has been exposed on several occasions, is that some advocates of strict creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy.<br><br>13.       All leading representatives of the main monotheistic religions have adopted a much more moderate attitude. Pope Benedict XVI, for example, as his predecessor Pope John-Paul II, today praises the role of the sciences in the evolution of humanity and recognises that the theory of evolution is Â“more than a hypothesisÂ”.<br><br>14.       The teaching of all phenomena concerning evolution as a fundamental scientific theory is therefore crucial to the future of our societies and our democracies. For that reason it must occupy a central position in the curriculum, and especially in the science syllabus. Evolution is present everywhere, from medical overprescription of antibiotics that encourages the emergence of resistant bacteria to agricultural overuse of pesticides that causes insect mutations on which pesticides no longer have any effect.<br><br>15.       The Council of Europe has highlighted the importance of teaching about culture and religion. In the name of freedom of expression and individual belief, creationist ideas, as any other theological position, could possibly be presented as an addition to cultural and religious education, but they cannot claim scientific respectability.<br><br>16.       Science provides irreplaceable training in intellectual rigour. It seeks not to explain Â“why things areÂ” but to understand how they work.<br><br>17.       Investigation of the creationistsÂ’ growing influence shows that the arguments between creationism and evolution go well beyond intellectual debate. If we are not careful, the values that are the very essence of the Council of Europe will be under direct threat from creationist fundamentalists. It is part of the role of the CouncilÂ’s parliamentarians to react before it is too late.<br></div>
