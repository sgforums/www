              <p><strong>Do we REALLY know psyche of S'pore driver?</strong>  <br> <br>Understanding the pysche of drivers like Mr Li Tian'En was the topic of discussion in Parliament yesterday.</p>
              <p>Mr Li has a love-hate relationship with the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme.</p>
              <p>On one hand, the bank relationship manager's drive home from the business district via the Central Expressway (CTE) is faster because of the evening ERP charges.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, he can't stomach paying the $9 ERP charges he incurs if he drives from his Hougang home to office in the morning.</p>
              <p>He now takes a more convoluted route to work in the morning, via busy Ubi Avenue and Nicoll Highway instead.</p>
              <p>He spends only $2.50 in ERP fees in comparison, but wastes more time on the road.</p>
              <p>This is because of the increase in motorists who now ply this route to avoid the CTE.</p>
              <p>Mr Li told The New Paper: 'The traffic is very heavy along this route. There are many more traffic lights and my cruising speed is probably around 30kmh.</p>
              <p>'It's a more unpleasant drive compared to taking the CTE, but I save more money.'</p>
              <p>This alternative route takes him about 45 minutes to get to work, compared to 30 minutes via the CTE.</p>
              <p>He said: 'If I'm going to pay so much to use the CTE, I'll rather be late for work.'</p>
              <p>Mr Li, who paid about $100,000 for his Alfa 147 some two months ago, said he would not give up the luxury of using his car in the face of increasing ERP fees.</p>
              <p>'I've already paid so much for my car, of course I am going to use it. It would take a lot for me to switch to public transport,' he said.</p>
              <p>Attitudes like Mr Li's got Mr Hri Kumar - Member of Parliament for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC - asking if the ERP scheme is the right solution to Singapore's traffic woes.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Is the ERP the right antidote to the problem? There's a flawed relationship between Singaporeans and their cars.</p>
              <p>'Do you think Singaporeans will change their driving habits if you increase ERP charges? Congestion will still happen despite that.'</p>
              <p>He argued that Singaporeans, having paid tens of thousands of dollars for their cars, will not baulk at paying ERP charges.</p>
              <p>Mr Seah Kian Peng, Member of Parliament for Marine Parade GRC, questioned what went wrong with the country's car growth over the years.</p>
              <p>MORE CARS ON ROAD</p>
              <p>The passenger car population increased by 5.1 per cent in 2005, 7.8 per cent in 2006 and 9 per cent last year.</p>
              <p>He asked: 'Why did we allow it to gridlock? I think we got the psychology wrong somewhere.'</p>
              <p>Transport Minister Raymond Lim explained that there is no single measure that can solve the congestion problem.</p>
              <p>The ERP is but just one measure, along with vehicle population growth control, road building and public transport improvements.</p>
              <p>'We need ERP to ensure that we are a city in a garden, and not a city in a carpark,' he said.</p>
              <p>On criticisms that the ERP is just a revenue generator, Minister Lim explained that the annual revenue foregone on combined ownership tax cuts such as excise duty and road taxes came up to more than $1.2 billion every year on a permanent basis.</p>
              <p>The ERP revenue comes up to just about $100 million per year.</p>
              <p>'So, it is not a revenue measure but a congestion measure,' he added.</p>
              <p>Minister Lim recounted how, when Certificate of Entitlement prices went above $100,000 in 1994, unhappy Singaporeans complained about the high car costs.</p>
              <p>The Government then switched to a usage measure.</p>
              <p>'So, we changed the system by lowering the ownership costs, so that you pay as you use. It is a fair system,' he added.</p>
              <p>He does not agree that given the cost of cars here, once people have bought their cars, they are going to drive no matter how expensive ERP is.</p>
              <p>Minister Lim cited an example of how traffic flow along the CTE was slow in the evening, with a travelling speed of about 34kmh.</p>
              <p>But when the ERP gantry was up, the cruising speed increased to 50kmh, and the cars using it dropped by some 10 per cent.</p>
              <p>He said: 'For some people, they will continue to drive regardless of the price, but not all will do so.</p>
              <p>'If this was so, all ERP-priced roads today will be congested and if the ERP system was a failure, other cities such as London, Milan and New York City would not have followed us.'</p>

              <p>the right solution is to make cars freaking cheap but prohibiting them from driving with expensive ERP, parking and fuel</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. scrap COE and road tax</p>
              <p>2. increase ERP, petrol/diesel tax</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in this way, everyone will be happy cos ppl can own a car as cheap as $20k, govt revenue increases and car industry sustained.</p>
