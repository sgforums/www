              <p>Philip Johnston<br> Last Updated: 8:21PM GMT 12 Feb 2009</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/philipjohnston/4604985/Whatever-happened-to-free-speech.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/philipjohnston/4604985/Whatever-happened-to-free-speech.html</a></p>
              <p>The refusal to admit the oddball Dutch MP Geert Wilders to Britain
                  yesterday marks a further retreat from this country's traditions of
                  free speech. It stands in stark contrast to what happened exactly 20
                  years ago tomorrow, when Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa
                  calling for the death of Salman Rushdie for insulting the Prophet
                  Mohammed in his book <em>The Satanic Verses</em>.</p>
              <p>In retrospect,
                  that was a turning point in the country's history of free speech, an
                  event that appeared to demonstrate indomitability, yet turned out to be
                  a defeat. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">An unambiguous stand was taken on Rushdie's behalf by the
                  government of the day, which denounced the threat to his life and broke
                  off diplomatic relations with Iran. Sir Geoffrey Howe, then foreign
                  secretary, told the Commons: "This action is taken in plain defence of
                  the right within the law of freedom of speech and the right within the
                  law of freedom of protest."</span></strong></p>
              <p>Despite mass book burnings, protests
                  around the world, including in Bolton and Bradford, and threats of
                  violence, the work continued to be published and sold. How could it be
                  otherwise? This was Britain, after all, the citadel of free speech. We
                  would not be brow beaten into denying the rights of one of our
                  citizens, or anyone else for that matter, from having their say,
                  however controversial or offensive their opinion might be.</p>
              <p>Sadly,
                  the past two decades have seen a pusillanimous flight into cowering
                  capitulation. We seem to have forgotten what free speech entails, how
                  hard it was fought for and how important it is to defend. It is the
                  value with which this country is most associated throughout the world.
                  It is why Britain has been home, over the centuries, to so many
                  political dissidents who would have been persecuted elsewhere, and why
                  those who live in autocracies that brook no criticism tune into the BBC
                  World Service.</p>
              <p>They see this as a place able to accommodate
                  opinions that are obviously crazy, offensive or even seditious, a
                  country where a view can be held and expressed, provided – and this has
                  always been true – that it does not foment violence.</p>
              <p>Geert
                  Wilders is an anti-Islamist who regards the Koran as inherently
                  inflammatory and believes he is justified in saying so. He has made a
                  17-minute film, <em>Fitna</em> – an Arabic word meaning test of faith –
                  setting out this thesis and was invited to show it at a private
                  screening in the House of Lords. The film can be seen on the internet,
                  so there is no question of stopping its dissemination. It contains some
                  unpleasant images of bomb explosions, of captured hostages facing death
                  and of chanting mobs interlaced with passages from the Koran.</p>
              <p>Wilders
                  claims that these verses from the holy book of Islam are being used
                  today to incite modern Muslims to behave violently and
                  anti-democratically. You may think he is wrong to say this; you may
                  agree with him; you might, like the lords who invited him to Britain,
                  think it is something worthy of discussion, given the obvious problems
                  caused around the world by radical Islamism and the violence
                  perpetrated in the name of the religion. It is hard, in a free country,
                  to understand why it is a view that must be suppressed.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">What,
                  then, possessed the Home Office to ban Wilders – an unprecedented
                  action against a democratically-elected politician from a European
                  state, who is entitled to free movement within the EU? By any measure,
                  it was an extraordinary decision; yet it was not even raised in
                  parliament, the supposed guardian of our freedoms, though some MPs have
                  commented on the ban, largely to support it.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Were Wilders a
                  terrorist preaching violence against particular groups, it could be
                  understood on public order grounds. The order issued by Jacqui Smith,
                  the Home Secretary, read: "The Secretary of State is of the view that
                  your presence in the UK would pose a genuine, present and sufficiently
                  serious threat to one of the fundamental interests of society. The
                  Secretary of State is satisfied that your statements about Muslims and
                  their beliefs, as expressed in your film <em>Fitna</em> and elsewhere would threaten community harmony and therefore public security in the UK."</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet
                  what possible threat to public security is posed by a Dutch MP showing
                  a film, in private, to a smattering of peers on a Thursday afternoon in
                  February? Of itself, the film does not call for violence against
                  Muslims; indeed, it suggests that Islam is a cause of violence, a view
                  with which you are entitled to agree or feel strongly about, but not to
                  prohibit. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The reason for the ban appears to have been the
                  possibility of protests by some Muslim organisations against Wilders's
                  visit. In other words, his freedom to express a view and the liberty of
                  peers to hear it in an institution supposedly devoted to free speech,
                  were set aside in the face of intimidation – the opposite of what
                  happened in the Rushdie case, even if that author was forced into
                  hiding.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is particularly insidious is the application of
                  double standards. One of those most opposed to Wilders's visit is the
                  Muslim peer Lord Ahmed, though he denies allegations that he warned
                  parliamentary authorities that 10,000 demonstrators would take to the
                  streets. Yet two years ago, Lord Ahmed invited Mahmoud Abu Rideh, a
                  Palestinian previously detained on suspicion of fundraising for groups
                  linked to al-Qaeda, to Westminster to meet him. When he was criticised
                  for doing so, he said it was his parliamentary duty to hear Rideh's
                  complaints. He does not appear to see any contradiction with the
                  position he now adopts against his fellow peers.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Had a foreign
                  parliamentarian who disliked Christians and considered the Bible to be
                  inflammatory planned a visit to Britain, does anyone imagine he would
                  have been prevented from doing so? No, and neither should he have been.
                  This must work for everyone.</p>
              <p>The arrest and possible
                  prosecution of Rowan Laxton, a Foreign Office diplomat, for railing at
                  the Israeli invasion of Gaza from his exercise bike in the gym, is the
                  latest example of an equally sinister development – the denunciation of
                  opinions expressed in private, as with Carol Thatcher's "golliwog"
                  comments. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Free speech is about understanding that some people hold a
                  different view from you, whether you like it or not. When we start to
                  alert the "authorities" to thought crimes we really are one step away
                  from the dystopian world that Orwell invented as a warning, not a
                  prophecy.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Government that has treated our liberties in such a
                  cavalier way is having none of this, of course. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">David Miliband, the
                  Foreign Secretary, said the film made by Wilders was "full of hate" and
                  therefore fell foul of British laws, though he admitted that he had not
                  seen it and therefore could not judge. But, in any case, is he right?
                  Is it against the law?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">People have always been free under the
                  criminal law to speak their minds, provided they did not, in doing so,
                  incite others to commit violence or infringe public order.
                  Rabble-rousers trying to whip up the mob have never been the
                  beneficiaries of this latitude: there is, in other words, a difference
                  between license and liberty. However, it is necessary to demonstrate
                  that the words complained of are likely to stir up hatred and public
                  disorder, not merely to complain that they are unpleasant or
                  objectionable to some. Imams have been allowed to continue preaching in
                  mosques when it could be argued that they have overstepped this mark,
                  as when they have called for the death of homosexuals or Jews.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Wilders
                  is no advertisement for free speech. After all, he wants the Koran to
                  be banned. But that is not the point. It is what this affair says about
                  us, not him, that matters. Is Britain now adopting a position where
                  people who support suicide bombers and jihad are able to make known
                  their opinions without legal challenge, whereas those who oppose them
                  cannot?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">The very people who in 1989 were demanding the murder
                  of Salman Rushdie for writing a book are today leading the charge
                  against a Dutch MP for making a film. The fundamental difference is
                  that 20 years ago, the government supported free speech; today, it has
                  cravenly surrendered. It is simply not good enough to say that Wilders
                  should not be heard because he might provoke a backlash from those who
                  do not like him or his views. That is not upholding the law. That is
                  appeasement. </span></strong></p>
