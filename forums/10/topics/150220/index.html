            <div class='col-md body'>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/1878?unwrap=1<br><br>Comments By Mellanie Hewlitt<br>Singapore Review<br>1 Oct 2004<br>Transparency in SOEs, GLCs &amp; State Administration<br><br>With an obscene amout of surplus in Medisave Reserves, huge hidden fiscal<br>surpluses enrich the Singapore government and state enterprises but impoverish<br>the private sector and tax payers.<br><br>Lack of Transparency is a common issue with the CPF Board and State Owned<br>Enterprises. The ST article (in 1 Oct 2004 issue) below is vaguely<br>reminiscient of similiar revelations of the huge hidden reserves which the<br>National Kidney Foundation had stashed away, even as it sort more charitable<br>funding from the general public. Indeed the common theme in both CPF and NKF<br>exercises is that they have the central objective of siphoning even more funds<br>from tax-payers into the already fat coffers of many state owned vehicles. All<br>this is cleverly done under the guise of schemes and policies which are<br>supposedly designed to look after the welfare of Singapore Citizens.<br><br>But the abuse is quite glaring since money only flows one way:- into the<br>pockets of the state administrators. There is no outflow from the state to the<br>public. What happens to the billions of dollars in reserves is also a total<br>mystery.<br><br>The high-surplus strategy lowers Singapore's standard of living. Deprived of<br>disposable income by numerous taxes, Singaporeans consistently consume a share<br>of GDP 10-20 percentage points below Hong Kong levels, while Hong Kong<br>maintains a higher per-capita income. It was only recently that the CPF Board<br>has also stepped up measures to sue "Medisave Laggards" who fail to top-up on<br>their own Medisave accounts.<br><br>These Big structural surpluses most benefit the ruling party, to the detriment<br>of the private sector. Unconstrained by tight finances, the government pays<br>cabinet members and civil servants some of the world's highest public-sector<br>packages. See:<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/1182<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/3<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/1321<br><br>A variety of analytical shields obscures the embarrassing size of government<br>surpluses. Accounting principles differ from global standards. A bewildering<br>array of statutory boards, government-linked companies, investment corporations<br>and holding companies transact among themselves at undisclosed prices. Key data<br>such as the government's share of national savings and the profits of holding<br>companies and investment corporations are kept secret. One analyst calls the<br>national accounts a "masterpiece of obfuscation." See:<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/87<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/1270<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Sg_Review/message/1170<br><br>The other troubling issue which is tactfully avoided by the government is the<br>fact that CPF investments (and returns/profitability of State Owned Companies<br>as wells as GLCs and TLCs) are under performers and laggards well behind<br>private sector standards. Is this is an intended result of figures manupulated<br>to obscure huge returns, or are State Owned Entities really so appalingly bad<br>at earning decent returns on investments? No one will ever know the answers.<br><br>It is indeed cruel irony that State Organisations and Government Linked<br>Companies are ripping-off the very individuals which they are established to<br>protect. So blatant is the abuse of public funds that such occurences have now<br>been institutionalised and formalised, with the Constitution re-written to<br>allow the state and State Owned Enterprises direct access to state/public<br>reserves. All this has happened with the blessing of the Auditors General<br>office and Finance Ministry.
