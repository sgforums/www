It was a success in NWFP and Balochistan provinces, but was only sporadic in Punjab and Sindh.<br><br>Religious parties and groups are cashing in on a widespread pan-Islamic sentiment, a characteristic of South Asian Muslims. They see the war on Iraq in black and white, as a clash of religions: Christian America and West - forget the actual facts - against a Muslim country, Iraq.<br><br>More pan-Islamic propaganda by mullahs has acquired a lot of paranoia and some xenophobia against the West. It curiously ignores "old Europe's" opposition to America's war and the worldwide demonstrations by millions of people of all religions or none.<br><br>Naimatullah Khan, a prominent MMA leader of Karachi who is also city's mayor, enjoys the reputation of being moderate and level-headed. He observed, "This war has no justification; it is against the UN charter and indeed will deal a blow to both UN and international law."<br><br>Astute politician that he is, he did not bring in the religious bit at all, realizing that he was speaking to an international audience. The MMA is exploiting the religious sentiments of Pakistani Muslims to gain power. This power drive by the mullahs has posed the secular elements in the country - an influential minority - a dilemma. They, too, object to the war on political and legal grounds, but their demonstrations are smaller. The majority among the West-oriented politicians is secular, but their shibboleths are taken from the mullahs.<br><br>Those who lead big, right-wing parties court the United States for support. But their politics, god and country, is heavily garnished with vacuous Islamic rhetoric. They have ended up strengthening the mullahs far more than themselves.<br><br>In short, the MMA is having the best of both worlds: On one side, it is cashing in on the widespread anti-US feelings, stealing anti-imperialist slogans from the left and, on the other, is bargaining with the generals. The generals are still the only people who matter in giving a share in power. But they dread the US reaction.<br><br>The generals, the silent puppeteers behind the show of the technically democratic government of Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali, and their chief, President General Pervez Musharraf, are at sea regarding what policy to adopt toward the US and the Iraq war they silently support.<br><br>Government views are carried by the media. But the generals are falling between two stools of reflecting popular feelings, with genuflections toward the MMA, and the need to remain on the right side of the US, on whose support they depend. In the event, neither objective is achieved, the US takes a dim view of what Islamabad is doing.<br><br>Mainstream right-wing parties stand crippled by the generals, except for the turncoat toadies who once belonged to the then Pakistan Muslim League of former Premier Nawaz Sharif, and are now the ruling party as the PML (Quaid-i-Azam).<br><br>They are dwarfed under the shadow of Musharraf and are not taken seriously. Their many efforts to woo the MMA to join the government have produced no result. The mullahs are aiming higher and treat the ruling party with contempt. The US, too, remains wary.<br><br>The other mainstream party that polled more votes than it got seats in last year's polls, the Pakistan Peoples Party of ex-prime minister Benazir Bhutto, is keeping aloof from all anti-US demonstrations, keeping a low profile. It is afraid of annoying the US.<br><br>Sharif's PML is also in the dumps with fewer seats in parliament, thanks to the peculiar results in the October 2002 election. Its rhetoric is borrowed mostly from MMA and does not really count today.<br><br>The left is only a dim memory from decades ago. Its atomized remnants are found in many non-government organizations. Their old allies, the regional nationalist parties, were never left-wing in texture, are marked by factionalism, and fast becoming inconsequential.<br><br>Balochistan continues to live in the Middle Ages and is represented by mullahs and the rich tribal chiefs or sardars. Only one regional nationalist party counts electorally because it emerged the second largest party in the last polls the Muttahida Quami Movement of Altaf Hussain.<br><br>But ethnic Sindhi groups regard MQM's nationalist credentials with suspicion because of accusations of its fascist tendencies. It is the backbone of Sindh's provincial government as the largest party of the ruling coalition. It has a deserved reputation of being pro-US.<br><br>But one of its leaders, ex-senator Nasreen Jalil, repeated a populist line on Iraq and emphasized the humanitarian factor. "Too many Iraqi lives are going to be needlessly lost. There is no real justification for it. Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, clearly questionable, would not be unique; so many others, especially Israel, have them. Would the US fight against them all?"<br><br>Asked about the war, Hamza Alvi, a leftist intellectual, disassociated himself from all that nonsense about a "clash of civilizations" or of religions. He said, "'The US is set on a course of enforcing a new, updated version of imperialism. Bush's immediate objective may be oil and giving Israel more security.<br><br>"But the vision behind the current American quest covers most of Asia, aiming at the encirclement of China and putting Russia in its proper place. It has all but secured South Asia and is well on its way to dominate Central Asia," he added. "Their nemesis - popular reactions and struggles - may seem far away. But they might not be all that far away either, including the many fooled Americans," Alvi said.<br><br>(Inter Press Service)</div>

The nuclearization of South Asia prompted some non-government groups to organize peace groups with a view to creating a critical mass supporting peace and nuclear disarmament, while others initiated permanent projects on peace education.<br><br>The Citizens' Peace Committee in Islamabad organized a 1,000-strong peace rally in the capital on Hiroshima Day in 1998, one of the biggest ever held by NGOs. The local peace groups were later knit into a national group called the Pakistan Peace Coalition (PPC).<br><br>However, the PPC proved to be non-starter as it relied on non-government groups than creating linkages with the political parties and people. Instead of making inroads in public and expanding its membership to make itself politically and financially, it organized conferences using money from the much-criticized Western donors.<br><br>"However much good work the NGOs are engaged in, there are many who question their legitimacy on several counts - whether it is their sources of funding or their way of working. NGOs can never be a replacement to political parties and cannot mobilize public opinion in the same fashion as a political party does," said Kaneez Zehra, a peace activist based in Islamabad.<br><br>The PRM chief agrees, saying that the secular peace movement in Pakistan is a political orphan and peace issues are generally not on the list of priorities of political parties. He said that one of the important reasons for an abysmally low number of people who turned out last month, on the day when millions protested against the impending Iraq attack throughout the world, was lack of interest by non-religious political parties in the Iraq issue - or probably wariness in taking a categorical stand on an issue sensitive in this mainly Muslim country.<br><br>"A vigorous peace movement needs political support, but secular political parties in the country are too embroiled in power politics that they have no time to take up issues that are close to people's hearts," Akhtar said. He was referring to the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) which polled the highest number - almost 26 percent of total votes - in last October's elections. It is second largest party in parliament.<br><br>The PPP, which has championed a progressive agenda since its inception in the late 1960s, has, however, adopted a policy of silence over the Iraq issue as it did in the case of the US-led military attacks on Afghanistan after September 11. The PPP and other mainstream non-religious political parties have so far not organized protests opposing the US attack on Iraq.<br><br>While the ruling Q League would stay away from what its leaders call "street theatrics" for understandable reasons, many non-religious parties, like cricketer-turn-politician Imran Khan's Pakistan Justice Party, have aligned themselves with the MMA on the issue. Khan even addressed the MMA rally in Rawalpindi.<br><br>The Pakistan Muslim League, led by exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, has organized some protest rallies in some cities, but adopted a line close to that of the religious parties.<br><br>Political scientists say that the PPP and other non-religious parties - having a stake in power - are abstaining from adopting any clear-cut policy on issues involving US interests, due to great US-influence in the country's politics.<br><br>"The PPP, being the main anti-establishment party, will not want to take an anti-US position at a time when the Pakistani military is drawing closer to Washington by virtue of the growing anti-Americanism in the country," observed a researcher at the government-run Institute of Regional Studies, requesting anonymity.<br><br>"If the PPP goes to the opposition camp, it will be assumed in American official circles that the Pakistani military is the only choice for protecting American interests in Pakistan and the adjoining region," he added. "I personally went to the PPP office in Islamabad and requested them to call the party workers to attend the February 15 protests, but officials there said there is no such order from the party leadership," said Sarwar Bari, head of the Pattan Development Foundation that has been organizing street theaters to sensitize people on the political dimension of US war designs.<br><br>Still, Bari said that people must be educated about the real reasons for US expansionism. "The MMA is mobilizing people around a religious agenda that breeds intolerance and hatred. The silence of non-religious parties is creating space for the religious right to further their extremist agenda and consolidate their political position," he said.<br><br>Bari said that people must know the facts, and the facts are that the US war designs against Iraq have nothing to do with Islam, but are in pursuit of its geo-strategic objectives. "People must know that the US has initiated some 34 major wars around the world since 1945 and Muslims constitute a very small fraction of its war victims."<br><br>How the secular peace movement can be strengthened and its message brought across in these very divided times boggles activists' minds. To them, it points out the need for more organization among people's groups, inroads into the political parties and peace education programs, especially directed toward children.<br><br>But until that time, they have to live with groups like the MMA, which may also be against war on Iraq but which peace activists believe is advocating views more damaging in the end to peace.<br><br>(Inter Press Service)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>March 24, 2003<br><br>Islamist nuke in an uncertain arsenal?<br><br>Arnaud de Borchgrave<br><br>A Pakistani nuclear missile can now hit Tel Aviv, according to a former Pakistani intelligence chief who is "strategic adviser" to his country's Islamist politico-religious parties.<br>Gen. Hamid Gul, the retired head of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, in his latest well-publicized (in Pakistan) statement, says: "We have the nuclear capability that can destroy Madras [India]. Surely the same missile can do the same to Tel Aviv. Washington cannot stop Muslim suicidal attacks. Taliban are still alive and along with 'friends.' They will continue the holy jihad against the U.S. America will destroy Iraq and later on repeat the same act of war against Pakistan, Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia."<br>A coalition of six extremist religious parties (MMA) now governs two of Pakistan's four provinces Â— a direct result of the free elections the U.S. insisted be held after President Pervez Musharraf endorsed the Bush administration's war on terror. MMA leader Sami ul-Haq, a newly elected senator, has also declared jihad against the U.S. and Israel. "If the U.S. attacks Iraq, the MMA alliance and all their supporters will attack Washington and Tel Aviv," he said.<br>Another redoubtable MMA leader, Fazlur Rehman, said, for his part, "The U.S. better take seriously the consequences of its attack against Iraq because we are fully capable of taking revenge." Arguably the most powerful extremist religious leader, Qazi Hussain Ahmed, head of Jamat-e-Islamai, warned President Bush he "will suffer the horrible punishment of God."<br>Pakistan possesses between 35 and 60 nuclear weapons with the missile capability (obtained from North Korea) to deliver them. The nuclear arsenal is designed as a deterrent to India's older nuclear capability. India conducted its first nuclear tests in 1974. This was the first time an influential Pakistani, well-known for his visceral hatred of the U.S. and Israel, had mentioned another nation besides India as a possible target for Pakistani nukes.<br>A number of Pakistani generals are Islamist fundamentalists and resent Mr. Musharraf's close alliance with the U.S. It was a "shotgun wedding," some of them have said. Mr. Musharraf had no choice when Mr. Bush called him the day after September 11, 2001, and asked him whether he could count on him to pursue the new war against Taliban and al Qaeda. Mr. Musharraf made a quick command decision, broke with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and gave the U.S. the use of several bases for Operation Enduring Freedom.<br>The all-powerful ISI's culture has long been anti-American, dating back to 1989 when the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan and the U.S. began punishing Pakistan for its secret nuclear buildup. Ever since the collapse of Taliban in November 2001, ISI officers have spread the word among the tribal chiefs along their ill-defined Pakistani-Afghan border that "America will be coming after Pakistan's nuclear arsenal as soon as they have finished with Afghanistan."<br>How safe is Pakistan's nuclear arsenal? Shortly after September 11, Mr. Musharraf ordered the country's nuclear weapons to be detached from their launchers and stored in six different secret locations with fail-safe security systems. But Mr. Musharraf has survived six assassination plots since September 11, and the CIA is clearly concerned about the very real possibility an Islamist general could take over one day Â— and acquire control of the arsenal.<br>Pakistan has carefully refrained from signing the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. Nor is it committed to the non-first-use doctrine. India and Pakistan pulled back last summer from a face-off involving 1 million troops. There is little doubt if India were to humiliate Pakistan militarily over the longstanding Kashmir dispute, Pakistan would retaliate with a nuclear salvo. Senior Indian national security officials accept this possibility with equanimity. In fact, one of them, speaking privately a month ago, said: "We could easily survive one or two nuclear hits. But when we retaliate, Pakistan would disappear from the map."<br>The North Korean crisis has been adjudged by Secretary of State Colin Powell as "not a crisis." Pakistan, in that perspective, is even less of a crisis.<br><br>Arnaud de Borchgrave is editor at large of The Washington Times and of United Press International.<br><br><a href="http://washingtontimes.com/commentary/20030324-26509390.htm" rel="nofollow">http://washingtontimes.com/commentary/20030324-26509390.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is WW1 and WW2 that shaped the world that is today. WW3 will only advance us even further into the future. Bush is aligning crooked lines, taking out tyrants and commies. WW1 is because of one person, WW2 is clearly about conquering for resource and land. WW3 will be different war, it is war to inject democracy, don't condemn this war just because it is called a war. WW3 is good, and WW4 will be more good. the Iraqi's will benefit from this war in iraq. they don't have to worry about being dissolved in chemical tanks, grinded alive, hanged or punched for not performing well in sports. Please support this war. Many people will die.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>India successfully test fires Prithvi<br>AFP<br>Balasore, March 26<br><br>India fired its surface-to-surface Prithvi missile, which can carry a one-tonne nuclear warhead a distance of 150 kilometres, at 11.30 am from Chandipur-on-sea in Orissa.<br><br>Pakistan, too, fired a short-range missile but it was not known if the test followed or preceded the launch of India's 8.5-metre Prithvi, which has a minimum range of 40 kilometres.<br><br>Indian military sources insisted the Pakistani missile launch was a tit-for-tat test-flight.<br><br>In Islamabad, however, the Pakistani government claimed its missile test had been conducted without prior knowledge of its rival's.<br><br>"We have conducted a successful Abdali missile test today and we had given prior information to all our neighbours about the test," government spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan told AFP.<br><br>"The missile test by India came as a surprise. We were not notified about the test in accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed by the two countries on February 21, 1991," he said.<br><br>The Abdali surface-to-surface missile has a range of up to 200 kilometers (125 miles) and is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, an official source said.<br><br>Military experts and political analysts in India said the timing of the Prithvi launch was calibrated to send a message to the United States, currently waging an all-out war in Iraq, as well as a separate warning to Pakistan.<br><br>"We visualise the test as a signal to Pakistan that the massacre of 24 Hindus in Kashmir has led to a fair amount of anger all over India and that such things are no more acceptable," said NK Sareen, a former chief of the Indian air force.<br><br>Sareen said the test of Prithvi, a tactical missile that has built-in computers and advanced navigation and guidance systems, appeared to be deliberately timed to coincide with the height of the conflict in Iraq.<br><br>"To the Americans the test gives two messages: You are sitting there in Pakistan but you have not squeezed (President Pervez) Musharraf's neck enough, which is not acceptable to us," the air force chief said.<br><br>"Thousands of terrorist camps are still operating in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Washington is following a different objective of killing Iraqi women and children -- and that without finding the smoking gun of weapons of mass destruction or chemical weapons," Sareen said.<br><br>India, which blamed Pakistan for the weekend massacre, also accuses it of arming and training terrorists in Kashmir. It is also pressuring the US to force Islamabad to end its support of cross-border-terrorism.<br><br>Indian defence spokesman P. Bandhopadhaya was at pains to de-link Prithvi's flight, abandoned twice last December due to glitches, to regional frictions or to India's vehement opposition to the US war on Iraq.<br><br>"This was just a developmental trial and hence the test should not be linked to any situation or issue because it is an ongoing process," he insisted.<br><br>Prithvi has so far been tested 16 times since its first trial in 1988.<br><br>"But at the same time, the test wants to explain that India is unperturbed by the global developments and that it will hone its pre-emptive strike capabilities if a war is thrust upon us," added political analyst Anand Ojha.<br><br>India, which conducted a series of nuclear tests in 1998, reversed its no-first-use doctrine last year with a warning that even a chemical or biological weapon attack on the soil would provoke a nuclear retaliation.<br><br>Prithvi, which means Earth, can be tipped with incendiary and fragmentary munitions or can carry a sub-kiloton nuclear warhead for use on massed troops or armoured formations.<br><br><a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_221640,0008.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_221640,0008.htm</a></div>
