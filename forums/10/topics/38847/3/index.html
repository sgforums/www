            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">okie... u all wanna talk about monster, then now and in the past, there are always tons of monster around...<br><br>China used to be called a monster too isn't it ? It killed a lot of University students when they go for  protest, it attacked mongolia and tibet and it doesn't do much welfare to its people either. So, does US attack china then ? No. Why ? Because it has Russia as its allies and china has real powerful weopon of mass destruction. SO wat is the diff to Iraq now ? Iraq is weak. It has never fully recover its strength after the war 10 years ago. It doesn't have weopons of mass destruction. If they have, they would have used it now since he is described as such a monster. Wat is the morale of story ? All nations should have WMD to serve as a deterrent to protect itself from attacks. Face it, it works.<br><br>U wanna talk about liberation, then NOrth Korea really need it as they r starving and dieseased. At the very least, Iraq people don't go hungry. So who need liberation more ? About democracy, US itself has rejected the will of UN by ignoring the resolutions. It has rejected the Kyoto Protocol even though it produce 40% of world polution. Is French all alone in disapproving the war ? No. Russia and China and many other non permanent disapprove it too. WHat is the intention to start the law of using resolution to pass a war ? To Deter wars that was not justified.<br><br>The US give the carrot to nations who support while giving the stick to those who reject its policy. It doesn't allow nations to take a stand out of their own free will. By this, I do not talk about SIngapore. There r many instances that happened especially before they attack Afghanistan. They give the carrot by weakening their stand on Taiwan for China, give incentives for Russia and give the stick by cancelling all visas to MAlaysians and cancelling help package to Turkey. Why resort to legal corruption ?<br><br>U talk about NOrth Korean holds dialogue with Japan and South Korea. Iraq too holds talk with UN too isn't it ? U talk about sincerity, neither of them fits the bill isn't it ? How about Librya ? It too is friendless. Does being isolation give us reason to attack ?<br><br>About AFghan. I don't think it has stabilise itself yet. Guerillas force r abundant around. Its own armies isn't strong to face the resistance force itself yet. Isn't that the same as some Afrcan nation (the Tutsi and bla bla bla), that when the British troops left, they started their own internal war ? As chinese say it, even the best external magistrate cannot judge fairly to internal domestic affairs<br><br>Maybe we should do something to Iraq, but the method of war is too much. Not only it cost problems to world economic, the weopons used to attack Iraq aren't cheap either. The cost to Iraq is worst. Human lives and infrastructure r killed. Killing 30% of people, making the other 30% geurillas while liberating the resukting 40% isn't much of a liberation.</div></blockquote>rubbish. i dun really care even if saddam has no WMD. his iron hand rule sickens me enough anyway, same goes to china.<br><br>as for the using of the weapons. iraq will not dare to use it, cuz by using it, its as good as finally admitting that they DO hv the weapons, and USA is right, more countries will help USA then. pls use yr head ok?</div>

They used precisely the same argument as wat u all had used in this discussion like gassing of people bla bla bla... After 10 year, US still used the same argument against Iraq.

            <div class='col-md body'>Way to go!! Pocket Pig, exactly same sentiments here. Nobody likes war, but sometimes it is necessary to go to that stage in order to bring peace back. But the so called 'piss-lover aka peace loving activists' don't think that way. As long as there is war, a number of them oppose without even thinking about why a war is fought and necessary. War and peace co-exist. Without war, there won't be peace and vice versa.<br><br>For all those that still think war is not the last solution, kindly offer your 'wise' suggestions to the now useless UN. All talk and no action. What's the use of condemming nations like iraq with harsh words? Do you think that Saddam will actually give a damm? There maybe no WMD and there could be. If Iraq is "clean", it should have let the UN inspectors go about their job without much interruptions and cooperate fully so as to prove to the world that is has disarmed.<br><br>9-11 was an example. All these years of US taking a backseat against terrorist and look what happened? Right now, most anti-war people might say war will not prevent future terrorist attack, but at least it could offer some glimpse of hope to the intelligence to try and prevent similar things from happening.<br><br>If there is no military or civilian casualty in a conflict, it is not a war but an exercise. For those anti-war activists, piss-lover, if you can look straight into the eyes of an orphan whose parents, siblings and relatives who has been subjected to cruel inhumane treatment and gased and tell him/her no war, perhaps you are just as cold-blooded as the regime.<br><br>True, there might be hidden agenda in this gulf war, but what do you prefer? A better iraq without the current regime plus a improvement of global economy or a iraq with the same family and a lousy economy due to the fear of terrorist?<br><br>Getting rid of saddam is not enough. His two sons have to go as well. They are no saints, if either one of them is to take over the country, one thing can be for sure, it is still hell for the citizens of iraq, just that it is under different names for their tyrannical ruler.</div>

Saddam say U.S and Britain is evil and Allah will stand by him, then his "Chemical Ali" gas so many people not evil??People vomitted with swollen eyes before they died. Again,must be endorsed by Allah. If saddam is out, a real human leader would put the $$ into education system in Baghdad and produce academic talents to INVENT or RESEARCH stuff that would save the ENTIRE HUMAN RACE in the FUTURE.(THE SAME TO NORTH KOREA) We need to finish wars FAST to PROTECT our children. When u store urine u will end up with kidney stones, and u will DIE. SAME, u don't do wars and clear out all these rogue STATES u will end up with CRANKY leaders in North Korea doing ONE NUKIE PER MONTH. they are commie states, they don't have a decent economy, they can only sell NUKIES and petty oil for survival.<br><br>Iran should be FORCED installed a democratic government too, u get hands chopped off for stealing things and Marijuana, OVER ONE BILLION STONED. They don't allow porn and open kissing and romantic stuff that supression produces HOMOSEXUALS, and in the end they get a wall PUSHED on them, FLAT, CRUSHED.<br>And they IMPOSE so many crazy shit laws that single mothers have to NO CHOICE but to smuggle drugs around for living, and in the END, they get HUNG, i posted the pic before, some of u must have seeen it. What happened to the child who's mother have been executed? he does petty stuff when he finally can't take it, he do drugs to gets EXTRA CASH maybe for doctor or something and joins HIS MOTHER. They don't have a government, they are all FANATICS governing the whole place. You don't CONDEMN a thief by CHOPPING his hands off, u don't even do that to a DOG. SINGAPORE DIDN'T have such tough and crazy laws, and we're doing 100, 000, 000 times better than them.<br><br>Talking about laws, recently channel U just make a damn humiliating show telling us that we have one of the highest TRAFFIC of porn in porn whatever. U know why?? in other countries they can just get it in the newsstands or just ANYWHERE.<br>They supress all this shit thinking they will be able to keep our children from BAD INFLUENCE, it is only a matter of sooner or later.<br>The PENIS is a terrible CURSE u KNOW?? the rest with steads skip this paragraph, u have something to vent on or a reason to act hero. Why this law?? maybe the politicians have wives aiming broomsticks at their head. i don't know, what do u think.<br><br>IF the Qin emperor didn't do all the conquering in China and COMBINE all in one, i think we would have end up with a bigger verson of the 2 Koreas and u all will commit SUICIDE studying the Chinese language ALONE. Thanks to the movie Hero, i didn't realise the moral of the story until my father tell me.  "This sword go down, alot of people won't die, emperor will live." Very cool qoute from the movie.<br><br>SO WHAT if Bush  evil or something?? IT IS the americans who vote for him. IT IS THEIR FAULT if too many people die.  The presidents ALWAYS CHANGE and if that black lady lawyer or some talented female professional  GETS to be PREZ in 2005 or later in the future , it is them who will do the CLEANING UP. PATCHING UP and DOING GOOD POLICIES because females are less agressive(to some degree).<br><br>LANGUAGE: all the world's government really must be ENFORCED to major english in their COUNTRIES. The animals couldn't put up a revolt against us humans for torturing and killing them is BECAUSE they doesn't have a language to REALISE their THOUGHTS.  You look at Indonesia, Philipines, Africa, We. SINGAPORE succeeded as a pro, 1337 country although we didn't have a NATURAL RESOURCES is because LKY emulated the english Westminster Governing system. We used it, plus his multi-racial peace policie (although he sometimes is really racist), we are good now, using ENGLISH to post our thoughts. i am not saying China have fail, it's really dumb to type and learn all the chinese symbols on the keyboard. It's unefficient, i bought a NJStar from Ang Mo Kio pirated shop and haven't figured out how to use it. (same to japan and other gibberish countries.)<br><br>we face 4 REAL THREATS, threats that wipe out the entire human race.<br><br>SPace SHit<br>a stone or a asteroid or whatever u call it carry a bacteria that lives in outer space UNKNOWN to medical science and lands in a lake and SPREADS to the fisherman who fish in it and eventually spread it to the WORLD just like the SARS. VIRUSES doesn't need passports to travel. You have heard of the Charles Monet case in the Ebola epidemic, the FAILURE of EBOLA is that it kills it's HOST (humans) too fast and people can detect it and put the rest in CONTAINMENT UNIT. If the Ebola has the slow-killing, far-spreading traits of the Aids VIRUS we would have been extinct.<br><br>Just ASTEROID<br>we can't see them, until today we still can't see them, yes we have powderful Telescopes and SOHO satellite, but a small speedy ones heading from the direction of the sun will be invisible to our telescopes sight. ( don't say i watch too many movies)<br><br>Exponential Growth<br>it is the irreversablility of progress, that goes faster than ever, more factories by the day producing more stuuf clearing MORE oil, trees. population is running high and many people will need many things.<br>In 1800 there were one billion people; in 1930 two billion; 1960, three billion; 1975, four billion; 1987; five billion; and in 1998, six, billion. And do u know that there are fifty quadrillion transistors are produced, more than SIX MILLION FOR EVERY HUMAN on the planet. (no shit). Why is this happening?? where is this "more" coming from?? More have been busy and have come to expect nothing less.<br><br>ET<br>Who know what they are thinking?? they must be up to something no good flying all over our skies. And it's really STUPID to think we r the only one in this UNIVERSE (Christians hush...)<br>talking about ET i got a set of alien badges of 12. really neat, interested e-mail me. going off at S$100, collectors item. plastic and steel all have.<br><br>The Bush's wars are good for the future generations, if he doesn't do it, someone else will. He UNITES the world. Look at united China, economically prosperous, look at big Africa, separated and filled with guerilla factions and rebels whatever u call them. and u they cut off people's limbs and sell them to voodoo magic master for a good price, a dead man's hand on a shop's window means good business. DISUNIFICATION looks like Africa, looks like North and South Korea, looks like shit.  Bush is not hitler, he doesn't occupy. Bush is a hero. You will witness the start of the unification of democracy, War in Iraq. Bush is mother nature's prescription for unification, Saddamn is the disease, Kimmy is the disease. In order to save diabetes patients, their limbs have to be cut off to save them, the same to planet earth, people have to die in wars and sacrifice to kill off the diseases. You don't have to pity the north korean commies, they happened to be born at the wrong time with the wrong ideas. and they are really stupid people, they launch a empty warhead into Atlanta, giving the U.S a damning reason to invade them. Bush is a prophet.<br><br>P/S: i am not a crank, please do not ban me.<br><br>DISLCLAIMER:<br>i am really sorry for the caps because i am afraid the nerds can't see them, and nerds have really big glasses. I try to keep it simple and use coffeeshop language. And sorry for the strong language.<br>There is many typos and slightly distorted facts in my post. i would have carried this to the Speaker's Corner near Chinatown but there's no chairs for me to sit and the babes would see me as a nerd and really pai seh. i am really shy and innocent, please don't hurt me.<br></div>
