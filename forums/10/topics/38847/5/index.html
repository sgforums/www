            <div class='col-md body'>I want to point out 2 of the "questions".<br><br>It is easy to ask questions that will skew opinion.<br><br>It's like a question: "what is the percentage of terror groups who claim to be "Islamic?" will skew opinion.<br><br>Perhaps it is more pertinent to ask this question:<br><br>If Iraq has WMD, between the US and Iraq, who would be more willing to use them?  Considering the last time nuke were used, it was in the middle of a World War almost 60 years ago.<br><br>The question is about NOW.  Has the world forgotten Saddam used chems on women and children when they were asleep in their village?  And where is the woman Dr. Germs?<br><br>Then, what MLK said... I have more to add... the moment we do not challenge those who would defend evil with liberal nonsense, evil has won.<br><br>Not to say that Dubbya went to this war with the best intentions, but this is something waiting to happen.  Mayhap if Dubbya didn't do anything and Saddam gave a few vials of Plague to terrorists, the same people who wrote that liberal nonsense would be demanding why Dubbya didn't do anything.<br><br>Who knows?<br><br>Right now, just pray for the war to end quickly with the ouster of Saddam.  And that the US do the right thing by helping rebuild the place without Cheney's cronies getting all the contracts.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">Just forwarding something I have read...

            <div class='col-md body'>Then the question is, Does Iraq has any weopons of mass destruction ? Up till now, no one gives us any concrete proof that he has it. If one doesn't have one, one can't use it. Please consider the last nuke is used by US.<br><br>And as I always say, they did used gas to kill 5000 people before. However that reason can only be used for a war, not 2 ! They used tat as an excuse to fight the war 10 years ago. BTW US killed 35000 people then. It killed 35000 people to revenge 5000 people. Is tat a good logic ? NOw u wanna kill 35000+++ for wat ?<br><br>US wants war to have the oil. Or he wants to do wat his father hasn't finished.Tat is it. Do u have any proof tat Saddam sent vials of plague to other countires ? If not, please don't assume.<br><br>If u find tat we r too soft with Saddam, then u r also suggesting tat the law is too soft to criminals too. The UN system works like legistrative system. The only problem to international law is there isn't any police to enforce international laws especially to bullies with powerful military might.<br><br>Why support US so much till doing things tat is unfair to Russia ? I support Russia to take back all the oil fields tat he had lost after the war. If US take them, tat means it really is going after the oil.</div>
