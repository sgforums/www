Even if Bush is some freemasonry worshipper he'll have to go through the congress, which he is doing now. People with qualification to go into congress must be qualified and not so naive to worship such stuff. Even amazing will be the whole congress is made up of freemasoners whatever u call it.</div>

US is no angel, but that doesn't mean they are THAT shallow... risking the lives of his people and intergrity, just for things they can take but almost impossible to keep?<br><br>down with the killings of civilians and soldiers, that's nonsense people... do you guys have any idea how many people were actually killed by Saddam Hussein during his reign.. for those of you who don't actually know how many people were killed, let me enlighten your ignorant selves... it's 2 MILLION... that the number of people who were killed over his decade of ruling...<br><br>families are killed if they don't comply to him.. families as in young and old, from the newborn babies to fibble grandparents... poison gas were let off to the kurds killing thousands each time...<br><br>on the topic of WMD.... why keep comparing Bush with Saddam when it's 2 different stories... Why would Bush use the WMD on us? Why dig into their national reserves to start a world if it meant nothing... or do you guys think that it's just the start of a plot for world domination? who in the right mind would do that? i don't think anyone in this world has the ability to pull that off...<br><br>more on the WMD.... US tests their weapons in seas and in deserts... and where does Saddam Hussein test his weapons? in a desert yes, away from civilization ? the answer is a big NO... do you guys have any idea how many people were killed during his ruthless weapons test.. how do you compare that with Bush? you don't see Bush going around testing the weapons at the expense of his people?<br><br>people talk about killing of people in the war... from what i mentioned in a previous post, death is inevitable in this war... but was is a death toll of 2 million people compared to a little death which wasn't even meant to be in this war... would you prefer having a continual increasing death toll, courtesy of Saddam's rule, or would it be better to suffer a little and put an end to all the killings...<br><br>what stands do we have to protest the war? do we live there? we have totally no idea how the living conditions are over there... you guys might argue that i have no idea myself too, but people, although i dun really have, but i have seen and heard things that voice the feelings of the Iraqis and i still feel strongly about the war.. Saddam muz be brought down....<br><br>if you guys are still not convinced, here's a link to an extract of a talk show... maybe you might just change your views after listening to it...<br><br>http://komo1000news.com/audio/kvi_aircheck_031003.mp3<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>Author: Chryssler Lords Amberlin (219.93.64.---)<br>Date:   03-26-03 12:22<br><br>egoman,<br>I am going to tell you that this war is not what it seems to be.<br><br>Since you know more about history, let me counter your argument and you correct me back ok? Deal?<br><br>~Your 2 million death is alittle misleading and incomplete. Have you include casualties of Iraq-Iran war? If Singapore can react so angrily over a small pile of rocks that is of course have its importance, imagine a big chunks of land in dispute claimed by your neighbour! Saddam go to war with Iran over border dispute. Case close.<br><br>~Poison gas on Kurds. If Abraham Lincoln justified his case as to prevent separation of north and south and endorse a civil war, why can't Saddam prevent separation of northern Iraq by Kurds rebels? The poison gas was actually meant to be dealt against Iran in a town called Halabja....I forgot the exact name. After the war with Iran, they have amassed some US$80 billion in debt! Met with revolt in the north, Saddam felt desperate and poison gas was used to suppress revolt.<br><br>~Then invade Kuwait, a territory cutout by the British and made independence. For oil I suppose. The world reacted quickly and oust Saddam forces out. In just 39 days, more than 200,000 Iraqi people died. Have you include this figure to your 2 million deaths?<br><br>In fact, you should have remained neutral. Bush campaign and propaganda is so successful that many believed in this perceived threat. JI and Al-Qaeda is a totally different issue. Why would you believe Bush accounts of Saddam funding JI and Al-Qaeda? Please tell me what Bush said. I will read your side of the story and reply back to you.<br><br>If you are so concerned with 2 million Iraqi deaths, then tell me how many deaths caused by Osama in the World Trade Centre? Shall we count death toll in this war as well - Gulf War 2? If Bush is forced to engage this war, then Saddam too is forced to engage war with Iran.<br><br>Kuwait case is closed. Don't exploit this matter. So is the Kurds. They are safe. They even surf internet! Don't be misleaded by what you see. The people who supports US coalition 2 weeks ago today disgruntle with US coalition. Facts and distortion. Its a horrible thing of today's world. US has Weapons of Mass Distortion and Weapons of Mass Distraction campaign. Keep that in mind.<br></blockquote></div>

U r trying to say tat US attack not because of WMD, he is lying about everything, including liberation of Iraq and his true aim is to conquer the world. Iraq is just the second step while Afghan is the first. Soon they will attack British, China, Russia and of course Singapore and sparking off WWIII. Billions of people will be killed. If Human or Earth ever survive after the nuclear bombs, all Caucasians will be made first class citizen, the rest of the races second class. We will all lived under the iron arm of US as they still trying to instill discipline. How about Muslims ? They probably all killed or forced to convert.  Wat about our culture ? All gone, the only culture left is the American culture.<br><br>R u against the war or for the war ? R u trying to be sarcastic ?<br></div>
