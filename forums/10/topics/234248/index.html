            <div class='col-md body'>Concrete price soars after sand ban. Are suppliers taking advantage?<br>Where's my CONCRETE?<br>By Teh Jen Lee<br><br>January 28, 2007<br><br>IN just one afternoon, he lost close to $1,000 because his order of concrete was not delivered.<br><br>-- MOHD ISHAK<br>Worse, the price of concrete had shot up by more than 50 per cent overnight - from $75 per cubic metre to $115.<br><br>The $40 increase means he has to pay $40,000 more for the 1,000 cubic metres of grade-30 concrete that he needs to complete his project.<br><br>And he has to pay cash, instead of having credit, like he did in the past.<br><br>Contractors like him have been hit hard by Indonesia's ban on sand exports which took effect from Tuesday.<br><br>Authorities here have said the booming construction industry will not be affected.<br><br>But some contractors are wondering whether some concrete suppliers are trying to profit from the situation.<br><br>One contractor, who declined to be named because he was afraid of offending the concrete suppliers, said: 'I had rented a crane specially to move concrete and I had about 10 men on hand to work, but with no concrete on Thursday, we couldn't do anything.<br><br>'The crane cost more than $200, my manpower cost was more than $500. Altogether the afternoon cost me about $1,000, but I have nothing to show for it.'<br><br>Mr Tony Goh (below), a clerk-of-works in his 50s who is involved in the contractor's project, called The New Paper to highlight his plight.<br><br>'I know the price will increase but there's no justification for supply to stop so suddenly without warning,' he said.<br><br>Another contractor estimates that he may have to pay $100,000 more for the 2,500 cubic metres of concrete that he needs. 'I just started my project last month and it's scheduled to finish at the end of this year. My contract has no fluctuation clauses to take into account price changes,' said the 43-year-old, who gave his name as Phillip.<br><br>Concrete suppliers contacted by The New Paper did not deny that some suppliers may try to profit from the situation.<br><br>SUPPLIERS HIT TOO<br><br>But they said that they were also feeling the pinch from the limited sand supply.<br><br>One supplier said alternatives to sand are only feasible if they are available in large quantities. (See other report.)<br><br>He said: 'We are badly affected because our sand supply has been greatly reduced. We require 50 loads, but we only get 10 to 20 so we can't fulfil all our clients' needs.<br><br>'We have to do rationing and go on a first-come-first-serve basis. Everyone gets a bit so that some work can be done.'<br><br>How about the contractor who could not get any concrete on Thursday afternoon?<br><br>The supplier said: 'The situation caught a lot of us by surprise. Many contractors who have concrete casting later in the day couldn't get any concrete.'<br><br>Dr Sujit Ghosh, president of the Ready-Mixed Concrete Association of Singapore, explained that many concrete suppliers normally have enough sand in their premises to last only a few hours.<br><br>'We are used to getting constant replenishment, but now the price and supply situation remains volatile.<br><br>'So we have to manage our little bit of sand stock.'<br><br>He knows of companies who are cutting output by up to 50 per cent because of the uncertainties in sand supply.<br><br>He said that there is some speculation happening now because 'it is an unusual situation and people don't know what to do about it'.<br><br>For now, the industry is waiting for the mechanism of release from the government's strategic stockpile and for the price of sand to be determined.<br><br>Dr Ghosh said: 'Until that happens, concrete suppliers can't come to grips with the sand ban so they raise prices and control supply carefully so as not to deplete their sand stock.<br><br>'We feel this situation is going to stop quite soon, but we just don't know when.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>No sand? Use ash or...<br><br>ASH and granite dust can be used to replace sand in concrete mixtures, according to Mr Tony Goh, who has been in construction for over 30 years.<br><br>But such materials will be needed in large quantities.<br><br>As for switching to non-concrete components like steel and granite pile, these will be applicable to projects that are still in the planning stage.<br><br>The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) said many residential projects are now using dry walls instead of concrete or brick walls.<br><br>Besides this, BCA is encouraging more extensive use of steel - now more common for high-rise building structures - for all types of buildings.<br><br>Mr Goh said: 'Some amount of concrete will still be required but it will be a lot less. For example, you can have metal decks with a thin layer of cement in place of thick concrete floors.<br><br>'Steel supply can be diversified more easily, unlike sand.'<br><br>However, as these materials will cost more, the contractors will have to take this into account when bidding for projects.<br><br>In the long run, these materials will be beneficial because they reduce construction time and projects will require fewer unskilled foreign workers on site, said Mr Goh.<br><br>'In the US, they use a lot of dry walls or plaster cement boards for internal partition walls. This omits brick walls and concrete plastering, which will speed things up.'<br><br>Meanwhile, according to reports, Indonesia imposed the ban for environmental reasons.<br><br>Another reason was to protect Indonesia's borders although the inland mining of land sand, which is different from sea sand that is used in reclamation works, does not have any effect on territorial borders.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The BCA case alot like the AVA case, I thought BCA said they have a large stockpile of sand.<br><br>"At the same time, we also have quite a sizeable sand stockpile, and we are prepared to release the stockpile to meet the immediate needs of the industry. It is very important for us to move away from such high dependency on sand import in construction work. We've been discussing with the industry trying to persuade them to move towards a more sustainable form of construction like the use of steel structure, the use of dry construction," said Dr John Keung, Chief Executive Officer, Building and Construction Authority.<br><br>KNN, nowadays their words cannot be trusted.</div>
