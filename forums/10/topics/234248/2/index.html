I think its stupid to suggest using more steel. </div></blockquote>Nope. Although steel is more expensive to use, it is easier and less labour intensive as compared to reinforce concrete. You need to employ skilled labour to cast the concrete and plaster it afterwards. Using steel eliminates all these. If a building is designed with steel reinforcement rather than reinforced concrete, the project can easily be completed 4-12 months earlier. And the developer would rather have the project completed earlier so as to start charging rent as soon as possible.</div>

Also, steel can be recycled from old material or even demolished buildings... making some the cost recoverable. Concrete can't be readily recycled.<br><br>Also it's not as if we are going to totally stop using sand... but the idea is to reduce where it can be reduced. Obviously for the critical apps that require RC, they are still going to use it. It's not as if we're going to build from 100 percent steel... if your roof does not need to bear 100 tons of weight... why use concrete now that you have a sand shortage?</div>
