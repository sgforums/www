It is a finely-ground powder produced by grinding Portland cement clinker (more than 90%), a maximum of about 5% gypsum which controls the set time, and up to 5% minor constituents (as allowed by various standards). As defined by the European Standard EN197.1, Portland cement clinker is a hydraulic material which shall consist of at least two-thirds by mass of calcium silicates (3CaO.SiO2 and 2CaO.SiO2), the remainder consisting of aluminium- and iron-containing clinker phases and other compounds. The ratio of CaO to SiO2 shall not be less than 2.0. The magnesium content (MgO) shall not exceed 5.0% by mass. (The last two requirements were already set out in the German Standard, issued in 1909). Portland cement clinker is made by heating, in a kiln, an homogenous mixture of raw materials to a sintering temperature, which is about 1450 Â°C for modern cements. The aluminium oxide and iron oxide are present as a flux and contribute little to the strength. For special cements, such as Low Heat (LH) and Sulfate Resistance (SR), it is necessary to limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate (3CaO.Al2O3) formed. The major raw material for the clinker-making is limestone (CaCO3). Normally, an impure limestone which contains SiO2 is used - the CaCO3 content can be as low as 80%. Secondary raw materials depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the secondary raw materials used are: clay, shale, sand, iron ore, bauxite, fly ash and slag. When a cement kiln is fired by coal, the ash of the coal becomes a secondary raw material.<br><br>Do you know concrete means?<br><br>Concrete is a construction material that consists, in its most common form, of <strong>Portland cement</strong>, aggregate (generally gravel and sand) and water.<br><br>F U C K You!!!!</div>
