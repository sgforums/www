We normal law abidding people have difficulty securing a job and have to work fairly hard to get a roof ... are these people living off my tax dollar in prison are gonna come out and think we are Happy land and we forgive their offense plus hand them money freely to sit in a cosy place.<br>Employers need to give them a chance. So does the govt - I used to work for a certain agency who refused to subcon furniture purchase to a company cause the employees are ex-cons.<br>However, these ex-offenders must also not think life is easy outside. They need to be counselled and taught about the harsh reality of any normal working person outside. Because some of these people think they are the only ones who are suffering and no one gave them a chance so they do crime to get easy money - ie the world owes them a living. The stupid campaign is not addressing the real issues but is again using some stupid commercial propaganda to push the sale of some meaningless ribbons.<br><br></div>

I am not very sure about the civil service in other country stance on hiring ex-convicts. My guess is that it should more or less be the same.<br>Despite having said that, I would still prefer the government to do more to help these ex-convicts beside the on-going yellow ribbon campaign. Perhape the prison service side can do their part by writing referral letters, WDA can also do their part by securing or recommending jobs for them. By the way, I think I read it somewhere whereby the police plan to erase off the criminal record for trival offender. Don't know whether this have been implemented yet. Indeed, this will prove to be a joyous move, to be able to give offender who committed crime at a spite of moment a second chance in life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
