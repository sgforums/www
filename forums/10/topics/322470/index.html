                                    Kan Seng</em><br> <strong>Unprecedented pressures</strong><br> Not all is right with the ministry he heads after a series 
                                    of glaring blunders. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br> June 28, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One 
                                    of the most hard-pressed leaders in Singapore today is probably 
                                    Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng, who heads the police 
                                    force.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    an unusual spot for Wong, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, 
                                    to be in. In fact, no minister in charge of security in 
                                    this city has been subjected to the kind of pressure that 
                                    he is facing now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There 
                                    is a reason for it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Since 
                                    colonial days, Singapore’s police force has had a 
                                    global reputation for its no-nonsense efficiency and discipline.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">For 
                                    Wong, the trouble started early this year when terrorist 
                                    leader Mas Selamat Kastari escaped from the high-detention 
                                    centre by climbing out through a toilet window.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Government 
                                    leaders, including Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, blamed 
                                    it on “complacency” at the lower ranks, but 
                                    not the minister.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Since 
                                    then, there has been a series of other high profile mistakes, 
                                    including: -</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>* 
                                    Two detainees</strong> escaping from a court lock-up after 
                                    beating up a policeman who was bringing water to one of 
                                    them. Both were subsequently caught. A breach of procedure 
                                    was blamed;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>* 
                                    In a rare display</strong> of indiscipline, Gurkhas attached 
                                    to the police clashed over a wage dispute two weeks ago, 
                                    resulting in eight being injured.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">They 
                                    are part of a 2,000-strong Gurkha contingent which plays 
                                    a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive areas, including 
                                    the Istana (the president's official residence), embassies, 
                                    airports and strategic industries;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>* 
                                    A few days ago</strong>, another blunder left a hole in 
                                    Changi Airport’s high-security image. A retiree, who 
                                    had mistakenly taken his son's passport, was allowed to 
                                    enter the restricted passenger's area after getting past 
                                    the check-in counter and the police stationed outside the 
                                    departure lounge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">At the 
                                    immigration counter, Ang Heng Soon repeatedly failed to 
                                    scan his fingerprint at the machine. He was directed to 
                                    an officer, who – unbelievably – waved him on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Upon 
                                    reaching Ho Chi Minh City airport, he headed directly to 
                                    immigration authorities, who put him on the same plane back 
                                    to Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“I 
                                    am totally appalled and flabbergasted at this slip-up at 
                                    the airport checkpoint,” said Wong, who promised to 
                                    take action against the staff responsible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">All 
                                    these indicate to Singaporeans that not all is right with 
                                    the no-nonsense Home Affairs Ministry, the frontline body 
                                    that overlooks security, including the war on terrorism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    public has called for the minister to be held accountable 
                                    for his “complacency”, which has been rejected 
                                    by the Prime Minister. Some wanted him dismissed, while 
                                    other said his salary should be docked as punishment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“The 
                                    Home Minister is losing control of his internal and external 
                                    security team in Singapore,” writer Koh Poh Chin said. 
                                    “This is a wake-up call. Our leaders should take a 
                                    step back and see what has gone wrong.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A leader 
                                    who passes the blame to his subordinates when things go 
                                    wrong cannot serve the country, he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">People 
                                    expect security procedures to be tightened, but not everyone 
                                    is certain that Wong is the right person to inspire a real 
                                    shake-up. To be fair, the police are facing a new dimension 
                                    in an ever-expanding island-state.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Since 
                                    September 11, it has had to meet the threat of a terror 
                                    war in an overcrowded island whose residential population 
                                    is continuing to grow by leaps and bounds. A million foreigners 
                                    are now working here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">To be 
                                    sure the force has increased, but so have the tasks it has 
                                    to keep Singapore safe. They have also become more demanding, 
                                    ranging from computer scams to complex white-collar crimes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Twelve 
                                    years ago the ratio of police to population was 350 to every 
                                    100,000 people. In 2006, it had fallen to 205 to 100,000.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There 
                                    are also fewer policemen on street beat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Peter 
                                    J. Arnold wrote: “I wonder what has happened to our 
                                    policemen who seem to have become invisible.” He said 
                                    that a visible police presence was a proven deterrent to 
                                    crime.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">More 
                                    worrying to the public is that, for some time now, the police 
                                    have been refusing to take action in assault cases unless 
                                    there are severe injuries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    victims are instead told to seek justice at the court.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When 
                                    design executive Kong Lai Meng landed in hospital after 
                                    being attacked, she was told by the police to file a magistrate’s 
                                    complaint at the Subordinate Courts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“So 
                                    anyone can just hit someone and not be arrested? I want 
                                    to see some justice done,” the 35-year-old angrily 
                                    said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“What 
                                    kind of message are the police sending to people such as 
                                    the individual who assaulted me?” she asked.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Hers 
                                    is just one of several cases, and it is clearly worrying 
                                    Singaporeans who look upon the police for protection against 
                                    public assaults.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Apparently 
                                    to lessen police workload, the government has passed laws 
                                    to allow soldiers to conduct civilian security operations. 
                                    They are deployed to help provide security at major events 
                                    and will have the power to search, detain and use force 
                                    against suspicious people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Despite 
                                    the recent downturn, the police here remain a credible force.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Research 
                                    firm Political and Economic Risk Consultancy ranked Singapore, 
                                    the United States and Hong Kong as the top three of 12 countries 
                                    on the quality of their police and judicial systems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    a reputation that the 38,000-strong force here, following 
                                    recent developments, will have to fight hard to retain.</span></p>
              <p>i think the 2 escape and father-son-passport cases showed the authorities were complacent rather than short-handed.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This must be a very unusual Sunday morning for the tripwire - after a bad night out being tripped ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Your suggestion at closing TTSH may well come true - when the 'First Lady' should take her final trip - after 'The First Family' trip over your idea - as so far there must be quite a few cadavers in the coldroom at TTSH.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This must be the time of the month when the tripwire makes his regular burst into pompous prominence in the Speakers' Corner - shooting out of the dark in a burst of light, burning like a meteor and leaving a trail of useless dust - only to peter out like a dying star.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Expressions of frustrations will only cloud your vision - can you see through the trail of your own star dust that you have kicked up ?</span></p>
