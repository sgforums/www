            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes cannot judge by appearance nia, teachers cannot bully people meh? It's sometimes that someone who thinks too highly of themselves and wants to win them as they think they so superior to others (a.k.a self proclaimation of genius)<br>that's why some cases like this happens to almost everywhere in the world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But why my some of mature frens say they were supposedly abused unfairly? I think school system has gone to two extremes. One too strict, the other too lax. But what if only, what if something like this really happen now? I thank God for so many Christian teachers here. I also owe it to many Christian teachers that i am still here in one piece. God bless them all!</div>

Just some humour. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I still think a certain amt of discipline is needed bcos without any discipline, ppl wont learn as well &amp; they might become distracted or lose focus. Then they go day dreaming or talking among themselves or worse, start throwing chalk or chairs.
