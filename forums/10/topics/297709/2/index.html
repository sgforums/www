It's there as a compensation for parking the money in the bank while inflation makes it worth less.<br><br>When the interest rate is so much lower than the inflation rate, the correct thing to do is to take it out of the bank to invest in a more profitable vehicle. This is, in a way also "saving".<br><br>If you were to take this line of backwards logic, I could just as easily point out that since cost of living has gone up, there is more incentive than ever to save(as opposed to spending), since it costs so much to spend money.</div>

I'm not planning to sell my house. Not in 5 years..... not even in 10-15 years. Why u may ask.... because a 4 Room is enough for me and my family. I don't buy a HDB to 'Invest'...... I buy one to have a HOME.People who buy and sell their unit to 'earn' some cash like changing underwear is basicly getting themselves in trouble.<br><br><strong>If your present unit can sell at a high price, it simply means that the unit you buy next will be similar high in price...... U at the same time restart your loan from HDB or the Bank. And since most of us only get older and not younger...... you will have less numbers of years to repay your loan..... therefore, higher monthly payment.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">The problem is when S'porean sees others cashing in on their unit and 'earning' $50-$70K in cash each..... they want to join in. Not thinking that instead of only needing to pay till they are 55...... now the loan won't end till they are 65.  Theres already enough ppl at my work place having this problem that I learn not to join them.  </span><br><br>So now, instead of mthly payment of $700-1K like my friends.....

            <div class='col-md body'>Now 4rm resale r asking for 300k at places like Sengkang. The point here why ppl get stuck financially is bcos they din c the interest behind the loan, that is the 1 dat many ppl being caught off after selling their house. Car interest is in $6-$10k thing but housing is of $50k-$200k kind of range.<br><br>To a couple 1k per mth mean 500 each, which to them is still can manage. 1 thing is u will buy high and sell high, so look no diff to me.</div>
