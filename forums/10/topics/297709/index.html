You have to buy a health insurance, and for students, it is already 52 euros a month (you can imagine for adults). This insurance makes visiting the doctor free... However, you still have to pay for the medicine.

If the people condone this, soon there will be molotov cocktails hurled at govt buildings or worse.<br><br>The problem with the masses is that they still fall for the carrots and 'freebies' handed out prior to each election; somehow, the perennial amnesia of past actions continues to plague our short-sighted people when they don't realise the power of their vote.<br><br>Addressing the chorus of disapproval concerning the mega-increases of top civil servants including ministers, LKY retorted: Singaporeans deserve a dose of incompetent leadership!<br><br>What he said is very true: we should give our vote to newbies and let them take up the mantel of leadership. There is never such a thing as absolute readiness; this applies appropriately to new leadership including the MIW. Losing 3-4 GRCs will surely knock their socks off, and a few ministers may just lose their jobs. Then again, the MIW keep insisting their ranks come highly qualified, so high that dozens of MNCs and top private sector companies are lining up just to hire them, therefore it justifies their 2-tier salary adjustments.<br><br>The problem is with the people who walk with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eyes wide shut</span>.

There is never such a thing as absolute readiness; this applies appropriately to new leadership including the MIW. Losing 3-4 GRCs will surely knock their socks off, and a few ministers may just lose their jobs. Then again, the MIW keep insisting their ranks come highly qualified, so high that dozens of MNCs and top private sector companies are lining up just to hire them, therefore it justifies their 2-tier salary adjustments.<br><br>The problem is with the people who walk with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eyes wide shut</span>.
