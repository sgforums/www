How many CCTV do you need to install in order us to monitor and trace any person in &amp; out of the block? 4, 5, 6 or more CCTV. How effective are they for us to trace if they walk in by wearing a big jacketÂ…. or gray areas?<br><br>2. If someone really want to attack any block, do they need to carry the bomb &amp; bring them into any HDB block, or all they need to do is just park their vehicles beside any block while people are picking up their children from school?<br><br>3. It is the duty of our officers not to have any bomb in the hands of wrong people, or to open windows for terrorist to bring in bomb. Installing CCTV in HDB blocks, the whole idea is a simple &amp; stupid one. It is okay if they want to do something stupid, but now they are asking poor Singaporeans to pay up for their stupidity.<br><br>Singaporeans is not naive or bo chap, it is because they simply not interested in any monkey show.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Silly idea. The costs of installing these things should be borne entirely by the government simply because we are already paying taxes, and it is the JOB of the government to use the money collected to adequately ensure our safety. If there is not enough money (?!?!), then somebody is not doing their job properly.<br><br>Maybe our taxes should be pegged to the amount of government services we actually use and we should received a clearly itemised tax bill each month instead....<br><br>Edit: i use the term 'we' loosely because as a poor student, i am not actually contributing much in tax terms to the  governemnt. I am sure there are many other such leechers posting here.</div>

From a global view point, Singapore is seen as a sort of "fortress of security" in Asia.   If they can attack Singapore and cause panic and destruction here, it will be a huge sign to the rest of Asia that nowhere is safe.    This alone is a huge carrot being waved in the eyes of terrorists... The government has little choice but to align themselves with US and Britain to fight this.<br><br>...transfering this costs back to us (again), when we're already paying all sorts of taxes which they siphon off into their pockets "legally" through their ridiculous pay packages.. That I disagree with!!!<br><br>Just my 2 cents...</div>
