The school serves first as an institution of learning and then one of imparting values. The primary source of moral values should come from the parents themselves.

            <div class='col-md body'>All in all it is the teachers who are to be blamed. We are paying them so much through taxes. The best they can do is to import proper moral values to our children. Unfortunately this is not so. Our teachers are generally too corrupted to do anything. They are conly concerned about their own well being and just aim to go home after half a day's work to give tuition to earn more money. The child spends most of his time in school and teachers should STAY IN SCHOOL to provide holistic development to the child. However, even if they are willing to do so, their moral values are really seriously in doubt to help bring up our children properly. It really sickens my heart when I see children of today not given proper guidance and society and teachers in particular blaming the children on their own incompetance.

Using corporal punishment now may be no use. Students are more outspoken and straightforward, if u try to punish them they will feel indignant and more hate and maybe commit more hate crimes. In the past, students more submissive mah, tell me u really want to students to be submissive, to be told what to do? u wanna let them be suppressed?

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm with teachers on this one.<br><br>With all the rulings and legislations being laid down by MOE, can we truly blame teachers for not instilling the right kind of discipline in students? Bogged down by meetings, school functions, the insistence that plenty of remedial classes must be conducted for 'weaker' students, preparing plenty of worksheets to 'improve' results etc etc, one can understand that the average teacher does not have even the slightest time worrying abt discipline.<br><br>The fact that all these regulations are being handed down by many within the administration who have never even set foot in a classsroom as a teacher is disturbing.<br><br>Who are these insufferable self-proclaimed know-it-alls who think they know how to run a school? With the policy of 'fast-movers' within MOE who promote 'scholarly' individuals for advancement, it seems many have forgotten that teaching is a passion first and a career second. As with all civil institutions, the scholars in MOE have been given the red carpet treatment. Many principals who are designated 'fast-movers' have let their careers get in the way of education. As with the NKF debacle, it is the students who ultimately suffer and not these 'administrators'.<br><br>In recent years, too much accountability has been placed on teachers such that they are no longer being afforded equivalent pay for the amount of load they are heaped with.<br><br>Shouldn't they be placed on the list of super scale salaries as well? Granting that in educating our youths of tomorrow, they are arguably performing a form of public service?<br><br>Let's not get carried away by blaming schools for everything. Discipline starts at home.<br><br>Period.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nowadays, our MOE like to coined with the in-the-air concepts that Creative Educations and Education Service Providers. These concepts simply does not work all the time. There had been many reports that school kids are now more worse than what we have seen in 1980s - 1990s. There had been few incidents that students challenged male teacher to one-on-one duel. Some teenage girls even accused their teachers or principles for modlesting them, but later these girls are found kissing and hugging at the void decks.<br><br>A country good fortune is closely linked to her people working ability and attitudes. In korea, the country still maintain the strict no-nonsense education system, and they are now more successful in R&amp;D and technological sector  than Singapore. Their korean scientist even reported some shocking breakthrough in their cloning effort few months ago. That is the product of good discipline in school.<br><br>Looking ahead at our roller coaster economical cycles, I am really worried when these new gen of singaporeans start working in the society. No wonder gov is opening some many places for the foregin talents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As quoted earlier......<br><br>All in all it is the teachers who are to be blamed. We are paying them so much through taxes. The best they can do is to import proper moral values to our children. Unfortunately this is not so. Our teachers are generally too corrupted to do anything. They are conly concerned about their own well being and just aim to go home after half a day's work to give tuition to earn more money.

Shame on you teachers<br><br>______________________________________________________________<br><br>I have a question for you:<br><br>If your child is not behaving well in the lift packed with strangers, he/ she is just yelling at the top of his/her voice. A stranger just stepped out and give your child a tight slap to shut him/her up.<br><br>Do you agree on this scenerio?<br><br>If you dun agree, how can you ask the teacher to give your kids their guidence?? It is like swimming in the open seas with 2 hand tied behind...pls try to understand the plight of a teacher.<br><br>Anyway, most new / young teacher with less than 5 years experience are not learning more than 3K for female, 3.5K for male. No OT pay, no transport allowance. Their working hour is very very long, why? Need to bring the students for perfrormance...competitions and even stay up to 9pm in school to give tutition class in school for the O levels / N levels students in sept - oct period. But are the students coming really for study?? Don't forget the teacher also need to mark worksheets, come out with lesson plans, study material, photocopying notes, exam papers....many many more.<br><br>I worked as a part time teacher before, seen too many of these things, thus I decided to move on rather than take up teaching career. I salute to the people who take up the teaching jobs, but once again, I agreed that there are black sheeps in teaching community as well.<br><br>______________________________________________________________</div>
