              <p><em>An economic system does not have to be expansive—that is,
              constantly increasing its production of wealth—<strong>and it might well be
              possible for people to be completely happy in a non-expansive economic
              system if they were accustomed to it.</strong> In the twentieth century,
              however, the people of our culture have been living under expansive
              conditions for generations. <strong>Their minds are psychologically adjusted to
              expansion, and they feel deeply frustrated unless they are better off
              each year than they were the preceding year. </strong>The economic system itself
              has become organized for expansion, and if it does not expand it tends
              to collapse.</em></p>
              <p><em>The basic reason for this maladjustment is that<strong> investment has become an essential part of the system, and if
              investment falls off, consumers have insufficient incomes to buy the
              consumers' goods </strong>which are being produced in another part of the system
              because part of the flow of<strong> purchasing power created by the production
              of goods was diverted from purchasing the goods it had produced into
              savings, and all the goods produced could not be sold until those
              savings came back into the market by being invested.</strong> In the system as a
              whole, everyone sought to improve his own position in the short run,
              but this jeopardized the functioning of the system in the long run. The
              contrast here is not merely between the individual and the system, but
              also between the long run and the short run...</em></p>
              <p><a href="http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/11.html#31">http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/11.html#31</a></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>...The third notable feature of the whole development is closely
              related to this special nature of capitalism. <strong>Capitalism provides very
              powerful motivations for economic activity because it associates
              economic motivations so closely with self-interest.</strong> But this same
              feature, which is a source of strength in providing economic motivation
              through the pursuit of profits, is also a source of weakness owing to
              the fact that so self-centered a motivation contributes very readily to
              a loss of economic coordination. <strong>Each individual, just because he is so
              powerfully motivated by self-interest, easily loses sight of the role
              which his own activities play in the economic system as a whole, and
              tends to act as if his activities were the whole, with
              inevitable injury to that whole. </strong>We could indicate this by pointing out
              that capitalism, because it seeks profits as its primary goal, <strong>is never
              primarily seeking to achieve prosperity, high production, high
              consumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral uplift.</strong> Any of these may be achieved under capitalism, and any (or all) of them
              may he sacrificed and lost under capitalism, depending on this
              relationship to the primary goal of capitalist activity—the pursuit of
              profits. During the nine-hundred-year history of capitalism, it has, at
              various times, contributed both to the achievement and <strong>to the
              destruction of these other social goals...</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em> ...In the course of time the central fact of the developing economic
              system, <strong>the relationship between goods and money, became clear, at
              least to bankers. </strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong></strong>This relationship, the price system, depended upon
              five things: </em></p>
              <p><em>the supply and the demand for goods, </em></p>
              <p><em>the supply and the
              demand for money, </em></p>
              <p><em>and the speed of exchange between money and goods. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>An
              increase in three of these (demand for goods, supply of money, speed of
              circulation) would move the prices of goods up and the value of money
              down.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em> This inflation was objectionable to bankers, although desirable
              to producers and merchants. </em></p>
              <p><em><strong>On the other hand, a decrease in the same
              three items would be deflationary and would please bankers, worry
              producers and merchants, and delight consumers (who obtained more goods
              for less money). The other factors worked in the opposite direction, so
              that an increase in them (supply of goods, demand for money, and
              slowness of circulation or exchange) would be deflationary.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em> Such changes of prices, either inflationary or deflationary, have
              been major forces in history for the last six centuries at least. Over
              that long period, their power to modify men's lives and human history
              has been increasing. This has been reflected in two ways.<strong> On the one
              hand, rises in prices have generally encouraged increased economic
              activity, especially the production of goods,</strong> while, on the other hand,
              price changes have served to redistribute wealth within the economic
              system...</em></p>

              <p>Stocks of rice is held by importers so they can only control price at NTUC. More interesting how much price rice increase in Carrefour and make a price check. But I believe they make a small profit on top of normal profit + GST of course.</p>
              <p>Singaporean consumption pattern no way to curb inflation. Nasi Lemak, Chicken Rice also price increase. All want to eat Thai rice. I guess this tells the supermarkets that demand (for Thai rice) is relatively inelastic and they can maintain the current price even when supply increases again. </p>
              <p>However I think that  the 3 warehouses full of rice means 3 months of low consumption worth, not normal consumption.</p>

              <p>Price increases because there is high demand. You should not blame the govt. You should blame those who stock up rice unnecessarily. They are the one who drives the demand up and since enveryone wants to make profit (this includes NTUC), they will have to increase the price to make profit and to buffer people from stocking more rice. Consequently, the poor suffer because of the increase in the cost.</p>
              <p>And also, those who trade in commodities and futures also play a part in increase in cost of food.</p>
