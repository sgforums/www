              <p>Sad to say the today of NTUC is no longer the same of yester years NTUC. Nowadays they operate like just any ordinary supermarket whose main aim is to make money. Helping the poor or the average folks is not in their agenda anymore.</p>
              <p>Well, they did mention that they will soon have a no frills supermarket. How cheap will those goods in this so call no frills supermarket is yet to see. Only time will tell.</p>
              <p>Oh, don't be surprise or even be shock if our minisiters' salary will increase too. Their excuse? 'We need them to continue to stay on with us so they can help to solve our current crisis.'</p>

              food prices increases are inevitable. i think there is nothing much we singapore can do since we are at the mercy of food exporters, rising oil prices (which means higher transoportation) and reducing supplies.
              
              I do think that govt can do something about the transportaton cost - can't go any where now without being charged. Are some of the increases really necessary - just count the number of ERP on the route, look at the price of shutter bus 
              
              My hearts goes out to the low income people - don't make enough to eat and travel to work... one-off bonus can't go very far...

              <p>If you study basic economics, you would understand that inflation and price increases come together with economic growth. You want higher salaries? Then you need to accept higher prices.</p>
              <p>What's more important for the government to do now, instead of trying to curtail price increases, would be to increase the poorer Singaporean's real income (that is, income adjusted after inflation) on a longer term basis. They are doing pretty well on the retraining idea, just need to make taxes here less regressive in nature, particularly GST.</p>
              <p>Actually when you complain about increases in food prices, be happy that you aren't starving, unlike people in many other countries. The current food crisis is plunging alot of people back into abject poverty.</p>

              <p>my impression about life is :</p>
              <p>1. Expensive good. Cheap no good. Cheap is a heresy. Good things cannot be cheap. budget air no good, expensive airbus good. nano not good, Lambo good.</p>
              <p>Seems to me, expensive things is good and means progress.</p>
              <p>Also, expensive CEOs good, cheap labor good. Pyramid good. </p>
              <p>Expensive car is good. Expensive road usage is good. Expensive medical is good.</p>
              <p>Expensive world record holders is good. Cheap labor is also good.</p>
              <p>Expensive oil is progress.</p>
              <p>Casino is good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. There is no equality in the sense that no one is born equal. Some with silver spoon some with golden spoon some with diamond and titanium spoon in their mouths. They get headstart in everything and even career planned till their retirement starting from the time they were born. No need to really fight for the position. Just inherit from their fudders uncles. Too Many in this situation will achieve the same if not more.</p>

              <p>3 Months Stocks need to replenish so new stocks = higher prices</p>
              <p>If you hold stocks for 3 months, don't forget to factor in the storage costs. Warehousing is expensive in Singapore and that adds to the cost of rice</p>
              <p>It's not a simple because you bought cheap = cheaper price. Even if you get at a cheap price and you leave it in your warehouse, it might end up more expensive than the current higher market because of storage costs</p>

              The solution is not to complain like this "why like this or like that" only after prices rise unreasonably but to exercise citizens' right and duties to air their views on government's wrongful taxing and hoarding money policies which is the root cause of such problems or at least make the right choice during elections.
              
              Too many people do not know that "they reap what they sow" and if they do not go on consciously promoting active citizenry or democracy others may not do it for them and only looking their own jobs or benefits and they will live to regret their lethargy.
              
              As a people we still have not politically matured to uphold democracy and instead many have been brainwashed into listening to untruths and half-truths without discerning the hypocrisy.
