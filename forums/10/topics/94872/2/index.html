We should be allowed to drive even though the COE is conceived to reduce road congestion. We however do not have homogenous road conditions, hence road usage should fall into a solely ERP-regulated method.<br><br>try this stupid idea of mine <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> : You have damn cheap cars(no COE, no funny taxes and duties), but the road usage is horrendously expensive (so ex that it covers the lost revenue of the above). What will happen? Everyone will drive cars only when they absolutely need it. Sounds good eh? You can buy your Evo8 and gleam it everyday, yet not move an inch. But alas, the downside is that you will end up with choked HDB carparks. I personally like the usage based charges idea. But the only downside is the required number of parking lots..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

I always think to myself....Gosh I am born on this 600+ sq km piece of snot. What can be done to make life better? I do find an increase in GST good. It goes towards a usage based form of charging for goods. No money? Dun buy anything. If basic necessities have to be made more affordable, then lower GST for that class of goods.
