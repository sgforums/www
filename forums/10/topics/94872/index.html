            <div class='col-md body'>this is in line with their "more car owners but lesser car users.".  Frankly i dun care lah, if u need the car, buy it, dun need dun buy. If u need to buy and can afford to buy, just buy it.<br><br>In time to come, what they want to do is that they realise COE is no longer a deterrent to car buying. So they just let you buy lor as many as u want. But they will stop people from driving their cars by increasing road taxes if you wanna drive your car on the road, more gantries, and other stuff lah.<br><br>So in time to come, you will see cheaper COEs and people will start buying cars and then government will increase the taxes to get the car on the road. Do you think the government is totally to blame? No I dun think so.  There are 2 kinds of Singaporeans. One who is bloody rich and cant wait to show off so buy and buy. One who is not bloody rich but is stupid enough to buy and buy because COE is low. So tell me who to blame? If expensive, DUN BUY LAH!</div>

Company can pay for it as well.<br><br>Current cost of owning a car? At least $1000 even if you do not use it. Where is the cost? COE and Taxes.<br><br>Should we reduce those? Yes. Price of car can be easily be a quarter of the current cost if we remove COE and tax.<br><br>Will reducing it cause problem? Yes, increase in car may reduce the speed of the traffic in places where there is traffic.<br><br>Purpose of ERP? To still allow smooth traffic even with the increase in car volume.<br><br>Net cost to car owner? For those going to CBD very frequently, it may increase. For those tho goes regularly, it may just net to zero. For those who goes irregularly or seldom goes to CBD, a much reduce cost?<br><br>(Increase in ERP, reduce in capital cost - you go calculate if it is net gain or loss)<br><br>Net effect.
