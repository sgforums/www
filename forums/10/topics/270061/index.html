With that, it will be difficult to earn money and difficult to finish those boxes of mooncakes.<br><br>Heard from him that around 10-15 policeman went to his office today due to this kind of incident(barter trade<strong>)(not sure about that, maybe due to sabotage), </strong>my uncle was shocked on it and may faced a fine of $40000-$50000.<br><br>I think that it is not worth for him to continue to invest and hang on there, morever he can be now considered as a senior citizen.</div>
