              <em>Singapore Democrats</em><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/Lees/LKYwax.JPG" border="1" alt="" width="150" align="right"><br><br>In
              the recent defamation suit hearing to assess damages, Mr Lee Kuan Yew
              testified in court that the President of the International Bar
              Association (IBA) had written to the Law Society of Singapore praising
              the judiciary here.<br><br>This letter was apparently written following the organisation's annual conference held in Singapore in September last year.<br><br>The following is what Mr Lee said in court:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Your honour, the International Bar Association decided to honour
              Singapore and hold its annual conference in this city and you [Dr Chee]
              were given an opportunity to present your case, with your complaint
              that Singapore lack the rule of law. There were some 3000 lawyers
              there. <br><br>I think they left Singapore with a very different
              impression from what you have projected because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have a letter from
              the President of the International Bar Association to the organisers,</span> namely the Law Society of Singapore, how successful the meeting was and
              how impressed they were by the standards they found to obtain in the
              judiciary - " (<a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-singapore/522-there-is-no-rule-of-law-in-singapore-audio-recording-2a">see here also</a>)</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the IBA has confirmed to the SDP that there was no such letter.
              According to the IBA its president did not write such a letter. The Law
              Society of Singapore has also denied that it has received any such
              letter from the IBA.<br><br>An IBA official said: "If there is another source of this letter, we do not know about it."<br><br>Mr Lee gave this evidence in the witness box during cross-examination by Dr Chee Soon Juan on 27 May 08.<br><br>The SDP will seek legal advice on this latest development.<br><br>In a related matter, Mr Lee's press secretary wrote to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> stating that Dr Chee had called Singapore leaders "murderers, robbers, child molesters" and "rapists" in open court.<br><br>Dr
              Chee clearly said no such thing and has written to the newspaper
              challenging the Minister Mentor to produce the records showing that he
              (Dr Chee) did. (<a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-singapore/566-attacks-by-lee-kuan-yew-getting-weirder-and-weirder">See here</a>).</p>

              <p>LKY called CSJ liar and a few other names in a defamation suit against CSJ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is a rule of law here the court will probably want to stop LKY from such name calling in a defamation suit which main objective is to stop anyone from defaming another without fear or favor treating all as equal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now I am totally surprised that the letter praising the Singapore judiciary for rule of law record introduced in court as evidence to support LKY defamation charge against CSJ may itself be faked as found by IBA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If this is the case, that the IBA letter turns out to be faked then will it be a retrial in the interest of justice and to uphold Singapore reputation for rule of law as contended by LKY in court.</p>

              <p>Dr. Vivian Bala has hibernated for quite a season already probably to make people forget his past failure to deliver results of his portfolio as minister for remaking of Singapore. Has he remade the dirty politics and all the suing of fellow citizens taking part in political process.</p>
              <p>If he has remade Singapore then we will listen to his advice out of respect for good works done.</p>
              <p>Now to remind us he is still the talent so he reappeared after the hiberation for quite a season and said like wiseman that internet will determine politics of the future.</p>
              <p>Very good. This thread in highly political and it is about the future in every word posted.</p>
              <p>If he wants to win few more votes for his non-GRC colleagues he should reply to this IBA faked letter to clear up for his party all the lies or seeming lies told in court in this latest defamation suit against CSJ.</p>
              <p>He should answer a simple question here: Is CSJ entitled to defence of fair comment or bring up issue of public interest in this defamation case.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Breaking news: IBA says it did not send
              letter that LKY testified it did</span></strong></p>
              <p>Wednesday, 02 July 2008 <em>Singapore Democrats</em><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/Lees/LKYwax.JPG" alt="" width="150"><br> <br> In the recent defamation suit hearing to assess damages, Mr Lee
              Kuan Yew testified in court that the President of the International
              Bar Association (IBA) had written to the Law Society of Singapore
              praising the judiciary here.<br> <br> This letter was apparently written following the organisation's
              annual conference held in Singapore in September last year.<br> <br> The following is what Mr Lee said in court:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"Your honour, the International Bar Association decided to
              honour Singapore and hold its annual conference in this city and
              you [Dr Chee] were given an opportunity to present your case, with
              your complaint that Singapore lack the rule of law. There were some
              3000 lawyers there.<br> <br> I think they left Singapore with a very different impression from
              what you have projected because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we have a letter from the President
              of the International Bar Association to the organisers,</span> namely the Law Society of Singapore, how successful the meeting was
              and how impressed they were by the standards they found to obtain
              in the judiciary - " (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-singapore/522-there-is-no-rule-of-law-in-singapore-audio-recording-2a">see here also</a>)</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the IBA has confirmed to the SDP that there was no such
              letter. According to the IBA its president did not write such a
              letter. The Law Society of Singapore has also denied that it has
              received any such letter from the IBA.<br> <br> An IBA official said: "If there is another source of this letter,
              we do not know about it."<br> <br> Mr Lee gave this evidence in the witness box during
              cross-examination by Dr Chee Soon Juan on 27 May 08.<br> <br> The SDP will seek legal advice on this latest development.<br> <br> In a related matter, Mr Lee's press secretary wrote to the <em>Wall
              Street Journal</em> stating that Dr Chee had called Singapore
              leaders "murderers, robbers, child molesters" and "rapists" in open
              court.<br> <br> Dr Chee clearly said no such thing and has written to the newspaper
              challenging the Minister Mentor to produce the records showing that
              he (Dr Chee) did. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-singapore/566-attacks-by-lee-kuan-yew-getting-weirder-and-weirder">See here</a>).</p>

              <p>Really can't believe it that Lee Kuan Yew has stooped this low to create a fake letter.   Mr Lee to produce the letter as proof and let IBA verify.   I want to know the outcome if it is a fake letter.   Mr Lee will have to act fast if not there will be further tarnish to his image.   If the letter is proven fake, hope he is willing to accept that people question his credibility.</p>
