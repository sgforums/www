            <div class='col-md body'>To many singaporeans, i believe holding a pink ic, makes you part of this unique identity nation...<br><br>But , i believe, as time passes, government prefers foreign talents over local talents , even when it comes to academic , and sports areas..<br><br>Look at the press coverage given to foreign born athletes in singapore..<br>almost 100%..<br><br>Local born athletes..almost 0% coverage.. Even Tan Howe Liang is born in Swatow,China..<br><br>We , sg men, should make it compulsory for foreigners to serve NS as long as below 30 years...<br><br>Why make Sg men suffer ? While the foreign talent who supposedly has the same brains and the same stuff take our gals..<br><br>Remember , alot of us lost our gals in the 2 years of NS, furthermore given this white man challenge , we must do something about it.<br><br>Converting the liability into asset today!<br><br>Sometimes i just wish , im a citizen of nowwhere..<br>From young til now..ive been looking for the best country to stay in..<br><br>1. Malaysia - no equal rights for citizens , policy benefits some pple..<br><br>2. Indonesia - anti chinese racial riots not long ago..<br><br>3. China - pay low , standard of living low except in some countries..<br>too many pple, threat of war with USA in the next 50 years.<br><br>4. Japan - Language problems, extremely high cost of living(but got chiobus)<br><br>5. Korea - National service 2 years compulsory, train to fight DPRK , language<br><br>7. Australia - one nation party, led by pauline hanson , still very much alive<br>dun feel at east<br><br>8. Taiwan- threats of tornados , threat of china , earthquake<br><br>9.

            <div class='col-md body'>as much as i dislike the system here, i'll have to admit that no matter what i'll still stay here. last time, i was like you, thinking of which country to stay in because of (higher standard of living, low cost) but then you have to realise that no matter what, you won't be accepted anywhere else. developing countries have too many people they won't accept you. america? australia? why would they wanna let you in when they have enough people on social welfare? although the system here does suck donkey balls its pretty much the only place you can return to and not get rejected. its like a house, though it may be a small house with lousy furniture and not some grand mansion with huge swimming pools its still your house.</div>

They were created by white australians who had no jobs and had to face competition with us foreigners because we foreigners have more talent?.  To them foreigners mean non whites...but unbeknownst to their poorly misled minds...the Brits and Americans are taking their jobs too.<br>Pauline Hanson has toned down on alot of things. She has been a jail bird too. She is running as an independent in QLD....so if u want to avoid her...go to the eastern states of Sydney and Melbourne. Melbourne city is saturated with asians. Mayor is also asian , John So, is his name.<br><br>Japanese are a xenophobic culture - they like their own kind ....their society is more racist than the western culture. You are not of japanese descent - u will issued only an equivalent of permanent residency. They do not welcome immigrants who are not japanese.<br><br>USA - the blacks are actually the ones who hate us asians more. and of course the occasional white trash as well<br><br>Europe - Scandinavian countries are welfare states....with neo nazis<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At least Australia protects the welfare of its own citizens even though they have no national obligations. In Singapore, the reservists make so many sacrifices and yet get little fringe benefits in return. The best example is the SIA Pilots' case, in which SIA chose to axe its SGrean employees rather than foreigners attached from other organisations. The fact that we needed a MYsian PR in the SIA Pilots' Union to arouse the feelings of its (SGrean)members is very ironic.</div>

If not and you are thinking about going anywhere to find job and make money, you can almost strike off most of the countries.<br>Secondly, if you are very young, no family to support, you can go and try. Good luck!<br>If I have the money, I will keep my home in Singapore, live 4 months (april, may, Sept and October when it is cool) in China where S$1000 is like S$5000 here, can eat in restaurant everyday, massage every other day and play golf once a week. Live another 2 months in Perth, go fishing and mountain climbing. Both countries you can speak the language. In between, wait for last minute air tickets discounts and travel to other countries. The greatest benefit of singapore pink IC is the passport, you can go anywhere without VISA.<br>No money, stay at home and talk on sqforum. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Irish passport has more benefits. It is easier to leave Ireland for otherparts of Europe because:<br><br>1) No exit Permit is involved. Even Malaysia with its strict laws against draft-dodgers can't stop conscripts from visiting Singapore freely. I doubt Ireland has such a scheme.<br><br>2) The Republic of Ireland uses the Euro. It is possible to travel between Ireland and other states in the Euro bloc without even passing through any Customs checkpoints. What a breeze.<br><br>In short, if you are an Irish citizen, you can travel from Dublin to Paris, Milan and Madrid without even showing your passport (and the redundant exit permit).</div>
