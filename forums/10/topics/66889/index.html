            <div class='col-md body'>Well my story.<br><br>I was born in Singapore in 1978 and migrated to Melbourne in 1986.  I got deferred from NS till the age of 21.  When I turned 21, they wanted me to serve NS but due to being in University in Melbourne half way, I asked for a deferment for another 1 and a half years.  They denied it and ask to me to coome and serve now or renounce citizenship.  At that time, I don't think I was mature enough to make the decision but eventually just gave it up because I had my Australian citizenship.  I did not want to disrupt my studies for fear I did not want to go back and study again.<br><br>So in August 2002,  I applied for employment pass as my father wanted me to come back and take over his business. I was rejected but no information given as to why. But some say it could have been because the pay was less then $2500 which it was. Could have been because the salary was too low or because I had not served my country when it came to NS.<br><br>I understand if they reject it on the basis of NS because it will not be fair to local Singaporeans.  But in order for me to serve NS I have to be PR or Citizen.  I am neither thus cannot serve.  I just need to be given the chance to work there so I can apply for PR again I am even willing to renounce my Australian Citizenship if they offer me the Singaporean citizenship again.  I am also willing to serve NS.<br><br>Well that  is my situation and I really want to come back and work and live.<br><br></div>

Take this as a fair warning and return at your own risk.<br><br>If you were to check the MIndef website, it indicates very clearly that revoking of citizenship or migration to another country does not relieve you of national service.
