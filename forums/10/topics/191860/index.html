            <div class='col-md body'>Every time the government tries to do something good it actually ends up doing worse. When it said it wanted to provide racially balanced election, it actually tried to use that as an excuse to prevent opposition parties to win seats.<br><br>Now we are told that to prevent racism, there is a need to control bloggers' posting racially offensive posts in blogs.<br><br>It sounds too good to be true that government now wants to prevent junk mailing. .. by private companies. But is it true that junk mail is such a problem?<br><br>It is probably more true that the government actually wants to prevent posting that criticise the government.<br><br>Below is the latest news reported in CNA (21.5.2006) on its proposed control of net mass mailing. Although such mass mailing might be a problem, it will be worse if government steps in as it will use the same law to further restrict citizens' last freedom to give their views on running of the country.<br><br>What do you all think?<br><br><blockquote>SINGAPORE: A committee that is looking at how to protect private information, is expected to submit its report to the government next month.<br><br>Experts believe one of the key features of the upcoming data protection law is clamping down on private companies that collect and disseminate your personal information freely.<br><br>Currently, when a person fills out their personal information on forms or lucky draw coupons, the companies will usually store your information in their databases and disseminate it without the person's knowledge or permission.<br><br>The upcoming law will likely make sure that will not happen again.<br><br>Experts believe the law may be ready in about 2 years.<br><br>"Data collectors would have to get your consent if they're going to use it for direct marketing and if you discover that your particulars are being used by direct marketing by a particular company, you'd have a right to go to the company and demand that they stop doing it. It's the sort of thing I could envisage in the legislation coming," said S Suressh, a partner at Harry Elias Partnership.<br><br>Singaporeans are increasingly using the internet to conduct transactions.<br><br>So it's timely for the government to study and develop laws to protect personal details.<br><br>"As we develop, there're more and more demands for rights and one of the rights is of course the right to privacy. So the government's probably decided that we have reached a certain level of development and that businesses can probably cope with the increased burden and cost of this," said Asst Prof Terence Tan from the Law Faculty at NUS.<br><br>The existing laws cover mainly government agencies such as the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, requiring they protect your personal information.<br><br>But data collection and protection are unregulated among private companies, which will change with the coming of new laws. - CNA /dt<br><br>Copyright Â© 2006 MCN International Pte Ltd</blockquote></div>

We cannot be over-trusting the government with too many presumptuous do-good action and must examine its ulterior motive and gerrymandering underhand.<br><br>Any controls over the net whether for racism or junk mailing must be extremely cautious and be strictly limited and confined to only one specific purpose and not open ended or interpretational to cover e.g. racialist remarks or defamation stuff which can give the power that be even greater power to curb freedom of expressions or views.<br><br>Do you see : laws can be gerrymandered to give government more absolute powers to curb citizens' rights and freedoms.</div>
