            <div class='col-md body'>If the objectives of the civil service are well set up in a Code of Civil Service civil servants would be able to practise good service as culture to the people without hearing so many holier-than-thou lecturing by their leader politicians causing confusion to the civil servants.<br><br>It is time to separate the civil service from the politician so that they do not appear to be taken for granted by the politicians as having to wear their political hat.<br><br>At the moment, citizens are being taken to task all the time or most of the time for negative feedbacks on wrong doings or inefficiencies, with civil servants being confused by all the wrongful challenges by the leader politicians affecting their professional judgments and service to the people.<br>Many civil servants still believe they must deny problems and confront critics like the politicians are doing.<br><br>Civil servants are being distracted by the contrary practices - talk one way and act the other way - of the leaders who keep denying problems and malpractices even in cases openly found to be wrong like the NKF or Shin Corp or ministers' self-reward schemes of all kind in the name of retaining talents when they are hardly talents to begin with.<br></div>
