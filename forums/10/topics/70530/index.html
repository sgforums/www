            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's SM Lee's personal ambition to turn Singapore from a third world to a first one. You should watch his proud speech when Singapore detached from Malaysia. He vowed to turn Singapore into a metropolis within a short span of time. At what costs? I agree that the living std is high but so are the costs. We live in highly stressed enviroment and we pay so much. I hope it's not just personal pride to bring S'pore to a greater height but for the greater good of Singaporeans. I am beginning to doubt this when so many citizens and netizens here start to lament and complain against the Lee empire. Is it a family or personal business or is it Singaporeans' business? Are negative opinions suppressed so that plans for S'pore are not derailed? What do you all think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being a first world country primarily depends on GDP and reserve levels. However, economists never rely on simply 1 factor, even though they do in judging countries lol. On paper, and by judging from GDP and reserve levels, Singapore is 1st world nation material, if one only limits his sight thus short. But from a social point of view, Singapore does not measure the mark for leisure time and certain freedoms. However, the people of the UN dont see it because they dont live in Singapore, most judges do not participate in what they are judging so they cannot know. Furthermore, Singapore's ills are masqueraded by tall glass buildings, cars, high tech substations, hospitals and other stuff.

But I digress.<br><br>Unfortunately, being the frogs-in-wells many here are, we do not understand that being First World means more than that. We bask in self-congratulation, think we've made it. But the fact is due to the either short-sighted or deliberate policies by those in charge, what we've had are ridiculous First World Cost of Living, 2nd World (if there's such a thing) wage system and arguably Standard of Living but with a Third World political system and worse Third World mentality and attitudes among most of the population..<br><br>A developed economy? No. First World Nation? An emphatic NO!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow it's a great exchange of ideas. Now I get the point. Sorry for starting the LKY and PAP bashing here. I am already resigned to my fate here unless God does a miracle. You all won't understand how I survive in Singapore. Must be a miracle from God. I think we need miracles to survive here. I can say I understand how an operational staff with $1.5k survive and suffer bcos I was one. Now I am jobless and depending on the many miracles that God has given me. Maybe I will make it rich by God's grace. Maybe I will never make it and live to see the light of day. God bless you all and continue to pray for Singapore! We really need God's help.</div>
