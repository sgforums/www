However, we must realise times have changed, if your puppy dog was very good towards you in its early years, but then as a dog if bites you day and night... your not going to cling onto the dog because it was good when it was a puppy now would you? Yes people can't be right all the time, do you want such people in government? Or in your company? No... you don't, this world is a dog eat dog world, if that applies to us, why shouldn't it apply to people like LKY?</div>

An opposition member wins a seat in parliament, and suddenly there are difficulties in the construction of an MRT station in that area.  Another constituency votes an opposition menber in, and by the next election it ceases to exist as a voting constituency.<br><br>Sunny, how can any oppostion members demonstrate their abilities when the big boys use their power to shut them down?

Oh wait, we are doing that already. Maybe you would like to feel the sting of being exploited as well or are you spouting such nonsense from your ivory towers. Go talk to the Singaporeans shortchanged by the system and ask them if it has worked for them.<br><br><blockquote><strong>this would destroy Singapore if serious u know... a matter of life and death ... if SIA dun do well, dun think singapore will even survive... see whether u care to complain whose policy works better at that time... </strong></blockquote>Is SIA's woes the fault of its pilots? Hardly, it was the well-thought out planning and complatency of the top brass in that company that caused the trouble. And who feels the burn? The workers who have been doing nothing wrong and doing their duty to the very end, only to be shortchanged in cold blood.<br><br>So your idea of tradining in political stability for logic would mean keeping these jokers to carry on making these mistakes so that the common would suffer.<br><br>Please, has it come to your mind that Singapore could be run far better?<br><br>It's time to wake up and leave the Matrix dude.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Singapore has some of the highest standards of living in the world. And this can in great part be attributed to a good, strong and stable government and a hardworking population. I am not a big fan of the government, but I believe that LKY's guidance and his legacy has been more beneficial than detrimental.<br><br>It is very easy to blame something or someone for your woes. It is more difficult to be able to pick yourself up and to turn a bad situation around. Granted, circumstances may not be favourable due to flaws in the system. But at the end of the day, there is little choice in the matter. Because in the case of Singapore, political liberalisation will not come as quickly as some would like. Poverty and disparities in income will always exist. These are problems that cannot be solved, but only reduced. Thus, either be content with your lot or try to change your lot in life.<br><br>If you want to compare Singapore to other countries, and for those who have been lucky enough to travel around alot, you will realise that Singaporeans are a very lucky lot. We are an affluent nation, have a top-rate educational system and a safe nation that is good for investment. Of course the government can do alot more, but utopia is only a concept, and perfection inattainable.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cookiecutter, theres no doubt that Singapore under the PAP has been extremely successful, and the PAP and its policies would be able to claim a lot credit for that. However the world has moved on since then, we have moved on. The old formula of attracting MNCs here because we can produce what they want to produce at the lowest price with the highest level of stability are over. We are being beaten at that game from countries all over Asia.<br><br>The reasons for this are many, not least because of PAP interference that has seen costs here shoot up a lot higher than IMO they should be, making Singapore and Singaporeans uncompetitive. Getting us to accept less pay, while expecting us to pay more and more, will not work and will fly in their faces, sooner or later. Anyone who believes that Singaporean workers cost more than American or Australian ones should be shot. And I don't want to say what I think of the so-and-so who said that to us in the first place.<br><br>What Singapore needs now are terms oft-repeated, but never enacted with any conviction, by those in power.<br><br>You're right when you say Utopia is unattainable. I fully agree. But Singapore can be better, a lot better for all Singaporeans, as opposed to being Utopia for a select few that is whats going on now. Unfortunately, the select few refuse to make changes that will make Singapore better as a place to live in. Small wonder that those who can, are leaving or plan to. While a lot more who can't, hanker to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, Viper, we're covering a lot of the same ground here, but it's essential to my point! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>It's true, cookiecutter, that under LKY's leadership, Singapore has experienced a rate of development that is pretty amazing.  This economy has grown like it's on steroids.  However, like in the case of steroids, one needs to be aware of the side-effects.  Are they going to result in malformations of the organs that will eventually kill or cripple the user?<br><br>I believe that since perhaps the early 1980's, these side effects have been steadily becoming more visible.  Success in the manufacturing game is influenced by your ability to produce the same goods at a much lower price.  However, with the rising costs of living and value of the Singaporean dollar, how long could we have kept the price low?  Sooner or later the game would have had to change to suit the circumstances.<br><br>Right now, as a First World country by economic standards,  Singapore would probably best be served by market creation, rather than by fighting for market share (which really depends on your ability to deliver better value per dollar than other countries).  A good example of market creation is Creative TechnologyÂ’s introduction of the Sound Blaster, but nobody seems to have been able to follow suit.<br><br>CreativeÂ’s director, Sim Wong Hoo, lists Â“being creativeÂ” as one of his hobbies.  Unfortunately, as the government itself has acknowledged through things like its entrepreneurship drives, Singaporeans are not being creative enough.  For the first 25 years or so of independence, SingaporeÂ’s success was built upon the ability of the people to shut up, follow orders and in so doing get the overall effort to progress as rapidly as possible.  That ability has not been replaced by the required creativity, and has become an unwelcome side effect of those economic steroids - we have not adapted to the new game as dictated by the change in the countryÂ’s circumstances.<br><br>Indeed, as has been expressed in many of the threads related to Â“quittersÂ”, in the Â“shut up and follow ordersÂ” environment, independent thinkers were, and still are, seen as loose cannons on deck and made pariahs.  Now that these people are being driven off, SingaporeÂ’s capacity to play the new game is being diminished.<br><br>In essence, with its latest moves of telling people not to be fussy about the work they take up, and trying to get them to perform the same work with wage cuts, the government is trying to flog the dead horse that is the old game.  The situation is exacerbated by slaves of the system like sunny, who tell non-supporters of the old game Â“maybe water in foreign countries would taste better...Â”, thereby further encouraging the brain drain.<br><br>The bottom line is that the foresight employed by the government in the early part of SingaporeÂ’s independence is not being employed now, and for that, I propose that dissatisfaction with the government is justified.</div>

LKY's response was something like, "<span style="color: red;">All I wanted to do was make a comfortable life for myself and my family - it's not my fault that the rest of the country came along</span>".  I think that says it all, and he's even put it out into the open.</div></blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> maybe it ain't his intention, but that just turned out to be 1 of the few instances that i'm inclined to believe our beloved CEO.
