To some extent, Beijing is willing to hold talks with Chen's administration, he claimed.<br><br>The "interim agreement" to which he referred would be an accord signed by Taiwan and China under which Taiwan would not declare formal independence in exchange for a guarantee of no military attack by China during the next 30-50 years.<br><br>The interim agreement proposal was initiated by Kenneth Lieberthal, a scholar at the University of Michigan, to help Taiwan and China prevent a war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Soong urges better relations with China to protect economy<br><br>CNA , KUALA LUMPUR<br>Friday, Dec 16, 2005,Page 3<br>The key to avoiding Taiwan from being marginalized is to engage with China, People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong (Â‘vÂ‘^Ã Ã¯) said yesterday.<br><br>Speaking at the Perdanam Global Peace Forum in Malaysia, Soong said that as new economic and political blocs in Asia take shape with China playing increasingly important roles, the only option for Taiwan to avoid being relegated to the sidelines is to improve cross-strait relations.<br><br>Taiwan, which has in the past maintained closed economic and trade ties with member states of the ASEAN, particularly Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, is finding it has fewer bargain chips in its maneuvering space in the region after China's rise and the growth of Chinese influence, Soong said.<br><br>During previous APEC meetings, many Asian countries sought bilateral consultations with Taiwan for closer economic and trade ties, but now these countries have turned to China, he said.<br><br>Given that much has changed over the past two years, Soong said, China has become the world's factory and the world's market and has attracted many Asian countries because of its economy.<br><br>Malaysia's two-way trade with Taiwan used to be larger than that with China, but now it is trading with China in volumes much bigger than those with Taiwan, he said, which is a worrisome situation for Taiwan.<br><br>Taiwan will face more serious problems once the "ASEAN plus China, Japan and South Korea" become reality, Soong said.<br><br>Taiwan's competitiveness will automatically slide since its exports to the "ASEAN plus three" members will be much more expensive with tariffs, the PFP chairman said.<br><br>Soong said Taiwan's government should seek to be on better terms with Beijing's leaders, who told him during avisit earlier this year that as long as Taiwan does not seek de jure independence, China would allow Taiwan to enjoy "a certain extent of maneuvering space" in the international community.<br><br><a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2005/12/16/2003284624" rel="nofollow">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2005/12/16/2003284624</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's time for Chen to quit<br><br>2005/12/21<br><br>President Chen Shui-bian won the presidency in 2000 with only 39 percent of the votes, but his approval rating was 77 percent after the first month in office.<br>Last week, in the middle of Chen's second term, the same pollster, the cable news network TVBS, found the president's approval rating had dropped, incredibly, to 10 percent, while disapprovals had surged to 73 percent.<br><br>In sharp contrast, approval for Chen's main opposition rival, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who heads the former ruling Kuomintang, rose to 80 percent, up from 65 shortly after he was elected KMT chairman in August.<br><br>The poll found public support for Ma's party had also advanced to a record 47 percent, while backing for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party slipped to a record low of 12 percent.<br><br>More astonishing, Ma was far more popular than Chen even among DPP's supporters, 58 versus 35 percent.<br><br>The KMT's efforts to seek further cooperation with its ally, the People First Party, and Ma's vow to reform his aged party, were cited as reasons for its increasing public appeal. At the same time, DPP's humiliating defeat in the Dec. 3 local government elections and the ensuing infighting contributed to its faltering public support.<br><br>Meanwhile, a survey by Era News, another cable network, found only 19.7 percent say they have confidence in President Chen while 66.9 percent say no. Almost all opinion surveys named President Chen as the only one to blame for DPP's election fiasco, as well as Taiwan's prolonged political upheavals, economic stagnation and social instability because of his anti-China policies.<br><br>People are fed up with Chen.<br><br>A deeper analysis finds seeds of Chen's failure in his character, family and policy flip-flops.<br><br>The president is a great campaigner but a man of poor taste with few inspiring qualities. In politics as well as in art, talent enables one to stand out in a crowd, but he needs taste to generate respect, and style to inspire a following.<br><br>The first lady, Wu Shu-chen, is famous for offering timely counsel to tycoons on business deals. A regular stock investor, she was fined for unreported trading earnings. She bought a Jaguar for her son to drive to work when he was in military service. The family of her daughter and son-in-law bought economy-class tickets but flew first-class on a vacation trip to the U.S.<br><br>The president's chief fund-raiser, a former presidential deputy secretary-general, has been indicted for involvement in the widening Kaohsiung metro project corruption scandal. Another presidential deputy secretary-general, just like the former one, is charged with conducting illegal stock trading through accounts of office staffers.<br><br>A Taiwan independence activist, the president reached a surprising "one-China" consensus with the ultra anti-independence opposition leader following the DPP's failure to win a majority of legislative seats in last year's elections.<br><br>And Chen's repeated promise to end the decades-old ban on direct transport links with the mainland has still yet to be realized after nearly six years in power.<br><br>Most of Taiwan's foreign investors have relocated to the mainland. Over one million of Taiwan's businesspeople, their families, and college students have chosen to settle there. And yet, Chen's government still restricts high-tech industries to outsource and fruit farmers to export to the mainland.<br><br>For Chen, this is the end. To borrow, again, a premier from the opposition camp, can't improve his poor legacy but will make his game of treachery look uglier.<br><br><a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/detail.asp?onNews=&amp;GRP=i&amp;id=73932" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/detail.asp?onNews=&amp;GRP=i&amp;id=73932</a></div>
