              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And the avg S'porean have shown how much they like his more vocal and daring ways at the last election didn't it...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The last election..... SDP got the worst result among all the Opps. WP &amp; SDA both retain their seats..... with WP nearly winning another seat. SO, what had SDP achive...... if memory service me right.... less than 30% of the Votes in Sembawang GRC.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Won't the "<em><em>more vocal and pro-active ways</em>" of the SDP be better server... when used in Parliament <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></em></span></p>
              <p>Until SDP could get themselves elected into the Parliament..... all they are doing is like a NGO..... cause they could bring out alot of concern (<em><strong>so could alot of 'Uncle' at any Coffeeshop</strong></em>)..... but they can't even get a chance to <span style="color: #3366ff;">Vote or Question</span> the Govt in Parliament (<strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">again</span>, like alot of 'Uncle' at any Coffeeshop</em></strong>).</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any good that the WP and SDA Members of Parliament has done after being elected into Parliament ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Both were subjected to the rules of Parliament, and to the bullying tactics and strategies of an overwhelming majority of the PAP dominated Parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even the Speaker of Parliament is a PAP MP and appointed to the chair - when most other parliaments have that position occupied by a neutral non-partisan personality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How often has the Speaker of Parliament cut off WP and SDA for their persistence, when both never attempted to pursue any issues ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">JBJ's time in Parliament had seen more persistence in chasing for answers on issues of public interests, and got cruxified by the Parliamentary Disciplinary Committees - that were weighed heavily by PAP members to form kangaroo courts that always led to a single outcome.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If one revisit History, one will note that the Rules of Parliament had been changed by LKY since the time after the Barisan Sosialis walked out of Parliament in protest to the shameful parliamentary practices pushed by LKY </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since the last Referendum for Merger with Malaysia, LKY has refused to allow Singaporeans to participate directly in the political process on any major issues that affect Singaporeans - in the same manner that the citizens in more enlightened countries like Switzerland and even Israel are open to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, get elected into Parliament - under whose game rules "in and out of Parliament" ?</span></p>

              <p>100% ruling on what? or do you mean 100% of the ruling party's policies on administration? If it is the latter, yes, and under the leadership of PM Lee.

              <p>We are an accidental nation with no natural resources. We only have each other to support one another. Many could have fled to other shores, but most stayed behind and contributed to our success on a national scale.

              <p>Some policies hurt, ( i don't enjoy paying taxes but i know it is necessary and pay without regrets ) but it is only for the good of all, never just for one person. All their polices are rational, and made with the best intentions to get the best results. There are no perfect ruling administrations, but PM Lee's is one of the best around we can hope for in these times, unlike the ones faced by MM Lee, where the opposition were murderers and thugs, not lazy butted slanderers of today.</p>

              <p><br>Yes indeed. Then what do you think of house visits close to elections? Do you think it is hypocritical, or is it ok?</p>
              <p>And also, may I ask if you think that LHL is not really capable? But it is LKY who is?</p>

              <p>I think the issue here is, is the country better governed or not. House visits are secondary issues.</p>
              <p>PM Lee had served several portfolios in the administration and he had not failed in them, but made them better - trade and finance. He is qualified for the post of PM to lead us all to greater heights.</p>
              <p>MM Lee is only a consultant, a valuable one, for his experience and knowledge is immense. Even other nations consult him. It would be a waste if he doesnt offer his views.</p>

              <p>My religion is Christianity, not Catholicism. My faith is my own and something between me and God, and no mortal can come between me and Him.</p>
              <p> I live in a secular state and have respect for other religions, for it gives them a source of comfort in trying times. If it comforts my fellow citizens to seek spiritual comfort, i will not stand in their way so long as it does not hurt others in our society.</p>
