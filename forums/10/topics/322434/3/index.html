              <p><br>Poh, as I mentioned to some people before that those lackeys can build temple called LKY temple and worship him after he dies.   These people can go there and ask for 4D/toto numbers.     This way, LKY can contribute to money making in Singapore even after he passes on.  </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is there any good that the WP and SDA Members of Parliament has done after being elected into Parliament ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Both were subjected to the rules of Parliament, and to the bullying tactics and strategies of an overwhelming majority of the PAP dominated Parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Even the Speaker of Parliament is a PAP MP and appointed to the chair - when most other parliaments have that position occupied by a neutral non-partisan personality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">How often has the Speaker of Parliament cut off WP and SDA for their persistence, when both never attempted to pursue any issues ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">JBJ's time in Parliament had seen more persistence in chasing for answers on issues of public interests, and got cruxified by the Parliamentary Disciplinary Committees - that were weighed heavily by PAP members to form kangaroo courts that always led to a single outcome.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If one revisit History, one will note that the Rules of Parliament had been changed by LKY since the time after the Barisan Sosialis walked out of Parliament in protest to the shameful parliamentary practices pushed by LKY</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since the last Referendum for Merger with Malaysia, LKY has refused to allow Singaporeans to participate directly in the political process on any major issues that affect Singaporeans - in the same manner that the citizens in more enlightened countries like Switzerland and even Israel are open to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, get elected into Parliament - under whose game rules "in and out of Parliament" ?</span></p>

              <p>Correct..... which is why in Anwar case..... there is a need to again use some "<strong><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #888888;">Sodomy</span></span></strong>" case to discredit him.</p>
              <p>Lets ask ourselves this question..... <strong><em>How could SDP or CJS claim that they represent the ppl of S'pore, when the ppl of S'pore NEVER EVER voted them into Parliament ever since CJS is the Leader of the party<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></em></strong></p>
              <p>WP or SDA might not have done much in Parliament, as some forumrunner had pointed out..... <strong><em>BUT THEY ARE VOTED IN BY THE PPL</em></strong>,and could claim <strong>LEGITMACY</strong> that they have the support of the ppl.</p>
              <p>If CJS or SDP wants the same legitmacy...... they MUST 1st get themselve elected..... then CJS style of questioning could be put to good use inside Parliament.</p>

              <p> <span style="color: #0000ff;">Surely you do not expect CJS to be promoted by CSJ or the SDP ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who is CJS ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is CSJ taking the leadership role to unite the Opposition Parties ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am not sure where you get all your information to cook up your very peculiar views of politics in Malaysia and Singapore.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since his entry into politics, I have yet to see any printed word from anyone that quoted CSJ declaring that either himself or the SDP represent the "<em>ppl of S'pore</em>" - how did you come to lay your hands on such a print ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Did you mistake his <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">offer</span></em> to represent Singaporeans - to fight for the political space - as a claim in itself ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you being naive in the same manner as you have interpreted the "Anwar matter" ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you seriously think that LKY will allow a "wild-card" that he cannot discipline to enter Parliament and give his dear Son a hard time ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">LKY will not allow any pressure to fall on LHL - as any pressures or stress will result in a chance of LHL's cancer recurring.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What do you think were the reasons for LKY's malevolent efforts at politically destroying the political challenges from Francis Seow, Tang Liang Hong and JBJ - just when LHL was soon to step into the PM chair ?</span></p>

              <p>''In response to media queries, Police confirmed that it received calls from<br> members of the public at about 2.20 pm on Saturday, 15 Mar 2008 informing that a<br> group of about 20 persons wearing red t-shirts were staging a protest outside the<br> Parliament House.<br> <br> Upon arrival, police officers observed that Chee Soon Juan was with a group of<br> about 20 persons chanting slogans and displaying various placards. They were all clad<br> in similar red-coloured t-shirts.<br> <br> Chee and his group ignored repeated Police warnings to stop the unlawful<br> assembly. Instead, Chee and his group persisted with their actions and also began to<br> stage a protest march towards Funan Digitalife Mall waving placards.<br> <br> The group was given a final warning by Police to stop the protest march or face<br> arrest. Chee and 11 others defied the police warning and were eventually stopped in<br> front of Funan Digitalife Mall and five placards were seized from them. In effecting the<br> arrest, Police faced resistance from some of the members who struggled and locked<br> their arms together. Police equipment including a police radio set was damaged. One<br> of the protesters, Chee Siok Chin had tried to bite a female police officer when the<br> latter tried to arrest her.<br> <br> <strong>Not the first attempt by Chee Soon Juan in acts of wilful civil disobedience</strong><br> <br> Police note that this episode is the not the first attempt by Chee Soon Juan and<br> other SDP members to stage illegal assemblies as part of their campaign for civil<br> disobedience against the Singapore authorities.<br> <br> In October last year, Chee had staged an unlawful demonstration at the Istana<br> Park facing the Istana main entrance on 8 Oct 2007. Chee had also staged an<br> unlawful assembly at the Myanmar embassy on 30 Sep 2007 to collect a petition<br> against the Myanmar Government and the Singapore authorities. This latest incident at<br> Parliament House today saw an escalation in the level of defiance shown by Chee’s<br> group; for the first time, the group staged typical militant protest methods of locking<br> arms to resist arrest practised by some protest groups in Western countries. The<br> attack by Chee Siok Chin is also unprecedented and police are investigating into the<br> matter.<br> <br> Parliament House is a high security installation. Outdoor protest activities are<br> not allowed given their potential for public disorder and disruption to community life.<br> Chee had earlier applied for a police permit to hold a protest rally but this was an<br> empty gesture as a subsequent posting on SDP's website indicated that SDP intended<br> to proceed with the rally on 15 Mar at 2.00 pm even though a permit was not obtained.<br> The post also urged "all Singaporeans who cannot stomach PAP's bullying anymore to<br> join" the event. Chee’s deliberate actions to break the law and defy the authorities are<br> consistent with his previous unlawful acts, for which he has been charged and<br> convicted in Court.<br> <br> Chee has persisted to advocate civil disobedience and street politics as the<br> means for political action in Singapore. In so doing, he disregards the law and holds<br> himself above it so long as he thinks the law in question is one he does not approve.<br> Police reiterates that no one is above the law. Our laws apply equally to all, whether<br> local or foreigners and it will apply no less to Chee.''--end of quote</p>
