              <p>What I think is, one should try to win with the current rules, no matter how unfair it is.</p>
              <p>When one wins, then one have the right to set their own rules, no matter how unfair it might be.</p>
              <p>There's no use trying to overcome those strongly in power using 'illegal' methods; it just doesn't work out well, especially in a Chinese dominated Singapore where everyone is extremely practical.</p>
              <p>Just like ancient China, when the emperor is very very good to their people by ensuring everyone thrives well, who else other than fanatics bothered about who is the emperor?</p>

              <p>Example...... it well known that most S'porean just wants result.... Not speech after speech after speech..... Not to see the Opps leaders trying their best to be arrested and get into prison. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The problem began with the Ruling Party fearing a mass recruitment of disgruntled professionals and highly qualified individuals joining the Alternative Political Parties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">CSJ was the first doctorate degree holder to join politics on the side of the Alternative Political Parties after a period of 25 years - and that he can shake a Prime Minister's constituency on his second outing in the by-Election of 1992 in Marine Parade - it caused all the alarm bells to ring in LKY's mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The same alarm bells rang when JBJ was successful in winning a seat ten years earlier, and LKY did his level best to 'fix' JBJ and have him thrown out of Parliament.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">CSJ was victimised by the dirty politics practised by the Ruling Political Party - in the accusations of him being a cheat on some trumped up charges from a $2 difference in the reimbursement taxi fare claimed by CSJ - that was approved one year before CSJ stood as an election candidate; and a second false charge of being a cheat for some postage that cost NUS less then $50 due to a purposeful misreading of the situation over a joint submission of his wife's research work as supporting papers being submitted by CSJ for validation by a US university. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Both the false charges were levelled at CSJ by his faculty head, who was a long term stalwart in the Ruling Party - who sued CSJ for libel for the rebutting the false charges that meant the faculty head was a liar. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">CSJ was caught in a no win situation - given that the Singapore Judiciary has never been seen to be independent of the political agenda of the Ruling Political Party - </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> as was seen in the manner that the late High Court Justice Sinnathuray tormenting efforts at JBJ, after JBJ was acquitted by a Lower Court Judge Michael Khoo; and which a subsequent appeal of the High Court judgment to the Privy Council resulted in the correctness of his acquittal by the Lower Court Judge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Under such circumstances, could CSJ enter the political arena by any other ways, when the playing field is not level, and the rules are arbitrarily set by the Ruling Political Party to ensure their own political superiority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Compared to CSJ willingness to take up hot issues, WP LTK and SDA CST have both hardly made any impact in Parliament, nor in their respective Constituencies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Both gentlemen could not even win their rights as elected Members of Parliament for their respective Constituencies to even lead their own constituents in the National Day celebrations, or even establish their offices in the void decks of the HDB flats in the same quality environment as the PAP MPs in their constituencies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What has both gentlemen to show for the period that they have been re-elected as MPs in their respective Constituencies ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">As matters stand, both gentlemen had their percentages slightly reduced in Election 2006 - even as their more junior members were more successful in making a dent even in the PM LHL's GRC.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Since Election 2006 - the Ruling Party has tightened the rules governing the activities of the Alternative Political Parties, with the Police Force leading the other government agencies to harrass or stone-wall the applications by the Alternative Parties for licenses to conduct political activities in their constituencies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Beyond their respective constituencies, the WP and SDA do not seem to conduct any poltiical activities to reach out to Singaporeans, or raise their own political PR profile - compared to the efforts by CSJ and the SDP in daring to represent Singaporean's concern in more vocal and pro-active ways.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I am not sure how you intend to balance out "<em>being less visibly active</em>" is equal to "<em>doesn't mean that he's not visible</em>" </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are you attempting to make him more visible by having two negatives in your statement to make his visibility become positive ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you taken a sampling of the disgusts felt by "<em>a lot more of singaporeans</em>" shown to be so conclusive in your statement ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Or is the truth not closer to the 'kiasu-and-kiasi' fact that most Singaporeans feel that it is better to sacrifice CSJ then ourselves, and let him butt head with the government while everyone sit back and wait for some reaction from the Government that will beneift everyone ?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What do you see as the mentality and character of Singaopreans ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If it does not work, do you think that the Government will not take pro-active responses to nip the problems in the bud - as in the manner that the Government has given the political space for Singaporeans to decide on issues that affect their neighborhood; but will insist that National Issues will remain the decision making responsibilities of politicians in Parliament ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This response was to prevent Singaporeans from swaying into the arms of the Alternative Political Parties by cleverly giving Singapore a false psychological control of their own destiny - even if it is a local one that affects their immediate environment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">On the one hand, they will destroy potent political personalities in the Alternative Parties such as CSJ, JBJ, Francis Seow, Tan Liang Hong - and even likely potential ones that have been destroyed such as NUS Student Union President Tan Wah Piow, Lawyers Teo Soh Lung,and Mirza Namazie - all having direct brushes with LKY.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is left to intelligent Singaporeans to know that the more stridently negative image that has been purposefully created to destroy the individual characters of politicians from the Alternatiive Parties - will reveal the assessment of the Ruling Parties as to who is the most threatening personalities from the Alternative Political Parties that will be most able to challenge their position.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From historical records, one can review LKY's methods in dealing with political personalities who will threaten his own position - as can be reviewed in the manner that he treated Lim Chin Siong, a person whom he had introduced - to Chief Minister David Marshall. - as the most capable person to be the first Prime Minister of Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yet it was the very person whom LKY feel most threatened in his own political scheme for his own ambitious future, and LKY worked with the Colonial Government to exercise the ISA and placed Lim Chin Siong under arrest - while LKY moved on to be the Prime </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Minister.</span></p>

              <p>If the SDP truly commited political suicide then lionnoisy would not be spending so much effort starting threads on them.

              <p>That's not political suicide, ironically lionnoisy has kept them with some credibility by trying to discredit and put so much attention on them.</p>
              <p>If it was political suicide, nobody would care about them, to put it simply. That would be political suicide.</p>
              <p>The NKF saga is a good example of political suicide is you're caught in it.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Clearly you have hit the nail on the head, ST.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Politics is not merely for the politicians as LKY and GCT will have us swallow this as some Biblical fact.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Politics is LIFE itself - and concerns every aspect of Humanities that is required to make a complete Human live life to the fullest.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is the self-interest of the politicians in LKY and GCT that they will declare Politics to be out-of-bounds to every Singaporean, unless we join some political party - and submit ourselves to their kind of dirty political rules that are drafted by them in their own self-interest.</span></p>
