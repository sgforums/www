              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: A People’s Action Party (PAP) split by internal schisms. Future leaders bereft of the "huge political legitimacy" that could be gained from endorsement by the man with unmatched moral and historical authority. These are some of the leadership fates that could befall a post—Lee Kuan Yew Singapore, as hotelier Ho Kwon Ping sees it.</p>
              <p>And such "imponderable" scenarios could help explain why a "system of elders" is now taking shape in the political landscape.</p>
              <p>"Perhaps it is to restrain factionalism, arbitrate disagreements, groom and assess future leaders, that the positions of senior minister and minister mentor have been institutionalised," said Mr Ho, who feels the PAP’s "extraordinary cohesion" over five decades has owed much to "the forceful personality of Lee Kuan Yew".</p>
              <p>Mr Ho, who is also MediaCorp chairman, was speaking on Monday alongside Professor Kishore Mahbubani at a seminar organised by Nanyang Technological University’s Asian Journalism Fellowship programme. The topic? "Singapore Beyond Lee Kuan Yew: Institutionalising the Singapore Way".</p>
              <p>Of this future, Prof Mahbubani, who Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, would not rule out a "significant reversal" of Mr Lee’s legacy, or the rise of a stronger Opposition usurping the one dominant party system — though he gave each scenario only a "one—sixth probability".</p>
              <p>While a "smooth and seamless transition" was a two—thirds likelihood, Prof Mahbubani harked back to the words of former Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee, after the PAP’s long monopoly of parliament was broken in 1981. "As (Dr Goh) has wisely told us, failure happens when we fail to consider the possibility of failure."</p>
              <p>So, for instance in the unlikely event of a strong opposition arising, would Mr Lee’s legacy be weakened? In fact, the "sharper political debates" arising could make Singaporeans more aware of the "precious political legacy they have enjoyed", said Prof Mahbabuni.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, as has happened in South Korea and Taiwan, it could also lead to the old legacies being quickly lost and forgotten by the new generation. "I am frequently shocked when I meet younger Singaporeans who have never heard of Dr Goh," he said.</p>
              <p>Both speakers were not alone in expressing uncertainty over how Singapore’s future, sans Mr Lee, would play out. During the Q&amp;A session, which was off—the—record, the audience raised concerns such as how the country would be deprived of its most astute and influential critic — and whether Mr Lee’s legacy, or indeed Singapore, could unravel.</p>
              <p>While Mr Lee’s retirement would "create a huge political vacuum", Prof Mahbubani believes Singapore has "done a lot" to protect his legacy, such as instilling a deep culture of meritocracy and incorruptibility.</p>
              <p>And Mr Ho had no doubts Singaporeans could "muddle their way through", even if the PAP’s leadership renewal "fails to deliver what it has done for the past 50 years".</p>
              <p>Mr Lee’s greatest legacy, he said, "is that the Singapore which he so passionately shaped will outlive not only him, but even his own party, should that ever come to pass".</p>
              <p>The reason: In his single most critical imperative — nation building — Mr Lee has largely succeeded, said Mr Ho, who has found young Singaporeans to own a strong sense of involvement and ownership in the country, contrary to stereotype.</p>
              <p>"Equally contrary to some people’s wishful thinking, there is not likely to be dramatic, broad—brush social or political liberalisation," said Mr Ho. "This is not a pent up society waiting for the demise of the strongman in order to overturn highly unpopular laws."</p>
              <p>Rather, the government has the support of the politically—vital heartland in its pragmatic, incremental approach to change, even as it responds to tomorrow’s generation, he said.</p>

              <p></p><h1>Lee Kuan Yew: a ratbag to the end</h1><p></p>
              <p>It seems the Australian government-academic establishment is
                  running out of Asian autocrats to fete. Chancellor Allan Hawke and Vice
                  Chancellor Ian Chubb of the Australian National University (ANU) are
                  the latest to join the Australian movers and shakers who laud
                  distasteful people -- in their case, former Singaporean prime minister
                  Lee Kwan Yew, who now holds an ANU honorary doctorate.</p>
              <p>That the ANU could impugn its reputation for excellence in Asian
                  studies and human rights law to further the ambitions of its top two
                  officers is surprising enough. That these men should ram through the
                  award by shelving university processes of review and then praise Lee's
                  "integrity," "commitment to advancing the causes of peace and
                  prosperity" and "international statesmanship [sic]" is downright
                  contemptible. But credit where credit's due: Lee would applaud their
                  methods.</p>
              <p>Hawke and Chubb, no doubt, will be unmoved to hear of Lee's most recent
                  slur against a head of state -- hardly proper protocol, one might
                  think, for the recipient of a gong for statesmanship. Nonetheless, on
                  April 4, Lee trotted out an attack on President Chen Shui-bian (é™³æ°´æ‰�),
                  saying that he was duping Taiwanese into believing that independence
                  from China is possible because war would result and the US would not
                  intervene.</p>
              <p>The problem with this salvo was that it wasn't just
                  personal; it was a bouquet to China and a put-down directed at millions
                  of Taiwanese people who believe in democracy and liberty. So a personal
                  attack on Lee for his cardigan despotism and hubris is perfectly in
                  order -- because so much of Singapore and its neuroses are linked to
                  Lee's person.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee's record on human rights is poor. He, like other autocrats in the
                  region, demeans his people by labeling liberties of press and academic
                  freedom as Western conceits that are not conducive to "Asian"
                  societies.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This mentality -- culturalist bordering on racist -- set up
                  one of the more enduring intellectual hoaxes </strong></span>of the 1990s, namely that
                  there exist "Asian values" (as opposed to Western or Judeo-Christian
                  values, presumably, though his argument was never coherent). And these
                  values, funnily enough, seem to absolve people such as Lee for
                  oppressive behavior -- as long as an economic return is delivered.</p>
              <p>Lee's legacy of authoritarianism lives on. This week saw the banning of
                  a documentary about a long-time political prisoner in Singapore, Said
                  Zahari. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Suffice it to say that Singapore's credibility is shaky if it
                  can't face up to events of 30 years ago and cites social order as a
                  pretext for shutting down debate.</strong></span></p>
              <p>And if it wasn't clear before, it should be now: With the latest pay
                  rise that lawmakers have awarded themselves (justification: lavishing
                  millions of dollars on the "most talented" legislators and executive
                  officials beats corruption), the Singaporean state can now be dubbed
                  the world's most lucrative -- and sanitized -- protection racket. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee,
                  who these days goes under the risible title of "minister mentor," will
                  himself pocket another small fortune.</strong></span> But even by Singaporean
                  standards, this <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>self-aggrandizement is so brazen</strong></span> that Prime Minister
                  Lee Hsien Loong has promised to donate his new riches to charity.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lee Kwan Yew, his son and their supporters can keep their city-state
                  kleptocracy and their largely pliant people.</strong></span> And long may he be courted
                  by foreign academic powerbrokers and governments dazzled by his
                  connections.</p>
              <p>But Lee Kwan Yew is no friend of Taiwan. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Until Singapore learns to deal
                  with domestic political opponents other than by intimidating,
                  bankrupting, arresting and torturing them, there is little to learn
                  from Lee's fiefdom or his lectures.</strong></span> Taiwan has seen it all before --
                  and left it behind.</p>
