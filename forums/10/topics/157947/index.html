            <div class='col-md body'>I have experienced deletions of my posts by CNA too. It was just my objective views on past policy errors but they just got deleted.<br><br>I fail to understand how in today's widespread telecommunications we must still have this kind of control of  information so that for those giving their views to CNA, they will only give good views favorable to the establishments to avoid being deleted.<br><br>If the feedbacks and openness and the intention to build an inclusive cosmopolitan society is for real we will not have so many deletions of this kind of views and opinions happening in what is supposed to be a leading news in the region.<br><br>The whole system is so filled with falsehoods and pretentious look-good news and views liked by the establishments but sadly devoid of creative ideas from people who really have something to offer. The people who continue to work the system are supposed to be talents and capable but sadly they cannot tell that by covering up problems like the NKF, they will be postponing solutions to be exploded by more powerful forces one day with greater consequences when problems cannot be covered any longer.<br><br>That is why we are seeing more building and worksite collapses and more MRT and LTA fiascos, more souzhou losses and more 7 wonders because of disdain for facts and fictions. What future do we have if people cannot and do not have the means to point out mistakes or what are facts.</div>

Or how the press is being used as a tool for nation-building.<br><br>Rather it is about MediaCorp's crop of mediocre journalists who pretend they are the best in the local scene, particularly those from the freesheet "Today".<br><br>This is what they wrote on their website, www.Todayonline.com:<br>[color=red]"With a team of talented reporters and worldwide correspondents, TODAY covers a diverse range of interests..."<br><br>Talented?  I think there is an element of shamelessness here for I don't associate bad writing and grammar with being "talented".  How do you call someone talented when he writes like that:<br>"Whenever Today runs its feature on the Singapore Idol, that's when it's letters' day".<br><br>Mind you, that came from a Today journalist. I can't remember the exact wording but I'm very sure she used "whenever" with "when".  Worse, somewhere down the article, she went on to criticise other newspapers!<br><br>And try reading anything written by their chief editor. Not an ounce of fluency or style in his articles.<br><br>The same applies for Channel News Asia which is basically a channel for posers and pretenders. Posers as in the glamourbabes (including the male journalists) they hire. Pretenders as in lots of superficial style and almost zilch substance.<br><br>Tell me why do I want to watch their coverage on the Iraq war when during the blitz, ABC, CNN, BBC etc had reporters embedded in tanks in the thick of the battle?<br><br>Nation building. That's the prerogative of the PAP Government. I disagree with it but hey, there's CNN and there's internet.<br></div>

Try reading articles written by this woman called Tshola Bering, a PR from Nepal.  9 out of 10 of her articles start with "In a move...", "In a bid...", "In an attempt...".<br><br>And yes, I did write to Today's editor to highlight their mistakes and tell them not to be so smug.  And you know what, they published an article showing that they are the most read paper among PMEBs!<br><br>How do you compare a free-sheet with a newspaper that costs 80 cents?<br><br></div>
