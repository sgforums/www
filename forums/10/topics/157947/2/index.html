I cited the Friday issue of Today in which there were 2 articles written by Jeanine Tan who is on the entertainment beat.

One such journalist is Cubby Leong.<br><br>A further proof of such sloppy and bad grammar occurred On Friday night in a CNA programme on roses.  Being all superficial style and no substance, CNA always likes to run those trailer with smart-alecky one-liners.  For this programme, the one-liner read, "Roses are not just flowers; they are also herbs that can aid in heart problems."<br><br>Now, wait a minute" "...aid in heart problems"???<br><br>Did they mean "...aid in ameliorating or solving heart problems"?

This is MediaCorp for you.

I mean, this sets very bad examples for everyone due to wrong English usage!<br><br><strong>Worst, honestly speaking, if organisations don't even accept any single suggestions, then how should it improve?</strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember: suggestions are the basis to improvement</span> !</strong><br><br>And that based from my observations,  Mediacorp nowadays really need a total change including the range of TV programmes it provided.<br><br>So if it does not accept even your sincere suggestion, then I would also feel hopeless of Mediacorp's future prospects.</div>
