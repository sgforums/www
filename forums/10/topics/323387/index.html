              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Singapore heading in the right direction considering the differences in the government policies in Singapore and Hong Kong both competing in the face of  challenges from a gloomy world economic outlook ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Hong Kong has seen its 2008 First Quarter performance improved on its 2007 results, and with consumer confidence driving its local economy as much as it maintained its export sectors in several areas that Singapore is also competing in.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>2008-05-16 - Xinhua</strong></p>
              <p>Hong Kong's economy continued to grow in the first quarter with its gross domestic product expanding 7.1 percent despite the growing adversities in the external environment, revealed the latest official figures on Friday. <br><br>KC Kwok, government economist of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said at a press conference here Friday that the GDP growth in the first three months marked the metropolis' 18th consecutive quarter that GDP growth exceeded the average trend growth. <br><br>Due to the uncertainties prevailing in the external environment and dimmer global economic prospects, Kwok said, the GDP forecast at 4 percent to 5 percent this year was still unchanged. <br><br>With the strong GDP growth in the first quarter, and barring any abrupt external shocks, it is likely GDP growth in 2008 should be close to the upper end of the forecast range, he said. <br><br>Total goods exports grew 8.3 percent in real terms in the first quarter, supported by the vibrant performance of the Chinese mainland and other emerging economies and the expansion of the European Union market. <br><br>Services exports also rose 10.8 percent in real terms on the back of a continued surge in financial services, as well as notable growth in offshore trade and inbound tourism. <br><br>Domestic demand played a key role in driving the economy forward. Private consumption spending rose 7.9 percent, underpinned by the firm labor-market conditions and rising incomes. Overall investment grew 8.9 percent with a rebound in building and construction activity. <br><br>However, amid dimmer global economic prospects, the local stock market experienced further consolidation in the first quarter and the housing market turned less hectic, Kwok said. <br><br>Labor market conditions continued to be firm in the first quarter. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 3.4 percent, and the underemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 1.9 percent. Labor earnings and wages were on the rise. <br><br>Consumer price inflation picked up, mostly due to the surge in food prices amid the global food inflation. Headline CPI inflation averaged 4.6 percent in the first quarter. After netting out the one-off effects of the rates concession this year and the public housing rental waiver last year, underlying CPI inflation was 4.9 percent. <br><br>Kwok said the external environment will remain uncertain and challenging, noting: "The US economy will continue to be weak with the effects of the housing market downturn spreading into the wider economy, while global financial markets are likely to remain unsettled. Economic activities in other major advanced economies have also showed signs of deceleration." <br><br>The growth momentum in the emerging and developing economies, including the Chinese mainland economy, is expected to remain vibrant, while there should be some mild moderation in growth due to the weaker demand from the advanced economies. <br><br>This should provide some cushioning effect on the impact on Hong Kong from the developed world's economic slowdown in the coming quarters, Kwok said. <br><br>Domestic demand is expected to grow and remain a key driver in economic growth. The firm labor market conditions and rising incomes should continue to fuel private consumption. <br><br>As business confidence holds up well and interest rates remain low, there should also be growth in investment spending in the rest of the year. <br><br>Kwok said the inflation outlook is also uncertain and will hinge on the movements in food prices in the international markets in the rest of the year, which can be expected to be volatile. <br><br>Apart from global food prices, the elevated international oil prices, the exchange-rate movements as well as the strength of the local economy are likely to continue to exert inflationary pressure. Nevertheless, the sustained increase in labor productivity will provide some offsetting effect. <br><br>Due to the high degree of uncertainties in the external environment, Kwok said, the forecast rate of increase in the underlying CPI for 2008 is maintained at 4.5 percent. The corresponding forecast headline inflation rate is also unchanged at 3.4 percent.</p>
              <p>"The risks to these forecasts are on the upside. The government will review the inflation forecast as more incoming data become available," he added.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">With the National Day celebrations approaching, Singapore is experiencing a tough period since the Election 2006 - and made worst with a slew of government approved price increases, and policies that contract the take-home pay of Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is Singapore heading the right way with the government in the hands of PM LHL ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is he and his handpicked team of elitist talents managing the economy right, or are they merely guiding the economy on "auto-pilot" and making small corrections simply to keep the plane flying on course - regardless of the looming storm clouds ?</span></p>

              <p>The latest survey of professional forecasters by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) shows that economists expect gross domestic product to grow 5.5 percent in 2008.</p>
              <p>This is a slight downgrade from the 5.6 percent forecast made in the last survey in March.</p>
              <p>But the second quarter appears to be doing well. Economists have raised their growth forecast for Q2 to 4.7 percent, up from the 4.4 percent reported in the previous survey.</p>

              <p>More than half of the 21 respondents of the survey believe that inflation will fall within a range of 6 to 6.5 percent this year.</p>
              <p>For the second quarter, inflation is expected to come in at 7.5 percent.</p>

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>Star, Malaysia<br>July 5, 2008<br><br>INSIGHT: BY SEAH CHIANG NEE<br></strong><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;">W</span></span>HEN the republic celebrates its national day next month with its traditional stirring parade and patriotic songs, the mood of many of its citizens will be less than joyful.</p>
              <p>On Aug 9 they will try to put aside an unusual combination of bad news – including crushing inflation and threat of a global recession – to wave flags and watch the fireworks.</p>
              <p>But it will be with a heavy heart. To put it simply, Singapore’s 43rd birthday is coming at a bad time, possibly one of the worst in decades.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the economy of the richest nation in South-East Asia had been firing on all cylinders in recent years.</p>
              <p>A booming construction sector, record tourist arrivals and a fast-growing financial sector have contributed to a gross domestic product growth of nearly 8% last year.</p>
              <p>The number of millionaires (in US dollar terms) increased to 77,000, making Singapore the seventh in the world in growth of people with high net worth.</p>
              <p>That was the recent past. The present is less cheery. A <em>Newsweek </em>correspondent who visited here in 2007 asked: <strong>“If the island’s economy is booming, why are so many citizens worse off than they were <span style="color: #800000;">10 years ago</span>?”</strong></p>
              <p>Even as the country prospered, the lives of lower middle class and the poor have become tougher over the past decade. It has in fact become bleak for the elderly and unskilled, who work as cleaners and labourers, <strong><em><span style="color: #800000;">admits the Ministry of Manpower</span></em></strong>.</p>
              <p>Their <span style="color: #800000;"><em>wages have remained stagnant for 10 years</em></span>, unlike other groups such as managers, professionals, sales and service workers, as well as plant and machine operators.</p>
              <p>Last year, managers – the best-paid group – earned 4.86 times more than cleaners and labourers. The gap has widened in 10 years. It was 4.13 times in 1997.</p>
              <p>A government committee on low-income earners says <em><span style="color: #800000;">300,000 workers, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">20% of the population</span> earn S$1200 (RM2760) or less a month – half of them S$900 or less</span></em>.</p>
              <p>“Income gaps are widening,” said Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, while Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew admitted that a narrowing was not likely any time soon because of cheap labour from China and India.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #800000;">Inflation, the worst in 26 years</span></em>, has further aggravated the problem since it is affecting the poorer class more than others.</p>
              <p>The wage gap has become a particularly acute problem among older and lower-skilled workers, who are among the most disenchanted population in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Commentators believe that the political fortunes of the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) are tied to its ability to tackle this dilemma at a time when Lee's influential presence enters its sunset years.</p>
              <p>If inflation worsens further or if the PAP cannot improve the lives of the middle class and the poor, it could face a <strong><span style="color: #800000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">crisis in the 2011 election</span></span></strong>.</p>
              <p>An unusually frank write-up in the government-controlled <strong><span style="color: #800000;"><em>Channel News Asia</em> last year said that middle class stagnation could lead to social instability</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>“Anecdotally, it seems to me that our society is already beginning to fray at the edges. There is an increasing coarseness to life,” the writer said.</p>
              <p>“People have no more time to be considerate to others; even scavengers have to become pushy for fear of losing out to competitors.”</p>
              <p>On a possible scenario if poverty spreads, he sounded a warning to the contended rich: “Even if you close your eyes to vagrants around us, you can’t avoid breathing the air that you share with them.</p>
              <p>“Even if you drive around in a sealed BMW or Lexus, one day, homeless kids will catch up with you at traffic junctions offering to clean your windshield.</p>
              <p>“Or you find yourself taking the long walk to your parked car, because the shorter route takes you past suspicious-looking men who might be desperate enough to snatch your bag.</p>
              <p>“I wonder if the decay has begun to set in, even as we continue to boast of high GDP growth rates.”</p>
              <p>The island state has become a rich oasis with pockets of rising poverty, where the homeless sleep at void decks or beaches.</p>
              <p>Workers in their 60s or 70s clean toilets and sweep floors, instead of enjoying their retirement with grandchildren as is befitting the world’s seventh richest nation (in per capita GDP).</p>
              <p>To say the government is not worried is understating the fact. It has set up a special body to study measures to improve the earnings of these 300,000 people.</p>
              <p>Ideologically, <span style="color: #000000;">Lee has always rejected subsidies or welfare schemes for the needy. The younger ministers</span>, led by his son Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, have, however, been <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800000;">tweaking the no-welfare system by dishing out more cash and topping up savings</span></span></strong> of the lower-income workers.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Called <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Workfare</span></strong>, it <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">provides hundreds to thousands of dollars</span></strong> to poorer families. Much of it has, however, <strong>been eaten up by the higher cost of living</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Some economists have called for a new social safety net to meet Singapore’s modern needs. Yeoh Lam Keong suggests identifying a basket of goods and services that is necessary for individuals and families to enjoy a minimum standard of living.</p>
              <p>Based on this index, the government should formulate new policies to help low-income earners counter the effects of globalisation.</p>
              <p>“We are in a strong fiscal position and if any country in the world can afford to find a better solution to deal with this growing income divide, it is Singapore,” Yeoh said.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em></em></span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em>Hong Kong-vs-Singapore</em><br><strong>Who is winning?</strong><br></span><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br>Last Sunday, I walked along Hong Kong's Causeway Bay and gained a new understanding of why <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Lee Kuan Yew sometimes wishes Singaporeans were more like the people of Hong Kong. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What I saw was a carnival scene, a little organised chaos and a picture of flourishing business created from adversity.<br><br>Several streets around Victoria Park were packed with maids from Indonesia and the Philippines sitting around the pavements enjoying their day off.<br><br>It was like a huge picnic of more than 1,000 people eating lunch, chatting and listening to music. It is repeated every Sunday.<br><br>By the roadsides, mini-buses displayed photographs of maids seeking jobs. You could just walk up, interview one and sign her up without any bureaucratic fuss.<br><br>In Singapore, I quickly told myself, such scenes would not have been possible. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I'm pretty sure that Singaporeans by the hundreds would have complained to the authorities about the crowds and the noise; businessmen would want them removed for blocking their shops. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And in 10 minutes, the efficient Singapore police would have moved in and cleared everything away. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Well, that's what makes Hong Kong different. The former British colony is less regulated and a lot livelier.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Slowly, Singaporeans are learning that orderliness and tranquillity do not always spell economic opportunities.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Instead of getting the police to evict them, the Hong Kong shopkeepers did better. Instead of whining, they turned adversity into ringing cash registers and making money from the crowds. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"Kedai makanan" dished out Indonesian takeaways. Others sold Suara, a Jakarta newspaper, clothes and cosmetics, mobile phone products, from ring-tones to IDD discounts and money transfer services. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Several provision shops sold Indonesian goods. A dozen Indonesian girls were paid to distribute flyers at street corners. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>But it was not only the people who stood out. The authorities, too, were tolerant in allowing small private entrepreneurs to do their stuff. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Faced with the same situation, the Singapore government would probably be handling it in a regulatory way. Break the law and you would get fined.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hong Kong's laissez-faire did not leave with the British; the traditions of free private enterprise beat our city hands down. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Top-down Singapore, on the other hand, is just beginning to encourage a greater creative spirit among its 4.25 million population. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In the republic, many big businesses are controlled and run by the government. In Hong Kong, the city owns next to nothing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Singaporeans generally aspire to get a degree and a high paying job, while their counterparts in Hong Kong dream of going into business and making a fortune. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Several years ago during a media forum, a newspaper editor asked for my assessment of the Hong Kong-Singapore rivalry. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The question was: "Who will win?" It is older than Singapore's independence; laissez-faire versus controlled economy, creativity against hard work and discipline, etc. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I've just returned from a six-day visit to Hong Kong's "conveyance belt" lifestyle and thought I would compare how restructuring Singapore is faring against it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Its seven million people are used to lining up even to pay bills, finishing quickly and moving on. The queues are always long. <strong>Densely populated Singapore is only slightly better; that's why we call it a fishbowl.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The frequent comparisons are understandable. Both cities were once British trading posts without natural resources whose wealth lies within their peoples. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The contrasts, too, are just as great. One post-Sept 11 difference is in security threat. I immediately felt it upon arrival. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I left behind a Singapore, which was patrolled by special police armed with sub-machineguns. In Hong Kong, policemen at Tsim Sha Tsui helped lost tourists if they're not catching criminals. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Hong Kong, under China's rule for seven years, is free of this fear.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There's no national service. China protects the city and underwrites its defence, saving it billions in defence cost. Similarly for its foreign service. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These savings strengthen its competitiveness against Singapore and every one else.<strong> But it is the people who make the main difference. They are exceedingly more entrepreneurial and creative</strong>. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>Singaporeans, on the other hand, are averse to business risks.</strong> They are generally better in their studies, make better professionals like engineers, scientists and mathematicians. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Every year, some 35,000 to 40,000 highly literate youths emerge from Singapore's education system with a one-track ambition to land a high paying job. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The island enjoys a powerful lead in the knowledge field and in skilled services - miles ahead in research and biotechnology. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Hong Kong, on the other hand, is <strong>10 years ahead in the creative fields, including movies, TV, music and fashion. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Both cities want to be Asia's New York or London,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but comparative advantage swings towards Hong Kong </span>because of its lighter censorship and greater personal liberties. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">...</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000;">Survey shows Singapore lags Japan and Hong Kong as design hub</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333;">A recent survey has shown that while local design professionals and experts rate Singapore's design hub status as fair, most cite Japan and Hong Kong as better locations for engaging in design work. <br><br>This finding from a survey conducted by Spire Research and Consulting seems to reflect the superior "brand image" of these two countries over Singapore in the creative industries. The survey involved over 40 Singapore-based respondents who are either suppliers or customers in, or experts covering, the fields of communications, environment, fashion and industrial design. * <br><br><br>The respondents ranked Singapore just above China, South Korea and Thailand for design work as a whole. South Korea is said to be catching up with Japan in terms of design output quality, while Thailand and China are associated with price competitiveness. <br><br>The general sentiment of respondents is that South Korea, Thailand and China have the potential to catch up with or even surpass Singapore as design hubs. <br><br>Ratings for competitiveness of Singapore design work <br><br>Most respondents felt that Singapore design work has met the basic requirements. Some also believed Singapore possessed a pool of design talent with potential for greater development. <br><br>However, none of the respondents was optimistic about Singapore becoming a design hub in the short-term: <br><br>? More than 50 per cent of the respondents rated the quality of Singapore design work as reasonable and efficient <br>? Approximately 20 per cent also pointed out that Singapore had a ready pool of IT talent, which is advantageous for the design industry <br>? Over 90 per cent of respondents believed that Singapore designers still lack creativity and international exposure <br>? A frequently cited observation was that the work of Singapore designers reflected a "lack of identity" <br>? High labor costs and the lack of a nurturing environment for creativity were also cited as inhibiting factors <br>? More than 50 per cent of respondents felt the market for design in Singapore was too small and consumers generally had a preference for foreign design works <br>? Respondents rated Singapore design work on various attributes as follows: <br><br>Attributes of Singapore design output <br>Mean Score (on scale of 1-7, 1 being the best) <br>Creativity 3.6 <br>Aesthetic Sense 3.7 <br>Pride in Producing Quality Work 3.5 <br><br>? When asked to cite the most competitive countries in the Asia Pacific for design work outside of Singapore, Japan emerged as the clear winner, cited by 72 per cent of respondents, followed at a distance by Hong Kong (31 per cent) and China (28 per cent). South Korea (10 per cent) and Thailand (7 per cent) were a distant 4th and 5th place <br><br>• While some respondents had experience of procuring or providing design work outside Singapore, most respondents might have been guided by impressions of the "design brand image" of these countries, based on published opinion and the views of industry colleagues <br><br>? In terms of pure quality of work, Japan received the highest mean score <br><br>Quality of design work done in countries <br>Mean Score (1-7, 1 being the best) <br>Japan 1.7 <br>Hong Kong 2.7 <br><strong>Singapore 3.6</strong> <br>Thailand 3.8 <br><br>Expert views on Singapore design work <br><br>The experts interviewed for this survey included faculty at leading universities and senior executives of design associations. These experts registered the following opinions: <br><br>? 70 per cent believed that the volume of design work commissioned in Singapore was increasing <br>? High costs, poor creativity and a weak sense of "identity" were the top reasons cited for commissioning design work overseas <br>? Some experts felt that Singaporeans were generally reluctant to consider design as a profession, thus limiting Singapore's potential as a design hub <br><br>What more can be done to position Singapore as a design hub? <br><br>? Nearly 60 per cent believed that the Singapore design sector was young and more organic development was needed before Singapore could aspire to be a design hub <br>? 50 per cent of the respondents felt that the current education system neglected the arts, particularly at the primary and secondary levels. They felt that the arts should be introduced at a younger age within the education system, so as to better nurture budding local talents <br>? The local designers surveyed wanted more support from local consumers for "designed in Singapore" products <br>? When asked what else the Singapore government and the design industry could do, respondents were mostly non-committal. Many felt that organic development should be allowed to take place, while some commented that: <br>• the government should provide financial support to designers wherever possible, for example through project-specific grants and access to funding for start-ups <br>• government and industry should support scholarships and exchange programs aimed at nurturing young designers <br>• local designers felt that the government should encourage more spending on local labels by awarding major projects to local firms, thus assisting them in gaining brand name recognition. <br><br>Conclusions <br><br>The community of customers and suppliers of design work in Singapore feel that the local design industry is doing a decent job. However in terms of its ambitions to become an international design hub, Singapore needs to start by being an Asia Pacific hub, and here it is in danger of being sandwiched by Japan and Hong Kong on the one hand and countries like Korea, Thailand and China on the other. <br><br>• Japan and Hong Kong are consistently associated with the best quality of design work, perhaps due to the associations these countries have with the creative industries as a result of their strong entertainment, fashion and merchandizing sectors. Japan's top ranking suggests that high labor costs need not inhibit the flourishing of the design industry <br><br>• Korea, Thailand and China are cited as up-and-coming design locations that can leverage lower labor costs as well as indigenous cultural traditions that are seen to benefit design creativity </span></p>

              <p>I think Lionoisy is forgetting that Hong Kong's sophistication as a market is way ahead of Singapore by many orders of magnitude.</p>
              <p>Lest he forgets, the US is our no.2 trading partner. A fall in demand from the US is going to hit us quite badly. There are many things happening now that will change the dynamics of trade very soon. One of the things that I have read in say NYTimes is that export trade from the US had such an all time high in recent times, that there is a shortage in containers to export. With oil prices going higher, there stands a chance that some manufacturing will return to the US, and anyone with a decent common sense (which i'm sure some here lack) know what that means.</p>

              <p>lionnoisy, sounds like you have a case of serious inferiority complex about our country.</p>
              <p>Only a person with inferiority complex sees the need to go about trying to find each and every single thing we are "better" in, even if the thing itself means very little.</p>
              <p>Are you trying to compensate for Singapore in something?</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>An <strong>inferiority complex</strong>, in the fields of <a title="Psychology" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Psychology"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">psychology</span></span></a> and <a title="Psychoanalysis" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Psychoanalysis"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">psychoanalysis</span></span></a>, is a feeling that one is inferior to others in some way. Such feelings can arise from an imagined or actual inferiority in the afflicted person. It is often subconscious, and is thought to drive afflicted individuals to overcompensate, resulting either in spectacular achievement or extreme antisocial behavior, or both. Unlike a normal feeling of inferiority, which can act as an incentive for achievement, an inferiority complex is an advanced state of discouragement, often resulting in a retreat from difficulties.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is the wage paid to
              the 7-Eleven staffer in Hong Konger any guide to the wages of
              any worker across the service industry ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Have you ever wondered how the
              HongKongers can survive in their supposedly costlier environment at
              your speculated lower wages, and yet without any Political Party to
              drive the Hongkongers - they will collectively achieved such
              spectacular growth that the Singapore Ministers' can only dream of
              - despite being given the "Million Dollar crutch" that they need to
              prevent corruption in their ranks ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Are the Public Housing in Hong
              Kong less affordable than Singapore's HDB  units - which the
              lower income groups of Singapore continue to be dependent on
              rentals, despite the Government efforts to increase home-ownership
              ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At the prices that the Singapore
              Government "fixed" the various prices for Goods and Services - and
              Public Housing - that Singaporean are made to depend on
              the monopolistic controls of the Government, and despite a
              supposedly better wages for the lower income - should we need
              to wonder how Hong Kong manage a lower Consumer Price Index in
              January 2008, when Singapore hit a 25-year record for our CPI at
              6.6% ?</span></p>
