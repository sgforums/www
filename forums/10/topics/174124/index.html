            <div class='col-md body'>(PAP has exploited the original concept of the GRC) Â– a serious problemÂ…<br><br>Govt all for contests among serious candidates<br>Jan 14, 2006<br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/forum/story/0,5562,364934,00.html?<br><br>Â“I REFER to the letter, 'More contests in coming election, please' (ST, Jan 12), by Mr Harry Lim Cheng Chwee.<br><br>The Government encourages contests in elections, so that issues can be debated, and voters can make a conscious choice as to who should be their MP and which party should form the next government.Â”<br>&gt;&gt; Actions speak louder then wordsÂ… (Uncontested seats in GE: 1988 (GRC 1st introduced): 11/81; 2001 (6cand.GRC introduced):55/ 84) now tell me honestly- why did the govt stray away from the initial principle of 4 cand. GRCs?- and how do walkover elections enable Â‘debateÂ’/ Â‘conscious choiceÂ’?<br>&gt;&gt; max of 16 x 4 memb GRC (16x 4= 64 cand.) 20 x SSC (tot=84seat parliament)- will encourage OP participation, enforce racial balance and encourage livelier debate.<br>&gt;&gt;Last minute revelation of election boundaries make it impossible for smaller parties to debate constituency issues- ind give obvious advantage to the incumbent.<br>&gt;&gt; Â‘Conscious choiceÂ’ would not be possible if citizens are not given adequate time/ opportunity post boundary declaration- to know their MP contestants.<br><br>Â“However, these must be contests between serious candidates offering serious alternatives, not contests with straw men just for the sake of having a contest.Â”<br>&gt;&gt; You already have in place the $13,500 deposit requirement that unwelcome candidates would looseÂ… (It would be telling if a PAP candidate lost to a Â‘straw manÂ’ )<br>&gt;&gt; PAP is not interested in moral credibility/ happy to just walkover? Â– DoesnÂ’t winning elections properly add credibility to authority Â– a Â‘SeriousÂ’ advantage for SG leaders?<br>&gt;&gt; Before accusing the OP of irrelevancy, shouldnÂ’t the ruling party show some moral decency by rectifying its unfair, monopolistic practices?<br>Â“In any case, whether constituencies are contested depends not on the Government, but on the opposition parties.Â”<br>&gt;&gt; mmm- set an unfair rule- then say- opp (small parties) are losers who cannot afford to participateÂ… this practice is despicable!!!<br>&gt;&gt; The Govt has so disadvantaged opposition representation, no wonder that disenfranchised SGporeans have become depressed and apathetic. There is an atmosphere of fear of the ruling gov, making many shun contact with opposition parties.<br>&gt;&gt;Current situation is that 6member GRCs benefit NO one else but the PAPÂ… 4memb GRCs was originally invented to ensure 25% minority representationÂ… but its application has since been exploited...  pls return to your 1st principles.<br>&gt;&gt; Common- you said no one would be left behind- then donÂ’t be elitist, give everyone a chance to participate/ vote/ speakÂ… may we all decide upon a common futureÂ…<br><br>The minimum number of Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) is set out in the Constitution.<br>&gt;&gt; PAP govt can decide on changes to the constitution rite?<br>&gt;&gt; Too small a number would disadvantage independents fr participating. If IÂ’m correct in PAP(41%) vs A(40%), vs B(14%), vs C(5%)- PAP wins; but the ratio of PAP(45%) vs A(55%) would be much different without the dilution of non-PAP votes. Small numbers of SSCs disadvantage an increase in opposition participation against the incumbent.<br><br>The actual number of SMCs created is decided by the Electoral Boundary Review Committee.<br>&gt;&gt; DonÂ’t they receive instructions from the govt/ constitution?- Gov also pays their salary rite?<br><br>But whether the same area is split up into multiple SMCs or combined into one Group Representation Constituency (GRC), it takes the same number of candidates to contest it.<br>&gt;&gt; Might as well have a rule making the election deposit $1million- (it is refunded if the candidate receives at least 15% of votes)Â… then say that because the amount is often returnedÂ… then the net cost of participation is maybe &lt;$100 admin fee etcÂ…<br><br>A serious opposition party therefore should have no difficulty organizing its candidates into teams to contest GRCs, as indeed some have done in recent elections.<br>&gt;&gt; You set the rules, you invent a standard to suite larger parties, and you will turn GE2006 into another bad memory Saturday for many in years to comeÂ…<br><br>Â“These parties have not been able to contest more seats not because of the GRC system, but because they have not found credible candidates to offer the electorate.Â”<br>&gt;&gt; You have made opposition representation difficult, your rules and policies unfairly disadvantage the opposition. Now U blame themÂ… how unfair! ...<br>&gt;&gt; Sad the guilty donÂ’t realizeÂ… didnÂ’t TT Durai Â‘orchestrateÂ’ his own downfall?<br>&gt;&gt; GRCs force opposition candidates to run under unnecessarily large party groupings- and 6 members are too many to put in one basket, as I said: roughly 16 x 4 and 20 x SSC would be a fairer proportion.<br>&gt;&gt; GRCs allow PAP to take advantage of its Ministers stature to win GRC votes during elections&gt; an unfair political advantage especially in 6memb GRC constituencies (16 x 4memb GRCs are ok w meÂ…)Â…<br><br>Court cases after elections arise only if individuals have been defamed during the elections, and have to sue to clear their names.<br>The best way to avoid these court cases is for candidates not to defame their opponents in the heat of the election campaign.<br>Chen Hwai Liang<br>Press Secretary to Prime Minister<br><br>Disclaimer: a/m are facts gained from reading others postings on the i-net and I could be misinformed. As such- any feedback/ clarification is most welcome.<br><br>(In a world of change- we need the best representation: PAP may have worked before: but I do not think it has all the correct answers for the future of Singapore- we need a balance of ideas, not a party whip deciding all directions for our little country-.).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Well, he actually took up the challenge and to me he put his position on the line and that is honor. Agreed, not only did the propaganda machinery went into overdrive but so did the party. That's what people would want to see, let every single candidate go out there and convince people what they can do for them. Not hide behind a technicality and claim that you have got the mandate or that the opposition was not committed enough to compete or in not credible. I don't know about the rest but everytime the people in power gloat about their acheivement or about the overrall (%) strong mandate for the winner, I get a sick feeling deep inside, which leads to a disillution of the whole system. No matter what you call it...gerrymandering, equal representation, minority rights..you know it simply a simple word starting with a "C" and its not creative or credible[/quote]</div>
