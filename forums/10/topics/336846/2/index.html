              <p>Do you know how to read the 'Billing' in this Thread, or are your thought process and vision controlled by your knee jerks ?</p>
              <p>Singapore is as strong an ally to the USA as the leaders of the nine countries whom Obama called - Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Mexico and South Korea - more so when the Singapore Leadership had given unstinting support to most US policies as much as Australia, Britain, and Israel despite our size.</p>
              <p>Canada, France, Germany, and Mexico had broken ranks with the USA on more political and military issues then Singapore has supported; while Japan and South Korea were even more selective.</p>
              <p>Despite the unstinting support from SG as an ally - did any US Administration showed the same level of appreciation to SG ?</p>
              <p>Only you will pull the wool over your own eyes to believe that <em>"SG leader dunt need American to endorse that SG is important".</em></p>
              <p>What possibly could be the reason for LKY to desparately build a deep sea naval base in Changi that can accomodate a US Navy aircraft carrier - and annoy every  South-east Asian countries, when all had wanted the US Military out of the ASEAN region ?</p>
              <p>Was it not a fact that LKY was promoting SG to be an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>important</em></span> lynch-pin in the US Global reach ?</p>
              <p>Surely, your Oz bitterness had blind-sided your views towards PM Rudd - and forgot that his first agenda as PM - was to withdraw Oz troops from Iraq, while SG's Old Man felt that it was important to fly Singapore's flag in a token appearance in Iraq - with an aerial tanker and a naval LST.</p>
              <p>Yet for all the negative claims you made, Australia is a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.expatica.com/be/articles/news/Bush-to-host-finance-crisis-summit-.html">member country of the G-8</a> while for all the self-aggrandizing claims you made about SG's wealth - we are not even a member of the G-8 or even part of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.g20.org/G20/">G-20 Countries -  </a>which included the richest Asian country - China, and the poorest - Indonesia.</p>
              <p>From the calls made by Obama to the 9 leaders - are you suggesting that the other nine countries are poorer, while Singapore is far richer than them ?</p>
              <p>From your typical stance taken in this SgForum, you will probably turn a blind eye to the fact that it is the Singapore Government that is rich, while Singaporeans are the poorer lot.</p>
              <p>Conversely, the US Government may have incurred a shocking huge national debt that have gained notoriety, many like you have largely ignored the other fact that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ifsl.org.uk/upload/PB_Private_Wealth_2007.pdf">Private Wealth in the USA  </a>far surpass the Singapore National Reserves or the size of the US National Debt.</p>
              <p>The reason for the USA still standing strong - despite the present chaotic economic and financial melt-down - is due largely to its inner strength - compared  to the Asian financial crisis of 1997, when many Asian economies were shaken to its core that resulted in total financial collapse in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and South Korea.</p>
              <p>Despite the present US financial melt-down, the US Dollar remains solid vis-a-vis other currencies, and is still used as a Reserve Currency by many countries.</p>
              <p>The solid Gold Bars locked up in Fort Knox remains untouched.</p>
              <p>The stupidity and greed of the World Financial Community in swallowing all that the ingenious US Financial System had created - reveal the smartness of not utilising their own internal resources, but to incur the losses onto others.</p>
              <p>The US Lehman Brothers had the biggest investment fund subscribers from Asian investors, and the biggest losers of the collapse of Lehman Brothers were Asians not US Citizens.</p>
              <p>In your anxiety to blow the horn so loudly on behalf of the SG Government, can you even begin to understand the politics that have been played by the US Private Financial Institutions on the World Community - when the US financial system was de-regulated by the Bush Administration ?</p>
              <p>Can we trust your abilitly to differentiate between the debt incurred by the US Private Financial Institutions with the US Government Bonds issued by the US Government ?</p>
              <p>From your skewed views of Oz, it will be benefit you more if you start re-reading and try to look into the deeper meanings behind <a rel="nofollow" href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080810154914AAonUO9">The Wizard of Oz.  </a></p>

              <p>Can we be one people - when the political leadership sees Singaporeans as those who are Talented being more superior and are more equal than those who are less Talented, or without any Talent ?</p>
              <p>You constantly rant about others being tin-pot wannabe despots, even as you express cynicism to these "wanna-be despots" exposing the "present tinpot despots" for all their scandalous policies and despicable acts.</p>
              <p>Yet you will claim to oppose the "present tinpot despots" for the same reasons but prefer in-action on your own part.</p>
              <p>If the Government has caused the citizen to suffer from stress related diarrhea, should it not be expected for the Government to wipe our arse - and even if they are not expected to wipe our arse, should it not be expected that the least to be done is for them to provide the toilet papers ?</p>
              <p>Can we trust a narcissist to leave the hawker blameless for causing food-poisoning ?</p>
              <p>We certainly can trust your judgment in your comparison of "the fool expecting the MP's wages to settle a gambling debt" to those who sacrifice the "future of their careers and the future of their families' simply to be "wannabe tinpot despots".</p>
              <p>Surely you must be an entrenched <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Narcissist">“narcissist”</a> made worst by your cynicism towards anyone, or any issues that offends your own inpotent inadequacies to a full life ?</p>
              <p>Can Singapore ever hope to excel from its present status, and become a true melting pot - when we have cynical narcissists around that sabotages the spirit of daring, of experimentation, and the willingness to face the unknown ?</p>
              <p>With characters like you around - no wonder LKY claim that Singaporeans lack the talent and the entrepreneurship and allowed him to cling on to power since 1957.</p>
