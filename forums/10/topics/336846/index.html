              <p>Why would Singapore even need a leader of historic proportions? Singapore just needs someone who can step on the necks on anyone who rocks the boat. We have a good thing here in Singapore and it wasn't by saying excuse me and giving seats to old ladies that we got to where we are today. Why do you think there is a cult-of-Hitler here in Singapore?</p>

              <p>He's not promising or dreaming about anything in his speech, but
              extolling the virtues of the political system in US and also the power
              of self-belief.</p>
              <p>Obama is saying that because there is "no fear of retribution in the political process" (either racial or political in his generation). That's why he is able to realize his dreams of being president of the most powerful country in the world as a black, when as recent as 40 years ago would not have been even allowed to sit on the same bus with whites or even study in the same school.</p>

              <p>The true genius of America lies in recognising that other than Criminals, the biggest threat to human rights is the unlimited power of the government.

              <p>In America you have people free to do anything except that which is illegal, the Government, free to do only few actions which is legally allowed to do. In SG it is the <strong>Exact opposite</strong>.</p>

              <p>If the government was erroneous, I am sure the Straits Time, Mediacorp, Newpaper, etc, would expose them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
