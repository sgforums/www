              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: A survey of new citizens and Permanent Residents has thrown up some positive results. <br><br>Of the 360 newcomers polled by a work group from government feedback vehicle REACH, close to 78 per cent said they feel welcomed in Singapore. <br><br>New citizens, who have to pledge their allegiance at such ceremonies have been in the spotlight recently. <br><br>The Singapore government is now focused on getting them to integrate better into society. <br><br>Of the 360 surveyed, 88 per cent said they don't have problems communicating with Singaporeans. <br><br>95 per cent said they would recommend Singapore as a place to live in and another 91 per cent intend to work here over the next five years. <br><br>The survey also found that many of them did not have any problems adjusting to Singapore's political system and the civic rules and regulations in the country. <br><br>Furthermore eight of ten surveyed supported the concept of national service in Singapore. <br><br>However, some of them came up against some resistance. <br><br>Dr Terence Chong, REACH Workgroup on Population and Integration, said: "There are still some new citizens who feel that they are unwanted competition in the workplace. They also feel that there are higher expectations placed on them because they are new citizens and PRs and so these needs to be addressed. <br><br>“You need a variety of ways. Education is important. You need to foster a sense of inclusiveness and for new citizens it is important to get them to realise Singapore's historical heritage and the importance of multiculturalism as well.” <br><br>The workplace is also the subject of another work group on economic issues. <br><br>It is urging the government to go easy on withdrawing the fiscal stimulus measures announced in the government's Budget. <br><br>Dr Chua Hak Bin, REACH Workgroup on Economic and Employment Opportunities, said: "With the recent property measures, there is fear that there would be a double blow if you withdraw a lot of stimulus measures introduced in February and there are already hints that the Jobs Credit scheme would be withdrawn and that's quite a big component - nearly four billion. <br><br>"We have to bear in mind that could have a negative impact on the economy, perhaps a gradual withdrawal is in order." <br><br>On Tuesday, the government had said that it will announce whether to extend the Jobs Credit scheme next month. <br><br>Moving forward, REACH has decided to form three new policy work groups to address the dynamic changes in Singapore society. <br><br>They will gather feedback on healthcare, manpower and national integration and present the findings in a year. <br><br>Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, said: “We owe it to you to respond equally conscientiously to your proposals. We will ask the relevant ministries to say 'Yes', 'No' or 'Maybe' and to give your reasons for the responses. <br><br>“REACH has evolved beyond merely being a channel for feedback although feedback remains important. Today, REACH is part of the concept of deliberative democracy - a platform for responsible citizens to come together, identify the key issues, analyse data, formulate innovative policy options and ultimately co-create solutions to the many fundamental challenges we face.” - CNA/vm <br></span></p>

              <p>Why should these new citizens not be welcomed ?</p>
              <p>They have yet to realise that they are being treated as "suckers"</p>
              <p>- to maintain the political stability of the PAP by diluting the growing numbers of disgruntled original citizens;</p>
              <p> - to boost the population;</p>
              <p>- to maintain the ethnic ratio;</p>
              <p>- to contribute into the dwindling balance in the CPF that has been affected by the dwindling birth rates over the last 30 years;</p>
              <p>- to inject funds into the National Reserves, as most new citizens must have at least US$250,000 before being allowed Citizenship;</p>
              <p>- to increase consumption of the essential services provided by the Government that will boost the Annual Surplus;</p>
              <p>- to become catalyst to the Singapore economy that is spiralling into a major doldrum;</p>
              <p>- to take up the slack created by a tired, aged, and resigned original population;</p>
              <p>Will the New Citizens be as enthusiastic when they realise that the solemn ceremony taking the <strong>Singapore Pledge</strong> is no more then an "<strong>aspiration</strong>" - and not a certainty that they is to be a collective effort from the Government and the People ?</p>
              <p>They will be true Singaporeans when they become dis-illusioned like the original Citizens; and realised that they have no avenues to demonstrate - let alone to protest.</p>

              years.<br> <br> The survey also found that many of them did not have any problems
              adjusting to Singapore's political system and the civic rules and
              regulations in the country.<br> <br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Furthermore eight of ten surveyed supported the concept of national
              service in Singapore.</span><br> <br> However, some of them came up against some resistance.<br> <br> Dr Terence Chong, REACH Workgroup on Population and Integration,
              said: "There are still some new citizens who feel that they are
              unwanted competition in the workplace. They also feel that there
              are higher expectations placed on them because they are new
              citizens and PRs and so these needs to be addressed.<br> <br> “You need a variety of ways. Education is important. You need to
              foster a sense of inclusiveness and for new citizens it is
              important to get them to realise Singapore's historical heritage
              and the importance of multiculturalism as well.”<br> <br> The workplace is also the subject of another work group on economic
              issues.<br> <br> It is urging the government to go easy on withdrawing the fiscal
              stimulus measures announced in the government's Budget.<br> <br> Dr Chua Hak Bin, REACH Workgroup on Economic and Employment
              Opportunities, said: "With the recent property measures, there is
              fear that there would be a double blow if you withdraw a lot of
              stimulus measures introduced in February and there are already
              hints that the Jobs Credit scheme would be withdrawn and that's
              quite a big component - nearly four billion.<br> <br> "We have to bear in mind that could have a negative impact on the
              economy, perhaps a gradual withdrawal is in order."<br> <br> On Tuesday, the government had said that it will announce whether
              to extend the Jobs Credit scheme next month.<br> <br> Moving forward, REACH has decided to form three new policy work
              groups to address the dynamic changes in Singapore society.<br> <br> They will gather feedback on healthcare, manpower and national
              integration and present the findings in a year.<br> <br> Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian
              Balakrishnan, said: “We owe it to you to respond equally
              conscientiously to your proposals. We will ask the relevant
              ministries to say 'Yes', 'No' or 'Maybe' and to give your reasons
              for the responses.<br> <br> “REACH has evolved beyond merely being a channel for feedback
              although feedback remains important. Today, REACH is part of the
              concept of deliberative democracy - a platform for responsible
              citizens to come together, identify the key issues, analyse data,
              formulate innovative policy options and ultimately co-create
              solutions to the many fundamental challenges we face.” -
