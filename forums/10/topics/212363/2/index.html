            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm the malaysians i spoke to agree with LKY's statements.  there are the preferential policies. then there is the preferential education system. then there is the preferential allocation of business contracts.  seems loads of things in malaysia a stacked to favour the bumiputras.  from what i know (ive hardly done a census or anything), most of the chinese there do not like the system. it was half amusing and half disconcerting to see how racist a bus driver i talked to while in malaysia had become due to the system there.<br><br>not related to systematic marginalisation is the fact that one of my friends has gone as far as to say that members of his extended family in malaysia have been victims of violent crime (in his words) by virtue of their (chinese) race.  i don't know anything about indonesia beyond my maid telling me that it is unsafe for chinese in most parts of the country.</div>

We are seeking clarification from the Singaporean side and we are still waiting for it,' he said.<br><br>At a dialogue for good governance on Sept 15, Mr Lee had said that it was important for Singapore to have a government that was 'really firm, stout-hearted, subtle and resolute'.<br><br>He noted that the attitude of Malaysia and Indonesia towards the Republic was shaped by the way they treated their own ethnic Chinese minorities.<br><br>Mr Lee said: 'My neighbours both have problems with their Chinese. They are successful, they're hard-working and therefore they are systematically marginalised, even in education.'<br><br>The two nations 'want Singapore, to put it simply, to be like their Chinese - compliant', said Mr Lee.<br><br>Only three per cent of Indonesia's 220 million population is ethnically Chinese.<br><br>But members of the minority group are disproportionately powerful players in the economy.<br><br>Chinese Indonesians faced systematic barriers during the 32 years of President Suharto's rule that ended in 1998.<br><br>The situation has improved since and many discriminatory regulations have been revoked. -- REUTERS<br><br></div>

I'm sure some Africans are also happy in their respective countries even though their economies are poor. I wouldn't go as far to say that most Malaysian Chinese are, but if you compare Malaysian Chinese and Singapore Chinese, then probably a larger percentage of our Malaysian counterparts would like to leave their country because of the Bumiputra policies.</div>
