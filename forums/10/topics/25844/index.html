            <div class='col-md body'>Laser, I take it to mean that my input is requested? You're making me blush!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>This has always been a thorny issue between the 2 sides, and to be honest, I don't believe I'll be able to give a totally unbiased opinion on this matter, after all theres the small matter of me being Singaporean and having been so for more than a quarter of a century. (Geez I really make myself sound old!)<br><br>Well, in a nutshell, I do believe that the original agreement is an anachrnism and was overdue for renegotiation. The price we were paying for the raw was way too low, and too skewed in our favour. However this was offset by the lower rates they paid for the treated water.<br><br>Which does beg the question. If they have been unhappy all this while, why let the issue fester till it became open disagreement? Why not talk about it long ago? As it is, now Malaysia wants a quantum jump in price, which makes it look a lot more unpalatable on our point of view. Wouldn't it have made more sense to negotiate earlier and agree to ramp up the price slowly.<br><br>It only adds a feeling in me that the government over there does not have the foresight to plan for long term, instead focusing only on issues which are staring them in the face.<br><br>Some have said Singapores recent introduction of Newater, which makes Singapore no longer dependent on Malaysia on its water, as a bad omen for relations, as it removes one more area of do-dependence. Bullshit, water has indeed been a factor linking Singapore and Malaysia, but this factor has been of late more of a sticking point, rather than common ground between the 2 countries. A cancer is also part of ones body, but does one not remove the cancer because of this reason?<br><br>Singapore's removal of the reliance on Malaysia of water only removes a frequent source of tension and a blight on the relationship. I feel if both sides are willing to work together, it will mean better relations both sides of the Causeway.<br><br>PS. As usual, the jibes from the Gutter Press and Two-Bit politicians on Newater are not helping. They're not seeing the big picture, but based on track record, its nothing new<br><br></div>
