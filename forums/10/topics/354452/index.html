              <p>Foreign students in Australia being exploited for profit: Report <br><br><br>By Roger Maynard, Australia Correspondent<br><br>SYDNEY: International students in Australia are often given misleading information by overseas recruitment companies and frequently exploited in the workplace, a new report has claimed.<br><br>The report, which looked into the way the international student community is treated in Australia, has raised concerns about the lack of affordable accommodation and underpayment by employers, among other things.<br><br>The study, by The Overseas Student Experience Taskforce, focused on the state of Victoria and was instigated in September in the wake of media and word-of-mouth criticism about local conditions.<br><br>International education is Victoria's biggest service export, and as many as 133,000 foreign post-secondary, vocational and higher education students contributed an estimated A$3.9 billion (S$3.8 billion) to the state's economy last year.<br><br>Highlighting what it considered to be one of the central issues facing these students, the taskforce report said many of them fall victim to Australia's ban on foreign students working more than 20 hours a week.<br><br>Most work beyond the stipulated hours and live in constant fear of being reported to the authorities.<br><br>'The consequence is often that overseas students are at risk of workplace exploitation as they fear they will be reported to the immigration authorities and then deported,' the report said.<br><br>An example of workplace discrimination it mentioned was the case where, for the same job, an Australian student was paid A$14 an hour and an overseas student A$9.<br><br>According to the Union for Fast Food and Retail Workers, this was only the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>In a submission to the taskforce, the union revealed the case of a Chinese student who worked for 20 days on a trial basis in a 7-Eleven franchise and alleged that the owner manipulated the books to misrepresent the number of hours worked for pay received.<br><br>'These kinds of horror stories should not, by now, be news to government,' the union said.<br><br>'The 20-hour work restriction, coupled with the lack of avenues for international students to come forward to complain about breaches of workplace rights, has created a thriving black market in which gross underpayment of wages, fraud by employers, bullying and intimidation of international student workers thrives,' it added in its submission.<br><br>In response, the taskforce recommended that students who performed well academically should be permitted to work for more than 20 hours a week.<br><br>It also recommended that education institutions be required to provide access to affordable and appropriate housing for overseas student in their first six to 12 months in Victoria.<br><br>On the question of offshore recruitment agencies providing misleading information, like favourable long-term visa outcomes, the inquiry urged the authorities to set up a register of education agents.<br><br>Australia's Immigration Minister has already pledged to widen legislative powers to tackle the problem.<br><br>While the taskforce's brief did not look at the standard of teaching in Victoria, the report does recommend 'an effective and responsive quality-control process...recognising that Victoria's reputation for quality is hard won and can be easily tarnished'.<br><br>The study comes hot on the heels of last week's federal Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education, which claimed that foreign students were all too often regarded as cash cows used to bolster budgets for domestic students and research.<br><br> <br><br>This article was first published in The Straits Times on 23 Dec, 2008.</p>

              <p>i do not think likewise, because the living expen for rent + food ect for me did not exceed 500 per month. But this was during the late 90s. I think now it just slightly went up , but still manageable. In Victoria now i think it shoud be averaging around $600.In low popualtion areas like Tasmania it will be cheaper but comparing to major cities like Melbourne and Sydney, convienience and transport is an issue.</p>

U Call singaporean students stupid for going overseas to study?. They pay the same amount for a car in SG + they get a cheap Aust car for $2K-5K to drive around there. Is it u or them is stupid.

              <p>Considring education is a worthy investment in one's life. The universities in Aust are not build by govt. They are bonafide institutions which receive funding from govt. The school fees not fatten their politicians, it is being used to pay for lecturers in the Unis.</p>
              <p>Do u think OZ citizens are subsidised, they are not. They only pay a smaller amount when they enter the unis and they have to compete with international students too. They will be paying the remainder and more than us through taxes when they go out and work.</p>

              <p><br>In here, we can use CPF mah, yet got govt subsidize, why need to go overseas?? Want to show off ar??? Last time, u go overseas people said WOW!!! ang mo trained, father must be damn rich, in today context, you go overseas most probably is due to you cannot make it into Singapore U. And today, we got alots of foreign university doing courses locally just to earn some money from us. So, why need to go overseas?? We should go overseas only to do business or for tour, for study??? dun give me the bull, unless you are doing PhD or master whereby you need to complete a certain project that needs overseas exposure, than, that is different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U should know our space constraint here, but we got good transport system here, and everything is very easily accessible, unlike Oz, buy one lipstick only, have to travel 1 hr or so...why compare our car prices when across the strait, indo and malaysia is lagi cheap. And bear in mind how many of our goondo students died on the road in OZ, those aussie truckers are reckless drivers, who cares so much of yellow skinned singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Of course it is different.</p>
              <p>But well, NUS offers opportunities to enrich yourself beyond studying in Singapore. There's internship like most unis, and there's Student Exchange Programmes to top universities in Europe, USA, China, Japan, etc, and Immersion Trips... These are programmes which I have participated in. And Student Exchange Programmes are subsidized for deserving students.</p>
              <p>In addition, my friends have also partipated in programmes in which they are attached to work in new start-ups in Silicon Valley, where they get to work and learn with some of the leaders in the industry, while at the same time, handle studies at universities like Stanford.</p>
              <p>Not only that, I managed to even take lessons in NUS on basic political analysis, basic accounting, basic Japanese language, and learn the German language (5 modules out of 6).</p>
              <p>On top of that, there's still time for me to give tuition locally and that built up my experience in the industry for 4 extra years.</p>
              <p>Indeed, "STUDYING IN NUS IS NOT THE SAME AS IN A COUNTRY LIKE OZ"</p>

              <p>Of course it is different.</p>
              <p>But well, NUS offers opportunities to enrich yourself beyond studying in Singapore. There's internship like most unis, and there's Student Exchange Programmes to top universities in Europe, USA, China, Japan, etc, and Immersion Trips... These are programmes which I have participated in. And Student Exchange Programmes are subsidized for deserving students.</p>
              <p>In addition, my friends have also partipated in programmes in which they are attached to work in new start-ups in Silicon Valley, where they get to work and learn with some of the leaders in the industry, while at the same time, handle studies at universities like Stanford.</p>
              <p>Not only that, I managed to even take lessons in NUS on basic political analysis, basic accounting, basic Japanese language, and learn the German language (5 modules out of 6).</p>
              <p>On top of that, there's still time for me to give tuition locally and that built up my experience in the industry for 4 extra years.</p>
              <p>Indeed, "STUDYING IN NUS IS NOT THE SAME AS IN A COUNTRY LIKE OZ"</p>
