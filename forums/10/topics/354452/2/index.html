              <p>Of course it is different.</p>
              <p>But well, NUS offers opportunities to enrich yourself beyond
              studying in Singapore. There's internship like most unis, and
              there's Student Exchange Programmes to top universities in Europe,
              USA, China, Japan, etc, and Immersion Trips... These are programmes
              which I have participated in. And Student Exchange Programmes are
              subsidized for deserving students.</p>
              <p>In addition, my friends have also partipated in programmes in
              which they are attached to work in new start-ups in Silicon Valley,
              where they get to work and learn with some of the leaders in the
              industry, while at the same time, handle studies at universities
              like Stanford.</p>
              <p>Not only that, I managed to even take lessons in NUS on basic
              political analysis, basic accounting, basic Japanese language, and
              learn the German language (5 modules out of 6).</p>
              <p>On top of that, there's still time for me to give tuition
              locally and that built up my experience in the industry for 4 extra
              years.</p>
              <p>Indeed, "STUDYING IN NUS IS NOT THE SAME AS IN A COUNTRY LIKE
              OZ"</p>

              <p>That's too bad for you, since you are telling us you want things the easy way out. It makes your degree even more worthless because you don't learn as much things <strong>because they don't want you to</strong>.</p>
              <p>And it's not whether they want me to take more modules a not; I want to learn that many things. And I took more modules than required because I want to learn.</p>
              <p>I have no idea why you would feel sorry for me for learning and knowing more things in NUS, because NUS wants it, and because I wanted it too.</p>

              <p>yes, one cannot be a CEO of a compnay without a degree - in Singapore. But you go look at China.

              <p>And Mark Zuckerberg, my example, did not invent any interface. In fact, his idea of creating the networking program Facebook was done before by Friendster before.</p>

              <p>And Bill Gates did not invent the first OS. He <strong>bought over</strong> MS-DOS.</p>

              <p>If you are so particular about degrees, you should know that a degree from an Oz uni which do not want you to learn much things is definitely worthless as compared to a degree from NUS which wants you to learn more things, especially in Singapore.</p>
