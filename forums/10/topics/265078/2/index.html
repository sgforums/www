A friend's boutique in Raffles Place has increased price on the quiet too. A business owner's mentality would be: "I am not running a charity here. I aim for profit. Why should I bear the brunt of the GST increase for other people?"<br><br>Did the PAP foresee this coming? The very act of raising GST to help the poor has caused a ripple effect on prices across the nation. Still helping the poor?<br><br>Think about the recent McDonald's advertisement on TV....where the auntie selling tissues says that "the price of tissue has gone up".<br><br>Vision of the PAP? Surely they had it but the monopoly of their power has made them slacken. The tendency to think of easy solutions as the way out has become commonplace.

            <div class='col-md body'>from what i see, Gazelle is the type of people that really support what the govt is doing. let's say 1 day the govt tell us " citizen of singapore, i'm afraid i can't let you take out your CPF as we minister need it to increase our salary and help the poor".
