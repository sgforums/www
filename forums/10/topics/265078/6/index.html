            <div class='col-md body'>The main point is that increase is not exactly 2%. It is more than 2%. Example the chicken rice is $2 , they increase to $2.50. They will never increase to $2.10 or $2.20. It more than 2% increase. After a few years, they increase another few percent. They increase another 50 cents. Accumulated, it more than the value increased. Not many people will calculate the exact increase every time when buying things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are my final observations on the impact of the GST on the common Singaporean (pls ignore all million dollar earning ministers, whom don't feel the pinch)<br><br>1) GST on goods from retailers that charge GST.<br>Most products that are sold with the charge of +2% GST do not seemed to have an increase in the original prices. Therefore, I am guessing that, since they can collect and redeem GST from the govt, these retailers are more likely to keep prices as they are<br><br>2) GST on goods from retailers that do not charge GST<br>This is a cost to the retailer, since they cannot redeem GST incurred from the Govt. As a result, they have to pass on the costs.<br>In all fairness we CANNOT say this is GST profiteering, but is more seen as passing on of costs from the retailer to the consumer.<br><br>Have you all noticed, that what has gone up mostly? Hawker food's prices. Tea, Coffee, your noodles, etc, all up from anywhere between 10cents to 50 cents. These are PRECISELY what the poor consumes the most, and NOT those retailers that charge GST<br><br>So till now, I still cannot fathom how the Govt is helping the poor, since GST hits the poor's pockets the most? *blur*</div>
