            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by matleep:</div><div class="quote_body">hard to explain. but basically if every company is GST-registered, then we pay only 7% GST. Depending on the situation, we could pay more than 7% or even less than that. let me show a situation where it is less.<br><br>Company A, a non GST-registered company, buys its goods for $107 which $7 is GST. He sells them for $207. So only $7 is paid as GST and the selling price is $200. Thus, GST is only 3.5%!</div></blockquote>Hi Matleep<br><br>I am unsure if your above example works.<br><br>Basically, the end product's GST is dependent on the price of the final good that is sold. The price of the final good is never impacted by the GSTs incurred by the companies in the supply chains, but more so by profiteering on the companies' parts.<br><br>So if you go to your above example, it is not really correct to say that you only incur 3.5%. The basic idea of business is to buy for 1 and sell for 2. So technically, if a business cannot claim GST, they would write that into their costs.<br><br>So assuming market conditions allow it, he would sell perhaps at $214 (and not $207), and then impose a 7% on $214.<br><br>If he is a GST registered company, then he could claim $7 GST from the $107 cost, and then instead of calculating it into his costs, remove that, and sell his goods at $200 (Excl GST) (buy for 1 sell for 2), which would then be cheaper for the customers.<br><br>Of coz you have companies that claim $7, and then still include that $7 into his base cost computation. That's why I find it fishy that Case could investigate the cases. Its really difficult to decipher between price increases due to GST profiteering and true GST impact, becoz there are many ways to hide the cost computation of a product</div>

He's too noisy and tends to screw up discussions.<br><br>There is another carrot cake at a coffeeshop opposite the road where the Braddell MRT is located, that is also nice, beside the 24 hours MacDonalds. Try both and let me know which one you think its better (I tend to think this coffeeshop carrot cake is nicer than the other, but is more expensive)<br><br>Anyway, the problem is, I find hawkers sometimes work on peer pressure. You have prices raised by 50 cents, then you have customers that don't respond by staying away. And then these hawkers survive, and those that maintain their prices would be tempted to raise their prices as well.<br><br>Also I refer to my other points. I observed a few retailers also secretly round their prices to the nearest 5 cents (usually up), which I find its profiteering. And you have customers that don't stay away coz they think a few cents is not impt.<br></div>
