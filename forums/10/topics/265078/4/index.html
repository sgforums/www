I am making my observations of some of the issues of this GST rise, anyone is free to support/contest my views<br><br>1) GST up by 2% is NOT price increase by 2%<br>I find that quite a bunch of Singaporeans are really stupid in this. They think that, assuming a product is $10 (excludes 5% GST of 0.50) now, then the increase of the product price after GST implementation is by only $0.20 (since 7% GST of $10 is 0.70).<br><br>What they failed to understand is that in an end-product, there are many parts in the supply chain to this product.<br>- Some of the suppliers are not GST-registered, and thus they cannot claim GST from the govt, thereby passing the increase in GST costs from their suppliers to the next company in the chain. This will translate to an increase in costs for the next company, which will then filter down to the end-user.<br>- Changes in GST, results in system changes (for large companies) or admin costs for smaller companies in that they need to make changes to their processes to adopt the 7%. This results in higher costs for companies, and they pass it on by increasing their prices<br><br>2) Companies that sell items at prices such as $11.60, for example, cannot increase their GST amt to 7% exactly, becoz it will result in 1-cents, (for the above case, its rightfully $12.41), which most probably will round it UP ($12.45 or $12.50). Becoz Singapore doesn't use 1-cent anymore, the businesses round up prices to the nearest 5 cents<br><br>3) Some restaurants, such as Delifrance, round UP the cents to make more money (just check your receipt the next time you eat with them). They are so blatant that, even if you spent for example, $21.55 (AFTER GST), they will still round it UP to $21.60. That's why I don't eat from Delifrance. They DO NOT follow the laws of mathematics. $21.51 is STILL $21.60 (still round up)<br><br>4) Hawkers raise prices at $0.50 almost all the time. I see lots of increases already in the place I stay<br><br>End of the day, I think many people are going to suffer. The GST incentive the govt give you aren't going to last too long, given that increases are more than 2%.<br><br></div></blockquote><br>GST is not up by 2% but by 40%!  From 5% to 7% is actually 2% more on 5% which is equal to 40% increase.<br><br>Sometimes it is not feasible for vendors to increase their prices as the same %  increase in GST. Moreover there is also the snowball effect as goods pass from one supplier to another. But of course there are others who capitalised on the hike.<br><br>Ok i'll boycot Delifrance since they don't follow the laws of maths. i shall also exercise my consumer's rights by boycotting those who up their prices excessively and don't provide value for money.</div>

Technically, many commercial entities (ie.hawkers, etc) do not actually collect S$1 million in revenue to begin with and would have no business to pass on any GST costs to the consumer. That said, as with any other theoretical legislations which can never be practically and efficiently enforced, increasing prices on the pretext of an increase in operational cost is more than a sufficient excuse required for profiteering. Throw in a regime so desperate for money with little regard for safeguarding consumer interests (not at the expense of businesses anyway) and what you see is effectively the ripple-effect of ill-conceived policies.<br><br>3) Though not entirely relevant, there's actually an underlying rationale behind it. In most parts of Europe and the US, for instance, you do not actually have "official" policies whereby things like "service charges" are levied in restaurants. However, most customers - on their own free will - would take the initiative to "tip" (pretty generously, I must add) and it's a gesture which is expected from the party rendering the service (be it a waiter or a cab driver). In many parts of Asia, however, such tipping cultures are not prevalent and you see "service charges" (something I personally don't endorse as I'd much rather favour the tipping system where you're not duty-bound to tip, but that's another matter) being levied instead. In view of such " inked-on-paper " policies, I would imagine it only fair then that consumers be charged for whatever "explicitly stated" charges and they be billed right down to the cent and nothing more. What seperates other countries adopting such tangible policies of billing from Singapore is indeed the rounding off process. I concur with you that it is indeed another "uniquely Singapore" scam that many business entities which actually levy explicitly-stated charges have actually got the audacity to shamelessly profit further by rounding up - instead of rounding off - the costs passed on to the consumer. I suppose the least you could do is boycott such merchants.</span><br><br>What dragg is trying to say is that only shops/merchants with the GST certificate (ie.their annual turnover is above $1 million) are entitled to levy GST (as in, explicitly state the cost of the item and/or GST seperately) on goods/services rendered. In other words, merchants whose revenue do not exceed $1 million cannot charge GST for the goods/services rendered - of course, we all know how easily they can get round this by using other excuses to increase the cost (bottomline is, they cannot legitimately use GST as an excuse).</div>
