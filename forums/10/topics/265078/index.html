            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>The GST was just upped to 7% on Sunday (congrats to all PAP supporters who don't understand the impact). I am making my observations of some of the issues of this GST rise, anyone is free to support/contest my views<br><br>1) GST up by 2% is NOT price increase by 2%<br>I find that quite a bunch of Singaporeans are really stupid in this. They think that, assuming a product is $10 (excludes 5% GST of 0.50) now, then the increase of the product price after GST implementation is by only $0.20 (since 7% GST of $10 is 0.70).<br><br>What they failed to understand is that in an end-product, there are many parts in the supply chain to this product.<br>- Some of the suppliers are not GST-registered, and thus they cannot claim GST from the govt, thereby passing the increase in GST costs from their suppliers to the next company in the chain. This will translate to an increase in costs for the next company, which will then filter down to the end-user.<br>- Changes in GST, results in system changes (for large companies) or admin costs for smaller companies in that they need to make changes to their processes to adopt the 7%. This results in higher costs for companies, and they pass it on by increasing their prices<br><br>2) Companies that sell items at prices such as $11.60, for example, cannot increase their GST amt to 7% exactly, becoz it will result in 1-cents, (for the above case, its rightfully $12.41), which most probably will round it UP ($12.45 or $12.50). Becoz Singapore doesn't use 1-cent anymore, the businesses round up prices to the nearest 5 cents<br><br>3) Some restaurants, such as Delifrance, round UP the cents to make more money (just check your receipt the next time you eat with them). They are so blatant that, even if you spent for example, $21.55 (AFTER GST), they will still round it UP to $21.60. That's why I don't eat from Delifrance. They DO NOT follow the laws of mathematics. $21.51 is STILL $21.60 (still round up)<br><br>4) Hawkers raise prices at $0.50 almost all the time. I see lots of increases already in the place I stay<br><br>End of the day, I think many people are going to suffer. The GST incentive the govt give you aren't going to last too long, given that increases are more than 2%.<br><br></div>

Depending on the situation, we could pay more than 7% or even less than that. let me show a situation where it is less.<br><br>Company A, a non GST-registered company, buys its goods for $107 which $7 is GST. He sells them for $207. So only $7 is paid as GST and the selling price is $200. Thus, GST is only 3.5%!</div>

They think that, assuming a product is $10 (excludes 5% GST of 0.50) now, then the increase of the product price after GST implementation is by only $0.20 (since 7% GST of $10 is 0.70).<br><br>What they failed to understand is that in an end-product, there are many parts in the supply chain to this product.<br>- Some of the suppliers are not GST-registered, and thus they cannot claim GST from the govt, thereby passing the increase in GST costs from their suppliers to the next company in the chain. This will translate to an increase in costs for the next company, which will then filter down to the end-user.<br>- Changes in GST, results in system changes (for large companies) or admin costs for smaller companies in that they need to make changes to their processes to adopt the 7%. This results in higher costs for companies, and they pass it on by increasing their prices<br><br>2) Companies that sell items at prices such as $11.60, for example, cannot increase their GST amt to 7% exactly, becoz it will result in 1-cents, (for the above case, its rightfully $12.41), which most probably will round it UP ($12.45 or $12.50). Becoz Singapore doesn't use 1-cent anymore, the businesses round up prices to the nearest 5 cents<br><br>3) Some restaurants, such as Delifrance, round UP the cents to make more money (just check your receipt the next time you eat with them). They are so blatant that, even if you spent for example, $21.55 (AFTER GST), they will still round it UP to $21.60. That's why I don't eat from Delifrance. They DO NOT follow the laws of mathematics. $21.51 is STILL $21.60 (still round up)<br><br>4) Hawkers raise prices at $0.50 almost all the time. I see lots of increases already in the place I stay<br><br>End of the day, I think many people are going to suffer. The GST incentive the govt give you aren't going to last too long, given that increases are more than 2%.<br><br></div></blockquote>1) How many people, consciously or otherwise, actually bother to keep in mind (or even know in the first place) that GST is only applicable to businesses whose revenue exceeds S$1 million in a given year? Technically, many commercial entities (ie.hawkers, etc) do not actually collect S$1 million in revenue to begin with and would have no business to pass on any GST costs to the consumer. That said, as with any other theoretical legislations which can never be practically and efficiently enforced, increasing prices on the pretext of an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">increase in operational cost</span></span> is more than a sufficient excuse required for profiteering. Throw in a regime so desperate for money with little regard for safeguarding consumer interests (not at the expense of businesses anyway) and what you see is effectively the ripple-effect of ill-conceived policies.<br><br>3) Though not entirely relevant, there's actually an underlying rationale behind it. In most parts of Europe and the US, for instance, you do not actually have "official" policies whereby things like "service charges" are levied in restaurants. However, most customers - on their own free will - would take the initiative to "tip" (pretty generously, I must add) and it's a gesture which is expected from the party rendering the service (be it a waiter or a cab driver). In many parts of Asia, however, such tipping cultures are not prevalent and you see "service charges" (something I personally don't endorse as I'd much rather favour the tipping system where you're not duty-bound to tip, but that's another matter) being levied instead. In view of such " inked-on-paper " policies, I would imagine it only fair then that consumers be charged for whatever "explicitly stated" charges and they be billed right down to the cent and nothing more. What seperates other countries adopting such tangible policies of billing from Singapore is indeed the rounding off process. I concur with you that it is indeed another "uniquely Singapore" scam that many business entities which actually levy explicitly-stated charges have actually got the audacity to shamelessly profit further by rounding up - instead of rounding off - the costs passed on to the consumer. I suppose the least you could do is boycott such merchants.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
