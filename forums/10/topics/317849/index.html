              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Leadership 
                                    lessons from a sub-contractor<br> Lim Chih Yang</strong><br> It is not often that one can learn leadership lessons from 
                                    The New Paper. While our local tabloid is a surprisingly 
                                    good resource on how to manage one’s finances, enjoy 
                                    fine dining, get the latest gossip, and contains the most 
                                    comprehensive coverage of football news, it rarely comes 
                                    up with soul-inspiring stuff. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">So it 
                                    was that I was very touched by this story, “I give 
                                    his family $3,000 every Hari Raya”, that appeared 
                                    in its pages on 30 April 2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mr Lam 
                                    Teck Foo, a sub-contractor, was fined a total of $150,000 
                                    for “failing to take reasonable and adequate fall 
                                    protection measures, under the Workplace Safety and Health 
                                    Act”. <br> <br> He was fined as a fatal accident had occurred to one of 
                                    his workers, who fell to his death while working on the 
                                    rooftop on September 2006. While his workers had been wearing 
                                    safety helmets, safety goggles, gloves, safety harnesses 
                                    and belts, they had no lifelines to secure their harnesses 
                                    to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    fine of $150,000 is huge when we look at Lam’s income 
                                    tax return of a little over $43,000. He had not contested 
                                    the charge and had in fact acknowledged his responsibility 
                                    for the worker:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">…I 
                                    was not around the work site, but my foreman said that the 
                                    worker was feeling dizzy. He was walking backwards when 
                                    he fell off the roof. But, he admitted, that as the boss 
                                    of the company, he is responsible for the safety of his 
                                    workers…</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    sub-contractor had also promised to give $3000 annually 
                                    to the family of the deceased every Hari Raya for three 
                                    years from the accident. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">On top 
                                    of the gesture, he had also foot the bill for the burial, 
                                    funeral and the chartering of his workers to attend the 
                                    funeral, which worked out to an estimated $15,000. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">(The 
                                    funeral took place in the Malaysian state of Terengganu 
                                    – the hometown of the deceased worker, Mr Zainal Zakaria.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While 
                                    we are in no position to gauge Lam’s financial means, 
                                    I am nevertheless touched by his gesture and sincere apology 
                                    to the family. Feelings aside, though, a few questions are 
                                    still in my mind. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While 
                                    Lam is the boss, he was not physically present at the worksite 
                                    to personally supervise the workers, and ensure that his 
                                    workers had their life-lines secured. So why, then, is he 
                                    being held responsible for the accident? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Perhaps 
                                    Lam should have taken a leaf out of our Deputy Prime Minister 
                                    Wong Kan Seng’s example. Here is how the scenario 
                                    would have played out had Lam been an attentive student 
                                    in Wong’s leadership class.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">1) Upon 
                                    knowing that the accident had happened, Lam would have made 
                                    a gesture of apology by telling the deceased family, “This 
                                    should not have happened. I am sorry that it has.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">2) Then, 
                                    he would have convened a Commission of Inquiry (COI), including 
                                    one of his own safety officers as part of the committee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">3) Thirdly, 
                                    he would then have released the COI’s findings and 
                                    absolved himself of all blame, since he is the boss and 
                                    he is reasonably not expected to be on site to check all 
                                    lifelines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">4) Fourthly, 
                                    he would have gotten his colleagues to be both cheerleader 
                                    and defence attorney, and exhort everyone to “move 
                                    on”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">5) Lastly, 
                                    he would have lain low and waited for it to blow over.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Hey 
                                    if Lam had learned his lesson, he would have saved his company 
                                    a whopping $150,000 in fines, plus all the other costs he 
                                    incurred in compensating the deceased’s family. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But 
                                    no, Lam did not evade responsibility. In fact, he did just 
                                    the opposite. He stood up, accepted his part of the blame, 
                                    apologised to the family of the deceased, paid the $150,000 
                                    fine, paid for the funeral and even pledged to give the 
                                    family $3,000 for the next three years at Hari Raya.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Now 
                                    that, dear readers, is true leadership – from a sub-contractor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mr Lam 
                                    has, according to The New Paper report, five children aged 
                                    3, 11, 12, 14 and 15. His request to pay the $150,000 fine 
                                    over ten months was rejected by the authorities.</span></p>

              Leadership lessons from a sub-contractor<br>
              Lim Chih Yang</strong><br>
              It is not often that one can learn leadership lessons from The New
              Paper. While our local tabloid is a surprisingly good resource on
              how to manage oneâ€™s finances, enjoy fine dining, get the latest
              gossip, and contains the most comprehensive coverage of football
              news, it rarely comes up with soul-inspiring stuff.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">So
              it was that I was very touched by this story, â€œI give his family
              $3,000 every Hari Rayaâ€�, that appeared in its pages on 30 April
              2008.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mr
              Lam Teck Foo, a sub-contractor, was fined a total of $150,000 for
              â€œfailing to take reasonable and adequate fall protection measures,
              under the Workplace Safety and Health Actâ€�.<br>
              <br>
              He was fined as a fatal accident had occurred to one of his
              workers, who fell to his death while working on the rooftop on
              September 2006. While his workers had been wearing safety helmets,
              safety goggles, gloves, safety harnesses and belts, they had no
              lifelines to secure their harnesses to.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              fine of $150,000 is huge when we look at Lamâ€™s income tax return of
              a little over $43,000. He had not contested the charge and had in
              fact acknowledged his responsibility for the worker:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">â€¦I
              was not around the work site, but my foreman said that the worker
              was feeling dizzy. He was walking backwards when he fell off the
              roof. But, he admitted, that as the boss of the company, he is
              responsible for the safety of his workersâ€¦</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The
              sub-contractor had also promised to give $3000 annually to the
              family of the deceased every Hari Raya for three years from the
              accident.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">On
              top of the gesture, he had also foot the bill for the burial,
              funeral and the chartering of his workers to attend the funeral,
              which worked out to an estimated $15,000.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">(The
              funeral took place in the Malaysian state of Terengganu â€“ the
              hometown of the deceased worker, Mr Zainal Zakaria.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While
              we are in no position to gauge Lamâ€™s financial means, I am
              nevertheless touched by his gesture and sincere apology to the
              family. Feelings aside, though, a few questions are still in my
              mind.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While
              Lam is the boss, he was not physically present at the worksite to
              personally supervise the workers, and ensure that his workers had
              their life-lines secured. So why, then, is he being held
              responsible for the accident?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Perhaps
              Lam should have taken a leaf out of our Deputy Prime Minister Wong
              Kan Sengâ€™s example. Here is how the scenario would have played out
              had Lam been an attentive student in Wongâ€™s leadership
              class.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">1)
              Upon knowing that the accident had happened, Lam would have made a
              gesture of apology by telling the deceased family, â€œThis should not
              have happened. I am sorry that it has.â€�</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">2)
              Then, he would have convened a Commission of Inquiry (COI),
              including one of his own safety officers as part of the
              committee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">3)
              Thirdly, he would then have released the COIâ€™s findings and
              absolved himself of all blame, since he is the boss and he is
              reasonably not expected to be on site to check all
              lifelines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">4)
              Fourthly, he would have gotten his colleagues to be both
              cheerleader and defence attorney, and exhort everyone to â€œmove
              onâ€�.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">5)
              Lastly, he would have lain low and waited for it to blow
              over.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Hey
              if Lam had learned his lesson, he would have saved his company a
              whopping $150,000 in fines, plus all the other costs he incurred in
              compensating the deceasedâ€™s family.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But
              no, Lam did not evade responsibility. In fact, he did just the
              opposite. He stood up, accepted his part of the blame, apologised
              to the family of the deceased, paid the $150,000 fine, paid for the
              funeral and even pledged to give the family $3,000 for the next
              three years at Hari Raya.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Now
              that, dear readers, is true leadership â€“ from a
              sub-contractor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mr
              Lam has, according to The New Paper report, five children aged 3,
              11, 12, 14 and 15. His request to pay the $150,000 fine over ten
              months was rejected by the authorities.</span></p>
