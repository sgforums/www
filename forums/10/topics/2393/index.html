Licking their superiors' boot, turn around bossing his men around. You like to give face that is your business. I don't give a damn to these people. This people don't deserve a single respect. Don't give me the crap what they gone through. Are you sure officer don't chao keng during their course?<br><br>Whether SAF is fuck up or not I think is quite obvious.

You seems to have suffered a lota shit but that's just too bad! are you trying to say that your knowledge is far better than your officers or specs? then I should say that the army have trained you well!<br>I mean that even when you are working, there are still superiors that lick the bosses' asses, so it happens. there are such people around.<br>Mind you, I had encounter a relly CB officer in my past unit, so? you can't do any thing about it! just fark them!

            <div class='col-md body'>NDU:<br>You are right. I read from the other post during your MSTD, there was a CNV's son doing his Midshipman. So far from what i recall, there was only 1 batch where CNV's son was onboard doing midshipman and i happen to be one of the ship crew. I believe i must had seen you before.<br><br>I believe you had seen what are fuck up officers and how officers carry balls. Even you yourself saw what happened.<br><br>Yes i had a real good time with the crews. Your MSTD coxwain was later posted to the same base as me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dear simon<br>Sorry if my interpretation is bad, i am not highly educated, why don't you express more clearly next time round. so you don't think that all SAF officers and specs are fuck up lah. so there are good ones lah.<br>Why can't i drag outside work in? Like NDU said, SAF is just an organisation what. the point i am trying to make, is that there are fucked up people everywhere so it won't be supprising to find them in the SAF.<br>Can you explain why you think that off and specs are so fucked up? is there any cases to share? before you flare up again, it is so that we can decide on how good or bad the offs and specs are.<br>If everyone thinks that SAF is fuckup then what are we going to do if there is no army in singapore? stock up pig's blood ar?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MBG:<br>Express more clearly? Even if i were to explain everything clearly, are you able to interpretate? Since when which post which sentence i ever said that all officers and specs are fuck up? Is it you love to make assumption or what? Now you realise you post wrongly, you try to drag other things in.<br><br>Don't you find that SAF got a lot of fuck up people? All the condamn useless people who can't find job outside stick to SAF. Outside world if you are fuck up, i really like to see how you survive? You try be fuck up and see.<br><br>Don't give me the crap if everybody think this everybody think that. The true is always the true. The true is for everybody to see. If you feel that bluffing yourself you will feel great. You can go ahead and bluff yourelf.<br><br>------------------<br></div>
