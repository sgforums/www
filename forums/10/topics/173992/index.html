We also have to do our part by being more observant. What the PAP is just this much, if we choose to be ignorant of our surroundings and let terrorists get pass us, it is our fault. You can't blame the government for letting the terrorists get pass you. The soldiers who patrol there only have a pair of eyes, and they can't keep an eye on everything. And mobilizing every soldier in Singapore to keep a lookout for terrorists will cripple the economy. Like you said, if those who know can't be bothered to tell the authorities, at the end, they are the ones who suffer because a successful will cripple our economy. You have seen the effects of 911 and how it affected us and the world.<br><br>About whether the custom officer will see the grenades, I believe that it is possible, with improvements made to X-ray technologies. One definitely can't stop a kid's curiosity. But is there a way to prevent that tragedy? There is. By being more observant. Keep a lookout for parcels that look suspicious.<br><br>I believe that Singaporeans and all those who are living in Singapore to encouraged to practise responsible citizenry. In MRT stations, every few minutes they will announce to keep a lookout for suspicious parcels, bags, etc. The authorities have done their best. If we choose not to, we suffer. We then blame the government for not coming to our rescue in time. But hasn't the government been warning us?</div>

The chance of them using viruses is low because it is impractical to use it.<br><br>However, bacteria can survive in the air. It would be much more effective to use bacteria if they want to attack us. Singaporeans have been taught to spot suspicious parcels which are most likely to contain bombs or explosives, but not parcels that contain biological agents like anthrax.<br><br>HDB is a nice target, because security is damn lax. There's no security guards. I remember I have to do some interviews with people who live in condos, and the security guards there won't let you in. I tried ways to get in (excluding climbing in), but to no avail. For HDB, just live the parcel of bomb on the ground level and set it off you will blow off the whole HDB block.
