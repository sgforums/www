              you to do stuff, and actually think and do stuff for the benefit of

              <p><br> But at least they learned to work as a team mah, they learned to
              tolerate and endure hardship mah and also, they are more healthy
              concious, if you look at our parks, our guys are still joggin even
              after NS, strong and tough, unlike our neighbours, all thin thin
              and hardly see anyone in the park running or joggin?? And when you
              look at them, they like want to fight and cause trouble, total lack
              of tolerances. And those sg Uncles who now got son going NS also
              trained their son up and be prepare, I see that in our ECP. But of
              course you dun expect all to be discipline mah, civilian life tend
              to enjoy more and they are expected to free themselves and once
              awhile spoil themselve. And they learn about politics in NS too,
              and that apply to office politics too, i guess. You sabo me I sabo

              <p> </p>
              <p>As for men in NS, i believe they are taught on leadership, on to lead, how to be a team member, how to take care of each other, how to be responsibility to yourself and the group and also your things, before going NS, my brother, just eat and dun wash, he also never clean his room, shout at my grandma and me, and always knock my head, when he was asked to lead the JOO chiat young football team, he make a mess out of it, ending in fighting and quarrelling, after Ns, he is different, he do his own chores, keep his things nicely, take care of us, and when he play for the senior football team for our JOO Chiat CC, he was nominated as the Capt of the team automatically cos they see the leadership in him, and instead of fighting he settle issue and keep everyone happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But perhaps he is one of the sort, i dunno about others??</p>
