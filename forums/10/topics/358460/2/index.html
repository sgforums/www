              <p>Discipline and NS has nothing to do with each other. A person can be disciplined without NS too. Military discipline does not equate to life discipline. military discipline is about operational readiness, efficiency and team work. In short, it is related to work, not life.</p>
              <p>Look around u , will ya, There are locals who are waiting to dismantle the PAP in the next election, people who commit molest and peeping Tom activities, A NSF who due to stress smuggles a rifle out of camp, recruits who shoot their officers during range, take MCs and keng..lots more..It does shows one that anything in moderation works, but when it is excessive, it just fails.</p>
              <p>Did NS cause them to be disciplined?, i think NS has screwed their minds and made them to be vicious, calculative animals in their own way. It is not  a hidden fact that military life brings out the savage qualities in you.</p>

              <p><br>But at least they learned to work as a team mah, they learned to tolerate and endure hardship mah and also, they are more healthy concious, if you look at our parks, our guys are still joggin even after NS, strong and tough, unlike our neighbours, all thin thin and hardly see anyone in the park running or joggin?? And when you look at them, they like want to fight and cause trouble, total lack of tolerances. And those sg Uncles who now got son going NS also trained their son up and be prepare, I see that in our ECP. But of course you dun expect all to be discipline mah, civilian life tend to enjoy more and they are expected to free themselves and once awhile spoil themselve. And they learn about politics in NS too, and that apply to office politics too, i guess. You sabo me I sabo you.</p>
