              <p>If I am not mistaken,  PRs have to decide when their sons
              are of a certain age, to declare whether their sons will take up sg
              citizenship and hence serve NS later on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have got a lot of PR friends who are contemplating this issue
              and likely will not want their sons to take up sg citizenship
              because of the NS issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's the point of sg citizenship when their sons could easily
              come back as PRs (like their parents) and continue to live and work
              in singapore without the national responsibilities?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for new citizens and their sons, I guess they will experience
              the same problems that Singaporean males are facing when they
              realise the additional responsibilities they are carrying and the
              government continues to favour foreigners over their
              sons.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Call me "brainwashed" or anything you want, but with the country having provided me quality education, social fabric and environment to live in, I really don't see why it's so hard to serve 2 years. It's not as if you're not getting anything from it also. And for those who argue that we are merely serving to protect the 30+% foreigners here, please do not forget that the other 70% is still ultimately our own people - our family, our neighbours, our friends. Rifts in society caused by NS. Ridiculous. Unless the people who comment so negatively have been through a terrible NS period or smth, I can't see the justification in calling the system a "National Slavery System".</p>

              <p>I agree with the Bear.</p>
              <p>Half of those who kpkb here probably haven't served NS yet and want to dodge it.</p>
              <p>The other half... may have valid grounds. That one I don't blame. ICT may be a liability for some.</p>
              <p>Still, the first 2 years... Heck. Some are just downright lazy.</p>

              <p>I believe that most ppls here feels that it is too long. 2 years! training is only like 6 months and for 6 months, half the time is wasted on waiting! Don't you agree?</p>
              <p>So what do you do after the training is over? Posted to units and do paper work! So you tell me is it worth the 2 years?</p>

              It's not as if you're not getting anything from it also. And for
              those who argue that we are merely serving to protect the 30+%
              foreigners here, please do not forget that the other 70% is still
              ultimately our own people - our family, our neighbours, our
