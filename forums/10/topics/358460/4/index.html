              <p>dun ever forget, if there's no army back then, we might just be easily bullied by M'sia. and also if there's no stability, no one would have wanted to come to Singapore to invest back then.</p>
              <p>I dun even believe it causes rifts though I admit there are people who ended up 'bullied' by the system be it medically (i.e. ppl who aren't even combat fit end up classified as PES B or combat fit by a panel of MOs rather than specialist) or psychologically.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, The boys spend 2.5 years of their life serving the
              nation. The boys loose out in employment opportunities by 2 years.
              Then they lose the pechant to study further due to the long NS duty
              and  numerous psychological taunts in NS by their
              superiors.  The girls climb the career ladder and as a result
              do not want to marry and settle down with the boys who are left
              behind. And factor in the foreign women influx, men shun away from
              local women, disregard them and generalise them. The girls
               also grew up in a life of luxury and are generally apathetic
              to political  or social affairs in the state .  Clearly
              evident,  in their lack of understanding about the conscript
              system and purpose, state governance and its associated problems
               , one being the boys who have to compete with foreigners for
              jobs and reservist liabilities hampering their progress. To add
              insult to injury, the cost of living  does not tally with
              earnings and the low wages that citizens earn does not help in
              procreation in the city state. The other factor is the predominant
              money culture prevalent in this city state that is causing
              traditional asian values to be eroded over time. And being females,
              and their natural instinct in the  city state tend to put
              materialism as top priority. The foreigners who arrive, many 
              are unwilling to settle down in the system and contribute to
              national security as they found that there is no real value in
              settling down in the city state which has no natural resources,
              economically unstable , politically underdeveloped and lacking in
              the diverse array of life found in other developed nations.
               Those who do, are most often, not the top talents  the
              govt preceives them to be and  often not highly educated or
              employed in jobs that require entry  or low level skills.
              These foreigners have also realised that returning to their
              countries or use the city state as a stepping stone  after a
              stint is the best option.</p>
              <p>The problem here lies in the social fabric of the nation that
              was engineered for decades to fulfill a narrow  mindset
              dominated purely by twisted and unnatural capitalism , meritocracy
              and elitism while showing a total neglect for social  issues.
              The manouever has set the ground for an initial social problem that
              has since intensified and has been seen to cause more problems over
              time. Unlike Other developed nations have addressed these concerns
              with effective social planning and ethics, Singapore yet remains
              unwilling  to take concrete efforts. Observers have noted that
              Singapore's social policies  geared towards  bringing
              about a secure and suitable environment for continous trade and
              economy, rather than as a whole solution . The system which
              collapses  when the world economy turns its back on the city
              state, the social situation is iis now paying the price. Rather
              than implementing protectionist policies to avert this situation,
              the authorities expect the social landscape to wait and ride out
              the tide till things improve.</p>
              <p>The other  problem here lies with the city state's
              obsessive paranoia,  stubborness,lack of foresight and
              outdated outlook on issues  relating to national security,
              citizen rights and social situation tied in as whole picture. Why
              is there a need to maintain a conscript system when other similar
              countries like Taiwan have successfully abandoned the system?
               The system together with the  other issues  is
              causing problems in the social fabric and how long before they
              start to realise this issue, until the birth rate reaches zero?
              Does the expenditure on the conscript system producing any real
              output value?. No it does not, at best a superficial face value. Do
              we have to ask ourselves on why we are  spending enormous
              amount of money on  human assets of the conscript system that
              produces unhappy soldiers, who view NS duties as a hindrance and
              burden, get disadvantaged in employment, risk their lives, and most
              importantly bring about dysfunctionality in national birth and
              marriage rates? The conscript system is an enemy of its own
              existence, outputting results which is contrary to what it set out
              to achieve in the first place and along with it  bringing
              added problems. And of course no problem is complete without
              addressing the the root causes . It seems the city state is
              suffering from a major problem that needs to be addressed -
              Problems which are made up of myriad of problems. The Singapore,
              popularly known as the lion city we know today, is best described
              as the lion with an erectile dysfunction.</p>
              <p>Who are we to blame? Ourselves or the govt? The answer is
              obvious. Both.</p>
