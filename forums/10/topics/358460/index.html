              <p>In any country or nation with a conscript system, it is expected that the system hold responsibility for shaping the fabric of national psychology and integration to set precedence to a viable governance of the nation.But in some cases, it just fails after some point of time. In Singapore, a small city state in south east asia with conscript style policies for almost everything, the boys spend 2.5 years of their life serving the nation before they set a steady course in their lives. But is not all over it seems as what follows is a 10 year cycle of reservist obligations. The girls have no mandatory requirements. In comparison to the girls, the boys loose out in employment  and further education opportunities by 2 years. Then they lose the pechant to study further due to the long distractive national service duty and  numerous psychological taunts in  by their military superiors, ironically moulding most of them them into simplistic and narcisstic persons, rather than strong creative individuals.  The girls, without this form of distraction climb the career ladder and as a result do not want to marry and settle down with the boys who are left behind. And factor in the foreign women influx, men shun away from local women, disregard them and generalise them. The girls  also grow up in a life of luxury and are generally apathetic to political  or social affairs in the state .  Clearly evident,  in their lack of understanding about the conscript system and purpose, state governance and its associated problems  , one being the boys who have to compete with foreigners for jobs and reservist liabilities hindering their progress.</p>
              <p>To add insult to injury, the cost of living  does not tally with earnings and the low wages that citizens earn does not help in procreation in the city state. The other factor is the predominant materialistic culture prevalent in this city state that is causing traditional asian values to be eroded over time. And being females,  their natural instinct  tend to put materialism as top priority. The foreigners who arrive, many  are unwilling to settle down in the system and contribute to national security as they found that there is no real value in settling down in the city state which has no natural resources, economically unstable , politically underdeveloped and lacking in the diverse array of life found in other developed nations.  Those who do, are most often, not the top talents  the govt wants to retain  often not highly educated or employed in jobs that require entry  or low level skills. These locals and foreigners, mainly  professionals in the middle class working sector have also realised that the defective state conscript style is ruining lives by holding citizens hostage decide returning to their countries or use the city state as a stepping stone  after a stint is the best option. In addition the local talents after receiving education and work experience, have been already migrating in droves to nearby countries like Hong, Kong, Australia and  the US. When the going gets tough , the tough gets going but elsewhere. Of those  who are left behind , are  ones that do not have the resources and skills to leave. As a result, the state is left with a mediocre workforce and an apathethic population left to fend for themselves and constantly being hammered down by the relentless state machinery apparatus which in itself is an enormous conscript system of sorts.</p>
              <p>The problem here lies in the social fabric of the nation that was engineered for decades to fulfill a narrow  mindset dominated purely by twisted and unnatural capitalism , meritocracy and elitism while showing a total neglect for social  issues.The manouever has set the ground for an initial social problem that has since intensified and has been seen to cause more problems over time. Though the city state has flourished in physical resources through merticulous planning of infrastructure, transport, medical and security, it is way behind in the social context.  While other developed nations have addressed these concerns with effective social planning and ethics, Singapore yet remains unwilling  to take concrete efforts. Observers have noted that Singapore's social and secuity hybrid policies  are geared towards  bringing about a secure and suitable environment for continous trade and economy, rather than as a whole solution which does not take welfare and rights into account . The system which collapses  when the world economy turns its back , the social scenario is now paying the price. Rather than implementing protectionist policies to avert this situation, the authorities expect the social landscape to wait and ride out the tide till things improve.</p>
              <p>The other  problem here lies with the city state's obsessive paranoia,  stubborness,lack of foresight and outdated Nazi styled policing on issues  relating to national security, citizen rights and social situation tied in as whole picture. The city state is known to invest in cutting edge defence technology, and yet why is there a need to maintain an army conscript system, when other similar countries like Taiwan have successfully abandoned it?  The system together with the  other issues  is causing problems in the social fabric and how long before they start to realise this issue, until the birth rate reaches zero? Does the expenditure on the conscript system producing any real output value?. No it does not, at best a superficial face value. Do we have to ask ourselves on why we are  spending enormous amount of money on  human assets of the conscript system that produces unhappy soldiers, who view NS duties as a hindrance and burden, get disadvantaged in employment, risk their lives, and most importantly bring about dysfunctionality in national birth and marriage rates? The conscript system is an enemy of its own existence, outputting results which is contrary to what it set out to achieve in the first place and along with it  bringing added problems. And of course no problem is complete without addressing the the root causes .  It seems the city state is suffering from a major fundamental problem that needs to be addressed - Problems which are made up of myriad of problems.  The Singapore, popularly known as the lion city we know today, is best described as the lion with an erectile dysfunction unable to set things upright, a trait which is of outmost importance in maintaining the success the it has than actually building it.</p>
              <p>Who are we to blame? Ourselves or the govt? The answer is obvious. Both.</p>

              <p>The boys spend 2.5 years of their life serving the nation. The
              boys loose out in employment opportunities by 2 years. Then they
              lose the pechant to study further due to the long NS duty and 
              numerous psychological taunts in NS by their superiors.  The
              girls climb the career ladder and as a result do not want to marry
              and settle down with the boys who are left behind. And factor in
              the foreign women influx, men shun away from local women, disregard
              them and generalise them. The girls  also grew up in a life of
              luxury and are generally apathetic to political affairs in the
              state . Their lack of understanding about the concript system,
              governance and its associated problems  like the boys who have
              to compete with foreigners for jobs and reservist liabilities
              hampering their progress. The other factor is the predominantly
              money culture prevalent in this city state that is causing
              traditional asian values to be eroded over time. The foreigners who
              arrive, many  are unwilling to settle down in the system and
              contribute to national security as they found that there is no real
              value in settling down in the city state which has no natural
              resources, economically unstable , politically underdeveloped and
              lacking in the diverse array of life found in other developed
              nations.  The problem here lies in the social fabric of the
              nation that was engineered for decades to fulfill a narrow minded
              mindset dominated by twisted and unnatural capitalism , meritocracy
              and elitism. The manouever has caused an initial social problem and
              has been seen to cause more problems over time</p>
              <p>The problem here lies with the govt's obsessive paranoia and
              lack of foresight and outdatedness relating to national security.
              Why is there a need to maintain a conscript system when other
              similar countries like Taiwan have successfully abandoned the
              system?  The system is causing problems in the social fabric
              and how long before they start to realise this issue, until the
              birth rate reaches zero? Does the expenditure spent on the
              conscript system producing any real output value?. No does not, at
              best a superficial face value. Do we have to ask ourselves spending
              enormous amount of money spent on the human assets of the conscript
              system that produces unhappy soldiers, who view NS duties as a
              hindrance and burden, get disadvantaged in employment, risk their
              lives, and most importantly the dysfunctionality in national birth
              and marriage rates? The conscript system is an enemy of its own,
              outputting results which is contrary to what it set out to achieve
              in the first place and extra problems.</p>
              <p>Who are we to blame? ourselves or the govt? The answer is
              obvious.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The boys who serve 2 years NS is disadvantaged. That is duh. If it is not necessary, which country will be so stupid to spend so much money to train so many soldier?</p>
              <p>So you blame government for making them serve NS. Than who defend the nation? If Singapore gets intimidated by other countries because of it's lack of military power, than again you will say govt fault.</p>
              <p>Did you not think this through thoroughly, or the govt did not think this through thoroughly? The answer is obvious.</p>

              <p>It is being used on unmeaningful activities that does not improve the life of those who work hard for the system. And also consider that foreigners may help the economy but what is obvious right now is the foreigners dominating the workforce that makes unemployment opportunities disadvantageous to locals. And the occurence results in low marriage and birth rates. In the end who is going to defend the country when there are very little citizens? Then singapore will be seen as weak in defence and do u think the foreign companies will want to set up base here to employ more foreigners to help the economy? It is a vicious cycle.</p>

He said in the early 50 and 60's, we got alot of gangsters (maybe one of them my Uncle), roaming the street and even polices are corrupted, and these gang leader make use of boys in their active teenage to help run the show for them by promising them gal, drink , smoke and even drug. So, as a teen boy, you tend to be sway by such goodies and wanted very much to express your power to scare others and all these people end up with poor and sick old age or even died at a young age. He stress that by giving NS during the age of 18yo, is thus good for the boys and the society as a whole, and i truly agreed with him till today, cos i see our guys are more discipline than the chinese, malaysia or other countries guys.</p></div>

              <p>cos i see our guys are more discipline than the chinese,

              <p>I cant agree on the discipline issue. Other countries guys are also emotionally disciplined as they  have suffered much more like civil wars, poverty and discrimination. Sometimes i see the exact opposite with sg guys, who after NS seem to be more indisciplined than before. Heard of guys who learnt how to smoke and drink, or patrooniase pros while in NS?</p>
              <p>Is that discipline? NS duty teaches u military discipline and not emotional discipline ( which is a very low).</p>
              <p>Bottomline is u cannot say that NS disciplines everyone and works for all. But u cannot say that lack of NS will bring about indiscipline in males.</p>
