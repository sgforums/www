            <div class='col-md body'>Here's the argument among MPs:<br>What's your view?<br><br>================================================<br>CONSIDER this, if Albert Einstein (considered the greatest scientist of the 20th century), Stephen Hawking (celebrated physicist and author of A Brief History Of Time) and Bill Gates (Microsoft chief and currently the world's richest man) were to come to Singapore, would we put them in jail?<br><br>The answer: Yes - if they're National Service defaulters.<br><br>This was the bottomline, as Parliament engaged in an animated and emotional debate about the Government's push for jail terms of up to three years for serious default cases.<br><br>What's 'serious'? According to Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean, it's when you stay away for two years or more from the time you must enlist for NS - or for those given deferment, from the time their exit permits expire.<br><br>SEEN AS BEING UNFAIR<br><br>Why so harsh? Because, the minister said: 'We'll be seen as being unfair if we were to treat talented NS defaulters more leniently than others. The fact that they are talented and can contribute to Singapore does not detract from the fact that they have defaulted on their NS.'<br><br>So yes, even if this means such talents end up staying away, at Singapore's loss.<br><br>Not every MP was convinced.<br><br>Despite the hue and cry over renowned pianist and ex-Singaporean Melvyn Tan's $3,000 fine for defaulting on his NS obligations - a sentence many considered too light - many of the 16 who spoke actually said: Let's be more flexible, more sympathetic and less judgmental.<br><br>Stressed East Coast GRC MP Tan Soo Khoon: 'Increasing the fines and penalties for defaulters may give us satisfaction, and a greater sense of fairness and justice, but it does not necessarily bring the men back.'<br><br>Ayer Rajah MP Dr Tan Cheng Bock said: 'We as a nation must always make room for forgiveness. Where possible, Singapore must never reject a returning son.'<br><br>After all, these MPs pointed out, many so-called defaulters were just kids when their parents yanked them abroad. Or they could have been chasing after that dream job when the NS call-up came.<br><br>Another veteran backbencher, Bukit Timah MP Dr Wang Kai Yuen, even said he was 'disturbed' by the jail terms.<br><br>'Are we seeking just punishment or vengeance?... We should not slam the doors shut for such lost sons.'<br><br>Especially, he explained, if they've turned the emotional corner and, like Mr Melvyn Tan, now want to renew old ties with family and country.<br><br>But it was the man who dropped the names of Einstein, Hawking and Gates - Tampines GRC MP Sin Boon Ann - who made the most impassioned plea.<br><br>Mr Sin argued: 'It seems... there will not be any satisfaction until the pound of flesh is extracted... (But) as we mature as a society and become more gracious, we must learn that the world is not only cast in black and white... (and) to be a more generous society by rising above our basic instincts.'<br><br>West Coast MP S Iswaran, though, had a different perspective.<br><br>MAKING A SACRIFICE<br><br>He'd recently met two young men - a foreigner who's a Singapore PR, and a Singaporean with an Australian PR. Both were serving their NS and asked him the same question: 'Why am I doing this?'<br><br>The MP's point? 'I want to be able to look these men... in the eye and say to them: 'We know you're making a sacrifice. We apply the rules impartially. We respect your sacrifice and service, and we'll not forget it. And I think our laws and the way we enforce them must evidence that and match our words and commitment.'<br><br>Wrapping up, Mr Teo advised the House to ponder this: 'Who will shed a tear for Singapore if there is no Singapore for such people to return to, because the institution of National Service has been undermined?'<br><br>So the country has spoken.<br><br>When it comes to NS, there are simply no ifs or buts. Just come home and do it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, i don't think anyone is dead against the idea of consciption in SG.The only concern is the increasingly difficult position SG males are placed in and disadvantages faced in the working world.<br><br>I would say with absolutely certainty that NS indeed enriched my life, fostered a new group of friends who stuck with you through thick and thin and inculcated the spirit of camaraderie.<br><br>Trench digging and instructors stealing weapons during BMT will always be stories we keep with us post-NS. Those are the fond moments i recall when i look back.<br><br>As for those who compare tough times with the current, always keep in mind that each preceding batch was always tougher than its predecessor. People literally died in LARGER numbers under the eyes of our israeli trainers. Some committed suicide. And back then no one cared. Nowadays, every NSman is a mother's son and even 1 suicide or accidental death will become a source of kopitiam gossip.<br><br>NS has made me a better person. I openly admit it. My only request is that ICT frequencies should be reviewed to get the best out of NSmen with minimal disruption to their careers. The current guidelines and Laws to deter defaulter-wannabes are sufficient. Let's not go demanding for higher mountains to climb each time someone new scales it.</div>

The view you have now is only partial, a bit premature imo. Have you started working and started a business to fully access the impact/benefits/value of NS?<br><br>Let's talk what you've said.<br><br>You enjoyed NS thoroughly but a big part is out of your hands at the mercy of retarded commanders. What I think you saw in NS is immature older boys (a few 1-2 years older than the NSman) essentially abuse their authority and bully than nurture the lower ranks. Their influence is hardly positive. The ones who make a positive influence on the NSmen are often seasoned commanders who don't motivate by fear but by your own effort toward excellence. That calibre of commanders are very few. One threatens/treats you no differently than slaves (to squueze out a result) whereas the other grooms you to overcome your fears to be your best.<br><br>I would agree with you that with 2 years ahead of your college peers, you are generally more mature than them. But I may not agree fully that what you had gained in NS is fully useful in college education.<br><br>Whether you'll be attractive to employers, that's for you to discover in future.<br><br>Everyone has or ought to have dreams and ambitions. At the prime of one's youth and learning, it is not a good idea to go through a major stumbling block. If Melvyn had gone thru it, would he have become what he is today - enriched and better equipped to pursue his dreams? That he avoided the stumbling block and ventured forward made him what he is today realising his dreams. If Ang Peng Siong followed Melvyn's path, he probably would have achieved bigger and become a huge celebrity or national sport icon today but because of NS, what has he really become today?<br><br>I feel we need a NS rethink if not remaking.<br><br></div>
