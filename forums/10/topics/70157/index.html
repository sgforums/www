            <div class='col-md body'>ST is absolutely right, however theres another point to make here. I have to really admire how the gahment, through its propaganda machine, is able to blur the lines and confuse the real issues here.<br><br>Theres nothing wrong with hiring expats to bring about abilities not present in Singapore, and I fully agree with that. However as ST has said, what the gah'ment has done is to cheapen the value of Singaporean citizenship and PR by allowing an influx of arguable 2nd rate low cost labour to supplant Singaporean workers to "make Singapore more competitive", when it was their policies in the first place that made Singapore and the Singaporean worker uncompetitive. They are trying to reverse their initial policy mistakes with a policy that alienates and trivialises Singaporeans. The dissatisfaction Singaporeans feel is directed at this influx of cheap 2nd rate foriegn labour, not the expats.<br><br>As usual, "Gah'ment make mistake, ordinary Singaporeans pay"<br><br>What the propaganda machine has done is to lump "expats" and "cheap foreign labour masquerading as talent" together, and make it look like our dissatifaction is being misdirected.<br><br>Smart, but I ain't buying...<br><br></div>
