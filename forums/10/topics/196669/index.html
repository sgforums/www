Those are just dramas and life really isn't exactly like that... As we watched the same old 'lousy' plots again and again... With the lightning flashes behind and the thunder giving its roar... The villian laughing away and the victim's mum or bf crying aloud... "Why..??" - We simply couldn't help laughing....<br><br>TODAY, we starts to realise the cruelty of this world... As it shapes itself into the box we visited yesterday...Where when you have $ and power, probably means people couldn't really lay their hands on you... And I thought to myself... Why are there so many 'sh|tty' people who would do just all sorts of things to climb themselves to the top...? People so labelled the 'bad guys'... From people who steal... Rob... Drug traffic..

If we do, I wonder who would be paying for all our misdeeds....?</div></blockquote>You are right!<br><br>I had this experience with a greedy and filty rich boss and he was an NMP.<br>Being so filty rich....he was greedy for power and fame which he tried to get into politics.  Once if he got into politics...and become a big lampar...you know what?.....he will try to make more money with his influences.<br>Many people in politics are out to gain personal interest...this is the fact.<br>I have also came across a ''borlanyong''(useless) grassroot leader who would serve committee out of personal interest for a free parking of whole estate or maybe first hand informations.<br><br>I'm sort of those who are soft hearted and straight forward type. Previously, I was the company's manager where I have to deal with quite a bit of contractual matters and our project was a tedious one and involved with loads of compliances required by the Authorities.  The hit up was due to my ex-boss who was type of person that like to beat around the bushes and twisting facts ridiculously and all out to save, cut cost or maximise profits for the project.<br>So... most of the times..in the meetings with the Authorities I have to bear all sorts of music from the Authorities' officers in-charge why my company is doing this and that where things were not right and not complying to contract that all decisions were made by my CB ex-boss  .<br><br><strong>You know what he told me? Hey! you have to be tough and cunning.....you must know to how turn and twist with facts...even if we have done something wrong.  We must twist it and turn it into others people fault.</strong><br><br>See...what type of person (my CB ex-boss) he was?<br><br>There are loads of hypocritic people around..especially in politics.<br><br>The Farking NMP (my CB ex-boss)  .  Thanks God that he is no longer in parliament.</div>
