            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Everyone<br><br>I have an issue with Singapore Post Ltd, which has been bothering me for days.<br><br>Please advise what I should do with the below situation:<br><br>I ordered a parcel from US using the EXPRESS USPS (Extremely Urgent) service.<br><br>The parcel arrived in Singapore on 27th Aug 07 at 11.03pm. It should be delivered on the next working day 28th Aug 07.<br><br>P/S: The speedpost Internet tracking system is not updated at all, other than showing 11.03pm reaches.<br><br>I didnÂ’t receive on the 28th Aug &amp; called Speedpost 29th Morning &amp; spoke to the officer, she mentioned my parcel has been <strong>DELIVERED</strong>Â”.....I am astound.<br><br>I say no &amp; she will check for meÂ…but while in vain, I called again &amp; another lady told me is Â‘DELIVEREDÂ’. I asked to speak to the manager.<br><br>The manager called me back &amp; says she will check for meÂ…the<strong> SECOND </strong>time she called back she told me there is some delay &amp; the parcel is still with Singapore post &amp;<span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> ASSSURE me is NOT deliver to the wrong address &amp; still in the Singpost base.</strong></span></span><br>She promised the parcel will be delivered by 29th before 9pm.<br><br>At 8.20pm, an officer came up to my house with my 6th Floor neighbor &amp; my <strong>package OPENED!</strong><br><br>My neighbor told me his mum signed the package on 28th Aug &amp; the parcel is ALL ALONG WITH THEM!!!Conclusion: The postman send to the wrong address &amp; the manager COVERS UP under someone instruction, NOT TRUTHFULL to consumer, this is uncalled for esp. Singpost clinched the World Mail Award in London. (http://www.singpost.com.sg/downloads...PR20070528.pdf<br><br>Question 1: WHY my extremely urgent package is opened by my neighbor &amp; why he didnÂ’t return to me, I do not wish to commentÂ…Â…Â…this is between Singpost &amp; him.<br>BUT WHY there isnÂ’t any compensation of the postage when is OPENED by a third party &amp; is exposed? If is a normal mail, lostÂ…openedÂ…No excuseÂ…I accept, BUT this is an EXTREMELY URGENT MAIL with TRACKING nosÂ…..please advice.<br><br>Question 2: Why the tracking system is not fully updated, the reason reply was incorrect scanning of barcodes upon receipt of parcel?? But their own assistant vice president, herself told me there are numerous complains too for slowness cos lack of manpower RECENTLYÂ…all the phone conversation, I believe is recorded by SingpostÂ…No cover up on this. Law by law, they are paid to do they workÂ….we pay the service, so this has to be updated for every single movement.<br><br>3) Inside the Apology letter the Asst.Vice-president send to me , it seem in my personal view....the courier who delivered the wrong mail took the most blameÂ…in the letter, she wrote she Â“..She has been reprimanded &amp; warned of her seriousness of her errorÂ…Â”.<br><br>P/S: BUT I did NOT blame her cos I understand sometimes this is HUMAN ERRORÂ….now that letter makes me sympathy with her.<br><br><strong>Now my question to assistant Vice president is</strong>:<br><br>1)If a manager from the customer service NOT truthful about my package status, not honestÂ….if she has tell me the truth everything is fine. But she Â‘liedÂ’ to cover up under SOMEONE instructionÂ’.<br>I spoke with the Asst. Vice President, Quality Management/customer care, Ms Gillian Yeap.<br>My question to her: The manager is untruthful to consumer, she is from SingpostÂ…Â….<span style="color: red;"><strong>So is Singpost INDIRECTY untruthful to consumer since the manager/employer is from Singpost??</strong></span>She could NOT answer &amp; she told me they will have a closed door discussion, I am still waiting for their answer, meanwhile, can u reader please advice me?<br><br><strong>P/S: Not being truthful,<span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> though UNINTENTIONAL </span></span>is still NOT truthful. NO EXCUSE</strong><br><br>2)Should my exposed parcel postage under (EXPRESS MAIL-EXTREMELY URGENT) parcel opened by a 3rd party in my block be compensated?<br><br>I believe this is a very important issue cos in business, TRUST &amp; HONEST is the keyÂ….esp, Singapore Post Ltd is a World Class Mail country<br><br>I sincerely hope someone can advise of my situation.<br><br>Thank u<br></div>
