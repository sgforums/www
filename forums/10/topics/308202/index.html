              <p>Just received a Utube link from a friend.   Please click and enjoy.   They said it so well except the part whereby that specky guy talked about PAP solving problems which I don't agree.   I doubt this guy knows the ways of PAP that well compared to the rest of the speakers.    He is not aware PAP hardly solve problems, the only way they solve problems most of the time is by using money (money to the gahmen).</p>

              <p>Not so much about the old lky, it is encouraging to know people from other countries speak our mind so to say.   I am always hoping for countries all over the world to see more and more dirt of lky, cissy lhl and his gang.</p>

              I have to agree a guy on the show comment on Singapore.That is he say:"Singapore is a country with no Soul".
              
              That is very true,and the reason why Singapore is so is becoz our PAP leaders have no LP or character.LKY boot-lick communist China,his son boot-lick his father and other countries,Lou Goh boot-lick LKY and his son.
              
              They all sell their own souls to other ppl in one way or another.Thats why Singapore government,to other ppl,is a country with no soul,no own culture,no character country.

              And there is one more thing i want to add,Singapore is a "Souless" country to foreigners and our citizens is also becoz our government over-emphasized the importance of "money".No doubt money is important,but our PAP leaders treat it with a wrong attitude.
                          
              To our PAP leaders,money is everything.Money to them is more important than earning respect from their ppl,more important than their dignity,their soul,perhaps even their lives.They talk to us everything about money.They sucks money in every aspect of our daily lives.This turn them into a hated fuking misers instead of a respectable politicians.
                          
              My advice to them:Money is invented by human to put into good use,not to be used by money and become money-slaves.Money,like the rest of many things,is a double bladed sword.Treat it with a wrong attitude,it will not only hurt those around you,but also yourself.

              <p>Who he admires isn't really important. We have a shortage of
                  opposition and unless we do something about it, the situation will
                  not improve..... we need some FTs to run for opposition <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Who he admires is important! Since he despise our current government because they are lousy or wat etc etc etc then let me ask, can he do a better job? If he speaks of the government so badly, can he give a better solution? rather than just saying "I despise the PAP and LKY" or "PAP regime really has to go." comments, why don't he come up with his own opposition team and win the elections? Don't NATO, because it doesn't require a million dollar salary to have anyone to NATO.</p>
              <p>If he is that good, I'm sure he can win the rigged elections rather than trying to be an internet CSJ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's a reason why the opposition is weak, it means they are no way better than the PAP. Sure they are severly in a disadvantage, but if they can't overcome such obstacles, can they handle even harder obstacles in the future? Are they ready to handle such a responsibility. While on the other hand, PAP has done a great job in securing its place. This is the way to go, safeguard your assets, secure your position. Would you want a government who loses its place easily to others? What if, in the global stage, can our oppositions protect our interests? Or do you want to change government just because you're sick and tired of PAP winning because you're jealous of them?</p>

              <p>Kim Jong Il, like the other truly first world dictators, have an inherently resolute platform to leverage on to barter and bargain against just about everyone else. This regime, on the other hand, has neither the courage nor incentive to establish a platform of isolation (hence, its infamous mantra of subscribing to the policy of diplomacy).</p>
              <p>What you have in this deluded utopian wonderland is a despot-wannabe aspiring to the ambitions of Hitler with the courage of a mouse. Surely, you don't need a rocket scientist to figure the senile despot running this regime hasn't exactly sorted out his identity crisis, have you? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>Then again, that probably explains why this regime has commenced on its nascent progress to establish bilateral ties with DPRK. Not like they'd ever come anywhere close to usurping the master though.</p>

              <p>Who he admires is important! Since he despise our current government because they are lousy or wat etc etc etc then let me ask, can he do a better job? If he speaks of the government so badly, can he give a better solution? rather than just saying "I despise the PAP and LKY" or "PAP regime really has to go." comments, why don't he come up with his own opposition team and win the elections? Don't NATO, because it doesn't require a million dollar salary to have anyone to NATO.</p>
              <p>If he is that good, I'm sure he can win the rigged elections rather than trying to be an internet CSJ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's a reason why the opposition is weak, it means they are no way better than the PAP. Sure they are severly in a disadvantage, but if they can't overcome such obstacles, can they handle even harder obstacles in the future? Are they ready to handle such a responsibility. While on the other hand, PAP has done a great job in securing its place. This is the way to go, safeguard your assets, secure your position. Would you want a government who loses its place easily to others? What if, in the global stage, can our oppositions protect our interests? Or do you want to change government just because you're sick and tired of PAP winning because you're jealous of them?</p>
