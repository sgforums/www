              <p>SG may boast its exceptionally high GDP growth rate now, but i see beyond the numbers and SG's future doesn't seem so bright to me</p>
              <p>Just like Japan many years ago, japan's path to a decade long of stagflation was preceded by a housing boom from cheap money and speculation. Its government ran out of the traditional (keneysian) ammunitions of avoiding a recession: lowering interest rates and running into deficits. But the government had a limit to running the deficits without causing a hyper inflation and interest rates were already at zero. and so there was no choice but to let the japanese economy freefall.</p>
              <p>Same goes for the US. housing boom then bust causing a crisis; its literally zero percent interest rates were not enough but unlike japan, because USD is the world's reserve currency, it could print money and let the other countries absorb the 'inflation tax'. Its stimulus packages and bailouts are costing the government a fortune however. and are buying time until the truth of US's worthless currency comes to light and the freefall of the US economy will ensue.</p>
              <p>Similar story of Singapore, near zero interest rates, enormous stimulus packages, running into government deficits, buying military jets we don't need, speculative housing prices with the expectation that 1.5 more million people are going to immigrate to SG. Singapore is so small it cannot afford to run much of a deficit, neither can it afford bailouts should a crisis ensue here at home</p>
              <p>When global interest rates rise, and it will soon, Singapore would have ran out of bullets to defend its economy, its tourism sector so dependent on low interest rates will suffer and make losses, housing prices will drop back down to earth, and it would stagflate or at least fade away..</p>
              <p>Its saving graces, as i see it. Are for the government to maintain low taxes, and for the singapore economy to remain one of the freest in the world, and for the rest of the world to be so much worse off that there would be a net immigration into SG.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Good question….</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 16.2037px;"><span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">An increase of demand such as consumption, investment, exports,
              public works etc. will increase the GDP, provided companies could meet the price
              and quality requirements of buyers. If not, imports will grow instead. However,
              our currencies are set against the greenback, and thus this would imply
              impending trade deficit i.e. more imports than exports. If national production
              cannot increase for some socio-political or some other reasons, companies producing
              already at max. capacity may decide to raise prices, and this would cause effective
              demand to <span> </span>drop with inflation.</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> <br> Moreover, <span>technological and strategic innovations
              could have good impact on productivity, on product, process, quality and also costs.
              These are value added elements to productivity. However, do take note - Capital
              and labour quality are important ingredients for a growing GDP.</span> If the
              labour force lacks the motivation or are tired out due to years of unchanged
              income, then this alone would have disastrous results in the long run on the
              economy. </span></p>

              <p>1)Yea the government is taking action to curb property prices buy making a committment to keep property prices low is the problem; it distorts the prices and will end up with oversupply. - instead of letting prices rise too high to buy, now everyone can buy at affordable prices.</p>
              <p>2) Our High GDP growth rate is not possible when we have negative productivity gains. They come from increase in government spending (military jets, infrastructure, like IR, universal studios) and rising paper value of the houses which keep changing hands which adds up to GDP. i think our GDP is pretty tied to property</p>

              <p>Alright, although we have digressed away from my main topic i shall humor you so'd you shut up and focus on my First post.</p>
              <p>Yes i did say</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">'And rising paper value of the houses which keep changing
                      hands which adds up to GDP'. </span></p>
              <p>It was poorly  phrased so let me rephrase it by adding afew words <strong>without losing the essence of the point</strong> :</p>
              <p>'<span style="color: #0000ff;">And rising paper value of the houses (which keep changing hands from speculative buying) which adds up to GDP.</span>'</p>
              <p>Dumbass.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Now second point</p>
              <p>I still stand by my statement <span style="color: #008000;"> "Our
                      High GDP growth rate is not possible when we have negative
                      productivity gains. They come from increase in government spending
                      (military jets, infrastructure, like IR, universal studios) and
                      rising paper value of the houses which keep changing hands which
                      adds up to GDP". </span>Of course i understand how the different sectors contribute to GDP, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">That point is trying to say that these are fake growth and temporary and not meant to say they contribute nothing! </span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Leme spell it out for you</p>
              <p>The 33% of our GDP stimulus package is also government spending, and have caused the caused the CPI to rise from negative to 3% to date. Have you ever thought that growth in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">financial services sector</span></span> and <span style="color: #008000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> wholesale &amp; retail trade sector</span></span> was because of the excess stimulus money supply and speculation from false confidence?</p>
              <p>Our increase in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manufacturing output</span></span>, Sure, they are led by some bio thing but they are not the totality of it all? have you thought that these also include temporary things like stocking and all the things we're building? (i.e TEMPORARY?).  <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And the points highlighted in blue are in my favor so i shant elaborate<br></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way you should know that GDP also includes government spending which is the increasing debt of the government into the billion. The fact that you so easily dismiss that and the stimulus in your 'GDP presentation'  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shows

              <p>I am an Econs noob, don't get nasty with me by calling me names, I just learnt this from Google. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Y = C + I + G</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is your <strong>I </strong>(investments)<strong> </strong>affected by interest rate in the <strong>IS-LM model</strong>? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is investment a long-term financial concept? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If there is an increase in the money supply (more house purchases by foreigners), a shift of LM to the right, will it lead to a lower interest? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4mxT27cYAU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4mxT27cYAU</a></p>
              <p>From 2:30 to 4:12, "the end result of the policy of increasing the money supply lowers the interest rates and a higher level of national income results". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will a lower interest rate affect the value of your <strong>I </strong>(investments) in the Y = C + I + G accounts? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the value of your I (investments) increases on the right side of the equation, will the Y (GDP) on the left side of the equation increase to balance out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So indirectly the changes in house prices does affect GDP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I like Econs, will do Econs 101 when I grow up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore students too used to rote learning, don't use their brains to analyse the information much, a by-product of our uniquely Singapore education system. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Alright, although we have digressed away from my main topic i shall humor you so'd you shut up and focus on my First post.</p>
              <p>Yes i did say</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993300;">'And rising paper value of the houses which keep changing hands which adds up to GDP'.</span></p>
              <p>It was poorly  phrased so let me rephrase it by adding afew words <strong>without losing the essence of the point</strong> :</p>
              <p>'<span style="color: #0000ff;">And rising paper value of the houses (which keep changing hands from speculative buying) which adds up to GDP.</span>'</p>
              <p>Dumbass.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Now second point</p>
              <p>I still stand by my statement <span style="color: #008000;">"Our High GDP growth rate is not possible when we have negative productivity gains. They come from increase in government spending (military jets, infrastructure, like IR, universal studios) and rising paper value of the houses which keep changing hands which adds up to GDP".</span> Of course i understand how the different sectors contribute to GDP,</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">That point is trying to say that these are fake growth and temporary and not meant to say they contribute nothing!</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>Leme spell it out for you</p>
              <p>The 33% of our GDP stimulus package is also government spending, and have caused the caused the CPI to rise from negative to 3% to date. Have you ever thought that growth in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #800080;">financial services sector</span></span> and <span style="color: #008000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">wholesale &amp; retail trade sector</span></span> was because of the excess stimulus money supply and speculation from false confidence?</p>
              <p>Our increase in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manufacturing output</span></span>, Sure, they are led by some bio thing but they are not the totality of it all? have you thought that these also include temporary things like stocking and all the things we're building? (i.e TEMPORARY?).  <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And the points highlighted in blue are in my favor so i shant elaborate<br></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way you should know that GDP also includes government spending which is the increasing debt of the government into the billion. The fact that you so easily dismiss that and the stimulus in your 'GDP presentation'  <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shows that you do NOT KNOW how to calculate the different sectors contributed to the overall economic growth of the economy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please go back to study your economics 101 lah.</span></span></p>
              <p>The fact that i come back from clubbing and still own u means maybe u should go more basic..... maybe economics 100000000000000000000000000001 hahaa</p>

              <p><br>ya, so easy, why not, dun rely on export too much, one day, if the demand is now, we are doom, so by importing people in is good, at least the domestic demand is able to sustain our economy, tho not on the bull side, but at least, on the stable side.

              <p>I've already explained what you've said in blue it just shows that you don't know how to analyze the statistics and <strong>use your brain to think</strong> how they come from. you only know how to <strong>LOOK </strong>and wow mindlessly at it.
