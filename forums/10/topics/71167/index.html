            <div class='col-md body'>I heard ( and saw on TV ), with very little surprise that foreigners will be encouraged to help Singapore with the shortfall in babies.<br><br>Also, they are encouraged to bring over their dependants in a bid to attract more foreigners here to set roots. Looks to me, we're being consigned to the attic like old furniture.<br><br>What have you all to say now? Or rather, what can we say? But that's the way it is here?<br><br>I mean look, the gov is concerned we don't have kids to take care of us when we grow old, or that we get old and sick and become liabilities. Then fine, but why can't we have our CPF at retirement age ( before 62 ) to take care of diabetic conditions and high blood pressure ( which is so popular and common in SG ) so that it does not get worse by the time we reach 62?<br><br>I have a friend who has a diabetic condition, and high blood pressure to look after. Monthly medical fees are on average $300. She's way above 55, but below 62, so CPF board says she will only be given about $300 per month once she reaches 62 but meantime, she has nothing to tie her over. I mean, right now, while she is old and cannot get a job ( thanks again to SIngapore's employment preferences ) to finance the medical cost to treat the condition, why can't the government have a heart to let her have her money to control her ailments before it gets out of hand at 62, while her son who just recently started a business is better able to roll finances to grow? In a situation like this, who can think of having babies???<br><br>The government thinks there is nothing much about bearing children and bringing them up, but haven't they thought about young parents who also have aging and ailing parents to look after?? Medical costs for old parents, plus the costs of having a baby and much more down the line.<br><br>I think our government haven't done a reality check.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No one from the Ruling Party a.k.a the Government will be listening to you, UNTIL there is sufficient numbers of Opposition Members being elected into Parliament.<br><br>No one from the Opposition Party will be elected into Parliament, if Singaporeans believe in the propaganda that members from the Opposition Party are gangsters, buffoons, clowns, and whatever colorful adjectives they can dream up to paint the Opposition Members.<br><br>Each Singaporean, who dare to offer himself as a Candidate in an Election, will have already made a sacrifice by showing his hand in Opposing the Ruling Party.<br><br>His career and his future will be made more difficult then those who have reached 55 years and unable to draw on their CPF.<br><br>Not only will his career be affected, but also those considered to be his IMMEDIATE family members.<br><br>As responsible Singaporeans, who are concerned with the future of Singapore, we should support those throw in their lot with the Opposition Parties, and let them have the opportunity to grow with experience in Parliament and in the Art of State Craft.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What makes you think foreigners would want to leave the comforts of their own peaceful non-stress lifetyle to come here and f***k and settle down??? Seriously, why would you think that? Well probably only the foreigners on employment packages might, since their lifestyle is usually non as stressful as the local workers, but we dont have many of such foreigners i can tell you that.</div>
