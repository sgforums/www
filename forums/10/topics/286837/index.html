            <div class='col-md body'>If a gay is a born condition then a gay is not at fault for expressing his liking of the same sex or engaging with another gay in gay sex. It is doubtful if such gay should be treated as a criminal or sinful.<br><br>It is essential to differentiate between sin and perpetuating of sin. If a gay is born to desire sex with another gay it is not a sin or a crime. If a gay engages with a normal human being in gay sex then it is necessary to differentiate the two - the normal human being should be guilty of unnatural sex whereas the gay should not.<br><br>The law should grant immunity to the gay from prosecutions of his unnatural sex whereas the normal should be regarded as influenced and be discouraged from any involvement though not necessarily to be heavily punished.<br><br>Let all human beings understand the issue regarding gays and gay sex and unnatural sex in proper and objective light and not be affected by so much unnecessary controversy once and for all by drawing a line between sin and perpertuating in sin.<br><br>The way it is possible to different between the condition of being gay and perpetuating of a normal person in unnatural sex.<br><br>Let the born gay be respected as they are born. But not the normal persons for wanting to do the same. He can be appropriately discouraged.<br><br>Let the world grow up to understand this issue in proper prospective. Let the world be able to see that a condition that is born is not to be banned as it is beyond the fault of the person so born. It is like a person born with hay lip or handicap of some kind. Other human beings must learn to accept such condition.<br><br>If gays want to engage with other gays and interact among themselves, what can the rest of the society do? Should they ban them or treat their conduct or behavior as sinful or criminal?<br><br>The natural and logical answer should be no. It is not criminal for gays to exhibit their own naturally born instinct as part of their born characteristics.<br><br>If someone is born with a desire to take drug what can society do? Yes it is a crime to take drug but should the law be so harshly applied against such a person born with a condition like this?<br><br>Even though the rest of normal human beings are subjected to such threats must we punish a person born with such a condition e.g. someone who was given drug to relieve pain and became addicted.<br><br>Should the drug law punish hims severely as if he perpetuate in drug taking?<br><br>Such a born or involuntarily caused condition should be recognized for what it is and be appropriately pleaded as innocence or involuntary act and not be too overly or harshly treated as we are human beings and must be able to differentiate between voluntary crimes and involuntary crimes like manslaughter and murder.<br><br>The above-stated is an important principle which should be adopted in dealing with gay issues and problems to resolve potential emotive issues and misunderstandings often arising in dealing with gays.<br><br>So the laws prohibiting gay sex and gay activities should clearly be established based on such a principle - if a condition is born like gay the person found to engage in it should not be punished but not the normal person certified to be normal and not born with such a condition.<br><br>Of course the law should still be clear with regard to protecting the rest of society. Those who are certified by physicians as gays can be made to live their lives as they are born without criminality or discrimination.<br><br>The law should not encourage those who are not born gays to engage in unnatural gay sex though and there is no reason the gays should object to this line between draw for the sake of proper moral and ethical or religious wellbeing of the rest of society.</div>
