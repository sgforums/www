              <p>People around me keep saying that PAP will win by a huge margin as always... but I'm not so sure that's the case. I was especially impressed by the quality of some of the opposition.</p>

              <p>Ok... I think people are hesitant to read because it seems long. So 
              I'll summarize here. If you've additional points, please feel free to 
              reply. The actual article tries to include points and pictures from 
              various forums (such as the 02/04/2011 CNA forum) and current affairs.</p>
              <p>Why did I spend ten hours writing the article? I wanted to write 
              something that is balanced. Many people are polarized into either hating
               or revering the PAP. I just wanted one essay that shows both sides of 
              the picture as much as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Law and Legislation:</strong> Generally very good. PAP was the one who introduced tough laws against 
              crime. Singapore, despite recent problems, is still one of the safest 
              places on Earth.</p>
              <p><strong>Housing:</strong> Very important issue. Questions 
              on privitization and profit margins of HDB. Also questions on the some 
              issues regarding Mah Bow Tan's arguments. For example, if we devalue 
              houses, then that does not necessarily make those who already own houses
               poorer as this is offset when they buy a house (at a reduced price). 
              Also, the issue on PAP only giving upgrading perks to those who vote for
               them.</p>
              <p><strong>Sports and the arts:</strong> Made efforts such as esplanade, YOG, 
              sports school and community level programmes. But are these well 
              administrated? And are these just lip service or not?</p>
              <p><strong>Medical services:</strong> PAP's polyclinics.. or at least the idea behind them was to ensure 
              affordable health care. But in recent years, the price of general health
               care seems to be rising...</p>
              <p><strong>Clean ang green city:</strong> Generally excellent initiatives. Singapore is very clean and green considering that over 5 million people are in it.</p>
              <p><strong>Energy and water:</strong> PAP has forward planning on many key issues here. But the nuclear 
              energy should not really be an option unless its techonolgy progress to 
              be virtually 100% safe.</p>
              <p><strong>Helping the poor and elderly:</strong> Efforts such as WDA and CDC. But are such efforts enough?</p>
              <p><strong>PAP's "entrepreneurial ventures":</strong> Such as Casinos/IR, GLCs and our overseas investments like the one in China. How successful are these ventures?</p>
              <p><strong>General cost of living:</strong> Talks about GST issue and inflation. BOTH of these together makes it so
               much worse. I also made some simple calculations that show that the 
              rebates are really not enough by themselves. I've also written a bit on 
              how most economic year one students would know that indirect taxes are 
              generally inequitable... and harsher on the poor, contrary to what Mr 
              Tharman implies. (I've also given Mr Tharman's points and try to justify
               them a little. E.g. rebates)</p>
              <p><strong>Dealing with crisis:</strong> Generally good despite things such as Mas Selamat's escape. Floodings in
               Orchard though, could be indicative that our infrastructure is taxed 
              beyond its limit (tie in with foreign worker issue)</p>
              <p><strong>Salaries of ministers and MPs:</strong> Exceedingly high. PAP's stance of such high salaries tied in to private
               sector preventing corruption is discussed. But still... salaries are 
              exceedingly high. In contrast, the opposition parties do not have such 
              monetary compensation at all. They may even have to resort to their own 
              funds to help the areas they're in charge of (tie in with PAP's 
              "selective" upgrading programme)</p>
              <p><strong>Foreign workers, jobs, population growth and infrastructure:</strong> Issue of integration, economic implications, straining the 
              infrastructure and a few others are discussed. Generally, I strongly 
              disagree with the current rate of intake. (Relevant statistics and 
              graphs included from singstats) Also some quick calculations on how much
               real space is available to each person.</p>
              <p><strong>Education:</strong> We've come a long way since our independence.. 
              but currently the situation is overworked students and even more 
              overworked teachers.</p>
              <p><strong>Dealing with opposition:</strong> Generally 
              little freedom of speech. Talks a little about the treatment of 
              opposition members, especially when it comes to funds. Singapore's funds
               are taxpayers' money. As such, every area regardless of whether it 
              voted for the PAP or otherwise deserve full access to such funds (see 
              Housing issue). There's also the issue of the GRCs and how less 
              experienced candidates can "tag along" for PAP.</p>
              <p><strong>Foreign relations:</strong> Generally good. I didn't mention anything about our level of humility or otherwise though.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> We've the backdrop of PAP's past achievements and present concerns. 
              This, against the bigger issues of globalization and a changing 
              worldscape. We've the privatization of public services and goods, the 
              increased cost of living and many other important concerns. Paraphrasing
               Dr Vincent, we're at a crossroads. Political apathy is not an option 
              anymore. It's time to make your vote count.</p>
