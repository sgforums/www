            <div class='col-md body'>Every now and then, we hear the Govt saying that they will work out something, some policy to help the needy people and families.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But I am just wondering, how do they define needy?  How does the Govt identify them?</span> To begin with, one of the MPs Dr Ong in his Parliament speech proclaimed that we Singaporeans are rich, on the basis that each family can afford a TV at home.<br><br>In the hospitals, needy patient's medical bills are SUPPOSED TO BE either fully paid for or heavily subsidised by the hospital's charity known as Endowment Fund.  But most of these charities set a maximum household income for every applicants for the fund which is $1,500.  This means that if the patient is poor, but his combined income in the family reaches $1,500, the hospital charity will not help him.<br><br>If the Govt used the same methodology to identify needy, I really wonder how many people can be helped and how many needy remain helpless and desperate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with your point. There has to be more information of how the government plans to "assist" those that are needy and the first thing is who are included in the "needy"? The definition of household income of 1.5k is too simplistic (as shown in the case of the MRT suicide case) ... I guess there has to be more holistic idea (e.g. taking into account household situation e.g. health burdens, family burdens etc. With 1.5 k but with a deep burden of taking care of a sick household member should definitely merit some type of assistance. Furthermore, assistance should be more "creative". Does it always mean a specific sum, can assistance extend to other type e.g. provision of medical services or children services etc? These are some of the things that are applied in the US and perhaps other countries.<br><br>Reflecting on this entire episode, I find that much is lacking in the government's manner of approaching the issue (helping the poor and needy) and disseminating the information/plans and ideas. To be upfront, I am neither pro- nor anti- the PAP government. But from a (hopefully) neutral view, I feel there are just some many ways that the government could have used to more effectively put forward its policies and programs. For e.g. instead of just informing about the GST increase, the focus should have been on the programs and plans for the needy, getting more feedback and inputs (government, grass roots, the general public). The way to fund the program is important but frankly secondary once people see the vision, the need, the plan and provide the support. Technically, I believe the government rationale of using the GST as a means is correct (specifically, our implementation of the value-added tax is not regressive since businesses with less than 2mil are not required to pay it but rather it is progressive given that the wealthier consumers consume more of the services/goods that larger businesses provide and therefore taxed more - this however is debatable - e.g. a trickle effect that someone else mentioned). Yet, being technically correct does help when people are so keenly aware of the many cost increases that have been occurring over the last few months. If you have played some of the strategy games like Romance of the Three Kingdoms, you know that you can't continue to impose hikes as the "population" will revolt. Similarly, there is only so much the general mass of Singaporeans can accept with respect to policies that hits directly on their pockets. So it would seem that the lack of transparency, the seemingly cold economic mindset and logic of the present government serve to reinforce its apparent disconnect with issues close to the ordinary Singaporean. I find that there is some much that our current bureaucrats can learn from our founding history (how that generation of PAP dealt with and effectively delivered on its promises).</div>

How much and what are the figures and what they plan to do? How are the needy gonna benefit from this grand plan? Is this gonna narrow the expanding income gap? Several people in this forum are argueing that this GST hike is just gonna dig into the pockets of the middle and lower income segments of the population, to fund a net which is suppose to support us, so wouldn't this be worsening the problem?</div>
