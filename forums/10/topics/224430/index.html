            <div class='col-md body'>Without state, no homes to speak about; without families wither state?<br><br><blockquote>I REFER to the report, 'Panel to probe why many youths taking wrong path' (ST, Nov 30). Many children start their stay at childcare centres at a very young age - in the past, as young as 18 months. Now, we have babies as small as two months old attending infant-care centres.<br><br>Without a strong bonding with parents, these children become attached to their friends. Blessed is the child who has found the right company but those who have not, they end up taking the wrong path.<br><br>While it is good that the Government encourages us to have children, perhaps it is time it takes a step further by encouraging mothers or even fathers to raise their own children, at least for the first seven years of a child's life. A firm foundation keeps the building upright... Shirley Woon Li Lin (Mdm)</blockquote><blockquote>I APPLAUD the Prime Minister's suggestion to make the Workfare Bonus a permanent fixture in Singapore's social safety net. I appeal to the Government to consider giving the bonus to caregivers because care-giving is not only a full-time job but also an extremely difficult task.<br><br>Like me, many caregivers had to give up their jobs to care for their loved ones who are stricken with chronic illnesses. I now write for a living, after giving up my 31-year career. Raymond Anthony Fernando</blockquote><blockquote>Much has been said about providing financial help to workers to cope with the rising cost of living. How about full-time housewives who have  sacrificed their careers to take care of their children? Sabrinah Samad</blockquote>...

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">The govt can belt out whatever fancy-named initiatives it wants .. but if they continue to ignore the root of the problem and not practice what they preach, whatever change that comes will only be superficial / on paper but not in practice.  Then the elites up there will be scratching their heads and pointing fingers at the commonfolk.  And vice versa.<br><br>Our current corporate culture currently puts the employees at a clear disadvantage.   Once you start pushing for better work terms as a reward for your good &amp; hard work, your employer starts looking for someone who can fill your position but settle for less.  The employers MUST be convinced that granting their staff this added flexibility will be in the company's best interests before they will willingly allow it.<br><br>So it seems the govt has been targeting the wrong group of people all along.<br><br>Now, what better way for the govt to start the ball rolling than to set an example and introduce appropriate incentives to entice other companies to follow suit?</span></div>
