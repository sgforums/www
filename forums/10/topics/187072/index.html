            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that teenagers should get involved in politics by knowing the basic of it and no need to go to the extent of it.<br><br>As you can see, most of the teenagers are not interested in politics as they are boring and useless to them, but it can control over their life. As the government can do whatever they want to the citizens which is everyone of us. If they don't know the basic of it, it will be quite difficult for them to raise out for eg if their favourite sport is being ban and they feel agitated over it.<br>One of the reasons of causes that lead them to have no time on it is due to the tons of homework and project we received, same goes apply for me. Even though all this are a challenge to me, I will still find time for that as they are bread and butter issues concerning me as a citizen and the country if not knowing any thing it can be quite a disadvantage for the rest who dunno anything about it. I hope that schools can promote the basic of politics in school in a soft way even though it is a sensitive issue but it is better for them to know better on it rather when they grow up which may be quite torublesome for them. Even though our country is peaceful and stable for now, we need to gear everyone up if there is a political turmoil strike in country which I hope it wouldn't happen. Like that they can gain more in knowledge and also let them to have their brain to function more by the view of thoughts and thinking as I see that everyone out there can excel.</div>
