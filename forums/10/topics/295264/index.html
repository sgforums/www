            <div class='col-md body'>Many people have hailed Lee Kuan Yew as a great first-world leader.<br><br>How true is this compliment? Can we compare his greatness to leaders like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Churchill, Deng Xiao Peng.<br><br>Apparently he has succeeded in the initial years in creating basic infrastructure, education and political stability as a base.<br><br>Apart from the initial success what else has he achieved ? Has he succeeded in transforming the economy to a resilient economy which can sustain the ups and downs in various other economies?<br><br>Is the present economic performance due to general world recovery and property play or IR. If he is a great leader then he must have solved certain problems faced by the people. Has he done so?<br><br>Has he succeeded in winning over the people and motivated them to take an active part in nation building to bring the economy to the first world or has he used only his political power over his opponents or critics to get what he wanted for himself or his party?<br><br>The above-stated are pertinent questions to be asked and answered if we want to arrive at a logical and objective conclusion.<br><br>Now let us start answering some of these questions. Are the people under his leadership over the past 40 years enjoying higher wages and higher standards of living or are they suffering from lower or dropping wages and prospect of losing their basic rights and jobs to foreigners. Are the people enjoying good government and happy.<br><br>It appears that from his own admission his starting point has been people are prone to riots, rebellions and needed to be controlled and the media has to come under rigid government control in order to avoid media getting into mischiefs.<br><br>It appeared that his solution is to clamp down on dissent by using the power afforded by democracy as machinery to get his way to survive politically and override on people's wishes and needs and to serve his and his own party interests.<br><br>He was highly motivated to bring about development at any costs to the people. So he ruled with great determination using all the scholars and elites as his instrument to maintain political control and to stay in power.<br><br>To him in order to succeed he has to avoid welfarism so he made all departments to be self-sufficient and resorted to taxing and recouping all costs and profiteering to create surpluses which he regarded as his own success.<br><br>The common men are not part of his solution. He would charge the highest fees called affordable fees from housing to transportation to utility and medical care to avoid spending on taxes so taxes get accumulated as surpluses for the state.<br><br>Despite making all the sacrifices over the years in paying the highest direct and indirect taxes to support the government which is enjoying all the power and highest rewards at the expense of the people, the wishes and aspirations of the people are often overruled or ignored.<br><br>MM Lee has not been able therefore to motivate the people with such a governing philosophy treating people as targets to suppress or tax so many citizens have voted with their feet and migrated to other less stressful countries.<br><br>Yet Lee continues to claim success of his brand of leadership which looks rather fragile which lead finally to his having to resort to hypocrisy and justifications to sing his own songs of success.<br><br>There is no sign of arrival of a value-adding technology-driven economy talked about for years precisely because of lack of talents, motivation or creativity due to wrong individualistic and egoistic anti-people and anti-teamwork system of governing.<br><br>He was able to get his way all because as a trained lawyer he was able play with legalistic wrangling of laws to stay in power but people essentially are suffering due to lack of motivation to participate in greater entrepreneurship or value venture to maximise their potential.<br><br>For one who claimed to be successful to use power to get what he wants we do not know whether he can be really be judged to be that successful or great.</div>
