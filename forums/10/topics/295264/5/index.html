            <div class='col-md body'>Lee Kuan Yew is the greatleader of a small country with no natural resource but many mouths to be fed- Singapore is not a first-world and was once a third world country<br><br>If Mao Zedong was 60% right and 40 % wrong and Deng Xiao Peng was 70% right and 30% wrong, then Lee Kuan Yew is definitely 90% right and 10% wrong. How come  he is not 100% right ? because he is human being. I am a free thinker but believe only God is 100% right!<br></div>

He has contributed to the birth of the nation and the building up of its basic infrastructure but he over-did taxing the people at every turn to enrich the government coffer without giving back anything much in return thereby running down our competitiveness.<br><br>The alternative to his top-down leadership is collective leadership which through delegated processes as posted in <a href="http://www.managefranchise.blogsppot.com" rel="nofollow">www.managefranchise.blogsppot.com</a> empowers all leaders and the whole civil service at every strata to contribute mass knowledge application without all his nannying and self-glorifying. Only through an inside-out approach treating his people with such deep concern and respect will he retain many good people and stop our brain drain even without all his assumptions that by paying his elite leaders well with millions which is without basis or proven results. Instead his millions only attracted the self-seekers who will do things to his bidding and drive up our costs and divide our society.<br><br>Only when he seeks the unlocking of his fellow citizens' talents to give of their best will he discover true talents. Only then will he succeed in leaving something good and lasting like a more cost-competitive quality-conscious socially and culturally cohesive society which is more enduring and more likely to unite the people to work as one.</div>
