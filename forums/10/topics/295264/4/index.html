            <div class='col-md body'>Some people have always asked this question, - if we do not have our present ministers then who are going to lead us?<br><br>Very simple, ask yourself this question - is it true there is no leaders or potential leaders and is not such a shortage of leaders as always cited caused by wrong leadership, suppressions like GRC or defamation lawsuits thereby depriving us of potential leaders.<br><br>If say 5 of the yes-men ministers are to lose their seats in the next election will Singaporeans' lives be necessarily worse off or will our economy or business go bust or investors take flight.<br><br>Potential leaders are many as I see it. They were prevented from standing for election by the GRC and the constant threats and defamation suits. People believe in propaganda that there is no talents among Singaporeans because of brainwashing.<br><br>The first thing when GRC is lifted we will see many people standing for election many as independents. We will see many with new ideas which are more pro-people and who could create new technology start-ups and innovative industries in hordes because of their talents which were so far suppressed.<br><br>It is not true that we do not have the talents. There is no opportunity given to many capable people to serve so all believe there is no talents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There ought to be a more open and accountable system if we want to develop our human capital - not by money alone or opening the flood gates to foreigners who may not even be attracted to us because the really good foreign talents already know enough about our suppressions or lack of motivation in our political system and will not be rooted here.<br><br>On the other hand due to brainwashing many citizens cannot see the alternative or a more open and larger perspective to solve our many social problems created. So they cannot understand the problems and prefer to stick to play safe and accept the status quo and not want to change.<br><br>The issue facing us the little red dot is not to cling on to past system where one man decides everything and if he is too rigid and self-centred he will create a lot of problems as we have seen in many areas from education to economic restructuring or mass participation and practical knowledge application which we need to bring about a more competitive society.<br><br>So we should start reexamining all the past assumptions made by our leaders and open up to new ideas and new areas where we could grow. It would be quite narrow minded to keep assuming we do not have more capable leaders and only insist the only the existing parties or leaders' own connections are our talents or leaders.<br><br>Without looking at the whole issue in greater depth and perspective we cannot make any real progress.<br><br>So when we keep asking who we can have or see as our leaders of tomorrow, we may be constraining our own choice or alternatives.<br><br>If we truly want to find or develop or work towards a more sustainable political evolution to get over the past suing and suppressing autocracy or dictatorship, we will need to keep this open system in mind all the time and chuck out all the existing ones based on connections or self-centredness.<br><br>This is especially crucial because we are a little red dot without landed or natural resources - we need to maximize our one resource that is the human resource or human capital.<br><br>It is only when our political leaders are thinking hard enough of such an open and larger alternative solutions that we can truly maximize our human resource and admit more practical talents needed to run the country.<br><br>By leaders I do not mean only ministers or MPs. At every level we need leaders. Now we are constrained by a small or limited group of people who only regard people connected or known to them by connection as talents.<br><br>Definition of capable people or talents must be reexamined and be made such that real practical talents are easily accessible to fill different levels of needs for leadership.<br><br>We could now see that only certain people known to them by connection are admitted to serve.<br><br>By such a narrow approach the government will be unable to find real and capable people and we will continue to listen to all the craps about our lack of talents and therefore will have to continue to use monies to buy talents when many capable people are sidelined as non-talents..</div>
