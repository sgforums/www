The practical test is whether such a leader has been able to bring about the greatest benefit of the greatest number. LKY is aware of such a leadership criteria but he has only paid lip service to such criteria and instead once he was secure in his power he went on the reverse of governing only to serve his own or his party political agendas at the expense of this leadership principle.<br><br>Yes he has served the people to fulfill their collective goal of achieving independence and establishing the basic needs in housing, infrastructural and other developments in the initial period 1960s-1970s. For this initial achievement he was (past tense) a great leader.<br><br>However since 1970s, secure in his power he became a different person and began to govern for his own interests and agendas to stay in power and tweaked laws and regulations based on false and unproven assumptions of all kinds. Based on assumption about the danger of welfarism he single-minded resorted to taxing and recouping all costs of essential services resulting in ever-rising costs of living and our gradual loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>A people that is so grossly over-taxed by all forms of direct and indirect taxes as posted in another thread simply could not survive.<br><br>In addition he became vindictive and went all out to sue his political opponents for so-called libelous speeches made in the heat of election campaigning and even threaten people with lawsuits even for remarks made due to provocation from himself. Is this the sign of greatness at all by any definition?<br><br>So everything has gone wrong with the same erstwhile great leader because of self or self-centredness and arrogance.<br><br>If he had not let power go to his head from the 1970s we might have gone on to achieve greater economic competitiveness from developing our own mass talents in every sphere of nationhood.<br><br>Instead he relied on hypocrisy and justifications to deny problems to no avail even in the face of all the wrong doings as exposed in NKF and subsequent audits of many departments.<br><br>Again is this denial syndrome a sign of maturity or greatness of leadership.<br><br>So on such record how could he ever compare with any one of the leaders as mentioned,<br><br>Singapore could have built a more competitive, more friendly and cooperative and caring society if we had open up and be more broadminded in our leadership. Many assumptions made were simply not as they were made out to be.<br></div>

The fact that he had perpetuated himself in  power for over half a century, outlasting and outmaneuvering(okay maybe he just fvcked his opponents to death) should bear testimony to his ability. Also, he was more intelligent than the other less sophisticated dictators around the region. Oh well somebody should just give him a prize for engineering apathetic and fearful Singaporeans who voted him into power time and again.<br><br>He had given himself so much lead that it would be difficult to turn the tables on him. He crafted a military that poses utterly no threat to his regime( take note that most dictatorships fell due to coup).

Has he succeeded in transforming the economy to a resilient economy which can sustain the ups and downs in various other economies?<br><br>Is the present economic performance due to general world recovery and property play or IR. If he is a great leader then he must have solved certain problems faced by the people. Has he done so?<br><br>Has he succeeded in winning over the people and motivated them to take an active part in nation building to bring the economy to the first world or has he used only his political power over his opponents or critics to get what he wanted for himself or his party?<br><br>The above-stated are pertinent questions to be asked and answered if we want to arrive at a logical and objective conclusion.<br><br>Now let us start answering some of these questions. Are the people under his leadership over the past 40 years enjoying higher wages and higher standards of living or are they suffering from lower or dropping wages and prospect of losing their basic rights and jobs to foreigners. Are the people enjoying good government and happy.<br><br>It appears that from his own admission his starting point has been people are prone to riots, rebellions and needed to be controlled and the media has to come under rigid government control in order to avoid media getting into mischiefs.<br><br>It appeared that his solution is to clamp down on dissent by using the power afforded by democracy as machinery to get his way to survive politically and override on people's wishes and needs and to serve his and his own party interests.<br><br>He was highly motivated to bring about development at any costs to the people. So he ruled with great determination using all the scholars and elites as his instrument to maintain political control and to stay in power.<br><br>To him in order to succeed he has to avoid welfarism so he made all departments to be self-sufficient and resorted to taxing and recouping all costs and profiteering to create surpluses which he regarded as his own success.<br><br>The common men are not part of his solution. He would charge the highest fees called affordable fees from housing to transportation to utility and medical care to avoid spending on taxes so taxes get accumulated as surpluses for the state.<br><br>Despite making all the sacrifices over the years in paying the highest direct and indirect taxes to support the government which is enjoying all the power and highest rewards at the expense of the people, the wishes and aspirations of the people are often overruled or ignored.<br><br>MM Lee has not been able therefore to motivate the people with such a governing philosophy treating people as targets to suppress or tax so many citizens have voted with their feet and migrated to other less stressful countries.<br><br>Yet Lee continues to claim success of his brand of leadership which looks rather fragile which lead finally to his having to resort to hypocrisy and justifications to sing his own songs of success.<br><br>There is no sign of arrival of a value-adding technology-driven economy talked about for years precisely because of lack of talents, motivation or creativity due to wrong individualistic and egoistic anti-people and anti-teamwork system of governing.<br><br>He was able to get his way all because as a trained lawyer he was able play with legalistic wrangling of laws to stay in power but people essentially are suffering due to lack of motivation to participate in greater entrepreneurship or value venture to maximise their potential.<br><br>For one who claimed to be successful to use power to get what he wants we do not know whether he can be really be judged to be that successful or great.</div></blockquote>Are you a member of the opposition party?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If not I suggest you forward this article to them than they can make a big hoo ha at the next election  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I am posting here like many others independently of any political parties' views. From my own perception, our political parties do not really work with forumers or websites for their input and they have their own in-house advisors. So I do not think they will post consider our views or opinions as helpful.<br><br>If you or any one here think otherwise they have my blessing to use my views on this matter. Thanks.</div>

He let power go to his head and became arrogant always trying to talk about his leadership and his past glory instead of focusing in solving many problems.<br><br>So to me because of such self-glorifications and self-interests he had sacrifice the larger good of society and our economy stagnated for many years.<br><br>Now with the recent world recovery he seized the opportunity quickly to talk about his past success again and again being too self-centred and protectionistic of his own gains and positions.<br><br>This kind of leadership to me is not great at all. He should just retire and let Singaporeans throw up their own new-age leaders without interference from behind the scene. We do have many potential good leaders who are much more passionate and capable than him who understand the needs of the people and who will no doubt given the opportunity win over the people to develop and nurture mass participation and practical knowledge application of all citizens (not just limited to scholars) to serve the greatest benefits of the greatest number.<br><br>People must use their keen perception to spot such new leaders who could serve them not necessarily people who are so-called scholars or high-flyers.</div>
