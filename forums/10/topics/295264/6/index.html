Is there super performance on their part? The other world leaders who really did great then should ask for 200% increases in their salaries ...  The problem is when there is screw ups, these ministers are never penalised. There is also no objective performance measure and the world is on an upswing in the economy therefore the better performance is not 100% attributed to the performance of our ministers which as usually they will claim it so.<br><br>Yes it is pointless but its is a matter of concern when we are their paymasters and yet these ministers had always gone ahead with their decisions regardless of the voice on the ground.<br></div>
