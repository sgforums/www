            <div class='col-md body'>A well written article which summarizes the problems in a nutshell caused by top-down authoritarian rule over the past 40 plus years.<br><br>It has critically examined under such authoritarian rule by one man, whether such a system has since 1997 indeed achieved any economic prosperity for the masses in exchange for curtailing of their freedoms of speech, speaking up on government's wrong policies, arbitrary detention of opponents without trials, doctoring the electoral process to hinder election of individuals in single ward etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">As a continuation of the opening thread posted, it was surprising to stumble on the following paragraphs of a report that is seldom noted : </span><br><br><span style="color: darkgreen;"><blockquote>:<br><br>An extract from the <a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=977" rel="nofollow">ThinkCentre : <span style="font-style: italic;">''Comet in Our Sky : Lim Chin Siong in History''</span></a><br><br>In a startling and revisionist essay, Dr Greg Poulgrain of Griffiths University observes that the British Governor of Singapore and his Chief Secretary in their reports to London had admitted that <strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the police could find no evidence to establish that Lim was a communist</span></span></strong>.<br><br>Poulgrain claims <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>it was actually Singapore's then Chief Minister, Lim Yew Hock, who had deliberately "provoked" the bus and other industrial workers and Chinese middle students to riot in 1956 in order to have Lim Chin Siong arrested</strong></span>.<br><br><strong>Lim Yew Hock's own admission to responsibility for the riot appears in an official report to the British Government which <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Poulgrain found in the Colonial Office records in London which are now open to researchers</span></strong>.<br><br><strong>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party with Lim Yew Hock</span>,"</strong> adds Poulgrain, <strong>"in urging the Colonial Secretary to impose the subversives ban in making it illegal for former political detainees to stand for election." </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In 1959, while Lim was in prison, the PAP won the general elections under which Lee became Prime Minister</span>, and Singapore was granted self-government by the British in all matters except for internal security, defence and external affairs.<br><br>Although Lim and other leftist political detainees were released from prison, their co-operation and alliance with Lee ended in 1961 due to disagreements over policies and strategies.<br><br>Until then the media presented the PAP as a leftwing party, indicating the pervasive and dominant influence of Lim's faction within and outside the party. Their rivalry was intense and ideological. Lee finally resorted to arrests to remove Lim and his faction.<br><br>When Lim and other political detainees such as Fong Swee Suan and S. Woodhull were released, they were appointed Political Secretaries. But the honeymoon was soon over.<br><br>The PAP split in 1961 saw Lim taking away with him almost the entire PAP branches and personnel to form and lead a new party, the Barisan Socialis (Socialist Front).<br><br></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">With the Archives of Public Records Office being opened in London - after the statutory period of secrecy has expired - the <span style="font-style: italic;">''Truth of the Past''</span> can now be fully known.<br><br>Since the release of new declassified information from the Public Records Office in London, Malaysians had the benefit of understanding the facts that led to their May 13 racial riots in 1969. The Malaysian are able to satisfy themselves that there were no racial tensions that sparked the riots, but that the purposeful accentuation of racial faultlines to cause a riot with racial overtones that will allow a small group of aggressive Malay Capitalist Politicians to usurp powers from the Conservative Malay Royalists under Tunku Abdul Rahman - (who had preferred a unified multi-racial approach in economic and political progress).<br><br>What will the Public Records Office in London reveal for those who have been accused of being communists by the Ruling Party - locked up unjustly, allowed to languish in prison for the better part of their youth ?<br></span><br><br></div>
