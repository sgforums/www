            <div class='col-md body'>Bernama) - A guest relations officer (GRO), who was photographed easing herself in a truck by a volunteer reserve corps member (Rela) after she was detained in a raid, Friday filed a suit against him and three others seeking RM5 million in damages.<br><br>The writ of summons was filed by Messrs Karpal Singh &amp; Company at the Civil High Court Registry in Wisma Denmark at 3.00 pm Friday.<br><br>Maslinda Ishak, 26, named the Rela member, Mohamad Tahir Osman, the Director-General of Rela, the Federal Territory Islamic Affairs Department (Jawi) and the Government of Malaysia as defendants.<br><br>In her statement of claim, Maslinda said that together with others, she was placed in a truck and taken to Taman Maluri, Cheras, after being arrested by Rela and Jawi officers at Kelab De Vegas, Jalan Imbi, Kuala Lumpur during a joint operation at about 11.30 pm on March 21.<br><br>She said she requested permission to use a toilet to ease herself when the truck was in the vicinity of Jalan Jejaka 5, Taman Maluri, Cheras at about 12.50 am on March 22 but the Rela and Jawi officers denied her permission to do so.<br><br>Maslinda claimed that instead, the officers scolded her and asked her to relieve herself in the truck.<br><br>She said she then requested her friends to form a circle around her with a scarf as she was in desperate need to ease herself.<br><br>She said at that point, Mohamad Tahir suddenly opened the back door of the truck, pushed Maslinda's friends away as well as pulled away Maslinda's scarf and immediately started taking photographs of her while she was in the midst of easing herself.<br><br>She is seeking, among others, general damages, including aggravated and exemplary damages, in the sum of RM5 million, interest, costs and any further relief deemed fit by the court.<br><br>Maslinda said that Mohamad Tahir's action constituted a grave trespass to her person and had caused her to suffer embarassment, humiliation and severe emotional and mental shock and trauma.<br><br>She also claimed that the Rela and Jawi officers, who were present at the time of the incident, breached their duty of care towards her by allowing Mohamad Tahir to take photographs of her.<br><br>Maslinda also claimed that the defendants were negligent for not permitting her to ease herself in a toilet, giving her no choice but to relieve herself in the truck as well as enabling Mohamad Tahir to take photographs of her and also for failing to stop Mohamad Tahir from acting in the manner that he did.<br><br>She said the officers had abused their powers and authority by denying her permission to ease herself and that Mohamad Tahir acted in utter disregard and contempt of her feelings and dignity.<br><br>Maslinda claimed that Mohamad Tahir abused and misused his powers as an officer from a government law enforcement agency by intruding on her privacy with intent to insult her modesty by taking her photographs while she was easing herself.<br><br>On April 16, the Kuala Lumpur Magistrate's Court sentenced Mohamad Tahir, 40, to four months' jail after he pleaded guilty to insulting Maslinda's modesty by taking 31 photographs of her easing herself.<br><br>Speaking to reporters later, Karpal said the sentence imposed on Mohamad Tahir was manifestly inadequate and he had written to the Attorney-General's chambers requesting him to file an appeal against the four months jail sentence.<br><br>He said that if the Attorney-General did not appeal against the sentence, he would apply at the High Court for a revision to have Mohamad Tahir's sentence increased.<br><br></div>

Do you want to support a party of whom the party leader said women are a cause of moral decadence, that young women with lesser clothes on tempts him to create sins? PAS's manifesto, thought and action are borne out of religious bad habits and not from any sense of trying to be sensible about its own society and problems.<br><br>Mohd Hashim Kamali, THE law professor in International Islamic University of Malaysia, the Sisters in Islam and even Dr.M has been opposing PAS's implementation of the hudud laws ever since more than a decade ago. Its best if you support these muslims instead of being amicable to the idea of "islam".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PAS is a rural religious nationalist movement that has transformed itself into a Malay minority political party and is trying to transform itself into a national democratic party with Islamic roots, similar to the Turkish AK party. We have seen PAS form alliances with DAP, a Chinese dominated democratic opposition party so I would take every policy idea flouted by a PAS representative as an attempt to test water to see which policies will gain it maximum political mileage. It may perhaps be another generation before PAS ranks are filled with leaders who understand the delicate nuances of Malaysian politics and that may not even be the case if Barisan continues to dominate national politics. So I think Singaporean Islamophobes can rest easy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its a paradox, that while PAS is being Islamist, PAS is actually tons more accommodating to other religions and race. Kelantan (PAS's jurisdiction) has the biggest buddhist statue in Malaysia while in a few UMNO states, statues like that are considered haram. When PAS came into power, they offered to build a hindu temple while UMNO-led groups destroyed them. When the orang-asli church was recently forcefully brought down, Nik Aziz, PAS's party leader warns you can't force Islam into others. Pork and alcoholic beverages are also easily available in non-muslim restaurants contrary to some misconceptions.<br><br>BUT.... BUT.. PAS expressions for an islamic state and especially PAS expressions in fiqh (juristic thought to pass laws) remains of a taqlidi (imitative, impotent) orientation. They're not necessarily reflective to reach an actual sensible social objective. Case in point on issues of zina, polygamy, women, irtidad, misyar marriage, tudung, and the impossibility of tawbah in enforcing the hadd laws. PAS propositions for Islamic-ness for muslims isn't considered fair for muslims themselves.</div>
