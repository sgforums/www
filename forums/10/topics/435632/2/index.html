              <p>By the way, I think it is because the second language syallbus
              is too easy so the student lost their interest in learning the
              language.  I won't argue whether second language is important
              here.  I just want to find out whether I should call the
              police and going to ang mo kio to talk to our PM.  I wish to
              find out about the truth.</p>

              <p>Do you know that some students cannot even manage their English language? If they cannot even manage one language, do you still expect them to manage one more? Are u not killing them? On the extreme end , RI, RGS kids can master up to 6 language with ease. So I think Chinese B policy is good. May it would be even better if it is a non-examination subject.</p>

              <p>Furthermore, do you know "even the so called mother tongue" that is "taken as (our) second language" is not out real mother tongues?</p>
              <p>Not only English replace Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil,  the so-called mother tongue "Mandarin", "Malay" and "Tamil" are fake mother tongues to many of these ethnic groups in Singapore.</p>
              <p>As pointed out to you in my previous post in the previous page, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the different types of Indians speak different Indian <strong>languages</strong>.</span>   For example, if your ancestors came from <strong>Kerala</strong>, most probably your mother tongue is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Malayalam</strong></span>.   If one's ancestors came from <strong>Andhra Pradesh</strong>, one's mother tongue is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Telugu</strong></span>.   <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Not all the Indian people's mother tongues is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tamil</span></span></strong>,  and quite a sizeable proportion of Indians in Singapore do not have Tamil as their mother tongue,  but are forced to choose Tamil when they enrolled in Primary 1.   You can see from their surnames,  example,  Indians whose surnames are <strong>Mohanan</strong>, <strong>Bhaskaran</strong>, <strong>Reddy</strong>, usually they are not Tamils,  they are Malayalees and Telaganas.  But Singapore government only publishes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tamil textbooks</span>  and  teach in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tamil</span>  syllabus.</p>
              <p>What is more frustrating is that,  the government indeed provides 2nd language instruction at MOE for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hindi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bengali</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gujarati</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Urdu</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punjabi</span> :</p>
              <p>see here</p>
              <p><strong><a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/admissions/returning-singaporeans/mother-tongue-policy/">http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/admissions/returning-singaporeans/mother-tongue-policy/</a></strong></p>
              <p>Why provide for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hindi</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bengali</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gujarati</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Urdu</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Punjabi</span>  which are the most minority groups among the Indians in Singapore,    and <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">purposely omit</span>  </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Telugu</strong></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Malayalam</strong></span> ,  when a very significant proportion of Singaporean Indians ancestors came from South India ???</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">What do they mean by non-Tamil students (may choose these languages)?</span></strong>   A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Telugu</span> person and a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malayalee</span> person are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Tamil</span> people as well !!!</p>
              <p>This is very unreasonable.</p>
