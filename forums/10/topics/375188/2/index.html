              <p>your internal mole theory was checked by pap 8 yearsago or more.thespore gov normally get rid of people likethat.they can smell internal moles intheir midst instantly.they have their own methods of making decisions.isnt much differentfrom the nazi system  at times.</p>

              <p><br>the ideologist goes same with LKY on PAP leader,...good opposition leaders must also be found, not train ya. You need a brunch of opposition peoples who are smart, can act better than hollywood, can lead, daring, jovious, cool but alert and finally, able to execute the final moment when the right time arrived.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP is a party initially set up by a group of peoples, they all shared the same inspiration and passion, but thing changed, and people start to leave, leaving LKY to be the lion king, and that suit him well, those left had fell into his plan, he knew what is coming. The differences btw them and LKY is that LKY has a gift that few peoples has in their mind. So, what is the gift he has? To know the answer, stay tune to Angel Online, the nos 1 primetime in sg.</p>

              <p>Angel7030, your theory is sound, but in practicality, it is flawed. MM Lee is no fool, and so are his team.</p>
              <p>But however, they are and will be victims of their own success. They have to constantly renew themselves and embrace changes as our world and technologies evolve, or they will no longer be relevant.</p>
              <p>Be glad, we still have the power of vote, which determines which party gets to administer our country, every 4 to 5 years.</p>
              <p>No matter how they may attempt to protect their party, in the belief that they are the best to lead, the tide of change is inevitable, in the way we think and the way we work. Look towards history and see how much we had change, and you may understand what I am talking about.</p>
              <p>The answer to change lies with our young. It doesnt matter which political party they join, but those who want to serve society must be of the best calibre, not only in IQ, but EQ as well, most critically - to have integrity and absolute loyalty to our People.</p>
              <p>They may still be young and immature, but the basics must be there, and given opportunities to grow up, not just grow old, in a conduceive peaceful environment.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, there may not even be a need to join the opposition for change to happen. So long as that leader-to-be is loyal to society, he will perform in our interest. His position, and all that he suffered for, is dependant upon our sacred vote.</p>
              <p>PS: Hope you will ignore those discriminatory remarks made by morons, which we singaporeans have to suffer for they are our own people probably, only who had not evolve beyound the tree tops, who called you labets.</p>
              <p>Freedom of speech belongs to such monkeys too, just as you have the fullest freedom of speech too, regardless of whoever or whatever you are. The new society of Singapore discriminates against no one, with regards to freedom of speech.  </p>

              <p>dear Honey xtreyier,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My place here got more morons than sgsforum ya, and in comparing with these virtual morons here,  all morons in sgfourms here, are chicken feets, me dun even bother need to care about them, afterall, this is cyber ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok honey, let get serious,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a talent in LKY that not much people have, and that is the future, LKY understand that history makes what it is today, and what he do today will create the future, he has a talent of controlling the future, in 1960 to 1963, he already knows what is going on and what the future lies, therefore he planned his move before all those stupid people in his party move out. Bear in mind, that it is these people, who thot they can beat him by forming a new Barisan party out of PAP, more so, it is these group who betray him, but he already had his blueprint for the future. Thus when most peoples are concentrating on current problem, he is alway thinking ahead of others. And that is why he is unique.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is too fragile to play with politics, you cannot have 3 or 4 parties inside the parliament shouting and argueing over matters leading to riot, protest and chaos. Within 3 months, the country collapse and those eagles and vultures are waiting outside ready to eat over you. Our economy need decisive and quick responses, we cannot let politicians go on argueing for the sake of their self interest in gathering power. We are a country that cannot work with too many monkeys talking, that is a unique part of us, other countries can afford to have different guidance because they got states and cities that form the united front. Ours is a city state by itself, one state, one govt, one singapore.</p>

              <p>hey angel7040,</p>
              <p>wat do u meaN BY WHAT HE DOES TODAY WILL AFFECT TOMORROW?</p>
              <p>howd u know if he did anything today or yesterday?do u even have a list of what he did this month even?</p>
              <p>name me just 2 things he did last year even besides scolding n threatening people?</p>
              <p>wedun need to have the best leaders to tell us  what the future is with the current situation now.</p>
              <p>do u always depend on the spore government and senile old sg uncle for information and your future all the time???</p>
              <p>and how on earth can you compare an efficient political machine as a monkey cage filledwith monkeys?an efficient system is a combination of programs and sub-programs with  practical tried n tested system.and no way is any person going to just open their mouth and simply say its no good or good.even if u are a hundred year old with some experience u still are not qualified to state its position.thats only meant for a collection of wise people and unbiased votes if that system isnt going to vanish in 20years time.</p>
              <p>i actually have doubts that the efficient  system seems to be sadly vanishing before me.</p>
              <p>thanks to people like u,,,spore will be chaotic as the taiwanese parliament with their regular shouting and fighting within the building itself.</p>
              <p>as for the hong kong people.....they are communist and its the decision just from head communist party.</p>
