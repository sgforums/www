              <p>so watch your words ....no one believes the gov anymore.....where the hell have the 2 of you been so far?have you been on drugs?</p>
              <p>i should say most sporeans are ruled by fear of losing their jobs and dying a painfully slow death in expensive spore.spore is very much like north korea and ranks as next to all those oppresive countries if u care to surf the internet under freepress.spore is also second expensive to tokyo in asia if the 2 of u even bothered to check it out.all these contribute to people not willing to fight it out.i only fear sporeans may be as ignorant as the 2 of you are.but as i  have been werking with my fellow sporeans ,most are angry at what was happening,most just wade the tide till things get better.</p>

              <p><br>I think you have to respect other people perspectives in looking into singapore clear present and danger situation. How many Singapore beside me, at 18 yo then, or even you, think about politics, as i posted many a times, most of my young frens in our early 20th also do not know what is going on, and who is the opposition, so to speak, in another words, if you serve a plate of politic senarios to each young peoples, they absorb it differently. But i can guarantee you, most will ignore it and dun even care the shit about it. How does this action come about, well, you may say LKY instilled a full brainwash on them or perhaps they are more interested in other stuffs. But you hv to give credit to LKY for being able to provide education opportunities for young peoples like us, not that the lecturers are PAP related, there are also China Chinese, Russian lecturer preaching Marxism and COmmie ideologist here, we are so liberated that today we understood what is education that provide knowledge and what is education that provide mental diversion to offensiveness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A true person live by his/her principles, he set his goals, his objectives and his plans to achieve it, even if it failed, losing all that had once being his/her pride, he/she still has the principle to live another day. If he/she felt regretted or cheated by what he/she had sacrificed in his/her life, be it you are old, middle age or young like me, you are nothing but a coward. A true coward. LKY had alway admired Uncle JB jeya, but because of different political background and interest, he cannot simply give him the benefit of his praises. But to him, Uncle JB lived as a true hero. I attended his ceremony whereby his son, Philip, gives a wonderful speech, all senior PAP minister, including PM and MM and SM attended. And at that time LKY already said "Leadership must be found, and we found it in Mr. JB, just that he is on the other side of midnight, but does not mean he is not a leader, he is a great leader, a man who holds his principles and intergrity, as an opponent to me, I have to do my part, but deep in my heart, I thot to myself, why i missed JB in the early 70s, he will have make a wonderful Home Affair minister."</p>

              <p>Last time, my Taiwan Uncle, Ao Li already said, "Singaporean are stupid" no one believe him. Now you see lah..He also told me that I am stupid to become a Singaporean, but I am not that stupid lor, because I heeled his advises whereas many Singaporeans throwed rubbish at him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Dear Singaporeans, learn to take critics as positive feedback ya, and when someone from another perspective said something bad about you, dun take it to heart, study it and learn to be smart. The more kiasu you are, the more you tend to suuuu...until pant drop.</p>
