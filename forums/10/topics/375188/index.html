              <p>“WE SAT through a talk yesterday on land investment in Birmingham and was shocked when my friend immediately ploughed in S$25,000 (RM60,000) to buy a 1,076 sq ft parcel,” an Internet surfer recently wrote.</p>
              <p>“It had no planning permit and might take seven years to get one,” he added.</p>
              <p>Yet she took the plunge. Why?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“She was enticed by the gifts – a S$600 (RM1,440) camera, S$100 (RM240) in shopping and S$50 (RM120) in dining vouchers and two bottles of wine,”</strong></span> the writer explained.</p>
              <p>He was commenting on the government’s search for people with special qualities for posting in China.</p>
              <p>“They’ll be hard to find since <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>90% of Singaporeans – and 100% of civil servants – don’t have them; they are very naive, easy to be eaten alive unknowingly</strong></span>,” he concluded.</p>
              <p>I had long wondered before this case what ingredients were needed to pull off a successful scam.</p>
              <p>When I was a news editor in Hong Kong, I put this question to a retired head of a cheating syndicate called Tin Sin Kuk, which had existed among the Chinese for ages.</p>
              <p>The ring consisted of five or six men and women, who would select a victim – always a rich person – to take part in “swindling” another person, who was actually a gang member.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, the rich person himself was the target.</p>
              <p>Sitting in my Causeway Bay flat, the old man said: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“For the cheating to succeed, the victim must have greed in his heart, the greater the better,”</strong></span> he said. “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>If he’s honest and not greedy, we cannot swindle him.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>A little naivete helps, of course. High education is no safeguard, he added.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Are Singaporeans too simple-minded – or greedy – to be able to survive unscathed in this era of sophisticated scams and financial sharks?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Protected by a system of laws and a stable environment</strong></span>, they become <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>vulnerable when exposed to sophisticated swindlers and Madoff-type con men.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The old magic stone tricks have made way for modern online frauds, credit card cheats and money schemes in which black and white are not always distinguishable.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“The average Singaporean is honest and law-abiding, and tends to think the world spins like that,”</strong></span> said a retired manager. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“If a well-dressed Westerner spins an investment plan, he’ll likely lap it up.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>As children, Singaporeans are over-protected by parents; and as adults, by strict laws.</p>
              <p>“I know of 12-year-old students who are not allowed to take a bus by themselves.”</p>
              <p>When he was commenting on reports of Singaporean businessmen being cheated in China at the time of its opening up, university researcher Wang Shouqing had said: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“The Singapore company is good in a very mature environment, but not good in emerging markets.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>His implication was that Singaporeans were too sheltered to be able to deal with the less scrupulous world outside. Many tend to take people’s words too much at face value.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Erik Wang, Singapore’s Consul-General in Shanghai, was quoted as saying that there was a simple <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>lesson for Singaporeans investing in China</strong></span>: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“Know how to cheat others more than they cheat you.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>Sharing the sentiments was controversial Taiwanese legislator Li Ao, who commented on TV several years ago that Singaporeans were stupid because they came from “poor genes”.</p>
              <p>He ranked them lower in natural intelligence (despite their high education) than the people of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>“Taiwanese are scoundrels, but lovable, Hong Kong people are craftier, (Chinese mainlanders are unfathomable) and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Singaporeans are stupider</strong></span>,” he said, adding that it was partially due to genetics.</p>
              <p>One Singaporean reacted: “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Some Singa-poreans can be very simplistic, because we have grown up in an engineered environment."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“The average Singaporean is good at academic studies and works hard, but falls short on individual initiative and street-wise qualities, relying too much on the government for help.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>As affluent Singapore opens its doors wider to foreigners, it will likely attract the wrong type of people to come and work their schemes here.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In recent years, cheating has been on the rise. Many originate from half a world away – through the Internet.</p>
              <p>This column has also reported on numerous cases of retirees being cheated of their savings by pretty, sweet-talking Chinese women.</p>
              <p>A recent headline said that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>on average at least one Singaporean falls prey to lottery scam fraudsters every day, and this remains a concern to the police.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Con men sell dreams and fakes ranging from college degrees to job contracts. They organise online “auctions” and make off with people’s money.</p>
              <p>The most prevalent are lottery scams, which is a worldwide scourge. In a seven-month period there were 210 Singapore victims, cheated of S$2mil (RM4.8mil).</p>
              <p>The amount is, of course, a far cry from the US$50bil (RM175bil) that Bernard Madoff cheated Americans of, including some of the most savvy investors. Such is the sophistication of this criminal art.</p>
              <p>Singapore has its own investment scandal, albeit on a much smaller scale as a whiplash of America’s financial crisis.</p>
              <p>An activist for clean governance <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Tan Kin Lian explained on his blog</strong></span> that it <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>began in 2006 when US investment banks were saddled with mortgages and corporate debts that were turning bad.</strong></span></p>
              <p>“They had to get rid of these assets.”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>They looked for countries with weak protection of consumers</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">which were convinced about the merits of using “the light touch” to regulate the financial sector and encourage financial innovation.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“They found Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan,”</strong></span> said Tan.</p>
              <p>As a result, some 10,000 Singaporeans, many of them retirees, lost S$500mil (RM1.2bil) of their savings to what they were led to believe was a “safe investment”.</p>
              <p>So far, only a fraction of the money has been recovered.</p>

              <p>Last time, my Taiwan Uncle, Ao Li already said, "Singaporean are stupid" no one believe him. Now you see lah..He also told me that I am stupid to become a Singaporean, but I am not that stupid lor, because I heeled his advises whereas many Singaporeans throwed rubbish at him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Dear Singaporeans, learn to take critics as positive feedback ya, and when someone from another perspective said something bad about you, dun take it to heart, study it and learn to be smart. The more kiasu you are, the more you tend to suuuu...until pant drop.</p>

              <p>“WE SAT through a talk yesterday on land investment in Birmingham and was shocked when my friend immediately ploughed in S$25,000 (RM60,000) to buy a 1,076 sq ft parcel,” an Internet surfer recently wrote.</p>
              <p>“It had no planning permit and might take seven years to get one,” he added.</p>
              <p>Yet she took the plunge. Why?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“She was enticed by the gifts – a S$600 (RM1,440) camera, S$100 (RM240) in shopping and S$50 (RM120) in dining vouchers and two bottles of wine,”</strong></span> the writer explained.</p>
              <p>He was commenting on the government’s search for people with special qualities for posting in China.</p>
              <p>“They’ll be hard to find since <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>90% of Singaporeans – and 100% of civil servants – don’t have them; they are very naive, easy to be eaten alive unknowingly</strong></span>,” he concluded.</p>
              <p>I had long wondered before this case what ingredients were needed to pull off a successful scam.</p>
              <p>When I was a news editor in Hong Kong, I put this question to a retired head of a cheating syndicate called Tin Sin Kuk, which had existed among the Chinese for ages.</p>
              <p>The ring consisted of five or six men and women, who would select a victim – always a rich person – to take part in “swindling” another person, who was actually a gang member.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, the rich person himself was the target.</p>
              <p>Sitting in my Causeway Bay flat, the old man said: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“For the cheating to succeed, the victim must have greed in his heart, the greater the better,”</strong></span> he said. “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>If he’s honest and not greedy, we cannot swindle him.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>A little naivete helps, of course. High education is no safeguard, he added.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Are Singaporeans too simple-minded – or greedy – to be able to survive unscathed in this era of sophisticated scams and financial sharks?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Protected by a system of laws and a stable environment</strong></span>, they become <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>vulnerable when exposed to sophisticated swindlers and Madoff-type con men.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The old magic stone tricks have made way for modern online frauds, credit card cheats and money schemes in which black and white are not always distinguishable.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“The average Singaporean is honest and law-abiding, and tends to think the world spins like that,”</strong></span> said a retired manager. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“If a well-dressed Westerner spins an investment plan, he’ll likely lap it up.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>As children, Singaporeans are over-protected by parents; and as adults, by strict laws.</p>
              <p>“I know of 12-year-old students who are not allowed to take a bus by themselves.”</p>
              <p>When he was commenting on reports of Singaporean businessmen being cheated in China at the time of its opening up, university researcher Wang Shouqing had said: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“The Singapore company is good in a very mature environment, but not good in emerging markets.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>His implication was that Singaporeans were too sheltered to be able to deal with the less scrupulous world outside. Many tend to take people’s words too much at face value.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Erik Wang, Singapore’s Consul-General in Shanghai, was quoted as saying that there was a simple <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>lesson for Singaporeans investing in China</strong></span>: <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“Know how to cheat others more than they cheat you.”</strong></span></p>
              <p>Sharing the sentiments was controversial Taiwanese legislator Li Ao, who commented on TV several years ago that Singaporeans were stupid because they came from “poor genes”.</p>
              <p>He ranked them lower in natural intelligence (despite their high education) than the people of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>“Taiwanese are scoundrels, but lovable, Hong Kong people are craftier, (Chinese mainlanders are unfathomable) and <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Singaporeans are stupider</strong></span>,” he said, adding that it was partially due to genetics.</p>
              <p>One Singaporean reacted: “<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Some Singa-poreans can be very simplistic, because we have grown up in an engineered environment."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“The average Singaporean is good at academic studies and works hard, but falls short on individual initiative and street-wise qualities, relying too much on the government for help.”</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>As affluent Singapore opens its doors wider to foreigners, it will likely attract the wrong type of people to come and work their schemes here.</strong></span></p>
              <p>In recent years, cheating has been on the rise. Many originate from half a world away – through the Internet.</p>
              <p>This column has also reported on numerous cases of retirees being cheated of their savings by pretty, sweet-talking Chinese women.</p>
              <p>A recent headline said that <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>on average at least one Singaporean falls prey to lottery scam fraudsters every day, and this remains a concern to the police.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Con men sell dreams and fakes ranging from college degrees to job contracts. They organise online “auctions” and make off with people’s money.</p>
              <p>The most prevalent are lottery scams, which is a worldwide scourge. In a seven-month period there were 210 Singapore victims, cheated of S$2mil (RM4.8mil).</p>
              <p>The amount is, of course, a far cry from the US$50bil (RM175bil) that Bernard Madoff cheated Americans of, including some of the most savvy investors. Such is the sophistication of this criminal art.</p>
              <p>Singapore has its own investment scandal, albeit on a much smaller scale as a whiplash of America’s financial crisis.</p>
              <p>An activist for clean governance <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Tan Kin Lian explained on his blog</strong></span> that it <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>began in 2006 when US investment banks were saddled with mortgages and corporate debts that were turning bad.</strong></span></p>
              <p>“They had to get rid of these assets.”</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>They looked for countries with weak protection of consumers</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">which were convinced about the merits of using “the light touch” to regulate the financial sector and encourage financial innovation.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>“They found Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan,”</strong></span> said Tan.</p>
              <p>As a result, some 10,000 Singaporeans, many of them retirees, lost S$500mil (RM1.2bil) of their savings to what they were led to believe was a “safe investment”.</p>
              <p>So far, only a fraction of the money has been recovered.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are not stupid. We are all just decent people, and would rather think well of others than to think ill of anyone. We are cultivated people, at least the majority of us, after years of peace and prosperity amidst a turbulent world compared to others.</p>
              <p>Even our worst con men cannot be compared to the class of Taiwanese scoundrels and crafty Hongkies.</p>
              <p>Because of our upbringing since young. We all swore and pledge allegience daily to our society - made of your family, relativies and friends and mine. It rubs in and is ingrain in us, to treat our fellow citizens better, unlike the riff-raff dregs of humanity from other foriegn lands.</p>
              <p>But globalizing had made us all reach out to the world, and carrying such honour bonds to treat non Singaporeans is a disaster to ourselves, thus the many cases of being cheated.</p>
              <p>I too, had been cheated before in foreign investments. I blame no one but myself, for being too trusting. But I realize what was lost was only money, not my honour and oath I had pledge, not only to my society, but to uphold it in my dealings with others of my race - human, for our pledge is an idealism beyond nationalities.</p>
              <p>Money, afterall, can always be made back over time. But reputations, once ruined, very seldom are given reprieves. There is always divine retributions anyway.</p>
              <p>So really, there is no need to change ourselves, for to change, would be to lower ourselves to the level of scoundrels and crafty knaves the Taiwanese and Hongkies truly are.</p>
              <p>We Singaporeans have a vision and a goal in mind ingrained deeply within us, and that is to build a better society than the one before. Hong Kong and Taiwan are not our model of an ideal society. No country is, I believe, for we are still evolving, as a nation, and if peace and prosperity is still within our grasp, it may be a nation that continues to be beyond the expectations of many, just as we are held in awe by other nations today.</p>
              <p>Such visions will be a reality, but only if our young are fully nurtured, and some of them will willingly step forward selflessly, to serve our society, to take us all to the next level, by building upon existing foundations within a peaceful and rational environment, than in an acrimonious dead-locked one.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The final split came just few days later in the Legislative Assembly.
                      Thirteen Left Wing PAP Assemblymen abstained from voting with the party
                      line. They were dismissed from the PAP. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In August 1961, they formed a
                      rival party, the Barisan Sosialis, led by Dr Lee Siew Choh and Lim Chin
                      Siong. They took 35 branch committees, 19 of the 23 organizing
                      secretaries and an estimated 80 percent of the membership. PAP under
                      LKY was a mere shell, according to Dr Lee. </strong></span>Both Dr Goh Keng Swee and
                      Lee Kuan Yew were devastated and thought that it is the end of the PAP.
                      But on man never gave up the fight as Dr Goh recalled the following
                      conversation with Toh Chin Chye:<br><br><strong><em>Toh:</em></strong> Why are you staring at the ceiling?</p>
              <p><br><em><strong>Goh: </strong></em>Do
                      sit down, Chin Chye, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we are all busted; the party secretaries, the PA
                      (People’s Association), the organizing secretaries, the Work Brigade. I
                      know the communists were organizationally much stronger than us. But I
                      didn’t expect us smashed up like this in just a week.</strong></span></p>
              <p><br><strong><em>Toh:</em></strong> I just come from Harry’s office. He was staring at the ceiling just
                      like you did. You should snap out of this mood. The fighting has just
                      begun. It is going to be long and nasty. But if we keep wringing our
                      hands in anguish we are sure to lose. We should start thinking
                      immediately of our next moves – how to rebuild the Party, rally the
                      loyal Party members and how to carry the fight into the enemy camp.</p>

I know what you peoples are thinking, but i just act blur blur hor, if not how to chop you. Same goes to PRC gal cheating old sg uncle theory, Sg old Uncles keep saying PRC gals are stupid and easy to get, tho the PRC are smart, but they acted innocent and blur blur...and then when time is ripe, they chop..and at the end of the day, when Old uncles goldmine is empty, Uncles then know who is smarter.</p>
