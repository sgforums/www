              <p>The failure of the govt in implementing the ERP system lies with its lack of constant persuasive communication with the general population on its virtues.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background info</span></strong></p>
              <p>Back in the 90s, facing an affluent middle class, MM Lee had to use COE to curb traffic gridlock due to the rise of car ownership, where even a receptionist drives to work.</p>
              <p>It affected economic productivity as workers, managers, CEOs, students were late for work and appointments on our limited roads.</p>
              <p>With a premium capped on buying cars using COEs, it became only the rich could afford cars, when COE rosed to $90,000 a certificate ($750 upfront per month). A japanese make Toyota Corrolla cost $150,000 to buy.</p>
              <p>MM Lee is neither right or wrong to force such measures when that issue of car ownership was placed on the pedestal of economic survival for our society. He was only a product of his authoritative times.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Present</span></strong></p>
              <p>PM Lee is also a product of his/our times. A time of more educated, affluent and socially aware equal citizens who aspired towards car ownership.</p>
              <p>ERP is a fair system which he approved, of taxing road usuage than for car ownership. You pay for what you use. What you don't need to use, you don't need to pay.</p>
              <p>Thus anyone who earns $2,000 a month can afford a new or cheaper 2nd hand car, with the lowered COE price of $9,000, with a monthly loan of $700+ for a $61,000 Toyota Corrolla.</p>
              <p>If you drive to work, it becomes necessary to pay the toll charges, but then you would probably be able to write off such charges as you would be making more economic profit with that shortened time driving than taking public transport.</p>
              <p>ERP charges are also tax deductibles for companies, which can be offset when paying company tax.</p>
              <p>At least, there is no longer a hefty upfront of $90,000 COE charges to pay per car, making cars affordable to all.</p>
              <p>At nights and weekends, if all 1.9 million working citizen population were to buy a car each, there will be heavy traffic and perhaps even gridlock, but then, there will be no lateness for work or appointments as majority of offices and vital economic activities would had been wounded down.</p>
              <p>For that comfort and small time in jams affecting not the economy, only our time, it is worth it than to be jam packed in public transport sniffing up armpits.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suggestions</span></strong></p>
              <p>1. Support PM Lee on the ERP system and plead for better improved public transportation for non-car owners using ERP taxes.</p>
              <p>2. Capped COEs below $10,000</p>
              <p>3. Educated and enlightened car owners to plan their routes more efficiently, even on weekends</p>
              <p>4. Govt to revamp and improve their grassroots leadership systems to disseminate public policies more efficiently and effectively.</p>
              <p>The Golden Age under PM Lee is within our hands. The choice is yours, to live in this golden age or be a cynic and never know or believe a golden age is possible.</p>
