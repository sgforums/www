            <div class='col-md body'>Sep 28, 2006<br><strong>Too many motorists get booked in overkill</strong><br><br>I WAS not surprised by the recent letters on the outsourcing of traffic police duties. It just took so long for motorists to voice dismay over this matter.<br>Could this be because Singaporeans feel they can do nothing once a policy has been implemented, especially when it concerns the police? The points raised by Mr Tan Lam Siong (ST, Sept 26) are relevant and certainly strike a chord among motorists.<br><br>The bigger issue insofar as motorists are concerned is the manner in which summonses are so freely issued, even for the slightest infringement such as darting into the bus lane (with no buses behind) to make a left turn a few metres before the slip road to avoid the jam ahead.<br><br>One of the most annoying incidents I observed was a warden diligently issuing tickets for cars parked neatly along a quiet road in a residential area at 10pm on the second day of Chinese New Year, when it was obvious that people were visiting and no one was causing obstruction.<br><br>I was incensed but I knew the futility of confrontation. And what about tickets being freely dispensed to cars parked in deserted back lanes?<br><br>One cannot blame the widely-held belief (erroneous or otherwise) that these over-zealous wardens have a quota to meet, and even if this is denied, that the authorities must account for the money they have paid for outsourcing such duties.<br><br>It is good to have tough enforcement in high traffic and accident-prone areas but the zealousness with which it is being carried out especially in lightly-used roads and back lanes, is reinforcing people's attitude that the authorities are unduly harsh and unsympathetic.<br><br>It is indeed contradictory for a government that encourages entrepreneurship in the Singaporean mindset to, at the same time, put the people in a strait-jacket. For that is what not allowing motorists to 'stray out of the box' even when no one is inconvenienced amounts to.<br><br>Motoring in Singapore is already stressful with the high taxes, ERP charges, traffic jams, etc. and now there are wardens all over the island waiting to book motorists.<br><br>Please, stop the overkill. Give the motorists a break, especially on Sundays and public holidays if no inconvenience is caused.<br><br>The traffic police should instead concentrate on some of the menacing practices seen on our roads, such as speeding by heavy vehicles, driving without headlights in the early hours of the morning when it is still pitch dark, and the increasingly dangerous practice of not using the signal lights while turning.<br><br>Philip Lee Fook Seng<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:7f1a5807070fd010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:7f1a5807070fd010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sep 28, 2006<br>OVER-ZEALOUS TRAFFIC WARDENS<br><strong>Unsuspecting motorist gets ticket in 'ambush'</strong><br><br>HERE'S my two cents' worth in the discussion on outsourcing traffic policing duties.<br>One Sunday in June, I went to make a withdrawal at an ATM in Abacus Plaza at Tampines Central. As most of the offices were closed, Tampines Central 6 was deserted except for some security personnel at the entrances to the car parks.<br><br>I stopped my car at the side of the road and was back in a flash after making my withdrawal.<br><br>To my dismay, I saw a Cisco warden quickly walking away after issuing me a ticket. I was puzzled by the speed at which the warden appeared, issued a ticket, then disappeared.<br><br>I returned the following Sunday afternoon and saw the warden playing hide-and-seek with me in an apparent attempt to 'ambush' me. I stopped my car and approached him for his details.<br><br>Although my three minutes of illegal parking did not cause any traffic congestion or inconvenience any other road-user, I concede I broke the law and have duly paid my fine.<br><br>What disgusts me are the questionable methods employed by the private traffic enforcement companies in their attempt to achieve their objectives ie. issue summonses.<br><br>Is this a case of the means justifying the end?<br><br>I recall the furore over an anti-narcotics officer who lured a doctor to sell drugs through an Internet chatroom.<br><br>Are the authorities endorsing entrapment as a legitimate form of law enforcement?<br><br>Until recently, I do not remember traffic enforcement officers ambushing motorists in order to meet quotas. Should we expect to play more hide-and-seek with Cisco wardens henceforth?<br><br>James Yap Chong Ann<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:74e95807070fd010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:74e95807070fd010VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a></div>
