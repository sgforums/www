            <div class='col-md body'>Fallout from the botched up PR with IMF and CSOs begins....<br>Who asked for it?<br><br>===========================================<br>At first, activists did not want to come here<br>Now they says: It's like Disneyland<br>By Dawn Chia And Tan May Ping<br><br>September 21, 2006<br><br>THERE must be something bad.<br>There must. It can't be this perfect.<br><br>Members of a civil society organisation working at the Suntec site yesterday. -- JOEL CHAN<br>That's the feeling many delegates of civil society organisations (CSOs) had of Singapore.<br><br>Some referred to it as 'Disneyland'.<br><br>Ms Sandy Krawitz, the communications manager of ActionAid International, said of her visits to Little India: 'The people there are so warm and friendly. The streets are so clean, and as I walk, I wonder if I'll see a piece of garbage or cigarette butt lying around. But so far there's none.<br><br>'When a colleague told us he found two plastic bags lying on the ground the other day, we all screamed 'yay' because it showed that Singapore's a real country after all.<br><br>'Without such imperfections, it all seems so surreal and dreamy.'<br><br>But their perception of the Republic before coming over for the International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings was of a tough, police state.<br><br>US activist Sameer Dossani of the 50 Years is Enough Network said activists had circulated reports claiming that people would be caned for staging outdoor protests here.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>NERVOUS<br><br>That made some activists nervous. They were all aware of the Michael Fay incident in 1994 where the American teenager was caned for vandalism.<br><br>'When a colleague told us he found two plastic bags lying on the ground the other day, we all screamed 'yay' because it showed that Singapore's a real country after all.' said, Ms Sandy Krawitz, ActionAid's communications manager -- JOEL CHAN<br>For the record, authorities here had said that vandalism is punishable with caning, but not staging an outdoor protest.<br><br>Then there was the chewing gum ban.<br><br>Ms Krawitz, an American, said: 'We joked that the perfect protest in Singapore was for civil society activists to stand in a row, chew gum and then blow bubbles!<br><br>'It would be really funny to see what the authorities thought of that!'<br><br>Mr Eric Gutierrez from the Philippines had heard there were strict rules here.<br><br>The international policy coordinator of ActionAid had expected a trying time for activists, especially when news broke that 27 of them were not allowed in.<br><br>Instead, he said, the meetings went on smoothly.<br><br>His only wish: That some of the other activists who had held the International People's Forum (IPF) against the IMF-World Bank in Batam had come over instead.<br><br>The 40-year-old said: 'In hindsight, it would have been good if the IPF was held here since all the delegates and ministers are here.<br><br>'We could have invited them to sit in on some of the meetings and have a better, more robust debate.'<br><br>Those who had gone to Batam said the meetings there went peacefully too.<br><br>'In hindsight, it would have been good if the IPF (International People's Forum) was held here since all the delegates and ministers are here.' said, Mr Eric Gutierrez, ActionAid's international policy coordinator -- JOEL CHAN<br>Street protests planned initially were called off as the Batam authorities banned outdoor rallies.<br><br>To those who had gone over, staging the alternative talks in Batam was important to signal to the Republic that they were not happy with the ban on outdoor protests here.<br><br>German Daniela Sutton, project manager of Berlin-based World Economy, Ecology &amp; Development, said: 'In Germany, people demonstrate all the time. There's nothing dangerous about it.'<br><br>But, like in Batam, activists who had come over decided to work within the local law.<br><br>Ms Haidy Ear-Dupuy of the NGO Forum on Cambodia said: 'I like the discipline that Singapore has. It's something that other countries can learn.<br><br>'But there's a need to find a balance, and for allowing freedom of speech and civic engagement.'<br><br>Still, she said, she's grateful to the Government for taking in the boat people who fled Vietnam in the 1970s and '80s.<br><br>Ms Ear-Dupuy said she was one of them and lived here in the '80s as a refugee.<br><br>Having spent a week here, some activists said Singapore needs to snap out of the Disney mode.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>ACCEPT FLAWS<br><br>And that means accepting the fact that flaws exist.<br><br>Mr Jeff Powell, a coordinator at the Bretton Woods Project, said: 'Part of what makes a great city is the negative, along with the positive aspects.'<br><br>Although Mr Powell, 35, has worked in South-East Asia (Thailand, Laos and Cambodia) for six years, he never wanted to visit Singapore because he thought it was organised but dull.<br><br>His impression hasn't changed much.<br><br>He said: 'Over the week, I've come into contact with taxi drivers and people who look like they're trying to help, but they seem awkward doing so.'<br><br>The CSOs said many of the activists who had attended the meetings here were academics with doctorates. They said their cause was noble and their sentiments genuine.<br><br>But they don't deny there were also troublemakers bent on disrupting the proceedings.<br><br>They hogged the headlines and gave CSOs a bad name.<br><br>The Republic, they said, had the wrong impression of CSOs, just as how some activists had misconceptions about Singapore.<br><br>Ms Krawitz said: 'Friends who've been here told me it's a very exotic and cultural place and I've always longed to see and experience it for myself.<br><br>'People describe it as a clean, orderly country and I know now for a fact that it is.'<br><br></div>
