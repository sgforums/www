            <div class='col-md body'>Pregnant mums who lose jobs a real problem<br><br>Jul 10, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>I REFER to the letters by Ms Lau Li Nah ('Can MOM help sacked pregnant worker?'; ST, June 27) and Ms Ngian Hui Chyi ('Woman on maternity leave replaced by temp'; ST, July 1) and the article 'Pregnant and facing the sack: More seek help' (ST, July 3).<br>The Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) first noticed in July 2004 an increase in the number of women calling our Helpline with issues surrounding pregnancy while employed.<br><br>In June last year, there were letters in the Forum pages from women who had been dismissed while pregnant.<br><br>And now, this month, the issue has surfaced again in the Forum pages and as a news article.<br><br>In total, Aware has received close to 40 calls or e-mail messages from women or their relatives.<br><br>This issue is not going away, and no amount of reassurance by the Ministry of Manpower will change that.<br><br>Planning for, having and caring for a baby in today's frenetic society is stressful enough without having to worry about one's source of income being terminated.<br><br>For most modern women, pregnancy itself already carries a certain amount of inherent risk.<br><br>When a woman is subjected to sudden and extreme stress and emotional upset, as happens when one is summarily dismissed, we can only imagine what further complications may affect the pregnancy and subsequent birth.<br><br>Add to that non-existent paternity leave, and a paltry two days child-care leave per year, the husband and father will be back at work long before the new mother is ready to be left on her own to face post-natal depression aggravated by depression caused by the sudden loss of her job.<br><br>Last year, Aware convened a focus group discussion on the topic attended by six women and three men.<br><br>Two of the women who had lost their jobs due to their pregnancy said they would not want a second child because the experience had been too traumatic.<br><br>The sad thing is that although this issue has been raised many times in the past, there does not seem to be sufficient political will to address it adequately.<br><br>A case in point is Aware's submission to a government-related agency to obtain funding to conduct a study on Managing Pregnancy And Employment.<br><br>After ongoing discussions and negotiations lasting one year, the final response was negative even though Aware had initially been given encouraging signals.<br><br>At the very least, a study should first be made to examine the extent of the problem.<br><br>Once the issues are understood more clearly, the correct solutions can then be proposed and implemented.<br><br>Aware is still going ahead with a scaled-down version of its planned research to achieve this end.<br><br>Call 6779-7137 or e-mail helpline@aware.org.sg to participate in the study.<br><br>It would be very much in the Government's interest to take concrete steps to address this issue before it affects many more women and their families.<br><br>We should not let such discriminatory practices by employers undermine our society's efforts to encourage more women to have more babies.<br><br>Tan Joo Hymn (Ms)<br>President<br>Association of Women for Action and Research<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking from a business point of view, saving costs is important. Employers will have to pay the mothers maternity leave, which amount to 2 months' pay. Whether or not these mothers work from home, they still have to be paid. And what employers are not happy is this issue. If they don't work, why should I pay?<br><br>During pregnancy, they have to go for regular checkups, which disrupts work and reduce productivity. All these add up to additional costs of which they can be saved by hiring temporary staff.<br><br>The problem started because businesses aren't willing to compromise, seeing this as loss of productivity and additional costs. Although they can hire temporary staff or even foreigners to save costs, this is not a long term solution. As more and more socieities open up, more women are able to work. By practising this, they are drastically reducing their own productivity in time to come, as there are lesser people to handle more work.<br><br>PAP did offer some solutions, but how long can they last? Bringing up a baby is lifelong, and it's not cheap, considering everything is on a rise here except pay.</div>

Of course not many companies have the economic ability to view it on a macro, long term issue.<br><br>Money may be the point of focus when it comes to a company, and for privatised SMEs especially, this is the crux of the entire operation. On this level, it does seem to make little economical sense to pay for a woman's pregnancy period and etc.<br><br>The impact of women in the workforce is global. The fact that women can work, contributed hugely to productivity rates as compared to previous eras. Not only that, with women as consumers with independent spending power, they probably work the economics far more than men.<br><br>Pregnancy is a natural process for women. It is something that they were born with the ability to do. And seriously, not that many women would utilise this benefit more than 3 times in the course of their entire life. I think this is far fewer than, say, the number of times a man goes for reservice combined together.<br><br>It seems strange that the government can subsidise the cost of reservice but can't do enough to subsidise the pregnancy period of women. Without the next generation, there isn't going to be anyone to defend eventually you know?</div>

The older kids would look after the younger kids.<br><br>Now, the environment is no longer as safe for young kids - both physical and psychological dangers around. The demands to provide more by society can be very pressing - more for education, more books, more games, more enrichment courses - makes it hard for single parent income (unless tt parent earns DAMN a lot).
