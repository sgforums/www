              <h1>US changes tack over North Korea nuclear program</h1>
              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) â€” The United States on Thursday for the first time<strong> admitted it was scaling back its demands on North Korea in a bid to
              break a diplomatic stalemate </strong>on ending Pyongyang's nuclear arms drive.</p>
              <p>The
              top Asia hand at the US National Security Council, Dennis Wilder, said
              North Korea was not "off the hook" on fully declaring its atomic
              programs, but that proliferation issues would be <strong>"handled in a
              different manner."</strong></p>
              <p>And US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in
              an apparent concession to Pyongyang, indicated the <strong>entire overdue
              declaration might not be made public.</strong></p>
              <p>In another turnaround, she
              hinted that <strong>US sanctions against North Korea could be removed even
              before the hardline communist state's nuclear programs or
              proliferations activities were verified independently.</strong></p>
              <p>"Verification can take some time," she told reporters.</p>
              <p>North Korea has been pushing the United States to remove it from the blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism.</p>
              <p>Rice
              said the document incorporating North Korea's proliferation activities
              <strong>could be kept private, allowing Pyongyang to save face.</strong></p>
              <p>"There
              will be, undoubtedly, briefings for Congress," on any final
              arrangement, she said, warning: "This is a diplomatic matter and not
              everything in diplomacy is public."</p>
              <p>A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that the document would be published "in some form."</p>
              <p>Washington
              wants North Korea to clear up suspicions about an alleged secret
              uranium enrichment program and suspected proliferation to Syria. North
              Korea denies both charges.</p>
              <p>For months, Washington had demanded
              that Pyongyang detail all of its nuclear activities, including any
              proliferation of nuclear know-how, in a "complete and correct"
              declaration North Korea had agreed to provide by December 31, 2007.</p>
              <p>The
              declaration was part of a February 2007 landmark deal grouping China,
              Japan, North and South Korea, Russia and the United States.</p>
              <p>Under
              the agreement, Pyongyang has shut down and begun disabling its key
              atomic plant in return for energy aid and major diplomatic and security
              benefits that could eventually mean removal from the state sponsors of
              terrorism list.</p>
              <p>The US government is eager to see the
              denuclearization drive completed before President George W. Bush leaves
              office in January 2009. The North tested a nuclear bomb in October 2006.</p>
              <p>On
              Wednesday, the United States said it was working with its diplomatic
              partners on a new mechanism to scrutinize any nuclear declaration by
              North Korea.</p>
              <p>The announcement of the new verification measure
              came amid criticism of a reported prospective deal reached earlier this
              month between US and North Korean envoys, which caused a great deal of
              skepticism among experts.</p>
              <p>They accused Washington of back-tracking on the terms of the original accord.</p>
              <p>But
              Rice has denied the existence of such a deal, and insisted Thursday:
              "The outcome we and our partners require is a full accounting from
              North Korea of all its nuclear programs, including any uranium and
              nuclear proliferation activities.</p>
              <p>"I want to emphasize that we
              are at the beginning of a very complex process, not the end, a process
              that must lead to the actual removal, for the first time in history, of
              nuclear material from North Korea and verifiable end to its nuclear
              programs."</p>
              <p>Wilder confirmed the United States had had "side
              negotiations" on the proliferation issue with North Korea and was
              sending an experts group back to Pyongyang next week "to see if we can
              make progress on the declaration."</p>
              <p>Earlier Thursday, South
              Korea's new chief nuclear negotiator Kim Sook said the disarmament
              talks with Pyongyang were "reaching a critical stage."</p>
              <p>"We are
              pushing to resume the six-party talks as soon as the declaration is
              submitted. All participatory countries agree to this idea," Kim told a
              briefing.</p>
              <p>Hopes of breaking the impasse have emerged since last
              week when top US nuclear envoy Christopher Hill and his North Korean
              counterpart Kim Kye-Gwan met in Singapore to debate the form of the
              declaration.</p>
              <p>If North Korea provides the nuclear declaration, the
              parties could move to implement the final phase of dismantling its
              nuclear program and materials.</p>

              <p>I don't know what is happening behind the scenes, there is at the present not enough information available for me to analyse this event, but the DPRK never fails to amaze me with their ability to make USA kowtow.</p>
              <p>USA don't dare to touch DPRK.</p>
              <p>Other countries, it dares to touch.</p>
              <p>DPRK, never.</p>
