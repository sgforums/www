It's either poisonous and banned or not. Cannot be half way. If it's poisonous, why isn't the FDA banning it? Even the European standards allow for its use in toothpaste (nobody seems to quote this.

Take the case of salted eggs. AVA has rejected consignments (not all) of salted eggs from China, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam because they contained Sudan Red. Even China has rejected many consignments of food from countries such as Japan and USA for containing undesirable amounts of bacteria and such. Question of food safety, no hysteria.</div>
