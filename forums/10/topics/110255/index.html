The present recession is a manifestation of the economic direction taken by the PAP. To alleviate the problems that confront the economy, the SDP proposes two sets of solutions for the immediate term (next 1-2 years) and the longer-term (within the next 5 years).<br><br>Immediate Term<br><br>Many Singaporeans have been retrenched or have seen their wages cut because of the recession. Under the present system these workers have little financial protection when they are retrenched. Adding to the worsening situation is the PAP's ill-conceived foreign talent policy. To remedy the situation, the SDP proposes:<br><br>Â• A minimum wage policy. The DOS has reported that while Singapore's GDP per capita income is $23,000, its wage structure is closer to that of the Third World. Such an economic arrangement is not good for long-term growth. Ensuring a minimum wage for the lowest of the low-skilled employee guarantees that prosperity is shared by all. Legislation is needed to prevent Singaporean workers from being exploited and ensure that employees be paid fair wages for their work commensurate with the cost of living. For a start, the minimum wage should be set at $5 per hour.<br><br>Â• Retrenchment entitlements. Presently when a worker gets retrenched, he or she is left out in the cold with no financial protection. This cause severe strain on the entire family with serious social repercussions. Under the SDP proposal, the Government will pay all retrenched workers their full salary for the first six months. This amount would be reduced to 75 percent during the next six months, and further reduced to 50 percent in the third six months. Each worker will be allowed to reject only up to three job offers in the one-and-a-half years following which the retrenchment entitlement ceases. Such a scheme will provide workers a cushion when they are retrenched while at the same time encourage them to seek employment.<br><br>Â• Singaporeans First Policy. The PAP's foreign talent policy adds to the burden of Singaporeans by indiscriminately allowing foreigners to seek employment here. The SDP will push for a Singaporeans First Policy, which will insist that employers retrench foreign workers first and only lay off Singaporean workers as a last resort. In addition such a policy will require the Government and employers to employ foreigners only if locals cannot be found for the job. This will ensure that only qualified foreigners will be allowed into Singapore.<br><br>Longer-term<br><br>To ensure long-term, sustainable economic growth, the SDP proposes the following:<br><br>Â• Scale back GLCs. Pretend as they might, GLCs cannot provide, much less sustain, economic development in Singapore. They must be dismantled and, in their place, local private companies must be allowed to surface and be given the chance to compete internationally, with the government playing only a supporting role. The SDP advocates that, with the exception of PSA and SIA, the Government privatises all other GLCs within the next five years. Every year the PAP drags its feet is every year Singapore loses its ability to compete at the international level.<br><br>Â• Protect local companies from MNCs. If Singapore is going to assist local private companies in becoming more competitive it must wean itself away from dependence on MNCs. Many countries have strengthened their economies without the MNC crutch. Asia abounds with examples, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Where MNCs are permitted in these countries, they are also given attractive financial incentives. These incentives are, however, clearly spelled out, as are agreements as to what and how technology transfer is to take place. Today Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan boast corporations that have become world-beaters in technology and innovation. In Singapore, however, reliance on MNCs has consigned the people to an economic system that breeds more model employees than visionary entrepreneurs. This means that Singapore will forever be at the mercy of foreign investors on the lookout for cheaper wages.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The proposals sound reasonable enough.  But to my understandinging there is a minimum wage structure in existence.  I like support proposal for retrenchment benefits but its need to be further developed.  The Singapore first policy would be very much similar to what Australia has.  It ensures that priority be given to local citizens before consideration about alternative applicants are considered.<br><br>The minimum wage proposal is interesting but as to how it is to be actually implemented deserves further study, there are too many variables to account for and I am way too unqualified to do that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>On the surface, it appear to be a interesting proposal.  However it is not original, it adopt and adapts practices already established in other countries.<br><br>What is important is a reorganization of the education system, and to re pioritize the overall objectives.   There has recently been news of universities planning to seek autonomy from state control but as to how successful it will is yet to be seen.  Unfortuantely, in Singapore, the need for political and social control by the ruling party overides all other concerns.<br><br>Actually if you look at it, Singapore is actually a social experiment in action.</div>
