            <div class='col-md body'>Dear,<br><br>Many people refuse to face the reality that we do live in a world of unknown(delusion?).  And everyone tried to bury that fear in either traditional religion practice or chasing after some impermanent dream in whole life.<br><br>But how can we be sure our believe is true?  Every different one claim their God to be the only truth, its certain that billions of unlucky faith followers will end up putting their life in wrong hand.<br><br>Hence there is an wise advise that we come across:  "Accept my words only when you have examined them for yourselves; do not accept them simply because of the reverence you have for me. Those who only have faith in me and affection for me will not find the final freedom. But those who have faith in the truth and are determined on the path(to realize the truth), they will find awakening." And this Truth shall be universal to all beings goodness with no exclusiveness to one particular group.<br><br>So what's your answer to those questions now?</div>
