            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Man faces 107 charges of duping CPF </strong></span><br><br><strong>By Chong Chee Kin</strong><br><br>A MAN who allegedly duped the Central Provident Fund Board into releasing his money early was brought before a district court yesterday.<br><br>Chen Gin Seng, 49, was said to have bought shares with his own money from the stock market and then sold them to himself at a higher price - with money from his CPF contributions.<br><br>While his CPF account shrank, the money went into his own pocket - money which he could not have otherwise withdrawn until the age of 55.<br><br>He is the third person to be brought to court for such offences.<br><br>He faces 107 charges - the highest number to date for such offenders.<br><br>Yesterday, the court heard he had allegedly made more than 100 such transactions between April last year and February this year using trading accounts he had with Kim Eng Securities and Lim and Tan Securities.<br><br>It was not mentioned, however, just how much he allegedly managed to squirrel out of his CPF account.<br><br>He allegedly bought and sold shares of mainboard-listed construction companies Lum Chang Holdings and Shining Corporation over 10 months.<br><br>A stockbroker explained how the scam could have been carried out.<br><br>For example, a person could buy $30,000 worth of shares with his own money from his cash trading account and then sell it for $50,000 or more to himself, with money from his CPF account. He might make paper losses in the CPF account but the money would have gone into his own pocket.<br><br>The broker described it as a 'risky and foolish way' to get money. 'It can be easily uncovered, given how the authorities like the Singapore Exchange monitor the transactions that go on,' he said.<br><br>The moment the same name appears on both the buyer and seller accounts,'alarm bells would ring'.<br><br>'It may not be share rigging, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that there is something wrong when you see one person buying and selling shares between his accounts,' he said.<br><br>Chen did not enter any plea yesterday. He is scheduled to return to court for a pre-trial conference on Nov 29. If convicted, he could be jailed up to seven years and fined up to $250,000.<br><br>Such a scam first surfaced in 2001 when Mr Chen Yew Choon was fined $60,000 after admitting to three charges of fraud. Two similar charges were taken into consideration.<br><br>This year, on Sept 22, company director Eric Tan, 45, was fined $7,000 after he admitted he made similar transactions with his own accounts on 37 occasions.<br><br></div>
