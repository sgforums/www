            <div class='col-md body'>Can the teachers handle the bullies? Answer is no. There seems to be an emphasis on getting 'great students' and encouraging them to become 'great teachers'. Those 'great students' ususally made the worst teachers around. Some will simply collaspes and cry when bullied by students. Another class of teachers are the 'nice pay! let's teach!' type. Their only concern is their monthly salaries. Got bullied? Theres your own bloody problem!<br><br>I had a teacher back in pri sch, who started smoking once he step out of the school. Not the perfect role-model, but he definitly have no problem handling the class.

I agree that life is inherently a darwainian process, when it comes to the crunch, I suppose everyone would switch on their most elemental instincts, however, in societies, wealth != graciousness and courtesies ....<br><br>but since you mentioned japan above, I think that's a very good case in point, (perhaps it's because they are such a homogenous society), they have managed to forge a collective spirit that can take them through lots of adversities, they have a relatively huge population cramped onto a small space, and they have evolved common courtesies, tolerance and respect for the others that makes their restricted space tolerable, contrast that to other north east asian societies (one can easily guess which one in particular I'm trying to drive at), okie, perhaps in that particular society, not everyone have "arrived" yet, but they are certainly getting there rapidly ... but that society has evolved very differently than japan, living there can be highly stressful, cos you'll have to deal with the worser side of human nature every single day ...<br><br>so what shall it be for singapore ? ... you know, I sometimes cringe when i think of the day when we have 6 million citizens (plus FTs and FWs), all cramped into our little red dot ...</div>

I agree though, that the rich-poor gap is something we have to keep track of, but that's fodder for another thread eh ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
