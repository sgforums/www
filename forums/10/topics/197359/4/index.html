            <div class='col-md body'>Courtesy is cultivated in upbringing with education. wealth's impact on courtesy is indirect.  Families who dont have to share a bowl of porridge will have time to teach their children and send them to schools. In Taiwan there are many courteous people but not rich. Their grandfather were rich before they came to Taiwan. Courtesy was part of their family upbringing. There are now many Taiwanese, became rich overnight by converting their tea plantations into industrial land, they remains rowdy, and courtesy is certainly not their trait, to most of them.<br><br>I have also seen many Indonesians in Singapore, don't look very rich to me, came out of takashimaya with only one bag, speak a few words of Mandarin and hardly any english, but extremely courteous and polite. Some other indonesians, whole body branded goods, moving around believing that it is their right to have the right of way.<br><br>The same has happened all over Asia.<br><br>Are the older folks in singapore most discourteous, meaning the younger Singaporean more courteous? than I would be happy for the future singapore would have more courteous people. Will a crowded singapore force our people to be more tolerant to one another? if that happens, it would still not be a bad place to live.<br><br>Singaporeans are generally more educated, and financially can-do, I can't see how much more educated we need to be, or wealth we need to accumulate before we start saying that we should now start to be more graceous and courteous, not required by the government but make it our very own trait.<br><br>I really dread it when it is the young and educated, financially ok singaporeans who are rude and yet they think others are discourteous.<br><br></div>

Poorly worded it may be, what I wanted to suggest is that as Singaporeans as a whole are a stubborn and apathetic community and factoring in the resistance to change older people would put up, it would almost be a forgone conclusion that nothing will come out of trying to change them, but that is just my point of view.<br><br>And yes, there are many well moderated forums with mature members around, why dont you just google (or yahoo) for 'forum code of conduct' and look for rules pertaining to flame or derogatory terms. Also, amongst other things, double, triple, quadruple, pentuple etc posting is also generally frowned upon - the edit button is there for a reason.<br></div></blockquote>But Singapore is not make up of older people only. What about young people like yourself?<br><br>All forums have their guidelines and code of conduct but it is only in fairy tales do you get everyone abidding to all the rules.<br><br>We come to forum to air our views as well as listen to others'.
