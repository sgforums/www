But the term "free" goes to the person consuming the resource, ultimately someone has to pay for it.  I think you are so brainwashed by OM and Gazelle. When you go Madonald's you order a Extra Value Meal, it comes free with an apple pie. Yes, you can say that the apple pie isn't free, it comes at a cost to Macdonald's, but it's free to you. That is the definition of free, if you choose to subscribe to Gazelle's form of definition, then nothing in this world is free, we might as well strike off the word from our dictionary.<br><br>There is private healthcare in the UK too, instead of the NHS. Those that OM highlighted before are well to do individuals who decides to go overseas for a holiday and medical treatment. Seems like OM highlighted some very skewed case of rich individuals going overseas for medical treatment because UK does not have private healthcare, UK has it's own private healthcare system.<br><br><a href="http://www.privatehealth.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.privatehealth.co.uk/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2001/mar/19/2" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2001/mar/19/2</a><br><br>The free healthcare provides basic needs to the poor and needy. If you cannot stand the wait, then you can probably choose private healthcare by buying a medical insurance. It provides the basic healthcare to those who can't afford the fees, but can afford the wait.<br><br>The case of this elderly UK lady highlighted by our propaganda new media is to sway public opinion. Do you think you can find elderly individuals here in Singapore with rotting tooth but can't afford the dental charges to have it removed? Why didn't the local propaganda media highlight these cases of poor elderly Singaporeans not being able to afford "public" healthcare? These are the people that can afford the wait but can't afford the dental charges. I know alot of these poor elderly folks who can't afford the charges but can afford the wait.<br><br></div>
