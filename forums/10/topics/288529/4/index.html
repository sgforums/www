[/b]</blockquote>I think diving has affected your intelligence in a negative way, maybe the intra-cranial pressure during scuba diving affected your ability to analyse issues properly. Maybe, like you say, it's a result of Karma that you took up diving and resulted in your sub-normal intelligence.<br><br>Take it easy bro....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>You are comparing 2 different issues altogether, flying you need to look at the weather too, it does not just involve the pilot and plane. The prices of these 2 airlines are world apart as compared to other average airlines. Why not compare 2 similar airlines, Cathay Pacific or Quantas? The price of these 2 airlines is comparable to SIA, Cathay is slightly more expensive.<br><br>Then you compare our Ministers salary with those of equivalent countries in the world. You compare them to Indonesian politicians, they are extremely extremely overpaid. If you compare them to Swiss, British, American, Japanese, New Zealand, etc, they are still extremely overpaid. Does this mean that there is alot of corruption in US or Switzerland or New Zealand? Don't you think our Ministers are severely overpaid. The over payment is the result of the P4P gaining monopolistic power in parliament. Like all monopolies, if there is power, it will be subjected to abuse.<br><br>Laws keep people from corruption, not money! What is it that prevents our local police from being corrupt by accepting bribe? You have a clearly defined set of laws for corruption and enforcement. If you tread outside these boundaries, you will be subjected to criminal prosecution. Likewise, for the politician, tougher laws should be set up to curtail their possible corruption. These politicians are representative of the population, they should have the utmost credibility, no lesser corrupt individuals would do.<br><br>If you pay someone $4 million a year and if somebody decides to give him $1 million for favours. What is there to prevent him from accepting such a bribe? Your payment of $4 million is not a deterrent.<br><br></div>

But indirectly it could affect you, in terms of enrichment of your life. Proves my point, seeing a doctor will not improve your intelligence.<br><br>Thanks for your subsidy, but it's better suited to helping those sub-normal intelligence children you are going to have.<br><br>But I paid more taxes than your puny $203.40, so I managed to pay off my own share, no need to rely on your generosity. Anyway, there is no need for me to see the specialist, only if I choose to as my ailment is extremely minor. But having sub-normal intelligent children from your genes is lifelong, take care bro.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>With the taxes you paid, can also tell that you are a lowly paid sub-normal intelligence worker.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Interesting to note that your chargeable income from income tax was around $25,811 (give or take $3 - $4). That would be around $2,000 a month, quite a good pay for your kind of intelligence. Hope it makes your life more meaningful.</div>
