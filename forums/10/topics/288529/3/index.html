But the term "free" goes to the person consuming the resource, ultimately someone has to pay for it.  I think you are so brainwashed by OM and Gazelle. When you go Madonald's you order a Extra Value Meal, it comes free with an apple pie. Yes, you can say that the apple pie isn't free, it comes at a cost to Macdonald's, but it's free to you. That is the definition of free, if you choose to subscribe to Gazelle's form of definition, then nothing in this world is free, we might as well strike off the word from our dictionary.<br><br>There is private healthcare in the UK too, instead of the NHS. Those that OM highlighted before are well to do individuals who decides to go overseas for a holiday and medical treatment.

If you cannot stand the wait, then you can probably choose private healthcare by buying a medical insurance. It provides the basic healthcare to those who can't afford the fees, but can afford the wait.<br><br>The case of this elderly UK lady highlighted by our propaganda new media is to sway public opinion. Do you think you can find elderly individuals here with rotting tooth but can't afford the dental charges to have it removed? These are the people that can afford the wait but can't afford the dental charges.<br><br></div></blockquote>U do know that medical insurance in both US and Uk is very very expensive right  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Some US report that middle class family in US can't afford medical insurance.

Instead they decide to highlight the issues in another country. Do go over Chinatown, speak to those old folks, ask them if they have any decayed tooth that they can't afford to have removed. No matter how long NHS makes you wait, it's better than not getting any treatment at all, so goes the old adage, "it's better late then never".<br><br>I went to make an appointment for a specialist today, the wait is just as bad as NHS. It's 2 months!!! Best part is I am paying for the treatment unlike NHS which is FREE.<br><br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/DSCN0284a.jpg"><br><br>Perhaps you could also explain why Hong Kong can provide all it's citizens with cheaper healthcare than Singapore??? Hong Kong has an equivalent standard of living in terms of GDP.  [SG$ 1.00 = HK$ 5.35]<br><br>Hong Kong's A&amp;E is HK$100 per attendance, which is SG$ 18.70.<br><br>How much does the A&amp;E attendance fees in our "PUBLIC" Hospital cost???<br><br>Best part is, Hong Kong has a similar tax structure to Singapore, I think the tax is cheaper than Singapore even and Hong Kong doesn't have GST at all. Kind of makes one wonder, where has all our tax revenues gone.<br><br>There are 2 kinds of people in Singapore, those that get rob of their hard earned money and starts making lots of noise. While there is another type when robbed, encourages them to rob us more.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>All figures below are in Hong Kong Dollars.<br><img src="http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb312/maurizio13/public_HK_hospital.png"><br>Source: <a href="http://www.ha.org.hk/hesd/nsapi/?MIval=ha_visitor_index&amp;lang=E&amp;intro=ha%5fview%5ftemplate%26group%3dOSR%26Area%3dGOP" rel="nofollow">http://www.ha.org.hk/hesd/nsapi/?MIval=ha_visitor_index&amp;lang=E&amp;intro=ha%5fview%5ftemplate%26group%3dOSR%26Area%3dGOP</a></div>
