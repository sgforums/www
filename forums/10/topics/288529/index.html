I think it's more like BullCrap Healthcare...<br><br></div></blockquote>Is our healthcare 'cheap'... of course not.<br><br>But is our healthcare 'Subsidized'...... it is. I when for a Lap-Band operation 1+years ago.... The hospital show me a price list of how much the whole 'package' cost. A foreginer will pay nearly 10K for the same package I took. A PR will pay 1K more than me. In the end, my total bills comes to $5k+ paying cash of around $3K, the rest by medisave.<br><br>It was bloody NTUC insurance that play me out..... when they rejected my claim due to me taking a lower end policy.<br><br>Therefoe is our healthcare cheap..... no it not. But the service is good and the doctor &amp; staff took good care of me before and after the Ops. You paid for what you get..... if not happy about the price, you could also be like those UK citizen and go for Ops in Malaysia and India. I do know some S'porean who buy their Monthly med from Malaysia.......</div>

The umbrella breaks apart half way in the rain. Can you raise an objection with the company? In the laws of contract you have no case because there was no exchange of consideration. If you think you deserve a better quality umbrella, you purchase a better quality umbrella from the stores.<br><br>Likewise with the NHS, the healthcare is provided free, if you think that you deserve better service or can't wait, you purchase it from the open market. That's why some chose to go overseas for treatment while others chose to wait in line.<br><br>Whereas in the case of Singapore, things are much different. You pay for hospital fees much higher than a Hong Konger would pay in their country and you get crappy service.<br><br>A few months ago, one of my family member had to be warded for a minor procedure. There wasn't any beds available, just think about it, I am paying for a service at above average rates (when compared to a Hong Kong Hospital), yet I have to wait 12 hours to be allocated a bed.</div>
