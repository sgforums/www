I am pretty sure the French would be desparate to win and given the past history of SAF purchases of French equipment, I would say Rafale is almost certain to win. In the  the past 10 years, Mindef has done some major procument from the French including:<br><br>1. 38  Giat LG 105mm Gun (Singapore being the first country to purchase this, and the French turned that into export successes, selling the mk2 version to Thailand, Indonesia, Belguim, and some other countries.  A very important factor for the French to ensure a victory in Singapore given they just narrowly lost one in the Korean competition due to certain "anomalies".<br><br>2.  22 AMX-10P, 22 AMX-10 PAC-90<br><br>3. 20 AS 550 Fennecs(10 AS 550A-2 and 10 AS 550C-2)<br><br>4. 6 modified La Fayette frigates including French made weapons<br>a. Exocets<br>b. Aster 15<br><br>It is obvious that Singapore acquire more French weapons than any other European ones including any Euro consortiums in the last 10 years.  Furthermore, RSAF has already established a training sqn in France and adding new training programs for the Rafales would be an exercise a lot more simpler than start a new one either in UK or Germany.<br><br>Plus the fact that I'm sure the French would not hesitate to sell RSAF Micas and integrate any AIM-9 that RSAF already has in its inventory to the Rafales. The US can still potentially deny RSAF access to Amraams on a Typhoon purchase.<br><br>Lastly, Rafales are already operational with the French AF and Navy. Well in RSAF's book, that is a very very very very very important factor. Typhoon is only recently in production. The European countries will still have some time before they resolve or tweak all the glitches.<br><br>Of course the dark horses are always the American planes, and F-15 being the leader of the pack !!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Once again, this topic has been going on in too many threads already. Perhaps we can discuss this again when RSAF finally select their planes (whenever that happens)....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Althru it hasn't been announced but the final selection is coming out soon i dun really know the actual date but it is getting really nearer than u expected i heard from a friend of mine who is working in the DSTA and even the russian reported than the final result is coming soon<br>i cant deny that this project has been quite awhile since singapore announce it plan to acquire new generation fighters,it is somehow or rather expected.<br>I agree that french equipment has been a potential selection from the a number of equipment u listed<br>that is acquire by SAF,there is a number of better planes out there<br>rafale is not the only one among the contenders.Having a base in CAUX france doesnt necessary means that singapore will acquire rafale<br>.US can also provide a training base with the US counterpart and even gain access to its aircraft training simulator and airforce base.Like those F-16 based in Luke airforce base.<br>Remember the package EF2000 consortium give us includes unrestricted Meteor missile acquisition with no condition and technical training support for the fighter planes.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we now have to wait for the nxt AA announcements sooner or later, with the maritime heli compettion1st.<br><br>This f-x competition is indeed veri tough 1: Typhoon, rafales, strike eagle, blk 60 falcons, super hornet, su-30.  It is onli recently tt we hav a veri gd relation with france with the recent purchase of france equipment.  It is like the apache n euro tiger copetition last time.  Now is tt most of us think is down to between this 2 aircraft: rafale n typhoon.<br><br>BVR missile is also an issue of it. tt we cannot deny it.  2 many factors affecting 1 another for this copetition.  It is nice to hav such a debate but in the end is still lies with the result selection.  Onli result selection tells us the minds of the mindef.<br><br></div>

In a previous post under the <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=24964&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">Singapore's SuperSkyhawk replacement page 4</a> you mentioned that "I've heard claims that RSAF is looking for a predominantly air superiority fighter not a multirole fighter, although I realy doubt this," I wonder how the claim came about. My understanding is that RSAF wants a  n air-superiority fighter who can move mud equally well, sort of the current capability of the F16 CJ/DJs except doing the tasks even better. Given Rafale F3 will have the AESA radar, OST for passive A2A BVR engagement (real kick butt I reckon), HMS, Data Voice Input, advanced ECM/ESM, up to 8 AAMs and the degree of Stealth better than the current F16, I can't see why Rafale will be ever overlook as an air-superority fighter even though it also excel in A2G (especially in the deep penetration strikes area).<br><br>I think RSAF can advance so much more with a Rafale purchase not just in terms of fighting capabilities, but also with the technology transfer, integration and customisation work on a RSAF Rafale variant (eg, intergrating Derby, Python 4, GBU-10s, AIM-9s, Maverick, whatever one can think of), this will benefit Singapore so much more than a Typhoon purchase.<br><br>Man, I still think that we should go for the frame with an AESA radar.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">German Typhoon jets still being tested</span></strong><br><br>AFP - <strong>Technical problems linked to the production</strong> of long-awaited Eurofighter warplanes has led to a delay in the delivery of a new German fleet, the German defence ministry says.<br><br>The ministry confirmed press reports of a delay in the Eurofighter Typhoon production, saying it was due to <strong>problems with the aircraft fuselage and the finishings on the wings and lateral control surfaces</strong>.<br><br>Germany has ordered 180 of the two-seater, two-engine fighter jets, created by a consortium composed of Britain's BAE Systems, Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa), Italy's Alenia and the Spanish group Casa.<br><br>The ministry comments partially confirmed reports to be published in the German weekly Der Spiegel that the <strong>carbon fiber layer meant to protect the back wing was in danger of flying off at supersonic speed, which could lead the plane to crash</strong>.<br><br>Over 600 Typhoon jets have been ordered by Eurofighter consortium members. Britain announced a six-month delay last May in the delivery of their fleet.<br><br>The first planes are scheduled to be operational by the end of 2002.<br><br>---------------------<br><br>Well as Viper52 and myself have always supported a Rafale purchase because Typhoon is still at the very moment, suffering from technical fault, I think this report rest our case.<br><br>Typhoon is still not ready for production. If RSAF goes with Typhoon, we will see Typhoon till at least 2008 or 2009. With a Rafale purchase, I think given the low production log book they have right now, RSAF might even get one by 2006 if we put the order in by 2004.<br><br>BTW, here is the URL to that news article:<br><a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/Sci_Tech/story_38651.asp" rel="nofollow">http://news.ninemsn.com.au/Sci_Tech/story_38651.asp</a><br><br></div>
