              <p>They are not "weak" but they are lazy.</p>
              <p>I don't mind if the person is stupid but hardworking. There is
              still some hope for the person. If you practice a lot, I don't see
              the possibility of getting L1R5 above 20 because they tend to
              recycle questions and they rarely asked questions that are outside
              syllabus. They are plain lazy. If a person is stupid and lazy, that
              person is beyond the word "hopeless".</p>
              <p>If your L1R5 is above 20, ask yourself this question : Have you
              put in enough effort to study during your O lv examinations? If so,
              how come you still get dismal results while your friends can get
              satisfactory results? Do you deserve this grade?</p>

              <p>precisely,  i felt the urge to say something when i came across the word "weak" to label them.  Saying weak in certain subject is different from saying weak in general.</p>

              <p>Campus is just a building. Nothing to do with how the school manages the students.</p>
              <p>The overall idea is good and deserves an award.. but the school still needs to be more creative when handling the students.</p>
              <p>Focusing too much on statistics, is never a good way to gauge human.</p>

              <p>I admire your gut to speak out openly. My friend who taught in ITE got scolded by CM before he can ask CM to debar a student. i just dun understand where is the integrity and who do blame....of course the people at the top. They are suppose to lead and not run away from problems. Principal, CM and SH they know about these problems. Even ITE students also know they can pass without much effort....</p>
              <p>I is a GREAT WAYANG.....</p>
