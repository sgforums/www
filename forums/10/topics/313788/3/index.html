              <p><br>Hey, I think you got the point wrong.</p>
              <p>TS is not belittling them, and TS is not shunning his/her responsibilities at educating them. His woes now are that the students themselves not fighting hard for the certification. They will end up nowhere when they graduate cos they might know nothing.</p>
              <p>Imagine this, how can TS push them, help them or teach them if they continue to be absent from class or not handing in homework? He is not saying a handful of problematic students, but only a minority wishes to do well. The rest just want to slack or breeze through their college life.</p>
              <p>I am sure a large population do not think it's the end for ITE students. I feel that ITE students are the ones who will think out of the box and come up with solutions. I have worked with some who can really be creative, while many are just "guai lan" and come out with problems or sh!t or just disappear from work.</p>
              <p>What TS needs now is a little encouragement from people and perhaps a change in management for the lecturers and students.  I wish him/her the best in teaching them.</p>

              <p>lets take this for eg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My 1st year classmate,who failed quite a number of subjects during N level actually got into my course(Bldg Drafting) instead of his choice course(Building Services Tech). Simply because he is colour blind under industrial light.Guess what the staff told him?they told him to choose 1 of 2 other courses <strong>AVAILABLE AT THE SAME CAMPUS  </strong>and that's how he got in.</p>
              <p>By right,he needs to pass maths and 2 other subjs but no,he got in just like that and in the end,he couldnt catch up and got 0.875 GPA.jeez</p>
              <p>I feel that if they have to decline someone's admission,make sure they meet the requirements of the course they choose.</p>

              <p>i was an ITE student. Let me share my story, i agree 100% with threadstarter though some of the points i dont see them on my campus back then as i was from DOVER which only have higher nitec students ( higher nitec=ITC).</p>
              <p>-&gt; not only hopeless student i saw, there were utterly useless lecturers in ITE too.</p>
              <p>I had lectuerers who KNEW nothing of what they are teaching. like having lab test, our pneumatic circuits refused to work,  he couldn't tell us what was wrong. not because it was a lab test but he DIDNT KNOW/COULDNT troubleshoot at all. I couldn't help it, needless to say my temper gave way and i told him off in a rude tone.i hate to say but, not only the students are responsible , some of the lecturers really CMI. 9am lesson , 9.30 break 10.30 come back.but there are really good lecturers who haven't given up hope on us.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh BTW , if you think ITE is a place where gangsters fight , student play games. My class caught a couple making out in school toilet ( the guy was a student leader!)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go figure,</p>

              <p>Because of teacher like the TS, that is why many people have bad impression towards ITE student and stereostype them as "weak"  ,a typical example can be found somewhere in this thread =].</p>
              <p>and because of people who called them "weak" they are not helping at all,in fact, they are adding more fuel to the fire, which hurt some ite student deeply and makes them think that it is really "in the end" for them.</p>
              <p>As human being, we are all are very vulnerable, many of the time when we fell down, we simply just give up and just accept whatever option given to us. At that point of time  when the surrounding people are not helping at all,it just make the matter worst.</p>
              <p>I have seen many Ite student and disabled people who managed to enter into local uni, they have strong determination, but the majority don't, this bunch of people need encouragement and helping hand, not those people who stereotype them.</p>

              Mihiro, if you were more discerning by following the thread from the start and reading carefully, you will know that the TS has no intention of bashing ITE students. The issue is a administrative loophole that is present and the exploitation of this system by the ITE students themselves. 
              
              To help people, they must first want to help themselves.

              <p>pardon me if i misleaded myself somewhere, because i based my opinion on the apologies letter itself, i rarely came to sgforum and happens to see this topic at the main pages and TS already motified what he wrote.</p>
              <p>other than that, what i wrote previously  is in regards to something else.</p>
              <p>i agree that to help people, they must first want to help themselves,but things don't always goes that way, is people who offer them the help then allows them to help themselves.</p>

              <p>They are not "weak" but they are lazy.</p>
              <p>I don't mind if the person is stupid but hardworking. There is still some hope for the person. If you practice a lot, I don't see the possibility of getting L1R5 above 20 because they tend to recycle questions and they rarely asked questions that are outside syllabus. They are plain lazy. If a person is stupid and lazy, that person is beyond the word "hopeless".</p>
              <p>If your L1R5 is above 20, ask yourself this question : Have you put in enough effort to study during your O lv examinations? If so, how come you still get dismal results while your friends can get satisfactory results? Do you deserve this grade?</p>
