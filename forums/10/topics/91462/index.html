Some scientists r worried tat the virus may cross mutate into affecting human. If tat happens, an epidemic may have started. It may also wipe out the chicken and eggs farm in singapore if we r not careful with it. Remember tat it is complacency tat place singapore into the sars alert last year.

Bird flu is highly contagious among birds and it appears to have a near 100% death rate. Remember SARS is believed to have caught from virus cross-mutated from civet cats as well, and it is shown tat human and pigs can be affected by it. So it is better to be safe than sorry.</div>
