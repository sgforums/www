At that moment, if I step out before the cars were stopped, I die; if I faint and fall, I die; if somebody pushes me from behind, I die; this is no difference from standing at an MRT platform when a train approaches!!   BUT, the train will never crash onto me, but the cars on the road can lose control and crash onto the crowd standing by!! so standing by the road side is more dangerous than standing on a MRT platform. Why we never ask the government to protect those standing by the roadside?<br><br>Visit the metros in all the major cities in the world, New York, Tokyo, Paris, London.....there are no doors or anythings that are meant to protect the passengers from the trains, or rather prevent the passengers from falling onto the tracks. There are much more passengers there, more pushing and squeezing, more drunkards....<br><br>Why do people stand so close to the track when the train approaches? want to get in first? another indication of Kiasuism. There is a yellow line beyond which nobody should stand except when you are boarding when the train stops. Why nobody observe???<br><br>Let there be fresh air while we wait for the train. If anything is to be done, lets educate those who want to commit suicide to go elsewhere and not inconvenience the commuters.<br><br>I don't work for MRTC, I don't own their shares, just feel that it is about time singaporean learn to be careful and not waiting to be protected.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see a sudden surge in people dying at the tracks recently. In the past people r also "kiasu' and try to board the train fast, but the number of death is few because they r not dumb. From the video tapes it is clear tat these people choose to commit suicide instead of foul play. These death or injuries do cause a lot of disruption to our public transport system isn't it ? So wat do u propose we do to stop tis problem ? If everyday someone decide to end their lives on the tracks, then we r gonna see more disruptions and our public transport system will fail to be reliable. Educating people to stop committing suicide on the tracks ? Educating them not to commit suicide has clearly fail, how do we educate them not to commit suicide on the tracks ? When they reach the point of committing suicide, they don't care about the consequences.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stupidissmart:</div><div class="quote_body">I see a sudden surge in people dying at the tracks recently. In the past people r also "kiasu' and try to board the train fast, but the number of death is few because they r not dumb. From the video tapes it is clear tat these people choose to commit suicide instead of foul play. These death or injuries do cause a lot of disruption to our public transport system isn't it ? So wat do u propose we do to stop tis problem ? If everyday someone decide to end their lives on the tracks, then we r gonna see more disruptions and our public transport system will fail to be reliable. Educating people to stop committing suicide on the tracks ? Educating them not to commit suicide has clearly fail, how do we educate them not to commit suicide on the tracks ? When they reach the point of committing suicide, they don't care about the consequences. </div></blockquote>So far nothing official about why these people were on the track when the train approached. Not sure if those were all suicide cases.<br><br>I don't have a proposal to stop people from commiting suicide by jumping MRT track. May be they think it is a faster way to die and less messy than jumping down from HDB. The japanese certainly think so, I was told every week there are 2 to 3 cases of suicides, at least.<br><br>What problem are we solving? too many suicides? why do they want to die?  family problem? BG problem? financial problem,....I don't know; or is it inconvenience to commuters due to disruption of service? may be MRTC should find a way to clear the body in the shortest time. May be we ask everybody commuter to pray before they go on the train that nobody jump track today....The list can go on...it is the concerns of everybody.<br><br>What I am saying is that if suicide rate increases, everybody should be concerned, not just the authorities or the government.</div>
