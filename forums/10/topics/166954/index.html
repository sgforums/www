            <div class='col-md body'>In many cases, the so-called deterrence meted to offenders has failed to stop or deter future crimes of the same nature.<br><br>Drug trafficking is one such instance where deterrence by death penalty does not work as intended.<br><br>What is more important in passing and enforcing laws is upholding of accountability and transparency in upholding of justice. Punishment should always be aimed at correcting the particular criminal and eliminating the cause for future commissions of the same crimes. Reforming and redeeming the criminal is one approach. There should be no assumptions that just because of certain consequences to society a criminal should be punished with some mandatory sentences or death. Below death, many measures are just as effective like life or long-term imprisonment and rotan. Let death sentence be the sentence of final resort reserved for treason or murder.</div>

Are our law makers and judges overly obsessed with deterrence?<br><br>If our laws are too harsh because of some obsessions of our leaders that they must punish certain criminals extremely to prevent certain crimes, then we should ask the question - are our leaders overdoing punishments for control or political purpose ? Is it necessary to ban chewing gums? Is it necessary to make Sedition Act tougher to nab people posting some criticisms of government or policies they don't like?<br><br>If we are in the wrong band, and forgetting that principal objective of laws is upholding of justice with accountability and transparency, then it is only right to desist from overkill of punishments as the latter might make us a police and authoritarian state. There seems to be a tendency for our law makers to accept the argument that we need to impose heavy sentence as deterrence with a habit to pass new mandatory sentencing for all kinds of offences.<br><br>Just imagine, people can go to jail for all sorts of reason like falling windows because of some rusty windows in the past. Are we becoming a society where control and punishment is everything. Even a fumbling old land lady can be jailed for mere renting of flat to foreigners not knowing how to check or stupid enough for not helping police to prevent entry of illegal immigrants.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, LAW in Singapore very harshly deters drug offenders. DETERRENCE to me is ok, it makes sense - especially with drugs. But what I did't quite like, and totally cannot agree with, is our government's inflexibility, and arrogance, over the latest hanging.<br><br>And if the Death Penalty is a permanent and essential component of Singapore's LAW, why can't our government make it more humane by upgrading the method to Death by Lethal Injection??? Too gentle?? Do they prefer some degree of brutality?? Too expensive??? Or just plain STUBBORN??? Just like with casino...before cannot now can, bcos need money.<br><br>We're fast earning nick names &amp; jokes internationally; "Singapore's a 'fine' place and many people 'hang out' there...."<br><br></div>
