The reason why many youths today are politically apathetic or dont even know who Grace Fu or Raymond Lim is due to them not having a say in the future of the country. Our education system does not train us sufficiently that it is the duty of every citizen to participate in decision making.<br><br>Lowering the voting age and modifying the curriculum will help help acheive a dual objective. To raise the level of political awareness and to inculcate national responsibility at a younger age.<br><br>And what makes you think everybody in singapore is a Wee shu min? How does lowering the voting age exactly leads to an opposition rout? Have you been to 2005 youth forum? Where opposition leader Chiam see Tong was invited to speak? Many youths cheered and supported him when he spoke and voiced his opinions.<br><br>So opposition rout or not, would depend on the quality of the opposition candidates.</div>
