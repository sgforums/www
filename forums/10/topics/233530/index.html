When he applied for a subsidised Housing Board rental flat, he was rejected because he could not meet the eligibility conditions.<br><br>The second person, added Dr Maliki, defaulted on the mortgage payments on his flat, which he had purchased from the open market with a housing grant.<br><br>When the bank repossessed his flat, he applied to HDB for a subsidised rental flat, but was also rejected because he could not meet the eligibility conditions.<br><br>HDB advised him to consider buying a smaller flat or to live with his siblings, or to stay at temporary shelters run by volunteer organisations, but he declined all these suggestions.<br><br>Dr Maliki highlighted three options for families who have trouble finding a roof over their heads: subsidised rental flats, open-market rental flats, and living with extended families.<br><br>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio GRC) asked: 'Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that there are also many cases of residents who are in negative equity and, as a result of that, the banks are forcing a sale and therefore they actually don't have excess cash to help them rent a flat, buy a flat?<br><br>'And that these cases are increasing because of the policy change of allowing banks to handle HDB mortgages?'<br><br>Families planning to take up a bank loan should understand the implications of taking on this responsibility, said Dr Maliki.<br><br>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines GRC) noted: 'When they apply for an HDB loan and they get turned down and the only alternative to getting financing for the house is to turn to the banks...it is not as if they have a choice.'<br><br>Both Ms Irene Ng (Tampines GRC) and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied GRC) also questioned if housing options are affordable to those from the lower-income group.<br><br>Dr Maliki assured them that the Government will try to help individuals who need shelter.<br><br>He said: 'If they do merit consideration, we will try to help them.'<br><br>NO MEANS TO RENT OR BUY<br>'Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that there are also residents who are in negative equity and...they actually don't have excess cash to help them rent a flat, buy a flat?'<br>MR INDERJIT SINGH (Ang Mo Kio GRC)<br><br>BANK LOAN IS ONLY OPTION<br>'When they apply for an HDB loan and they get turned down and the only alternative to getting financing for the house is to turn to the banks...it is not as if they have a choice.'<br>MR SIN BOON ANN (Tampines GRC)</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After crap hits the fan, the cleaning up only just started..<br><br>===========================================<br><br><strong>Target help at those who need it</strong><br><strong>By Leong Wee Keat , TODAY | Posted: 29 January 2007 1312 hrs </strong><br><br>Michael Palmer said he will look into what can be done for students to offset the upcoming GST hike<br><br>Identify those who have defaulted on their HDB loan repayments or have not been able to pay their utilities bills Â— when deciding who should get a bigger slice of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) offset package Â— instead of sticking to stark criteria of personal income or flat size as in the past.<br><br>This unorthodox suggestion of how to allocate Government relief came from economist Tan Khee Giap, who was speaking at a People's Association Youth Movement (Paym) policy forum yesterday,<br><br>He suggested a "country-wide record", monitored by a centralised agency, be set up to monitor those people who regularly turn to agencies for aid and, hence, are likely to be in real need of help.<br><br>"I suggest that you look at people and how many months they do not pay their PUB bills; the number of people who default on their HDB rental or HDB instalments," said the Nanyang Technological University don. "These are all valid indicators that (they) cannot make it in day to day (life) Â… and ought to be helped."<br><br>Going beyond the offset package, Associate Professor Tan said that while there are many social assistance schemes to help the poor, the problem is to improve their access to such help.<br><br>He suggested that a one-stop centre, providing information on government and welfare groups' assistance schemes, be set up.<br><br>Currently doing research on how easily Singaporeans tap such help, Prof Tan noted that those in the lower-income group could easily double, or even triple, their monthly source of funds Â— if only they were able to tap into all the schemes available to them.<br><br>Yesterday's forum was attended by about 80 youths between the ages of 19 and 35, who felt the young should not be left out of the offset package for the 2-percentage-point GST hike.<br><br>Temasek Polytechnic student Faris Basharahil pointed out that students are consumers, too. Yet, unlike adults who receive offset package benefits, students receive little direct help, said the 19-year-old.<br><br>Member of Parliament (MP) for Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency Michael Palmer agreed with his concerns. Speaking to reporters later, Mr Palmer said he would look into what could be done for the students.<br><br>"Yes, we do a lot in terms of indirect investment in them, education, transport, it's all subsidised ... But, directly, the students feel, 'Hey what am I getting? Everybody is getting a Progress Package, an offset package, what am I getting?'" he said.<br><br>Noting the previous GST increases, industry development manager Ricky Ng also asked during the forum whether the impending increase was "the end of the road" for GST hikes.<br><br>And, if there is to be a future increase, Mr Ng, 33, said: "Why take your medication once or twice? Why don't we just take an injection and call it a day?"<br><br>In reply, Mr Palmer said he would need a crystal ball to predict any further GST hikes, and these would depend on the added expenditure needed for the development of services and the physical infrastructure. - TODAY/sh<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  Why denied the poor from renting a subsidised flat. The purchase of a 3-4 or 5 room should rest on the liberty of ppl if they wanted to purchase it or not. Why set this kind of policy where u earn 2.5k /mth then u must buy a 4 or 5 rm flat.<br><br>They thot the flat very cheap.. 200+k, ppls no need to pay bills, settle some red ang pows.. these and that. What if they are out of job? Childrens, wife?<br><br>Nevertheless, they still managed to secure all seats and the ratio remains with 2 opposition voices. I am not supporting of the current parties or opposition. But we really need to seriously consider what we are doing and saying, it just doesn't tally. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
