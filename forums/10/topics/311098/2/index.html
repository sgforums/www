              <p>With influx of deposits in the interbank markets and concerns over the US economy, lenders are slowing down their credit growth. That is, when banks cut back on lending, banks will carry surplus funds. They cut deposit rates since they can't lend out much. You see banks choosing to pump their funds into asset backed loans, that is, property loans. You see DBS and Maybank advertsing their housing loans aggressively.</p>
              <p>People see opportunities to convert their savings into USD currency, hoping to cash in when the USD currency appreciates. The trick asking what is the lowest pit, the time to buy USD? How long do we hold on to the USD currency?</p>

              <p>Dear Firepig,</p>
              <p>We will not call Hong Leong Finance a bank. It's a finance
              company unless you mistaken it for HL Bank, which is a Malaysian
              bank operating here in Singapore. HL Bank belongs to the Quek
              Faminly in Malaysia. Hong Leong Finance belongs to the another Quek
              Family in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Being a Finance Co, Hong Leong Finance largely lend against
              assets, that is, they engaged in asset based lending. When borrower
              defaults, they can fall back on the assets pledged. I would not
              consider Hong Leong Finance weak financially.</p>

              <p>Hong Leong Finance has been seeking for a banking licence for many years.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian Quek managed to get hold of the Singapore bank licence by acquiring a Malaysian bank and rename it Hong Leong Bank. As a Malaysian bank, they waltz in for a bank licence and registered "HL Bank" in Singapore. That certainly peeved the Quek family in Singapore, though no fault of the Malaysian Quek.</p>
              <p>Till this day, our Singapore Quek is still unable get their banking licence.</p>

              <p>Have you considered Foreign exchange risks? What about flexibility in repayment when using the domestic banking structure for domestic transaction purposes? And just because your aware of these existing rates doesn't mean that those are the only rates that the banks are offerring. In fact, banks do offer their premium or high net worth clients a better rate then the rest of the public. Thats capitalism for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>On a side note, are you guys aware why the banks are actively selling their unit trusts? Its just a clever way to transfer their risks to the consumers as there are associated risks and costs involved in holding too much raw cash.

              <p>Generally, foreign banks [like SCB and Maybank] are prepared to offer higher rates attract more SGD deposits. Because they will usually go into inter-bank markets to borrow from local banks like DBS, which has the largest depositor base.</p>

              <p>The insurance packages and the unit trust packages offered by the banks are different. I agree with you that the banks act as channel distributors for insurance products as these are mainly the forte of insurance giants like Pru and AIG, as you rightly pointed out yourself. However, unit trust packages are under-written and managed by the banks themselves and sometimes in collaboration with another financial institution. You can't lump all products provided by the banks under one arguement.</p>
              <p>Unit Trusts underwritten and managed by banks: A way to earn revenue AND transferring of risks to consumers. Insurance products: Channel distributors and earning a fee income.</p>

              <p>bank owners are the smartest people:</p>
              <p>1. people just give and give them their salaries every month.</p>
              <p>2. they just use this gigantic sum and able to afford the best to help them invest.</p>

              <p>wow, what is the criteria to legally own a bank in sgpore huh?</p>

              <p>And btw , my degree was in comp sci. I'm just working in the financial sector now. What's YOUR excuse for incompetence?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, EV does not take in account retardation factors such as inflation. Do you even know what Expected value is? Anything above the risk-free interest rate carries risk for greater rewards. Investing is such an activity. Since when is there a written guarantee that you have to be able to break even with inflation? If that were the case, inflation would not be a problem at all.</p>
              <p>No, I must confess your MV is a mystery to me. Perhaps you would like to enlighten me?</p>

              <p>the EV SHOULD be the same</p>
              <p>SHOULD. In a perfect free market.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure you took economics either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And btw , my degree was in comp sci. I'm just working in the
              financial sector now. What's YOUR excuse for incompetence?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, EV does not take in account retardation factors such as
              inflation. Do you even know what Expected value is? Anything above
              the risk-free interest rate carries risk for greater rewards.
              Investing is such an activity. Since when is there a written
              guarantee that you have to be able to break even with inflation? If
              that were the case, inflation would not be a problem at all.</p>
              <p>No, I must confess your MV is a mystery to me. Perhaps you would
              like to enlighten me?</p>
