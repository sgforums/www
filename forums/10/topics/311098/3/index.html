              <p>Btw, EV does not take in account retardation factors such as inflation. Do you even know what Expected value is? Anything above the risk-free interest rate carries risk for greater rewards. Investing is such an activity. Since when is there a written guarantee that you have to be able to break even with inflation? If that were the case, inflation would not be a problem at all.</p>

              <p>being a layman,</p>
              <p>i have this wild thought how to improve the situation:</p>
              <p>1. since banks IR so so low, why not put in overseas banks?</p>
              <p>2. if there are overseas good banks able to pay more interest, can we lump together many people's money into 1 big sum and put into overseas banks that give more interest and earn more interest using a combined account?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i worry that like this, local banks will go kaput.</p>
              <p>but then again, if this happens the banks might react to retain the 'talents'.</p>

              <p>Your concern could be addressed by purchasing treasury bills/notes which are effectively risk-free (so long as you buy those in civilisations that are remotely human :P ) - treasury bills/notes effectively pay you the interest upfront and the rest at maturity.</p>
              <p>In addition, should circumstances change favourably prior to maturity, you could always trade your bills/bonds (known as securities trading) OTC, which effectively locks in your profit.</p>

              <p>Banks of today are here to create the crisis to the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The banker bonuses which encouraged excessive risk-taking which cause the financial crisis today. <br><br>They basically gamble - as it paid they to gamble - when they win they walk away with huge bonuses, when they lost - they do not share the lost !!! Even if they lost their job, they already walk away with larges sums that they win earlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The banks change the practise, hold back the bonus for a certain period of years, and if loss for the following years, their bonus is reduce, thus if they are make to share the gain and lost .</p>

              <p>Yes, its extremely feasible. In fact, there are international banks operating in Singapore that provides services such as Foreign currency deposits, saving you from the need to go overseas physically and openning a bank account there.</p>
              <p>Of course, you will be bearing the foreign exchange risks if you do. And no, you won't be taxed. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/satisfied.png" alt="satisfied.png"></p>

              <p>If the interest rate is 7%, your final is 1.07 more than your original amount. However, you will have to take into account exchange rates. If the exchange rate drops in your favour (and SGD is expected to rise in value), and if it drops 7%, your final is 1.07*0.93 = 0.9951, less than the amount you initially put in.</p>

              <p>Putting in a foreign account, you are still exposed to the long-run risks of the currency market. You never know which way the currency is going to go. Lucky you earn. Unlucky (eg suddenly get sub-prime crisis, etc), then you lose.</p>

              <p>thats right, why should we lend money to banks who use it to invest for themselves?</p>
              <p>I will leave them some little money just enough for me to withdraw from ATM for daily expense purposes.</p>
              <p>I will put  majority of my money in foreign bank or any secure bank for 1 year to try and use internet banking to do money transfers. Even CitiBank and Other Great Foreign Banks that are more international are opening retail banks here and provide ATM machine also.</p>
              <p>Thus, Given the INFLATION and LOW LOW SUPER LOW LOW interest given by local banks for savings and FD, there is really no need to owe them in the way of lending their boss my money for them to use at their owns in ways they choose and like and fancy.</p>
              <p>No body owes them nothing. This is lesson learnt from life in the PORE. We really do not owe them anything. Their happiness. If we continue to leave money there, they continue to enjoy at my expense. Only when they give higher interest surpassing the inflation by 2 percent then only i may consider. Else, there is really no reason to put into FD and savings account except for ATM purposes. If no need use cheque, then close the current account.</p>
              <p>This is to make our local banks better. Let them realise they must not be complacent. Complacency has cost poreans and the pore a lot of reputation loss and money loss and resources loss and most importantly my face is lost in front of foreigners.</p>
              <p>that money cannot compensate.</p>
