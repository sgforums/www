Owners of property need to see your employment pass, work permit or student pass before they will rent out their rooms. The laws in Singapore are very strict with regard to harbouring of illegal immigrants. Owners of flats, apartments or landed houses face mandatory jail and caning for not instituting proper checks on immigration status of foreigners renting rooms from them. In the case of public Housing Board (HDB) flats, such flats are confiscated. " </span></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">From extracts of the</span> <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/reports/public/hansard/full/20041116/20041116_HR.html" rel="nofollow">Parliamentary Debates - Official Report of Tenth Parliament</a><span style="color: darkred;">, the concern of MPs and NMPs were expressed on the severity of the proposed Amendments to the Law being passed through Parliament. </span><br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani:</strong><br>"Next, Sir, I am also concerned that the new section 57(7C) does not state that in doing the three checks, it is sufficient.  It states that a defendant, who is charged, shall not be deemed to have exercised due diligence, unless he has discharged the three checks.  To prove due diligence, he must prove that he has done the three checks.  But the question is:  if he has done the three checks, is that enough?  It seems not so.  Looking at the new section 57(1)(v), under this section, he may still be liable for the new minor offence.  This seems to place a heavy burden on potential landlords. They are told what to do and yet, they do not know whether what they do is enough.  I would suggest that once the defendant has proven the three checks, the burden of proof shifts back to the prosecution to show lack of due diligence.  This would make the duty of the landlord more certain.<br><br>I have a similar view as regards the intermediate offence, where the defendant proves two out of three checks.  While I welcome the concept of this intermediate offence, I thought that the shifting of proof back to the prosecution mechanism would establish greater certainty. "<br><br><strong>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</strong><br><br>"Sir, the new section 11A imposes on persons who have ceased to be a citizen of Singapore to leave Singapore within 24 hours after he ceases to be a citizen of Singapore.  Why such a harsh timeline?  The Controller of Immigration should allow at least 14 days for the non-citizen to organise his life and make necessary arrangements for him to leave Singapore.  These are the people who are going to migrate and it is important that they leave Singapore with fond memories or at least very little negative thoughts about our nation.  Any harsh treatment of these people would not assist in them being good ambassadors of Singapore when they are abroad.<br><br>The punishment seems to be very harsh.  Why should we want to send him to prison and, worse still, cane him for such an offence?  The modern trend in punishment is to try and avoid any form of caning to be imposed by a court of law.  Caning may be contrary to the modern trend in human rights.  Caning should not be a form of punishment in our modern world.  The sentencing system should be less harsh and I submit that imprisonment as a form of punishment should suffice. " </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to the research which is actually the link which you provided on your first page, updated on August 2006, states that the canings offences does not include renting out house to undesirables. I can understand why you find that the offence of renting out houses is a cane-able offence, but I think given the more informative authority from the 2 websites is seems that renting out houses to undesirables is not a cane-able offence. Perhaps it will be enlightened to show the relevant passage on the singapore statues online.
