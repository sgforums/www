            <div class='col-md body'>It seem our distinquished judges think that imposing flogging is just a question of number of strokes.It is very easy for them to say 3, 10  or 24 strokes.Do they know what they have imposed on a person?<br><br>Of course,the more serious the offence, the more the number of stokes of floggings. But can u imagine imposing 24 strokes )the maximum allowed under the law)?If there is no limit, i think our judges may impose 100 stokes!<br><br>Since flogging is such a cruel punishment,as long as the criminal given a few strokes of cane,i believe it should be sufficient punishment for crimianls.What is the purpose of imposing large number of  strokes?<br><br>For example,stepdad raped his stepdaughter twice,he was give the maximum 24 strokes of cane &amp; 24 years of impriosnment.If there is a person raped his daughter 5 times,how many stokes of canes our judges think is needed?</div>

They swelled to twice their normal size. I could not sit down or lie on my back. I couldn't even walk properly. The skin on (my) buttocks peeled off and (my) backside was completely bruised. It bled on and off for days [...] (I had to) put on an apron for about ten days as I could not wear shorts. (I was) also unable to sit. Immediately after the caning (I had to lie on my) stomach for about four hours. For two hours (I even had) difficulty standing up [...] Going to the toilet was the worst [...] you don't dare to squat because you may tear open the wounds again. So you try to do it half sitting and half squatting" ("Jack" - 20 strokes).<br><br>"I stumbled to an adjacent room and plonked myself down. For the next three weeks (I) slept with my face down. (I) could neither eat or sleep properly. For the first week, I couldn't even sleep. The pain was unbearable. It took more than a month for the wounds to dry. My buttocks didn't look normal after that, with the skin drooping and the scars" (Sam - 15 strokes).<br><br>"(After the caning) I couldn't sit down or lie on my back for a week. (Going to the toilet) was the worst of all [...] I could not squat or even bend my knees. I got scared every time I got the urge [...] I tried not eating but this did not work. I still had to go and I had to do this standing up, holding my buttocks wide apart. (This lasted) one week then things came back to normal" (Ah Seng - 5 strokes).<br><br>"The wounds take between a week and a month to heal. During that time many cannot sit or sleep on their backs and dare not bathe for fear of getting sores. The wounds heal but the marks are indelible. The caners are supposed to be so skilful that they never hit the same spot twice" (Sunday Times, Singapore, 13 July 1986).<br><br>"My buttocks swelled a little bit [...] the wounds hurt for about five days after which they itched as they healed. The first couple of days it was very hard to sit. Now on one side there are three dark brown scar patches on my right buttock, and four lines each about 1.2cm wide on my left buttock, where the flesh was torn" (Michael Fay - 4 strokes).</span></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">If anyone believe that caning is similar to corporal punishment in schools, think  again about the judicial caning in Singapore that frighten even the best known hard core criminals who will plead for a longer jail term in lieu of caning.<br><br>Judicial caning is a cruel and necessary means of dealing with criminals, but the Singapore Government is abusing this process designed to deal with criminals, by taking the easiest route to solve other mundane issues in subjecting ordinary citizens to this cruel punishment.<br><br>Ordinary citizens can be subject to caning for the simplest offense - such as an innocent home owner who is blindsided by unscrupulous housing agent to rent rooms to illegal workers; company directors made liable for the shoddy work of  his managers for overlooking the immigration papers in employing foreign workers, and any other similar breaches of a multitude of Singapore laws that are designed to entrap Singaporeans into obedient and subservient citizens.</span><br><br></div>

They are not as innocent as you think. Someone who does not ask to inspect the work permits is passively allowing illegal workers.<br><br>The law has achieved its purpose. Jail does not scare anyone but the threat of caning has greatly reduced the incidence of such cases. Making Singaporeans obey the law is not entrapment..it's the duty of all citizens.</div>
