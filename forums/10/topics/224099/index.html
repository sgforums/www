This is what a Foreign talent said....</strong></span></span><br><br>Extracts from Todayonline.<br><br>Give foreign talent equal dues<br><br>Letter from ROBYN M SPEED<br><br>I REFER to the report, Â“Permanent Residents debate price of citizenshipÂ”,<br><br>(Dec 5).<br><br>One might argue that Singapore citizens in other countries should not be entitled to the same benefits as the citizens of those countries. It is only fair that they pay full health costs and pay more for education.<br><br>If they want the same treatment as citizens, they should take up citizenship in that country. It should not matter if Singaporeans have been living in Australia, New Zealand, or the United States for a decade or more Â— they should not get the same rights as the citizens. They should expect to pay more.<br><br>It is only fair. Right?<br><br>I bet you would say no; that if you do the work, you should get fair and equal treatment. Yet, that is what Singapore wants to do to foreigners here.<br><br>You want the top professionals in the world to come and work here, to build Singapore as the top research place in the world, the top education hub. Yet you want to hold them distant, to treat them as second to the locals.<br><br>Surely these foreigners are working for Singapore and her citizens, to build your country and economy, to add to your markets and prestige.<br><br>Some come here, with their families, for career opportunities. They pay rent at the market rate for a condo apartment, their children attend an international school (because they want a sense of continuity for their childrenÂ’s education). Add up these costs and they are paying a lot of money, while supporting SingaporeÂ’s economy.<br><br>Why do these foreign employees come here? Because the employer decided that they were the best person for the job.<br><br>Singapore is a small country and it is difficult for anyone to have the same experience as a worker who has travelled the world, worked in massive markets and learnt from the top people in their fields.<br><br>I am an expat. We all have a bond with our homeland and to turn oneÂ’s back on it is considered to be almost despicable by many. Our homeland is our home in the world Â— you cannot lightly ask a person to give that up.<br><br>Singapore wants to be an international hub of research, education, tourism and so on. And yet, this latest move smacks of:<br><br>Â“You are welcome to come, but Â… Â”.<br><br>Foreigners are either welcome or they are not.<br><br>And beware, for there are always other markets for these people to go to.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cost vs Value?<br><br>I was listening to NewsRadio 93.8FM today. They mentioned something about Singaporeans examining the cost of their citizenship against the value of citizenship.<br><br>Well we all know what the big "cost" is to most Singaporean males. National Service. Just those two words remain a huge sticking point in the locals vs foreign=talent debate.<br><br>Of course the government has now responded to our good citizens.<br><br>All this while we the citizens kept asking, what is the value of our citizenship? (we all know the costs already) We ask, "Isn't the value of our citizenship the same as that of a Singapore PR?"<br><br>And what does our good government do? They think about it for a long time and then decide that to appease us citizens, they will raise the cost of being a foreigner.<br><br>I mean they could have increased the value of our citizenship. But no, they choose to raise the cost of being a foreigner.<br><br>No wonder the foreigners are angry now. Well here's what I would like to say to the foreigners : "Welcome to Singapore! Now you know how it feels to be a true Singaporean!"<br><br>Don't you know that this is how our country works? Everything is about increasing costs. ( One wonders where all that increased revenue collected goes)<br><br>You are not happy because you feel you should be getting more than the other guy? Ok we'll make you happy by making the other guy pay even more than you ok? But no way in hell will we ever make it cheaper for you!<br><br>Cost vs value. Dear government, how about increasing the value of the citizenship for a change? Take the carrot approach. Make the foreigners feel they can gain MORE VALUE than they have now as foreigners rather than INCREASE COSTS for them.<br><br>Perhaps the Ministers still don't get it. Well here's how I think they will definitely understand.<br><br>Instead of raising Minister's salaries every now and then, why not we ask the leaders of other countries to be paid less!<br><br>Or instead of saying we need to peg our salaries to the top 6 earners hence the need to raise Minister's salaries, how about we lower the pay of the top 6 earners every now and then? Get it now? If you still don't get it....sigh.......<br></div>
