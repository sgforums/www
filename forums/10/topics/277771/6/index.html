            <div class='col-md body'>Winning hearts and minds are impt in anything you do, especially if it is politics.<br><br>Look at Chiam See Tong. Why has he held on to the Potong Pasir for so long, despite PAP seemingly doing everything they can to win back the ward? Or Low Thia khiang for that matter. They let their actions speak for themselves. They improve their wards, and in the process improve the lives of those who lived in Hougang and Potong Pasir. That's why the majority of them continue to support these 2 men. 50 years down the road, when people write about these opposition figures, these 2 men would be praise for the fact they fought the PAP with their brains and talent, and not because they shouted at the PM in a market in Jurong West.<br><br>As for Chee, we wonder what does he really want to achieve with what he is doing. If he wants to bring democracy to the people through his methods, then all i can say is democracy is drifting away from us further and further.</div>
