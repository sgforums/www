            <div class='col-md body'>Dr Chee, is using a technique that philosophers like Aristotle used, and that is to push the "idea" (in this case, illicit laws and the illicit PAP actions) as far as it can go to understand the full consequences of the ideas (and in this case, expose the full consequences of the illicit laws and the illicit PAP actions).</div>

We have never experienced a 100% western civilisation in terms of democracy.  To be fair, we have our own democracy, which I also hope to see improvement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Singaporeans generally could not really appreciate or understand Chee's acts. Myself included.  We think that he is almost like crazy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>But as a human being who respect all views and prefer that all views be heard and debated, I also have some respect for Chee. He is definitely not perfect and so is everyone in the world. But he is contributing to singapore in his own way and only history can judge him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Singapore will forever remain what it is and even grow to become more of what it is today, like it or not unless.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>People like Chee seems to be tackling the problem in an ineffective way.<br>I would think to be more fruitful, both sides need to be able to sit on the table and have a nice discussion with maybe the whole world in a civilised manner. When the whole world is watching, both sides have to be on their toes.  I know, this sounds naive and unrealistic but I appologise. I am not a great speaker nor bombastic one.
