            <div class='col-md body'>I personally do not see anything wrong with what he is doing. If the govt is as wonderful, outstanding without flaws like what they always advertise, then why are they so frighten of letting dissident voice to be heard? Why would they install laws and mechanisms to prevent ppls from crticising them or obstructing the flow of alternative ideas/suggestion? For those that condemn him, ask yourself what have you done to let the voices of hearlanders be heard by the 'power of one'? I have seen many ppls from all walks of life including forummers here, criticising the govt, but come election time, they vote the lightning, for fear of various retributive actions if they voted oppositions. But for Dr. Chee, he is at least many times braver than any of us here. With a good PHD, he could have gotten a good job overseases or perhaps even join the PAP asone of those so called 'post-65 MPs' and become a seat warmer. If his interest is just to become famous, he could do it in many other easier ways, but from the fact that he stayed firm eventhough going to jail for many times, shows a great deal of his character.......<br>For those that say he is working for foreign countries to put down SG lar, he tried to escape SG while bankrupt lar, give what I am abt to say a deeper thought............<br>Why did SPF custom allow Richard Yong and his wife to leave for HongKong when they are prime suspects in the NKF saga. Their photos are well emblazoned on the newspapers for weeks, many ppls already know their face liao and the SG police can actually let him slip pass their immigration filtering system. This shows how 'selective' our SG police is in dealing with these cases.<br>For those who question his character just because he ousted Chiam, listen to this. In the founding era of P4P, the party is made up of many union leaders, blue-collared workers and also the english speaking white collared guys. Lxx, made use of those chinese speaking blue collared grp to secure the support of the heartlanders and when P4P became govt, they accuse the grp as communist and expel them out of SG. Another seldom known fact is that Lxx once worked as English translator for the Japanese during the war years. This in fact speaks great volume of the character and moral integrity of Lxx.....<br>And for Chee letting the international community know of SG's plight= betraying SG. Think of this.......many toursit or expats that worked in SG for extended period of time already know of the 'great deeds' of the 'power of one'. Even if Chee did not raise the issue, many ppls already know that we are living in a pseudo-democratic regime, as we can see of the latest IMF meeting saga.<br>Lastly, perhaps you do not know, Dr. Sun yat sen, the revolutionary that overthrew the Manchus actually drew lots of monetary support from overseases and especially overseases chinese. The armanents and weapons are bought overseases and smuggled via Japan. So by this context, does it mean he is a evil man? Think abt it................</div>

My husband told them, "Well, I am going to prison next week."<br><br>My eldest daughter looked at me and asked, "Is Papa joking or serious?"<br><br>I said, "This government doesn't seem to like your Papa very much, does it?"<br><br>Soon Juan's travel ban resulted from his bankruptcy has effectively made him a prisoner in his own country since 1 April 2006.<br><br>I am partly pleased with the fact that he doesn't need to be constantly traveling and away from the family. At the same time, however, I understand his frustration at not being able to attend meetings overseas, to be there to network with fellow democrats, to make passionate presentations, and to impress upon the international community of the political situation in Singapore.<br><br>Most of the time, the world is rather uninformed of Singapore's authoritarian government and its sophisticated yet repressive controls, despite Singapore being a presumably modern, progressive, rich city-state.<br><br>Even when they know, many prevailing commercial interests tend to out-weigh the prospects of antagonizing the Singapore government that is very much into business itself.
