She can divorce him if she wants to, how do you know she doesn't share the beliefs of her husband and thus stay by his side to support him? How do you know that CSJ is forcing her to stay? What makes you think that Chee didn't offer a "flight" solution to his wife?<br><br>We are all responsible for the choices we make, the fact that she is still by his side, speaks alot of her own strength and resilience.</div>
