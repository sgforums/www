The notion that each citizen matters, and seen to matter, with a real and practical effect on policy feedback from the ground, is too vital to ignore. You need to instil a sense of ownership from within, not via campaigns and talking shop where talk is indeed cheap.<br><br>This, in a nutshell, contributes to the <strong>net national security index</strong> when we measure it in the context on the strength and profile of Singapore in the world map. In Rostow's stages of development, we're slowly creeping towards the final stage of self-actualisation. Ideas and human security probably will form the final parts of a larger security map. We must stay relevant to the world, and certain beliefs or political ideologies seem to be holding this nation back.<br><br>I feel that Chee wants this for Singapore, however, perhaps his methods require tweaking for the layman to understand his motivation.<br></div>
