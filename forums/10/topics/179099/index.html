            <div class='col-md body'>not all muslims lah, just the fanatics.<br>my muslim frens are open minded. they don't care the cartoons.<br><br>the fanatics that riot &amp; issue threats are bullies. Bullies are control freaks. They want to force their will on you, dominate you, humiliate you and make you respect them, treat them preferentially and even fear them. Fear is the fuel of the fanatical bully. He becomes stronger by instilling fear as fire become bigger with gasoline.<br><br>So how would you deal with the bully? The worst thing is to show fear and try to appease him. Your fear and retreat only makes him bolder and he will demand more.</div>
