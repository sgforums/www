            <div class='col-md body'>This is a case of 'every law has its good and bad'. No point arguing because those who say that this law is bad obviously choose to ignore the reason behind this law. Vice versa for those who say it is good.<br><br>It is the same isnt it. When USA attacks IRAQ, all peace lovers say it is wrong. But ask the Kuwaitis and most of them will tell u Iraq deserves it.<br><br>Similarly, if you are a drug trafficker and human rights advocate, you will say this law is wrong but your son is being led into drug abuse by these traffickers, you would support this law.<br><br>So why say?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Pikamaster,<br><br>Finally, men will administer according to men's standards. Only when one day, those who administer laws find themselves in personal circumstances as experienced by the miscreants they then will know more about conscience and compassion in matter of punishments.<br><br>In my view, dealth penalty should be meted out as a last resort as men in different circumstances will react differently when they are in difficulties. Such penalty should be reserved for the perpetrators not to everyone by strict application to acts of commissions or omissions. However, many punishments might well be based on men's own fear such as in the case of illegal immigrants or drugs' dangerous spread in society.<br><br>Presumption of seriousness is only presumption. The fact that drugs have caused extreme suffering is should not be sweeping as to exclude the compassion to men based on circumstances.<br><br>Can anyone really claim that he is perfect and can do no wrong?  A more mature society will perhaps see more light of such compassion. I can see the views of others that laws or harsh laws cannot solve all problems.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>So far none of the supporters have proved the Penalty's Deterrent effect yet. SO are you going to provide statistics that show THAT?</blockquote>I have already shown statistic tat Singapore had achieved very effective control of drug in.. I guess page 7 of this thread. Compared with the days where drug traffickers r not hanged, the result is obvious. Tis is so despite the fact tat drug use is on the rise. Wat statistic had u shown tat haning is not deterent ?<br><br><blockquote>The bottom line is, death sentence will not be effective as long as the profit from trafficking will be able to compensate for the risk to smuggling drugs into Singapore. </blockquote>The bottomline is, we had made drug trafficking to be TAT much harder. Drug traffickers r HARDER to find, trips to sell drug have to be made more regular, difficulty in smuggling drugs have been made much lesser. Overall the drug abuse problem has been made much lesser. DO u know wat i am saying ?<br><br><blockquote>You smoke...you cant stop now can you? Fair enough. Suppose you had been educated differently, there is a good chance that you wouldnt have started in the first place. Youre in australia. You KNOW that the people in australia have a better knowledge about drugs than the people of singapore. whys that? its not word on the street (it is to an extent) - its whats taught in schoools. </blockquote>U talk about education here and there, but when asked on how to improve the education here u r speechless. Wat is the difference between education on drugs different in Australia compared with here ?<br><br><blockquote>Uh huh...that report said that the potential was there. Oh fuk! shieet...lets BAN water. Ecstacy CAN kill. Water CAN kill TOO. You just drink enough water to exceed your kidney's ability to process it, causing extracellular osmolality to fall resulting in cellular oedema, including cerebral oedema, which CAN be fatal. Yay...its just the fact that it CAN... </blockquote>Com'on man, don;t be childish.. obviously the risk is MUCH MUCH greater than dinking water. U drink water wat is the probability u will die ? 0.000000000001 perhaps. Wa is the probability u will die or suffer health ailments from taking esctasy ? 1%. Wat is the difference. Perhaps a billion times ?<br><br><blockquote>Well...if we HAD TO HAVE A DEALTH PENALTY FOR SOMEONE (and im saying we dont...but supposing we HAD to)...I'd give it to tobacco companies before i gave it to dealers. Make sense? </blockquote>No. Because the harmful effects of cigerrettes is much leser compared with other drugs. U want to look at effects u look at all the repurcussion of it, not just look at the ease of addiction. All the harmful effects of cigerrettes r present in majuana. However majuana/heroin/cocaine had more undesirable effects than cigerrettes.<br><br><blockquote>If you havent realized where im going yet, my point is: WHY THE F*** CAN CIGARETTE COMAPANIES SELL TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND GET AWAY WITH IT LAWFULLY, WHEN PEOPLE DEALING WITH "ILLICIT" SUBSTANCES GET SHOT</blockquote>Why ? because cigerrettes have been here for thousands of years. It was never placed to be illegal when it first come out and after so many years. It is impossible to ban it. But drugs r new, and they come out only with the last century. We can control tis if we make an effort now. Furthermore drug r more deadly and harm society more than cigerrettes. So in your scenario, u want to make ALL drugs legal just because cigerrettes r legal ? So u will be more happy if u see more people got hooked to drugs so tat they can be a brain damaged free person ?<br><br><blockquote>Do you know who makes substances 'illicit' and 'legal'? Er...lets think about that for a sec...maybe THE GOVERNMENT? Oh damn...so technically, the government is also a drug trafficker (indirectly) because they allow the sale of tobacco. </blockquote>Singapore had followd the guidelines from United Nation. AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION. And MOST countries abided with its guidelines on WHICH drugs to banned. U want to complain, then complain to UN lor.. it is nothing similar to small few countries<br><br><blockquote>The sad thing is, many people seem to be throwing away their Gods for teh god of vengeance, more an avatar anyway... </blockquote>In case u had not read it before, YOUR BIBLE SUPPORT DEATH PENALTY. Only those who wish to throw away death penalty is throwing away their god.<br><br><blockquote>subject is an 18year old female going thru the A-levels right now... </blockquote>So u r just using 1 singaporean to set the view of 4 millions of its citizen ? I am one singaporean as well, and I believe tat the education has been done up till my expectations. SO 1 against one makes it null ? Why don't u just tell us how further to educate the people ? Why avoid tis question for so long ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those illicit drugs are banned for a very good reason. They result in mind altering episodes which results in danger to self and danger to others. Nicotine doesn't mind alter , like cannabis/heroin/cocaine/meth(speed) , so there is no comparison .<br><br>Smoking results in lung cancer. Illicit drugs  can result in social problems of a bigger magnitude (stealing for drugs , homocidal paranoia etc). Don't tell me what you know about how it works - unless you have tried them . I've seen the human results of what those illicit drugs can do in australia and frankly I wish they have the death penalty for drug traffickers in australia as well .<br><br>If any of you wish to pity the drug traffickers and their sob stories, by all means do so. They do not earn my pity ....not even if it is for their dying grandpa/ma/kid/sibling/parents who needs money for surgery , at the expense of other people.<br><br>I will never empathise with drug traffickers, in fact I despise them.  I looked at all the australian families whose loved ones are drug users - who came in because while they were high , how they endangered the life of other people and jeopardised their own.<br><br>I don't make way for the bible in this argument - I only look back at those victims and their families to feel such a way for the death penalty</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Gazelle,<br><br>If we are to discuss this topic reasonably we need to keep to the points which are:-<br><br>1) Do you think that Singapore should soften its law on drugs abuser (especially those who do contribute to our society)?<br><br>2) Do you think it is right for our government to execute them?<br><br>a) Marx Oh Wee Chee, 31, a director of events management company Zero<br>Event Concepts.<br>b) Tunisian Guiga Lyes Ben Laroussi, 35, marketing manager at Bobby<br>RubinoÂ’s restaurant and his girlfriend<br>c) Mariana Abdullah, 24<br><br>3) Will the ex. High Court judgeÂ’s son, Dinesh Singh Bhatia, 34, get away with a lighter sentence?<br><br>I think there will be no point in discussing this topic f we are to base our arguments on "laws have its good or bad", "drug traffickers cause great harms to society and need to be executed to protect the innocent" or "it depends on perceptions of the harms or risks" etc.<br><br>To keep to reasonable discussion, let us examine whether death penalty meted out to those in possession of 20 grams of hard drug is excessive or notoriously too drastic.<br><br>If we are to recall how this death penalty came to be imposed, we might see the perspective and from there gain a better understanding whether such penalty is excessive.<br><br>When Singapore imposed death sentence on drug trafficker of such a small quantum of drug possession, it was facing grave problems of widespread addictions leading many social problems as posted by many. As a result of such death penalty, we might have solved our drug problems or subdued them at the expense of those who unfortunately were found in possessions of 20 grams for whatever reasons or circumstances.<br><br>Not many people are interested to know about the personal circumstances of those people who were hang. But not too many countries are following our heavy-handed punishment system. If so, prima facie, there is a case to examine whether our particular insistence on death to drug pushers might be overboard.<br><br>It will be interesting to see how many countries or percentages of countries have followed our death penalty prescription for drug trafficking. If they had done so, have they succeeded in weeding out the addiction or trafficking. If they had after introducing death penalty, then there may be some argument in favour of death penalty but alternatives like education can still be looked into.<br><br>To illustrate the possibility of alternative, reference was made incidentally to god and bible. This has drawn out some pros and cons as many people have different views about god's attitude to punishment.<br><br>To my mind, god reserves death penalty to the worst crime like murder not not necessarily drug possession. Examples showing god had preferred dishing out death penalty may be unrelated to drug case we are discussing.<br><br>So again, I agree illustrating god's attitude to compassion may not be rational and objective for discussions.<br><br>The only point to my mind worth mentioning about god perhaps is that god did not seem to be in great anxiety to impose death penalty for crimes other than wilful murders. Bibles or Korans I believe advocate compassion for human mistakes or lack of rationality. After all to err is human and to forgive divine.<br><br>Is an amount of 20 gram too small an amount to equate to wilfulness in murdering someone. Should our punishment system befit the crimes based on wilfulness as well as actus. Are runners or desperate people who made mistakes due to extremely unfortunate circumstances worth granting them an opportunity to turn over a new leaf as they may be driven by desperation or circumstances to turn to crimes but not the perpetrators who often are someone else.<br><br>The real culprits are often the masterminds who are often rich and powerful individuals wilfully committing major crimes. Try to deter this group of perpetrators in cooperation with international agencies and hunt down such people instead of fixing the penalty of death on proxies.<br><br>If crimes cannot be solved easily because the profits are high or dangers are grave, does it follow that punishment should increase correspondingly then? If the answer is no then should the 20 gram threshold amount be reduced to say 5 - 10 grams?<br><br>If the answer to this logical question is yes then we will be basing punishment on veangence as pointed by pikamaster. Is this what we want of our society - veangence and more veangence on various grounds.<br><br>Therefore, I feel that there is a case that death penalty to deter drug possessor of 20 grams may be too harsh. Those who insist that society is at risk may not be advancing logical arguments to support the status quo of death penalty.<br><br>The least that should be done is to conduct further study to see if death is too harsh a penalty for possessor and on top of this, it might not lead to solution of this international problem.<br><br>It may be a case of chicken and egg to assert that the only way to go is to make it extremely deterrent as drug trafficking is indeed too dangerous. It may be a case of drug being so heavily punished that drug masterminds would be justified to push up the street values higher and higer giving lucrative incentives thereby due to heavy penalty to breed more trafficking. Perhaps, there is a case to further study and review along this practical line instead of just insisting on status quo punishments. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

As explicitly formulated, the precept "You shall not kill" is strongly negative: it indicates the extreme limit which can never be exceeded. Implicitly, however, it encourages a positive attitude of absolute respect for life; it leads to the promotion of life and to progress along the way of a love which gives, receives and serves. The people of the Covenant, although slowly and with some contradictions, progressively matured in this way of thinking, and thus prepared for the great proclamation of Jesus that the commandment to love one's neighbour is like the commandment to love God; "on these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets" (cf. Mt 22:36-40). Saint Paul emphasizes that "the commandment ... you shall not kill ... and any other commandment, are summed up in this phrase: ?You shall love your neighbour as yourself' " (Rom 13:9; cf. Gal 5:14). Taken up and brought to fulfilment in the New Law, the commandment "You shall not kill" stands as an indispensable condition for being able "to enter life" (cf. Mt 19:16-19). In this same perspective, the words of the Apostle John have a categorical ring: "Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him" (1 Jn 3:15).<br><br>From the beginning, the living Tradition of the Church-as shown by the Didache, the most ancient non-biblical Christian writing-categorically repeated the commandment "You shall not kill": "There are two ways, a way of life and a way of death; there is a great difference between them... In accordance with the precept of the teaching: you shall not kill ... you shall not put a child to death by abortion nor kill it once it is born ... The way of death is this: ... they show no compassion for the poor, they do not suffer with the suffering, they do not acknowledge their Creator, they kill their children and by abortion cause God's creatures to perish; they drive away the needy, oppress the suffering, they are advocates of the rich and unjust judges of the poor; they are filled with every sin. May you be able to stay ever apart, o children, from all these sins!". 42<br><br>As time passed, the Church's Tradition has always consistently taught the absolute and unchanging value of the commandment "You shall not kill". It is a known fact that in the first centuries, murder was put among the three most serious sins-along with apostasy and adultery-and required a particularly heavy and lengthy public penance before the repentant murderer could be granted forgiveness and readmission to the ecclesial community.<br><br>55. This should not cause surprise: to kill a human being, in whom the image of God is present, is a particularly serious sin. Only God is the master of life! Yet from the beginning, faced with the many and often tragic cases which occur in the life of individuals and society, Christian reflection has sought a fuller and deeper understanding of what God's commandment prohibits and prescribes. 43 There are in fact situations in which values proposed by God's Law seem to involve a genuine paradox. This happens for example in the case of legitimate defence, in which the right to protect one's own life and the duty not to harm someone else's life are difficult to reconcile in practice. Certainly, the intrinsic value of life and the duty to love oneself no less than others are the basis of a true right to self-defence. The demanding commandment of love of neighbour, set forth in the Old Testament and confirmed by Jesus, itself presupposes love of oneself as the basis of comparison: "You shall love your neighbour as yourself " (Mk 12:31). Consequently, no one can renounce the right to self-defence out of lack of love for life or for self. This can only be done in virtue of a heroic love which deepens and transfigures the love of self into a radical self-offering, according to the spirit of the Gospel Beatitudes (cf. Mt 5:38-40). The sublime example of this self-offering is the Lord Jesus himself.<br><br>Moreover, "legitimate defence can be not only a right but a grave duty for someone responsible for another's life, the common good of the family or of the State".44 Unfortunately it happens that the need to render the aggressor incapable of causing harm sometimes involves taking his life. In this case, the fatal outcome is attributable to the aggressor whose action brought it about, even though he may not be morally responsible because of a lack of the use of reason. 45<br><br>56. This is the context in which to place the problem of the death penalty. On this matter there is a growing tendency, both in the Church and in civil society, to demand that it be applied in a very limited way or even that it be abolished completely. The problem must be viewed in the context of a system of penal justice ever more in line with human dignity and thus, in the end, with God's plan for man and society. The primary purpose of the punishment which society inflicts is "to redress the disorder caused by the offence".46 Public authority must redress the violation of personal and social rights by imposing on the offender an adequate punishment for the crime, as a condition for the offender to regain the exercise of his or her freedom. In this way authority also fulfils the purpose of defending public order and ensuring people's safety, while at the same time offering the offender an incentive and help to change his or her behaviour and be rehabilitated. 47<br><br>It is clear that, for these purposes to be achieved, the nature and extent of the punishment must be carefully evaluated and decided upon, and ought not go to the extreme of executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society. Today however, as a result of steady improvements in the organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not practically non-existent.<br><br>In any event, the principle set forth in the new Catechism of the Catholic Church remains valid: "If bloodless means are sufficient to defend human lives against an aggressor and to protect public order and the safety of persons, public authority must limit itself to such means, because they better correspond to the concrete conditions of the common good and are more in conformity to the dignity of the human person".48<br><br>..................<br><br></span><br><br>So.. do you still wish to misquote scripture?<br><br>the insolent pikamaster<br><br></div>

As a result of such death penalty, we might have solved our drug problems or subdued them at the expense of those who unfortunately were found in possessions of 20 grams for whatever reasons or circumstances.<br><br>Not many people are interested to know about the personal circumstances of those people who were hang. But not too many countries are following our heavy-handed punishment system. If so, prima facie, there is a case to examine whether our particular insistence on death to drug pushers might be overboard.<br><br>It will be interesting to see how many countries or percentages of countries have followed our death penalty prescription for drug trafficking. If they had done so, have they succeeded in weeding out the addiction or trafficking. If they had after introducing death penalty, then there may be some argument in favour of death penalty but alternatives like education can still be looked into.<br><br>To illustrate the possibility of alternative, reference was made incidentally to god and bible. This has drawn out some pros and cons as many people have different views about god's attitude to punishment.<br><br>To my mind, god reserves death penalty to the worst crime like murder not not necessarily drug possession. Examples showing god had preferred dishing out death penalty may be unrelated to drug case we are discussing.<br><br>So again, I agree illustrating god's attitude to compassion may not be rational and objective for discussions.<br><br>The only point to my mind worth mentioning about god perhaps is that god did not seem to be in great anxiety to impose death penalty for crimes other than wilful murders. Bibles or Korans I believe advocate compassion for human mistakes or lack of rationality. After all to err is human and to forgive divine.<br><br>Is an amount of 20 gram too small an amount to equate to wilfulness in murdering someone. Should our punishment system befit the crimes based on wilfulness as well as actus. Are runners or desperate people who made mistakes due to extremely unfortunate circumstances worth granting them an opportunity to turn over a new leaf as they may be driven by desperation or circumstances to turn to crimes but not the perpetrators who often are someone else.<br><br>The real culprits are often the masterminds who are often rich and powerful individuals wilfully committing major crimes. Try to deter this group of perpetrators in cooperation with international agencies and hunt down such people instead of fixing the penalty of death on proxies.<br><br>If crimes cannot be solved easily because the profits are high or dangers are grave, does it follow that punishment should increase correspondingly then? If the answer is no then should the 20 gram threshold amount be reduced to say 5 - 10 grams?<br><br>If the answer to this logical question is yes then we will be basing punishment on veangence as pointed by pikamaster. Is this what we want of our society - veangence and more veangence on various grounds.<br><br>Therefore, I feel that there is a case that death penalty to deter drug possessor of 20 grams may be too harsh. Those who insist that society is at risk may not be advancing logical arguments to support the status quo of death penalty.<br><br>The least that should be done is to conduct further study to see if death is too harsh a penalty for possessor and on top of this, it might not lead to solution of this international problem.<br><br>It may be a case of chicken and egg to assert that the only way to go is to make it extremely deterrent as drug trafficking is indeed too dangerous. It may be a case of drug being so heavily punished that drug masterminds would be justified to push up the street values higher and higer giving lucrative incentives thereby due to heavy penalty to breed more trafficking. Perhaps, there is a case to further study and review along this practical line instead of just insisting on status quo punishments. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>What I can say is that Singaporeans should not always think all drug user are criminals. For example, there are many people whom I met in cities like Paris, London, New York, Amsterdam, Barcelona, do smoke weed and if you talk to them, most are intelligent, peace loving people and are very philosophical about life. Some whom I met are bankers, lawyers, musician, artist and people from all walks of life. Personally I feel that talking to some of these drug users are more interesting and enriching than talking to typical Singaporeans who only like to talk about food, career, and other material stuff.<br><br>What I really dislike about the law in Singapore is that they discriminate people who are different. For example, when you see someone with long hair, many will refer them as "gangster", and that is part of the reason why majority of Singaporeans are typical Singaporeans, just like a product coming out of the same mould.<br><br>With regards to drug law in Singapore, what I personally feel is the Singapore as a society have matured a lot faster than our counterpart in Malaysia or Indonesia, and I believe we are matured enough to start making their own decision in life. Unlike what some former say that if you show drugs to Singaporeans, they will take it and become an addict. I think that kind of perception is absolutely RUBBISH and CHILDISH.<br><br>Do I think that death sentence is effect to control the drug situation here? IMHO, No!!.<br><br>First we have to understand that part of the reason why Singapore has managed to controlled drugs trafficking better than other neighboring countries is because of our size and border. Unlike countries where they are separated by land, Singapore is surrounded by sea and the only way you can bring drugs into Singapore is through causeway, airport and ferry terminal. If we can ensure that we have watertight security at these places, Singapore drug problem will not worsen without the cruel death sentence.<br><br>There has been a lot of talk by fellow forumers that death sentence is the "ONLY" way that we can control the problem in Singapore. If that is true, why isnÂ’t there any report or studies specifically proof that death sentence is a full proof way deter criminal and drug offence. And why are there so many countries that oppose it? DonÂ’t forget, most developed countries do have to pay for their country medical bill and welfare, and they are the same people that oppose the use of death sentence.<br><br>As for the chance of people turning over a new leaf, I would like to quote Bill Clinton as an example. Bill was once a drug user when he was a teenage and the same guy eventually became the president of world most powerful nation. I would like to know if the same can happen in Singapore? IMHO, the answer is NO WAY!! Is actually goes to show that our society are against people who are more "adventurous" in life.<br><br></div>

Punishment has the primary aim of redressing the disorder introduced by the offense. When it is willingly accepted by the guilty party, it assumes the value of expiation.
