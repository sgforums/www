Trafficking beyond a prescribed limit should not entail a death sentence, since it has not worked at all.Drugs are more lethal than other substances, but we should never fall into the trap of being the ones that pull the trapdoor,nor the ones that tie the noose.Those are just excuses for a state which does not value life enough to want to reform, and barring any success, not just to kill these people off.Sad but true.</div>

Overly protected children are like domesticated cats and dogs, and they are the one that will suffer when they are put into the wild (or go overseas)<br><br>As for your wish that ALL drugs will stay out of the country, i believe it can only be a wish at best. Singapore is a country where we receive about 8 million foreign visitors annually, and close to 1 million of our population are foreigners. Beside that you have to consider that PSA handle about 30 million TEU containers ever year and Changi Airport handle 2 million tons of air cargo per year. How would you expect our authority be sure that none of the above is carrying drugs in to Singapore?<br><br>Drug traffickers are sons and daughters of people just like you and me, and I think it is cruel for to say that we should hang them to protect our children. As it has already been proven through the years that death sentence has diminishing effect to deter drug trafficking<br></div>

It's pretty bad if you asked me.<br><br><strong>I would any day prefer living in Singapore where laws protect our children and family then anywhere else in the world.</strong>[/quote]<br>So youd rather your children have sweetshitfuckall morals and cage them up, rather than let them run around with good decent morals that you can trust?<br><br>If you help a butterfly out of its cocoon, or if you help a chick out of its shell, they usually die or dont form properly.  Exposure to bad things is part and parcel of life - you cant just block it out.  You'll do more harm than good.  What we want to be doing, is to teach kids well, so that we can trust them when we're not around.  If i had kids, i really wouldnt care if they were to parties where drugs + alcohol were rampant because<br>1) they'd know whats right and whats wrong<br>2) its part of growing up - you do stupid things, and learn from them<br>3) because if i told them not to do it (at all), id be a hypocrite.<br><br>of course i dont want my kids abusing the crap out of drugs, but if they tell me theyve tried something once or twice every now and then, id rather that than have them caged and chanined up and 'sheltered' from the world.  Its a harsh place, people have to learn - you cant shelter them for their whole life.  It's easy in Singapore i suppose, because its so small, but realistically speaking, it wont work elsewhere.<br><br>I'm going to the bank to rob my account, then Orchard Road...woohoo...shoopppping.<br></div>

Its just retarded...maybe someone needs to TEACH THE BLOODY PUBLIC properly, because if one doesnt know that pissing in a lift is really filthy, they should just shoot themselves.<br><br>While you're at that, think about this:  Singapore is small.  Singapore has no natrual resources.  Singapore has man power (ie intelligence).  But if Singaporeans love pissing in lifts and putting chewing gum on trainlines, they must be bloody god damn stupid.  A stupid person in singapore, is not going to have a job, and they're family will get affected, and their perspective of self respect and such will probably go down the drain.  In that case, because they (1)cant find a job because they're stupid (2)affect they're family because they have no income (3) dont think highly of themselves...lets just shoot them too because they are stupid and are just wasting precious space.<br><br>Also, to stupiddissmart - the first headline i read in the straits times yesterday when i arrived in singapore was some bs about them reviewing the way they teach chinese.  Its MANDARIN...a MAJOR LANGUAGE SUBJECT.  If they cant get that right - do you think they can get the intricate methods of educating peoples "inner self" and come up with a decent method for demonstrating morals etc?<br><br>rant over.<br>excuse any personal remarks.  its soooooo HUMID here its annoying.<br><br>going shopping now.</div></blockquote>We have anal-retentive people running the show.It is very obvious.And lots of things here are done for the sake of "wayang" and are superficial, not to mention short-sighted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you dislike something about a nation you have certain ties for, you will tend to be critical and reach out to her citizens in order to make or effect a change for the better.There are a lot of issues in Singapore which are not nice, nor are they effective or representative of intelligent life.Loyalty to one's country does not mean an automatic obedience and unflinching promotion of our government's policies.The flaws are there, and we need to do something about it.Confronting the issue on the death penalty at least lets all of us have our say, and to oppress others for their beliefs is wrong.Attack his arguments if you wish, but please let's not degrade ourselves to the level of those who would use lawsuits liberally to silence any voice that they deem has made them lose "face".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Supreme Court to weigh medical marijuana laws<br>Plaintiff calls it a life-and-death issue<br><br>Friday, November 26, 2004 Posted: 1:42 PM EST (1842 GMT)<br><br>OAKLAND, California (AP) --<br>Traditional drugs have done little to help 39-year-old Angel Raich.Beset by a nightmarish list of ailments that includes tumors in her brain and uterus, seizures, spasms and nausea, she has been able to find comfort only in the marijuana that is recommended by her doctor.<br><br>It eases her pain, allows her to rise out of a wheelchair and promotes an appetite that prevents her from wasting away.<br><br>Her Berkeley physician, Frank Lucido, said marijuana "is the only drug of almost three dozen we have tried that works."<br><br>On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that will determine whether Raich and similar patients in California and 10 other states can continue to use marijuana for medical purposes.<br><br>At issue is whether states have the right to adopt laws allowing the use of drugs the federal government has banned or whether federal drug agents can arrest individuals for abiding by those medical marijuana laws.<br><br>California passed the nation's first so-called medical marijuana law in 1996, allowing patients to smoke and grow marijuana with a doctor's recommendation. The Bush administration maintains those laws violate federal drug rules and asserts that marijuana has no medical value.<br><br>"I really hope and pray the justices allow me to live," said Raich as she crammed a blend of a marijuana variety known as "Haze X" into a contraption that vaporized it inside large balloons.<br><br>She said the outcome of the case will determine whether her "husband will have a wife," her "children a mother."<br><br>The case will address questions left unresolved from the first time the high court considered the legality of medical marijuana.<br><br>In 2001, the justices ruled against clubs that distributed medical marijuana, saying they cannot do so based on the "medical necessity" of the patient. The ruling forced Raich's Oakland supplier to close and other cannabis clubs to operate in the shadows.<br><br>The decision did not address whether the government can block states from adopting their own medical marijuana laws.<br><br>Nevertheless, the federal government took the offensive after the ruling, often over the objections of local officials. It began seizing individuals' medical marijuana and raiding their suppliers. Nowhere was that effort more conspicuous than in the San Francisco Bay area, where the nation's medical marijuana movement was founded.<br><br>Raich and Diane Monson, the other plaintiff in the case, sued Attorney General John Ashcroft because they feared their supplies of medical marijuana might dry up. After a two-year legal battle, they won injunctions barring the U.S. Justice Department from prosecuting them or their suppliers.<br><br>"This has been a nightmare," said Monson, a 47-year-old accountant from Oroville whose backyard crop of six marijuana plants was seized in 2002. "I've never sued anyone in my life, never mind the attorney general of the United States of America. For crying out loud, here in California we've voted to allow medical marijuana."<br><br>She regularly uses marijuana on a doctor's recommendation to alleviate back problems. She says it also helps cope with the recent death of her husband, who suffered from pancreatic cancer.<br><br>Last December, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Raich's and Monson's favor. It said federal laws criminalizing marijuana do not apply to patients whose doctors have recommended the drug.<br><br>The appeals court said states were free to adopt medical marijuana laws as long as the marijuana was not sold, transported across state lines or used for non-medicinal purposes. The other states with such laws are Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.<br><br>The court ruled that marijuana for medicinal purposes is "different in kind from drug trafficking" and outside the scope of federal oversight.<br><br>The same court last year said doctors were free to recommend marijuana to their patients. The government appealed, but the Supreme Court justices declined to hear the case.<br><br>In June, however, the justices agreed to hear the Raich-Monson case. A ruling is expected to decide the states' rights issue the court left unanswered in 2001.<br><br>Acting Solicitor General Paul Clement told the justices in briefs that the government, backed by the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, has the power to regulate the "manufacture, distribution and possession of any controlled substance," even if such activity takes place entirely within one state.<br><br>Besides California, the states allowing marijuana to be used as medicine with a doctor's recommendation are Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state.<br><br>Even some states without medical marijuana laws have criticized the federal government's position. Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi told the court they "support their neighbors' prerogative in our federalist system to serve as laboratories for experimentation."<br><br>A number of medical groups, doctors and marijuana supporters also wrote the court, saying marijuana benefits sick patients.<br><br>Raich, whose legal team includes her husband, Robert, said she hopes the chemotherapy Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is undergoing for thyroid cancer "would soften his heart about the issue."<br><br>"I think," she said, "he would find that cannabis would help him a lot."<br><br>The case is Ashcroft v. Raich, case no. 03-1454.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Pikemaster,<br>Anything when taken on overdose would cause damage to the body, like panadol, hamburgers, even tea! Most drugs were obviously medicines, like Marijuana for stress out handicaps, 'speed' was a prescription for memory loss patients, MDMA from Ecstasy was also a medicine, even morphine. Not to mention many others. But like anything, moderation is the key. Ecstasy wouldn't harm a person if you take 1 pill or 2 once in a blue moon for entertainment, but if at 1 shot you take 10, then you probably are asking for it. Same goes for panadol.<br>And as for Marijuana, they haven't detected any side effects yet., according to one of the latest scientific documentary. In fact, the latest medical research has no evidence or claims of side effects to many drugs, even ecstasy, speed, LSD etc... In their report, they can only see result after a person grows old, many years later, which they are still finding, but again, there are too many variables, like the quantity the person took, and if it's once a while or constantly.<br>Talk about it, they did a research on KFC(Kentucky Fried Chicken), an a person ate KFC continously for days, after 1 or 2 weeks, he was suffering from some disease. So KFC is also a drug, why don't they ban it.<br>Simple fact, too much of one thing is bad, and dumb druggies would go too far indeed.<br>When the ads report, they are mostly taking those bad cases and highlighting them, but for too many other normal cases without any problem, they are not going to mention. I have met and got along with numerous drug users overseas, and after years, they are completely as healthy as normal sober people, no bad health, no broken families, nothing. And it's not that they have taken it only since i met them, some had taken since they were 14. But there is one common thing about them, they don't overtake, they take only to relax and chill out when stressed or simply for entertainment. There is that word "Control" on majority average of people.<br>Those who actually die of drug overdose are those heavy weight drugs like Heroine, Cocaine. People like INXS singer, etc etc., for example....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the whole issue of death penalty, be it for drug offences or for murder has always been highly debatable. Many see it as a legitimate form of detering future offences from taking place. But others also see it as a violation of the one's right to live.<br><br>As pointed out by many forum contributers, the death penalty is meant to serve as a deterance to both 'local and foreign traffickers'. But the question of whether it is too harsh a punishment totally misses out the point (at least i think so).<br><br>Students as well as adults have received sufficient, if not abundant, education regarding the harmful effects of drugs, be it in schools or in the media. So it is fair to say that an individual who chose to consume drugs, regardless of what type, is aware of the risks and potential damages. This means that there is deliberation involved before the individual decides whether to consume the drugs or otherwise. Although one can say that peer pressure may influence this decision, the decision is made by the individual themselves.<br><br>But after all the effort the government have made to educate Singaporeans on the harmful effects of drugs, people still believe that it is the responsibility of the government to 'protect' society from being exposed to drug traffickers. Are we therefore turning into a society where we have to be wrapped in cotton to protect us from the 'evils of the world'? Simple laws of economics thus applies: no demand for drugs, no supply of drugs. As simple and possibly naive this statement may sound, it is fortunately true. No drug users were put at knife or gun point when they first consume it.<br><br>I am not saying that the act of drug traffickers are to be condoned. But the death penalty is a blinding barbaric act that achieves little or no effect. Though one may argue that the death penalty may be the reason to account for the relatively low drug consumption in Singapore, it still does not eradicate drug consumption at all.<br><br>The death penalty is murder. It is as simple as that. Why are we moving back to the medieval time by classifying criminals as people who do not deserve their rights to be upheld? Are we becoming more of an arrogant and unsympathetic society? Since the moment the death penalty was implemented, drug trafficking is STILL occuring. Doesnt really say very much about its success, does it?<br><br>What is important is to address the root of the problem. In this case, the motive of the parties trafficking drugs. Though it is often profit motivated, there are circumstances when drug trafficking is seen as an option to escape financial woes in desperate times. Perhaps, more can be done to address to cause of the problem rather than spending tax payer's money supporting jail terms of convicts and the execution of the death penalty itself.<br><br>We are all human, regardless of whether we are convicts, hardworking citizens or even government officials. We are all in no position to determine the fate of another human being. To take away one's life is murder (contestable for euthanasia). The death penalty is no exception.<br><br>To err is human. To forgive, divine. Killing another for their mistake without a giving a chance to make amends is simply barbaric. If there's a fear of the offender commiting the offence again, well, the sentence can be made heavier should they commit the offence again. If all things fail, life imprisonment is always an option.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The death penalty is murder. It is as simple as that. Why are we moving back to the medieval time by classifying criminals as people who do not deserve their rights to be upheld?</blockquote>I believe it is wrong to say tat the death penalty belongs to medieval time. Tis is because from medieval time til now, there is always some country tat impose death penalty till now. Even america, the country deems as the most free and democractic have death penalty in some states. Death penalty is murder ? I believe suicide is a better word since they knowingly choose to commit a crime with death penalty. Jailing is illegal restraint of a person freedom and caning is physical abuse. However it was needed to keep the people in line and protect the innocent. Otherwise everyone will become criminals.<br><br><blockquote>Though one may argue that the death penalty may be the reason to account for the relatively low drug consumption in Singapore, it still does not eradicate drug consumption at all</blockquote>it is not realistic to demand for a zero drug consumtion status in any country. It appears to work in reducing the number of drug consumption, why stop it ?<br><br><blockquote>What is important is to address the root of the problem.

Can u name me a counry with no poor or uneducated people ? Does being poor and uneducated means they r more protected by the law ? Execution in fact saves money for everyone compared with jailing.</div>
