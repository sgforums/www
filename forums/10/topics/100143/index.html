It has already caused all the harmful effects of drugs trafficking. Worse still, they appears to "re-package" drugs into something hip and cause more people to be hooked up to it. I see no reasons why they should be spared.<br><br>Talking about reasons, I heard of better ones. There is a poor chap trying to rake in some money by trafficking for her grandmother medical fees.

Everyone, be it even the poor ,rich and powerful, are subjected to the law equally.<br><br>Drug trafficking is presumed when the possesion of a specific  drug is carried above a certain amount in an individual .<br><br>Now the way I look at the situation :<br>Successful working adults - I assumed that they are educated  - are they not? Even if they are not, it is a common knowledge that the death penalty applies to drug trafficking.<br>They should be aware of the death penalty regarding illegal drugs. They chose to ignore the death penalty by possessing the specific drugs in sufficient amount.<br><br>Doesn't matter if they did it for fun. Doesn't matter if they did it for curiosity. Doesn't matter if they only sold it to 30 people. It only matters that they knew the risk and CHOSE to take the risk. The blood is not on the government's hands - it is on their own hands because they CHOSE to take that path.<br><br>They HAD THE  CHOICE .  No one placed the drugs in their hands at gunpoint. Therefore there is no excuse for them to escape the death penalty.</div>

Perhaps, I should resurrect that thread.<br><br>Your argument on the UDHR is invalid, since I have read it through about 30 times, and I can't find a single statement that provides for the Death Penalty. The statement you provide isn't adequate justification, unless you are saying that murderers aren't humans as well. ANyway, isn't killing murderers still murder, whoever does that? I've always wanted to ask supporters of DP this: Do they condone the murder of a murderer by the family of the victim, or by a friend fo the family acting on their behalf?<br><br>Anyway, the problem with the Drug trafficking Law is that when you preemptively arrest someone for trafficking at Changi Airport, technically there have been no victims yet since he hasn't sold his wares, so there is morally nothing to accuse him on except intent, making it like the situation in "Minority Report".<br><br>I urge you to think carefully.<br><br>the Pikamaster</div>
