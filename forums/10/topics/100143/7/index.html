            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I believe the reason Singapore is save is no longer due to its harsh law and death penalty, but rather our mental development over the years. </blockquote>Really ? Wat has HMI do with anything on drug abuse ? U show us a statistic of HMI and u never link it with drug abuse, isn't it out of point ? Let me help u link HMI with the problem of drug abuse.<br><br>follow the report in<br><br><a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/global_illicit_drug_trends.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/global_illicit_drug_trends.html</a><br><br>u can just look at the executive summary to download.<br><br>Do u know which country suffer the most increase in drug abuse ? It is western Europe and America ! Taking a look at the world map on increase of drug abuse, America and Western Europe scores on Ecstasy, Amphetamin stimulants. They report a large increase of drug abuse in these regions. In fact, western europe have a large increase in drug abuse ranging from cannabis to heroin. The largest amount of drugs seized were from america and western europe ! If u look at HMI index provided bu Gazelle, u wil notice tat there is NO CORELATION between HMI and drug abuse situation. Taking a look at the rate of drug abuse, we can see tat in the region of singapore and malaysia where death penalty is enforced, it reported a reduction in drug abuse for all category of drugs. Looking at tis statistic, we can say tat the laws and regulations do help in reducing the problem of drug abuse. HMI means nothing. Some country with high HMI have successfully reduced drug abuse. However some other countries with high HMI stil face severe drug abuse problem.<br><br><blockquote>Therefore I believe that the effect of abolishing of death penalty on drug offence will not be like what stupidismarts has describe. in fact if we do that, I am sure Singapore will move up another few notches in the HMI index. </blockquote>Sorry man, the statistic do follow wat I described. Punishment must remain harsh to deter potential traffickers and protect the public. When we remove the death penalty, HMI will not sudenly increase. There is no correlation between death penalty with HMI index as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>Will you become a drug addict?</blockquote>The whole world doesn't revolves around u my boy. U won't go into drugs doesn't mean the other people won't.<br><br><blockquote>If a government is corrupted, drugs traffickers will be able to function in Singapore without the fear of being caught or punish. If what you say is true, i would assume that half the world population will be drug addicts by now. Since more countries in this world does not have death penalty for drug offences</blockquote>If wat i say is true, then half of the world is facing drug abuse increase by now. Tis is true according to statistic. Wat has it got to do with corruption ? If a gov is not corrupted, the trafficker still find means and ways to transport drugs to the country.<br><br><blockquote>Drugs only serve to enhance nature's process of selection, the weak-minded ones die out because they need a substance to run their lives and mood swings.Therefore, if they choose to consume, all those that are affected have only themselves to blame for being sucked into the habit.No point bloodying our hands.They made a choice to consume, let their genes be cleansed from our pool, which has seen lotsa scum growing over the years.</blockquote>Com'on man, going by your argument, then surely it is better for society to weed out the drug traffickers isn't it ? DO u think drug trafficker r better than drug taker ? They choose to sell drugs, they choose to harm people, so if they got caught and hanged, they have only themselves to blame. They made a point to sell drugs, then let their genes be clensed from our pool, which has seen lotsa scum growing over the years.<br><br><blockquote>Abolishing the death penalty should not be seen as being lenient toward traffickers but rather trying to be more humane. </blockquote>Being more humane to trafficker is being more lenient towards to them. U r encouraging drug abuse to increase in singapore<br><br><blockquote>Do you think the selling drugs in Singapore can be as easy as selling candy to kids in kindergarden? </blockquote>No, but more drugs means drugs will become more accessible. U will see more people pushing drugs and more people become hooked to them. These people will in turn ask their friends and peers to take drugs as well. In some part of western europe and america, where control of it is lesser, u can really go and buy drugs as easily as u buy... well.. pirated softwares. Can u do tat in singapore ?<br><br><blockquote>Education!! Not color of your skin!!</blockquote>I have said before, it depends on many factors other than education. The legislation is another important factor to consider. It has already been shown tat your assumption tat HMI is correlated with drug abuse is totally wrong.<br><br><blockquote>I didnt know there are so many developed countries that dont have common sense. Are you sure we are so drug free?</blockquote>The comman sense had shown on these countries. In countries where they r lenient with drug trafficker, their drug abuse problems had spiralled out of control.<br><br><blockquote>I think 16 is a more humane age. 14 I would consider that paedophile. </blockquote>The point is we protect public since their intellectual range from 5% to 95% of the population. U cannot expect tat everyone will not choose drugs just because of education.  If education works, then nobody should be smoking.<br><br><blockquote>Will you be able to explain how life will be sacrifice (in high places?) </blockquote>Wat r u talking about ??</div>

However there is no convincing evidence that the death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other punishments. There is always a risk that minor traffickers or vulnerable drug addicts will be executed, while those who mastermind the crime of trafficking evade arrest and punishment.<br><br>In the countries which impose the death penalty for drug offences Amnesty International is aware of no evidence of a decline in drug trafficking which could be clearly attributed to the threat or use of the death penalty. While certain countries have introduced the death penalty for drug offences, its use has been rejected elsewhere. Nigeria abolished the death penalty for drug offences in 1986 after several executions provoked widespread protests. Turkey abolished the death penalty for drug trafficking in 1990 as part of a general reduction in the crimes punishable by death. In Mauritius, where the death penalty for drug trafficking had been introduced in 1986, the section of the law providing for the death penalty was declared unconstitutional in 1992.<br><br>Claiming that the death penalty has been effective in controlling the trade in illicit drugs, the Singapore authorities reported an overall decline in the number of drug abusers arrested between 1994 and 2001.(37) However, despite the use of the death penalty and high execution rates, drug addiction continues to be a problem, particularly among the poorly educated, impoverished, unemployed and young people from broken homes. According to the website of the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), a total of 3,393 drug abusers were arrested in 2002. The number of new drug abusers increased by 16% compared to the figures for 2001. The CNB announced that it had seized 63 kilograms of heroin and 34 kilograms of cannabis during 2002, and also reported a significant increase in the use of methamphetamine. This is despite the fact that the scope of the death penalty was increased in 1998 to introduce a mandatory death sentence for importing, exporting, or trafficking in more than 250 grams of the drug.<br><br>Those convicted of more minor drugs offences also face cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Persistent or so-called "hardcore" drug addicts who have been admitted more than twice to a drugs rehabilitation centre are treated as criminals and may be imprisoned for up to 13 years and sentenced to caning.<br><br>Observers have drawn attention to the need to combat the social conditions which can give rise to drug abuse and addiction, rather than resorting to executions as a solution.<br><br>"The eradication of the supply of drugs is important but equally important is the alleviation of social conditions that encourage would-be traffickers or addicts. The socially excluded young and poor school dropouts are the most affected and drug addictions are disproportionately high among males with poor education... Are we assisting the socially excluded to reintegrate into society or are we disposing them off [sic] as rejects?"

Hundreds of people have been executed since then. The reason that induced to turn to death penalty resides in its presumed deterrent efficaciousness, as it's obvious, against drug traffickers. However, in spite of the numerous executions, there is no convincing evidence that a decrease of drug traffic in interested countries could be attributed to the threat or application of capital punishment.<br>In Iran, executions for drug crimes started before the revolution in 1979. It turns out that, later, over a thousand people have been sentenced to death; and yet drug abuse and trade are still a serious problem, not solved at all.<br>In Malaysia, where death penalty for drug crimes is compulsory since 1983, autorities have more than once publicly acknowledged its ineffectiveness. The general detective inspector affirmed in 1985 that capital punishment didn't seem to have deterrent effects against traffickers; in 1990, the Vice-minister of the Interior affirmed that capital punishment hadn't been able to decrease drug use or traffic and there was the need of a different approach to the problem. The list of the failures could go on.<br>Some international organizations have discussed the matter. The UN thought about the measures to be adopted against drug traffic that:<br><br>On the grounds of many experts' experience, the fact that as utmost punishment there is death penalty doesn't imply necessarily that it has particular effects against drug traffic: as a matter of fact in some cases it could complicate Public Prosecution's activity since law courts need much higher standards of evidence if death penalty is provided (particularly if it's complsory). The most effective deterrent is surely the certainty to be discovered and arrested.<br><br>http://library.thinkquest.org/23685/data/drugs.html<br></div>
