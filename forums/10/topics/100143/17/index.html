Marijuana affects memory, judgment and perception (11). The drug can make you mess up in school, in sports or clubs, or with your friends. If youÂ’re high on marijuana, you are more likely to make stupid mistakes that could embarrass or even hurt you. If you use marijuana a lot, you could start to lose interest in how you look and how youÂ’re getting along at school or work.<br><br>Athletes could find their performance is off; timing, movements, and coordination are all affected by THC. Also, since marijuana can affect judgment and decisionmaking, its use can lead to risky sexual behavior, resulting in exposure to sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.<br><br>Q: What are the long-term effects of marijuana use?<br>A: Findings so far show that regular use of marijuana or THC may play a role in some kinds of cancer and in problems with the respiratory and immune systems.<br><br>Cancer<br>ItÂ’s hard to know for sure whether regular marijuana use causes cancer. But it is known that marijuana contains some of the same, and sometimes even more, of the cancer-causing chemicals found in tobacco smoke. Studies show that someone who smokes five joints per day may be taking in as many cancer-causing chemicals as someone who smokes a full pack of cigarettes every day (15) .<br><br>Lungs and airways<br>Lungs and airwaysÂ—People who smoke marijuana often develop the same kinds of breathing problems that cigarette smokers have: coughing and wheezing. They tend to have more chest colds than nonusers. They are also at greater risk of getting lung infections like pneumonia.<br><br>Immune system<br>Animal studies have found that THC can damage the cells and tissues in the body that help protect against disease. When the immune cells are weakened you are more likely to get sick.<br><br>Q: What does marijuana do to the brain?<br>A: Some studies show that when people have smoked large amounts of marijuana for years, the drug takes its toll on mental functions (4). Heavy or daily use of marijuana affects the parts of the brain that control memory, attention, and learning. A working short-term memory is needed to learn and perform tasks that call for more than one or two steps.<br><br>Smoking marijuana causes some changes in the brain that are like those caused by cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. Scientists are still learning about the many ways that marijuana can affect the brain.<br><br><blockquote>Drugs are more harmful than cigarettes?

U want it to be banned or freely in so people will become addicts to it. If u talk about smoking, sorry man but smoking marijuana is also similar. If u talk about heavy drugs like heroin and cocaine etc, then it will cause the people to either become brain damage and addiction.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Heroin abuse is associated with serious health conditions, including fatal overdose, spontaneous abortion, collapsed veins, and, particularly in users who inject the drug, infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.<br><br>The short-term effects of heroin abuse appear soon after a single dose and disappear in a few hours. After an injection of heroin, the user reports feeling a surge of euphoria ("rush") accompanied by a warm flushing of the skin, a dry mouth, and heavy extremities. Following this initial euphoria, the user goes "on the nod," an alternately wakeful and drowsy state. Mental functioning becomes clouded due to the depression of the central nervous system. Long-term effects of heroin appear after repeated use for some period of time. Chronic users may develop collapsed veins, infection of the heart lining and valves, abscesses, cellulitis, and liver disease. Pulmonary complications, including various types of pneumonia, may result from the poor health condition of the abuser, as well as from heroin's depressing effects on respiration.<br><br>Heroin abuse during pregnancy and its many associated environmental factors (e.g., lack of prenatal care) have been associated with adverse consequences including low birth weight, an important risk factor for later developmental delay.<br><br>In addition to the effects of the drug itself, street heroin may have additives that do not readily dissolve and result in clogging the blood vessels that lead to the lungs, liver, kidneys, or brain. This can cause infection or even death of small patches of cells in vital organs.</span><br><br><blockquote>If drugs are not withheld from them, all drugs abusers will only make their bodies weak and it won't even cause cancer if they don't take drugs by sniffing or injection wheras smoking causes cancers of mouth, throat, lung, pancreas and urinary bladders.

The effect takes few hours, just like alcohol.  After that, the person is back to normal.<br>So what does alcohol do,<br>distorted perception? Yes<br>trouble with thinking and problemsolving? Yes<br>loss of motor coordination? Yes<br>+ more....<br>So nobody should take marijuana while driving, studying or going for sports. Yah sure, ok!!!! Should anybody take alcohol while driving, studying or going for sports???? It all sounds like "donkey" talk, don't you think so??? Who would really want to take marijuana while driving, studying or going for sports, it's for relaxing, not for doing work....<br><br>And as for long term research, they haven't proven the result of cancer yet.  And according to how much dosage....<br>Now, who can tell me is more dangerous??? Alcohol, Cigarettes or Marijuana. I tell you, Alcohol and Cigarettes are really more harmful than Marijuana.<br><br>And talk about withdrawal symptoms, marijuana is not the drug that cause withrawal symptoms like what you see of people tied to the bed. That is heroin and cocaine.<br><br>Let me tell you what really marijuana is all about, rather than what rumours you hear about. Marijuana makes a person stone. So the person just sit down there, feeling relax and start laughing over every little thing. It's a relaxant use in hospital for over stressed out patients, and deals with a nerve that deals with our amount of tension we have.<br>When the person takes marijuana, he/she wants to relax. The person is not going for sports, nor study etc, because the person would want to relax.<br>The amount of dosage of marijuana is to be consume is way less than cigarette. 1 joint=1 stick. 1 joint can last the effect for hours, unlike cigarettes.<br>Marijuana consist of no harmful chemicals as of yet, and is also use for clothes, massage oil etc etc... No scientific research have yet manage to successfully come out with a report. My guess is amnesia or brain cancer is under very heavy dosage, that amount of quantity which no one would probably reach.<br>Think about it!!! If it's so easy and obvious, they would have proven results clearly long time ago.<br><br>However, like anything, it does have it's pros and cons.<br>Pro:<br>Stress relieve<br>More peace and harmony between people, since they are more relaxed<br>Enjoyable moments<br>Easy to sleep, for insomnia patients<br><br>Cons:<br>Abuse cause laziness<br>Not presentable, because behave stupid<br>Not for use when working, driving or exercise<br><br>The reason why government banned it really is becos it causes people to be lazy and makes them look stupid......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for the other comments like THC causing damage to body immune systems and such, these are not yet proven. 5 joints may cause cancer, it's again a maybe issue, they have no proven record yet.<br><br><blockquote> Marijuana can lead to risky sexual behavior</blockquote>that's true and false. When a person takes marijuana, he/she are stone, they wouldn't be good at words enough to pick up the opposite sex. They are not witty enough for that, i would rather say alcohol is a greater stimulant for that. But marijuana is good for sex among couples!!!<br><br>As for increased heart beat, no findings is dominant yet.<br>5 joints a day is a lot, few people smoke that way. 1 joint already has effect that can last a long time. And most people mix it with cigarettes so the effect is weaker. A whole joint of marijuana is a lot, and also a lot of $$$.<br><br>As for coughing, that is true!!!! But again, consumption of marijuana is less than cigarettes overall to cause any real damage as yet...<br></div>

Marijuana is +2000 yrs old.  It's also use for meditation, and is still legalised in Tibet, Holland etc...

It is good for self-evaluation becos it makes a person think about their life and their purpose and goals.<br><br>A lot of people still don't understand that different drugs are different, Sutpidssmart, you are the one that have no idea about drugs. Marijuana is different from cigarettes. Ecstasy, Acid, Heroine, Cocaine etc are all different, don't get confused.<br>Ecstasy deals with our nerve that feels pain. That's why, a person on ecstasy would be able to dance without feeling tired. It is very different from marijuana.<br>Acid is a hallucinator that enables people to see illusions.<br>etc etc etc<br>Heroine gets a person smacked down, it's not for dancing. The person would have illusions and feel as if he/she living in another world totally. It's very antisocial, unlike ecstasy.<br></div>
