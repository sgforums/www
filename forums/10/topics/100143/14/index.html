If your logic is true, then the mere possession of a gun should be punished in the same way as you have mentioned by death sentence - because one gun is sufficient to cause instant death.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>are you saying the proportion of deaths from illcit drugs is lower than the proportion of deaths from cancer caused my smoking? since youre so sure, show stats.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The report I have given have given facts tat the proportion of death is higher.</blockquote>let me check that for myself.<br><br><blockquote><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>yes i have. how different? the degree of dissimilarity or the difference in methods? The degree is difference is massive.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Wat is it tat is different ? Tell me about it </blockquote>tell me the difference between sugar and salt.<br><br><blockquote>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>do i look like a researcher? what level is singapore on? what sort of scale would you like me to answer that with? i cant really answer it accurately can i? can you<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Then why r u complaining about something u don't know much about ? U r no researcher so why r u talking about censorship etc ? </blockquote>are you a researcher-cum-philosopher-cum-policital-analyst?  if we go by what you say, no one here should be commenting at all, and we should leave everything up to the government.  in that case, we can all be sheep and follow the leader.<br><br><blockquote><br>tat is the thing, they do not want u to do drugs. Why not do drugs, they show u all in the posters, talks, lessons and crime watch u had watched isn't it ? Wat happen if one does ? Then the advice is go to police. How can one consume drugs safely ? Because it is never safe when u do drugs. )But they do advice on not sharing syringes etc too) U have already perform something illegal. Do any country teaches u wat to do if u commit theft ? Do other country tell u wat to do if u murder someone ? Do other countries teach u how to gamble if u need to gamble ? We don't offer other options for these behaviors. It is the same as we don't offer choices to people to see if they want to murder or commit theft. Wat u r talking about is not education on not using drugs, u r educating people how to use drugs ! Does gazelle and other talk education on how to use drugs or education on not to use drugs ? </blockquote>i know they dont want people to do drugs.  But look at it realisticly, not idealistically...there are BOUND to be people that have tried an illicit substance some time in their life.  Yes, other countries do teach you how to gamble actually.  Grade 11 in Brisbane taught that in Math's "Probability".  And you know what the strange thing is?  We placed bets in class too.  Horse-racing?  Have you heard of the Melbourne Cup?  Well, bets were placed for that too, in school.<br><br>My point is, teach people not to do bad things.  If they DO want to do it, information on how to do it safely (as safe as possibile) should also be offered.  If people dont want to do it, they wont care.  The people that are interested in doing it, will at least know how they can do it with the least risk, and how to do it without affecting too many other people.  ie "not leaving used sharps around"...thats a good start but its got to be advanced further than that.<br><br><blockquote>They r not lame. They inform people on expected society behaviors or correct livign lifestyles. It is not explicit rules or anything. They acts to inform u wat normal people should do. In primary schools, they tell u tat normal people shoud bath everyday. They tell u tat a person of moral should not have sex indiscriminately. They tell u to follow the laws. They also inform u tat doing drugs is not wat is expected of nrmal people. So u feel damned offended about it informing u and say it is lame ? All people have been exposed to diffeent things. I felt tat it is important for developing normal people. As said before, it depend on the attitude of the people taking the lesson. Perhaps they felt education is only about taking exams. </blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"people on expected society behaviors or correct livign lifestyles"</span>  That sentence in itself basically says that CME teaches people "premediated living templates for life".  They act to inform one on what normal people do?  There ISNT a normal person.  People are people, they arent normal.  There isn't a normal.  "A person of morals should not have sex indiscriminately"?  Thats arguable, i personally dont engage in that, but sex lifestyles are an individuals own preference, and it shouldnt be hardwired into people not to do it, because it is a free world.  Im not offended because it was informative.  I was 'offended' because they were brainwashing sessions.<br><br><blockquote>I don't remeber knowing anyone who fails their civic and moral education. I don't know man.. can u get wrong when they ask basic facts like asking u how many times do u need to bath ? Do u get a wrong answer if they ask u how should u view drugs. If a person answer tat doing drugs is perfectly fine, I will fail tat person outright as well. Why ? because it is really morally and a civic wrong. </blockquote>Yeah well now you know of one.  So, how many times does the normal person have a shower/bath?  Once, twice?  I have 2 showers a day...most of the people i know have 2 as well.  Does that make us normal?  So are you trying to say that people in NS that dont have showers when they're training in the jungle dont qualify as normal people anymore?  I got failed in my test because i purposely gave wrong answers, BUT i did justify as best i could as to why I'd make that decision.  In real life, no, i wouldnt have done what i wrote down on paper, but there are people that will, and for the same reasons i noted in my exam paper.  Does that mean that they are lowlifed scum of society?  One of the questions i remember in the CME paper was to list street names of illegal drugs.  What sort of retarded question is that?  How about questions asking how you can 'cooly' say "no" to drugs?  "Tell them that good friends dont make their mates do drugs"?  Thats a really really lame arsed weak excuse.  It was in the textbooks......you think a textbook answer is actually going to work on the streets?  Educations got to be realistic.<br><br><blockquote><br>Another reason is because there is really nothing to argue about in dealing with drugs. U r arguing in a different manner than the rest of the people. U r arguing tat drugs is right, and people should do drugs. I guess u r really the only one arguing about tis now. The rest of the people do view drugs as a problem in society </blockquote>Im not arguing that drugs are okay.  im not saying people should touch them.  I think its a problem, i think laws should be reviewd, i think education methods should be reviewed.  your point is that "nobody should do drugs".  If this were a perfect world, i'd agree with you to the fullest extent and argue against dicks like me.  However, we arent in a perfect world and we've got to tackle the problem realitically.<br><br><blockquote>a week ? I believe it will last much more considering the fact tat a joint is only at most 2 grams. U can probably make 250 joints with it. How long can 250 joints last u ? Lets just assume your standard of one week is correct. If u r a drug user, not trafficker, and u know tat the death penalty will be impose if u buy a week or more supply or drugs, will u not buy in only 1-3 days of drugs instead ? The only reason why people will have more drugs is only drug trafficker because they need to hold the supply of it for some time. Doesn't tat show the weight of the drugs is accurate in determing who is a user or a trafficker </blockquote>well over a week actually then.  if smoked.<br>less time if it was cooked.<br>if you buy in bulk, you get it cheaper?  isnt that right for every consumable good?<br><br>i think we've gone off at a massive tangent to the whole topic so we should try and become more objective.<br><br>robertteh said, "A gun is lethal.

It caused a diplomatic spat over the Mike McCrea issue while wasting thousands of Victorian taxpayers' funds to feed him. If Singapore had no capital punishment, McCrea wouldm't have to flee. And I'd rather Anthony Ler suffer in jail and go crazy than see him executed just like that. What he did to his wife cannot be described using sanitised language.</div>

Therefore holding an illegal gun carries the death penalty in the name of self defence and preservation of the people = same reason as illegal drugs.  I though you would know this, it is under the armed offences act.<br><br>Practically if an individual is determined to kill - every daily solid object can be used to kill.  Even pencils can kill through penetration of the vital areas of the body. However people use daily objects for survival.

Military and police forces have guns for the protection of citizens and a gun is only drawn within a boundary of rules , bylaws and training (like in NS).<br><br>Drugs , on the other hand, like ketamine ( similar to ectasy but used medically) and morphine ( the weaker cousin of heroin) is legal when it comes down to medical use but not a layman's needed daily objects. Likewise the pharmaceutical companies (who make them under strict guidelines), the pharmacist and the doctors who order it and the nurses who administer it, are given the same boundary like the military and police forces.<br><br>Guns have bullets- bullets have no eyes- innocent people can get killed within a large radius- have you heard of ricochet?  Illicit drugs mind alters and has a large range of social consequences from the mild to the severe. Illicit drug makers have no control over how they make heroin or cocaine - they usually mix it with impurities , and other chemical substances that are harmful to a human being besides the drug itself.

Brainwashing the whole younger population at the age where they're most vulnurable to outside information is...  well thats not very moral is it?  Putting values in peoples heads that they wouldnt have necessarily followed if they were allowed to develop themselves, with guidance.  It'd be all fine and good if CME was about guidelines...from what i remember, it was more of a set of rules and laws to live life by.  I dont have my little books or sheets from school, but if you manage to find one in PDF format i'd be happy to rip it apart and justify why i think its brainwashing.

Well, ask girls how often they wash their hair, and more than a few will tell you they do it every couple of days because its very drying.

Are you saying that you can judge someone's morals to be right or wrong?  You really cant.  I gave my answers, i justified my answers to the fullest extent i could on paper.  I got marked wrong.  Simple as that.  Theres a problem with the system.<br><br><blockquote><br>Please justify why u will not bath everyday ? Please justify why u will not bruch teeth everyday ? Please justify why u want to have sex wantonly with anyone ? U want to be funny, u get just get laughable result. </blockquote>if someone can justify his or her choices to themselves (they usually can if they end up doing something), i dont have a problem with it.  I dont want to have sex with everyone, but if he or she is aware of it, and his or her partner is aware of it too, i dont really care.  Do you have a problem with it?  Its a personal choice.<br><br><blockquote><br>U wouldn't have done is one thing. U don't know how to answer basic facts is another. U deserve to fail </blockquote>I dont know how to answer basic facts?  Of course i bloody know how to answer basic facts.  CME is one of the stupidest tests ive done in a proper educational institution.  Look at the 'ah bengs' and triad gang wannabes......you wouldnt say they're very moral people would you?  But yet they passed their CME papers.<br>If i derserve to fail because i questioned the system, then yes.  I do.<br><br><blockquote>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Does that mean that they are lowlifed scum of society<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>It just meant tat they never pay attention to lesson.

Wat is wrong with tat question ? </blockquote>Yes, i listed everything, correctly too i might add.  The point i was trying to raise was more like...what sort of stupid question is that?  Supposing CME lessons actually worked...then you dont want to be asking dimwit questions like that.  You want to be asking about harmful effects + such in the hope of "psyching" people into not doing drugs.  Singapore's all about "psycho-ing" people not to do things due to serious, unreasonable, harsh repercussions.  Since Singapore works that way, then CME papers should too.  Wheres the consistency?<br><br><blockquote>I thought u like discussion question ? Tis is one discussion question isn't it ? </blockquote>Yes i do.  Sadly, no its not.  It was, how would i say, a given "formula" and suggested that it'd work every time.<br><br><blockquote><br>We r using education to discourage people to do drugs. If u think tat is funny, then all countries r funny. </blockquote>Not discourage.  You're using education to tell people what to do and what not do to, be it explicitly or implicitly.  Thats brainwashing.<br><br><blockquote><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Thats a really really lame arsed weak excuse.

No, it is still inadequate but it beats nothing </blockquote>Well theres a lot more they could do.<br><br><blockquote>How to tackle realistically ? By your suggestions u r encouraging drugs to be legallised ! Com'on man, tis is not a perfect world. If the people don't find drugs they don't do it. Tat is the basic principle tat works in tis imperfect world. Now u r arguing tat we should taught people on how to use drugs. May I know how will tat make the drug abuse problem dissappear ? May I know how does tat substitute the death penalty ? U r out of point here. </blockquote>By my suggestions YOU are ASSUMING that i want to leagalize drugs.<br><br><blockquote>Tat is for common groceries. As said before, in tis way u can classfy who is the drug trafficker and drug user. It is a good way to push judgement </blockquote>can we both agree that the law doesnt differentiate accurately between the two?  or are you going to debate more?<br><br><blockquote><br>Same as drug abuse hee. We punish the trafficker heavily. U get a problem with tat ?</blockquote>I got a problem with the death sentence, yes.  But i dont break the laws in singapore, i dont live there, i dont really care.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>LEt me tell u somethign. U have gone totally way off point<br><br>1) U say education can help to make up the effort of the death penalty. However the education scheme u promoted do not have this effect. Does teaching people how to take marijuana help in combating drug abuse problems ? Does teaching people more about using heroin help to prevent more heroin abusers ? No ! U r telling people education is a key factor to remove drug abuse and the things u had said does nothing to remove the problem ! U r out of point !<br><br>2) U r talking about education yet now u r preventing education to be taught to them. U do not want civic and moral education to proceed ! U do not want them to know more about drug abuse ! U do not even want to educate children on basic information on life such as keeping clean and hygiene ! U do not want them to be taught about drug abuse because they r brainwashing too. Yet initially u want them to "brainwash" people about how to use drugs safely ?!?!? U have been going through a total wrong focus and prove yourself to be contradictory  ! U want education to be done on immoral things such as not bathing everyday, having sex as much as u want if no one stops u and how to do drugs properly ! U do not want education to be done on teaching them to kept themselves clean, to practised safe sex and stop all form of drug abuse ! Wat r u doing ?<br><br>Now I proceed to explain how wrong your points r.<br><br><blockquote>do you know?<br>you cant really tag a numerical value on it can you?<br>how about media that isnt censored for (intellectual) content, but just for offensive content? </blockquote>I had said before, all countries control their media. Even american is seemed to have controlled their media during the report of iraq war etc. Is tat an intellectual censorship or offensive censorship ?<br><br><blockquote>The difference between education and singapore generally can be sumarized in saying that Singapore says:<br>1) Dont do drugs.<br>2) If you do, you're ^$%&amp;ed in every way possible and you'll become a failure in life.<br><br>In Australia,<br>1. Dont do drugs.<br>2. Don't do them because (...law, but more importantly health issues)<br>3. If you do, you could get in trouble with the law, but more importantly, you could be putting yourself at risk.<br>4. If you finally decide to do them, take these steps (...) so that your personal saftey is put as less of a risk that if you didnt follow the guidelines. </blockquote>Frankly, u know little of singapore education on drugs. Singapore do practise your point 1-4 for its education. It ask u not to do drugs, it do explained why one shouldn't do it such as telling them about brain damage and death, it too tell u the possible death penalty from doing drugs, and finally it do tell people how to practise geenral safety when doing drugs such as sharing needles etc. It is all the same. U have added nothing different compared with singapore drug education. U should really read back your civic and moral education<br><br><blockquote>Well let me get extremist and say that in that case they shouldnt teach students about the sharemarket because quite plainly, the sharemarket is basically a big leagalized casino.</blockquote>U r right, it is extreme and totally out of point. Crossing the road is actually gambling with your life. So don't cross the road lah ?<br><br><blockquote>Probability (and other stuff) is useless if you cant apply it to real life situations. The fact is that you've got to be realistic.<br>What about sex were you saying? Safe sex? Yes, and in more detail with more information than Singapore does. I believe the chemistry students in my school did in fact have a unit on corrosive chemicals and also brought around the topic of how to dispose of a body. Talking about things doesnt necessarily mean that someone's going to do it. </blockquote>And in which area does australia become more detail than singapore ? Frankly I believe singapore have gone to a reasonable level in terms of sex education. Why don't u tell me how detail does australia go about in their sex education ? Unless u r gonna tell me they show them an adult flick otherwise I really see nothing lacking in our education for it.<br><br>ABout talking on corrosive substances, there r some lecturer here who do dwell on such topics to make the lesson more interesting as well. There r some lecturer who used gambling to teach probability as well. Who tell u tat we never do such measures to make the class more intertesting ? Wat u have been saying is just spices to make the class more lively. There is nothing really significant or meaningful in your complains.<br><br><blockquote>So you're saying that if you decide to do bad things, the society will completely abandon you and leave you for dead? Im not saying "teach them to do bad things better". Im saying "teach them, in case they do bad things, how to do it while reducing risk of personal saftey".<br></blockquote>Wat r u saying, u r teaching people how to do drugs. I am telling people not to do drugs. Does telling them not to do drugs = to saying society abandoning them and leaving them for dead ? How do u ever come to tat conclusion ? I guess u better read more properly before making such groundless comments.<br><br><blockquote>About sharps, i know thats taught there. Thats a starting point...potential users of drugs (thats everybody) should know what to do and what not to do to minimize risk to the greater society,. </blockquote>So wat is your problem ? The education is similar to australia one isn't it ? FYI, teaching about needles etc is not taught tis year or last. It had been taught for more than 10 years from today.<br><br><blockquote>I like realistic education. Realistic, informative education that can be applied in the real world. On the street. Not in the classroom. </blockquote>Yeah, and how do u do tat ? U mean telling people to bath regularly is not realistic ? U mean telling people to bruch teeth regularly cannot be used on the "street" ? U mean advising people to practise safe sex is not informative ? COm'on man, u just have a limited understanding of civic and moral education, tat is why u have so much complains about it. Now after knowing more about it, r u still gonna say it is useless ? Tis is more "street" and "realistic" education compared with knowing how to do equations isn't it ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Are you trying to say that civics and morals can be TAUGHT? They can be nurtured, they can be encouraged. Brainwashing the whole younger population at the age where they're most vulnurable to outside information is... well thats not very moral is it? Putting values in peoples heads that they wouldnt have necessarily followed if they were allowed to develop themselves, with guidance. It'd be all fine and good if CME was about guidelines...from what i remember, it was more of a set of rules and laws to live life by. I dont have my little books or sheets from school, but if you manage to find one in PDF format i'd be happy to rip it apart and justify why i think its brainwashing. Or on the other hand, maybe i just dont know anything about morals. </blockquote>They can be informed. Tis is not brainwashing ! Telling people to bath regularly is brainwashing to u ? Then I guess no one can teach to others about anything ! FYI, showering is not equal to washing your head. According to civic and moral education they recomend u to wash your hair at least once per week. Anything wrong with tis statement or u just wanna argue for the sake of arguing ? Why don't u try to shred these few pieces of information ? Showering at least once per day, brushing your teeth at least once or twice per day and washing your hair at least once per week. Don't do drugs, don't have unsafe sex, don't change your sex partner often, be wary of cheats and strangers, be careful with money, wash your hands before eating, try to eat a balance diet, exercise regularly, drink plenty of water, sleep in a well ventilated room, when sick inform your parents etc. Tear these into shreds ! Show it to me ! Complain about it and tear it into pieces ! Tear any of the above list of actions to shreds lah !<br><br>U r just biased against singapore education.. tat is all.<br><br><blockquote>Washing and keeping really really clean actually doesnt allow your immune system to develop fully because you're so clean. </blockquote>U r talking nonsense here. Then u r encouraging people not to shower lah ! U r encouraging people not to wash hairs lah ! U r encouraging people not to brush teeth lah ! Might as well teach people to eat unclean food and not visit doctor to build up your immune system as well. These guidelines r recommended by the doctors and health agencies. SO your idea is better than people from there ?<br><br><blockquote>Actually let me rephrase that. i gave answers that were not the answers they wanted. Are you saying that you can judge someone's morals to be right or wrong? You really cant. I gave my answers, i justified my answers to the fullest extent i could on paper. I got marked wrong. Simple as that. Theres a problem with the system. </blockquote>They ask u how often to shower u answer back tat don't shower at all to build up your immune system. U still deserve to fail. Simple as tat.<br><br><blockquote>if someone can justify his or her choices to themselves (they usually can if they end up doing something), i dont have a problem with it. I dont want to have sex with everyone, but if he or she is aware of it, and his or her partner is aware of it too, i dont really care. Do you have a problem with it? Its a personal choice. </blockquote>Someone can also justify their reason if they go around murdering someone and commit theft too. Going by your theory, u can go and visit all prostitutes in the world when u r single as well. But then u r doing something not recomended. Do u recomend all your single friends or future children to visit prostitution ? It is like trying to be funny and refuse to bath regularly. U got your wish and u come out with all sort of skin dieseases. Is tat wat u desire to be taught to children ? Teaching children about these basic living styles certainly beats not teaching them at all. DO I have a problem with people complaining tat basic information be deleted off the education system ? I do have a problem.<br><br><blockquote>I dont know how to answer basic facts? Of course i bloody know how to answer basic facts. CME is one of the stupidest tests ive done in a proper educational institution. Look at the 'ah bengs' and triad gang wannabes......you wouldnt say they're very moral people would you? But yet they passed their CME papers.<br>If i derserve to fail because i questioned the system, then yes. I do. </blockquote>Well, then A bengs r better than u since they can pass such a simple test while u fail at it. They probably know how to be more clean and hygiene than u... Now I know why u r so pissed off at it.. because u fail at it while people with poorer grades get better result than u.<br><br><blockquote>PFFT. CME doesnt mean anything even if one listens</blockquote>It meant something to people who do not know of such things such as young children<br><br><blockquote>Yes, i listed everything, correctly too i might add.

Singapore's all about "psycho-ing" people not to do things due to serious, unreasonable, harsh repercussions. Since Singapore works that way, then CME papers should too. Wheres the consistency? </blockquote>Why was it a stupid question ? it is meant to see if u pay attention during classes. If no one pay attention then CME lessons don't work. If tat is a stupid question then maths test r stupid questions as well. They give u a problem where the teachers have a problem finding it. Your latter part of question seems to be wierd. Knowing wat is the street names of drug is important too because if u don't know wat drugs to be wary of, u might be taking them yourself unknowingly. U can't expect the test to test on everything isn't it ? Tis is one aspect tat can be tested as well. They tell u about the possible repercussion of it. They tell u not to do drugs etc. And u have a problem with the test because they didn't test u on wat u had spotted before ?<br><br><blockquote>Yes i do. Sadly, no its not. It was, how would i say, a given "formula" and suggested that it'd work every time. </blockquote>How to tell your friend drugs is not a cool thing to do has a close formula for it ? I thought tis is so open ended ! It is a discussion question and u do nto like it as well ! Wat is the problem with u ?<br><br><blockquote>Not discourage. You're using education to tell people what to do and what not do to, be it explicitly or implicitly. Thats brainwashing. </blockquote>Wat do u view eduction as ? Going by wat u say every thing is brainwashing. U tell people not to leave their needles around is also brainwashing. U tell them to do drugs safely is also brainwashing. U tell peopel not to do durgs is also brainwashing. Like tat how ? Don't educate meh ?<br><br><blockquote>Well theres a lot more they could do</blockquote>More complains and no suggestions<br><br><blockquote>By my suggestions YOU are ASSUMING that i want to leagalize drugs. </blockquote>U tell people tat tis is a realistic world and there r people bound to be drug takers. And so wat does tis naturally point us to ?<br><br><blockquote>can we both agree that the law doesnt differentiate accurately between the two? or are you going to debate more? </blockquote>They can. The amount is too much for a normal drug taker to have.<br><br><blockquote>I got a problem with the death sentence, yes. But i dont break the laws in singapore, i dont live there, i dont really care.</blockquote>U got a problem, I don't. U don't care about the laws in singapore, then why do u paste a passage from roberteh and want me to answer to them ? I answer it then u say u actually don't care ? Then ask me for wat !</div>
