Many harmful short-term and long-term problems have been documented with its use:<br><br>The short term effects of marijuana use include: memory loss, distorted perception, trouble with thinking and problem solving, loss of motor skills, decrease in muscle strength, increased heart rate, and anxiety2.<br><br>In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of emergency room mentions of marijuana use. From 1993-2000, the number of emergency room marijuana mentions more than tripled.<br><br>There are also many long-term health consequences of marijuana use. According to the National Institutes of Health, studies show that someone who smokes five joints per week may be taking in as many cancer-causing chemicals as someone who smokes a full pack of cigarettes every day.<br><br>Marijuana contains more than 400 chemicals, including most of the harmful substances found in tobacco smoke. Smoking one marijuana cigarette deposits about four times more tar into the lungs than a filtered tobacco cigarette.<br><br>Harvard University researchers report that the risk of a heart attack is five times higher than usual in the hour after smoking marijuana.3<br><br>Smoking marijuana also weakens the immune system4 and raises the risk of lung infections.5 A Columbia University study found that a control group smoking a single marijuana cigarette every other day for a year had a white-blood-cell count that was 39 percent lower than normal, thus damaging the immune system and making the user far more susceptible to infection and sickness.6<br><br>Users can become dependent on marijuana to the point they must seek treatment to stop abusing it. In 1999, more than 200,000 Americans entered substance abuse treatment primarily for marijuana abuse and dependence.<br><br>More teens are in treatment for marijuana use than for any other drug or for alcohol. Adolescent admissions to substance abuse facilities for marijuana grew from 43 percent of all adolescent admissions in 1994 to 60 percent in 1999.<br><br>Marijuana is much stronger now than it was decades ago. According to data from the Potency Monitoring Project at the University of Mississippi, the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of commercial-grade marijuana rose from an average of 3.71 percent in 1985 to an average of 5.57 percent in 1998. The average THC content of U.S. produced sinsemilla increased from 3.2 percent in 1977 to 12.8 percent in 1997.7<br><br>Marijuana affects many skills required for safe driving: alertness, the ability to concentrate, coordination, and reaction time. These effects can last up to 24 hours after smoking marijuana. Marijuana use can make it difficult to judge distances and react to signals and signs on the road<br><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes you are asking questions.  i never said it was personal - i was refering to general education in singapore, on the whole.<br><br>==============<br><br>I have stated about cocaine and heroin.

Results are felt almost instanteounsly because THC is absorbed immediately once in the lungs (because its vaporized and a gas).<br><br>eating/drinking it - typically, hash cookies are just cookies.  you can make brownies..cookies...anything basically.  the secret is mixing the butter/oil that you use to cook your food, with weed.  THC is soluble in lipids, and hence, the fat/oil in butter ats as a solute and the THC dissolves in it. Then you cook your cookies/brownies with that butter cointaining the dissoved THC.<br><br>you could also make tea with it<br><br>you can also just eat it (try eating dry grass - its about the same)<br><br>ingesting it this way...effects are felt after a fair amount of time (30minutes+), effects are not as euphoric or 'high' as ifi you smoke it, but the amount of time you can sustain the feeling is a lot longer (ie, you dont crash as soon and as fast).<br><br>===<br><br>Tat won't be a problem ? Do u see more or hear more ? U think making u high to the point tat u lost your sense of time and space is desirable ? Won't tat result in more accidents and crime to take place ?

Tis mental addiciton is much more perverse than eating chocolate or watching TV.<br>--&gt;well, if a group of stoners are sitting around watching tv and they're high, what sort of threat does it pose to the community?  and yes, i can tell you that most people love weed because they lose sense of perception.<br>why do you consider anything that makes you high addictive?  sugar makes you high?  have you ever tried to binge drink unmixed ribena, or any other cordial straight?  sugar makes you high - is it addictive?  if we go by your perspective on addictions - Yes, sugar is addictive, and so is every other thing in this world...because everything can be psychologically addictive to an individual.<br><br>===<br>If u drink only a glass of wine while another smoke only a stick, who is more likely to be in an accident ?<br>--&gt; how big a stick?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>=====<br><br>In the end u agree tat the source of info is not off, then u say tat we shouldn't trust these sources ? Aren't I asking questions now ? Then wat information can be hold true ? Even scientific journals etc has been proven wrong from time to time.<br><br>--&gt;information contained may be true, but the whole truth might not be there.  im not saying to trust or not trust the sources, because as you say journals and studies have been proven wrong every now and again.<br><br>i think we've gone a bit off topic...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MARIJUANA AND ACTUAL DRIVING PERFORMANCE<br>NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION<br>BY HINDRIK W.J. ROBBE AND JAMES F. O'HANLON<br>Abstract: This report concerns the effects of marijuana smoking on actual driving performance. It presents the results of one pilot and three actual driving studies. The pilot study's major purpose was to establish the THC dose current marijuana users smoke to achieve their desired "high". From these results it was decided that the maximum THC dose for subsequent driving studies would be 300 mcg / kg (0.3 mg / kg). The first driving study was conducted on a closed section of a primary highway. After smoking marijuana delivering THC doses of 0, 100, 200, and 300 mcg / kg, subjects drove a car while maintaining a constant speed and lateral position. This study was replicated with a new group of subjects, but now in the presence of other traffic. In addition, a car following test was executed. The third driving study compared the effects of a modest dose of THC (100 mcg / kg) and alcohol )BAC of 0.04 g %) on city driving performance. This program of research has shown that marijuana, when taken alone, produces a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to the consumed THC dose. The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a steady lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight in their performance and will compensate where they can, for example, by slowing down or increasing effort. As a consequence, THC's adverse effects on driving performance appear relatively small.<br><br>============================<br><br>The Age, Canberra Times (Australian Paper)<br>The largest study ever done linking road accidents with drugs and alcohol has found drivers with cannabis in their blood were no more at risk than those who were drug-free. In fact, the findings by a pharmacology team from the University of Adelaide and Transport SA showed drivers who had smoked marijuana were marginally less likely to have an accident than those who were drug-free.<br>A study spokesman, Dr Jason White, said the difference was not great enough to be statistically significant but could be explained by anecdotal evidence that marijuana smokers were more cautious and drove more slowly because of altered time perception. The study of 2,500 accidents, which matched the blood alcohol levels of injured drivers with details from police reports, found drug-free drivers caused the accidents in 53.5 per cent of cases.<br><br>Injured drivers with a blood-alcohol concentration of more than 0.05 per cent were culpable in nearly 90 per cent of accidents they were involved in. Drivers with cannabis in their blood were less likely to cause an accident, with a culpability rate of 50.6 per cent. The study has policy implications for those who argue drug detection should be a new focus for road safety. Dr White said the study showed the importance of concentrating efforts on alcohol rather than other drugs.<br>================================<br><br>ALCOHOL IMPAIRS DRIVING MORE THAN MARIJUANA<br>New Scientist, 20 March 2002<br>Exclusive From New Scientist Print Edition<br><span class="large">A single glass of wine will impair your driving more than smoking a joint</span> (theres your answer to that question).  And under certain test conditions, the complex way alcohol and cannabis combine to affect driving behaviour suggests that someone who has taken both may drive less recklessly than a person who is simply drunk.  (most teens/youth in australia KNOW that mixing alcohol and marijuana is a no-go zone...do youths in singapore know that?  Is education sufficient at this point in time?)<br>====================================<br><br>Australia: Cannabis 'Not Risky'<br>Pubdate: Wed, 31 Oct 2001<br>Source: Advertiser, The (Australia)<br>STUDIES had found it impossible to prove cannabis adversely affected driving, an Adelaide University researcher said yesterday.<br><br>Professor Jack Maclean, director of the road accident research unit, said there was no doubt alcohol affected driving adversely, but that was not the case with marijuana.<br><br>``It has been impossible to prove marijuana affects driving adversely,'' he told a conference in Sydney.<br><br>Marijuana might affect performance in a favourable way by reducing risk-taking, he said.<br><br>======================================<br><br>RESEARCH for a computer game company has found a small amount of cannabis could help players' performance, making them drive faster and safer.<br><br>The experiment was carried out for Acclaim Entertainment to see how cannabis would affect people playing its new game, Burnout. A group of 20 experienced games enthusiasts and drivers between 21 and 40 took part in the test to study reaction times, speed, concentration levels and road safety.<br><br>Ten of them then smoked about 0.15 milligrams of cannabis, or about half a "joint", while the other ten had had no stimulant for at least 72 hours prior to the test. They were then given a demonstration of Burnout and asked to take the controls.<br><br>The researchers say 80 per cent of those who had smoked cannabis demonstrated superior reaction times to those who had not. About 60 per cent finished a lap faster, while 70 per cent experienced a lower number of collisions, and more than half reached a higher level in the game.<br><br>When playing in competition with each other, the drivers who had smoked cannabis won eight out of the ten matches. The company claims drivers under the influence of cannabis appeared to have more confidence in their ability and be much calmer.<br><br>Simon Smith-Wright, Burnout's communications director, admitted the findings do not translate into real life, but insisted small amounts of the drug helped driving.<br><br>He said: "The results of our tests clearly indicate that a small or moderate amount of cannabis is actually quite beneficial to someone's driving performance.<br><br>=================<br>Marijuana and Driving: A Review of the Scientific Evidence<br>(excerpt)<br><br>It is well established that alcohol increases accident risk.  Evidence of marijuanaÂ’s culpability in on-road driving accidents is much less convincing.<br><br>Although cannabis intoxication has been shown to mildly impair psychomotor skills, this impairment does not appear to be severe or long lasting.  In driving simulator tests, this impairment is typically manifested by subjects decreasing their driving speed and requiring greater time to respond to emergency situations.<br><br>Nevertheless, this impairment does not appear to play a significant role in on-road traffic accidents.  A 2002 review of seven separate studies involving 7,934 drivers reported, Â“Crash culpability studies have failed to demonstrate that drivers with cannabinoids in the blood are significantly more likely than drug-free drivers to be culpable in road crashes.Â”  This result is likely because subject under the influence of marijuana are aware of their impairment and compensate for it accordingly, such as by slowing down and by focusing their attention when they know a response will be required.  This reaction is just the opposite of that exhibited by drivers under the influence of alcohol, who tend to drive in a more risky manner proportional to their intoxication.<br><br>=====================<br>random piece of information: 1962, John F Kennedy uses marijuana for pain relief.<br>1995, British medial journal reports long-term smoking is not harmful to health.<br>1996, May lead to lunger cancer, studies report<br>Nov 1996, marijuana use with doctor's supervision is allowed in the state of California<br>1997, UCLA School of Medicine publishes results of an eight year study concluding that there are no differences in lung functions between heavy smokers and non-smokers.<br>===============</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Marijuana<br>Marijuana Myths<br><br>1. Marijuana Causes Brain Damage<br>The most celebrated study that claims to show brain damage is the rhesus monkey study of Dr. Robert Heath, done in the late 1970s.<br><br>This study was reviewed by a distinguished panel of scientists sponsored by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences.<br><br>Their results were published under the title, Marijuana and Health in 1982.<br><br>Heath's work was sharply criticized for its insufficient sample size (only four monkeys), its failure to control experimental bias, and the misidentification of normal monkey brain structure as "damaged".<br><br>Actual studies of human populations of marijuana users have shown no evidence of brain damage.<br><br>For example, two studies from 1977, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) showed no evidence of brain damage in heavy users of marijuana.<br><br>That same year, the American Medical Association (AMA) officially came out in favor of decriminalizing marijuana. That's not the sort of thing you'd expect if the AMA thought marijuana damaged the brain.<br><br>2. Marijuana Damages The Reproductive System<br>This claim is based chiefly on the work of Dr. Gabriel Nahas, who experimented with tissue (cells) isolated in petri dishes, and the work of researchers who dosed animals with near-lethal amounts of cannabinoids (i.e., the intoxicating part of marijuana).<br><br>Nahas' generalizations from his petri dishes to human beings have been rejected by the scientific community as being invalid.<br><br>In the case of the animal experiments, the animals that survived their ordeal returned to normal within 30 days of the end of the experiment.<br><br>Studies of actual human populations have failed to demonstrate that marijuana adversely affects the reproductive system.<br><br>3. Marijuana Is A "Gateway" Drug It Leads To Hard Drugs<br>This is one of the more persistent myths. A real world example of what happens when marijuana is readily available can be found in Holland.<br><br>The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the 1970s. Since then, hard drug use, heroin and cocaine, have DECLINED substantially.<br><br>If marijuana really were a gateway drug, one would have expected use of hard drugs to have gone up, not down.<br><br>This apparent "negative gateway" effect has also been observed in the United States.<br><br>Studies done in the early 1970s showed a negative correlation between use of marijuana and use of alcohol.<br><br>A 1993 Rand Corporation study that compared drug use in states that had decriminalized marijuana versus those that had not, found that where marijuana was more available, the states that had decriminalized, hard drug abuse as measured by emergency room episodes decreased.<br><br>In short, what science and actual experience tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the much more dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.<br><br>4. Marijuana Suppresses The Immune System<br>Like the studies claiming to show damage to the reproductive system, this myth is based on studies where animals were given extremely high, in many cases, near-lethal, doses of cannabinoids.<br><br>These results have never been duplicated in human beings. Interestingly, two studies done in 1978 and one done in 1988 showed that hashish and marijuana may have actually stimulated the immune system in the people studied.<br><br>5. Marijuana Is Much More Dangerous Than Tobacco<br>Smoked marijuana contains about the same amount of carcinogens as does an equivalent amount of tobacco.<br><br>It should be remembered, however, that a heavy tobacco smoker consumes much more tobacco than a heavy marijuana smoker consumes marijuana.<br><br>This is because smoked tobacco, with a 90% addiction rate, is the most addictive of all drugs while marijuana is less addictive than caffeine.<br><br>Two other factors are important. The first is that paraphernalia laws directed against marijuana users make it difficult to smoke safely.<br><br>These laws make water pipes and bongs, which filter some of the carcinogens out of the smoke, illegal and, hence, unavailable.<br><br>The second is that, if marijuana were legal, it would be more economical to have cannabis drinks like Bhang (a traditional drink in the Middle East) or tea which are totally non-carcinogenic.<br><br>This is in stark contrast with "smokeless" tobacco products like snuff which can cause cancer of the mouth and throat.<br><br>When all of these facts are taken together, it can be clearly seen that the reverse is true: marijuana is much SAFER than tobacco.<br><br>6. Legal Marijuana Would Cause Carnage On The Highways<br>Although marijuana, when used to intoxication, does impair performance in a manner similar to alcohol, actual studies of the effect of marijuana on the automobile accident rate suggest that it poses LESS of a hazard than alcohol.<br><br>When a random sample of fatal accident victims was studied, it was initially found that marijuana was associated with RELATIVELY as many accidents as alcohol.<br><br>In other words, the number of accident victims intoxicated on marijuana relative to the number of marijuana users in society gave a ratio similar to that for accident victims intoxicated on alcohol relative to the total number of alcohol users.<br><br>However, a closer examination of the victims revealed that around 85% of the people intoxicated on marijuana WERE ALSO INTOXICATED ON ALCOHOL.<br><br>For people only intoxicated on marijuana, the rate was much lower than for alcohol alone. This finding has been supported by other research using completely different methods.<br><br>For example, an economic analysis of the effects of decriminalization on marijuana usage found that states that had reduced penalties for marijuana possession experienced a rise in marijuana use and a decline in alcohol use with the result that fatal highway accidents decreased.<br><br>This would suggest that, far from causing "carnage", legal marijuana might actually save lives.<br><br>7. Marijuana "Flattens" Human Brainwaves<br>This is an out-and-out lie perpetrated by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America.<br><br>A few years ago, they ran a TV ad that purported to show, first, a normal human brainwave, and second, a flat brainwave from a 14-year-old "on marijuana".<br><br>When researchers called up the TV networks to complain about this commercial, the Partnership had to pull it from the air.<br><br>It seems that the Partnership faked the flat "marijuana brainwave".<br><br>In reality, marijuana has the effect of slightly INCREASING alpha wave activity. Alpha waves are associated with meditative and relaxed states which are, in turn, often associated with human creativity.<br><br>8. Marijuana Is More Potent Today Than In The Past<br>This myth is the result of bad data. The researchers who made the claim of increased potency used as their baseline the THC content of marijuana seized by police in the early 1970s.<br><br>Poor storage of this marijuana in non air conditioned evidence rooms caused it to deteriorate and decline in potency before any chemical assay was performed.<br><br>Contemporaneous, independent assays of unseized "street" marijuana from the early 1970s showed a potency equivalent to that of modern "street" marijuana.<br><br>Actually, the most potent form of this drug that was generally available was sold legally in the 1920s and 1930s by the pharmaceutical company Smith-Klein under the name, "American Cannabis".<br><br>9. Marijuana Impairs Short Term Memory<br>This is true but misleading. Any impairment of short-term memory disappears when one is no longer under the influence of marijuana.<br><br>Often, the short-term memory effect is paired with a reference to Dr. Heath's poor rhesus monkeys to imply that the condition is permanent.<br><br>10. Marijuana Lingers In The Body Like DDT<br>This is also true but misleading. Cannabinoids are fat soluble as are innumerable nutrients and, yes, some poisons like DDT.<br><br>For example, the essential nutrient, Vitamin A, is fat soluble but one never hears people who favor marijuana prohibition making this comparison.<br><br>11. There Are Over A Thousand Chemicals In Marijuana Smoke<br>Again, true but misleading. The 31 August 1990 issue of the magazine Science notes that of the over 800 volatile chemicals present in roasted COFFEE, only 21 have actually been tested on animals and 16 of these cause cancer in rodents.<br><br>Yet, coffee remains legal and is generally considered fairly safe.<br><br>12. No One Has Ever Died Of A Marijuana Overdose<br>This is true. It was put in to see if you are paying attention. Animal tests have revealed that extremely high doses of cannabinoids are needed to have lethal effect.<br><br>This has led scientists to conclude that the ratio of the amount of cannabinoids necessary to get a person intoxicated (i.e., stoned) relative to the amount necessary to kill them is 1 to 40,000.<br><br>In other words, to overdose, you would have to consume 40,000 times as much marijuana as you needed to get stoned.<br><br>In contrast, the ratio for alcohol varies between 1 to 4 and 1 to 10. It is easy to see how upwards of 5000 people die from alcohol overdoses every year and no one EVER dies of marijuana overdoses.<br><br></div>

THC is soluble in lipids, and hence, the fat/oil in butter ats as a solute and the THC dissolves in it. Then you cook your cookies/brownies with that butter cointaining the dissoved THC. </blockquote>Okie, but who actually ingest THC tis way ? Isn't the most common way is by smoking it ? U can even cook cigerrettes if u want.<br><br><blockquote>okay, lets go with the 24-hour period even though the report clearly states "it CAN". </blockquote>24 hours is long enough.

Who knows the next moment they will jump down the floor or something.<br><br><blockquote>You realize that the phrase "marijuana is addictive" refers to extremely (you would believe how much) heavy users of the substance? </blockquote>Statistic had shown tat there r a lot of people receiving treatment to kick marijuana. When u introduce marijuana to a country, do u expect all people to be light smokers ? Surely some will become heavy smokers and therefore addicted to it. Do u see a lot of people recieving treatment to kick the habbit of eating chocolate ? Is there as much side effects to marijuana compared with coffee or chocolates ?<br><br><blockquote>Yes, laws should be reviewed and education and awareness should be reviewed too, and changed.</blockquote>No, the case has not been shown to be adequate and no one has come out with a good suggestion on how to improve education or awareness.

When someone smokes marijuana, THC rapidly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream, which carries the chemical to organs throughout the body, including the brain.<br><br>In the brain, THC connects to specific sites called cannabinoid receptors on nerve cells and influences the activity of those cells. Some brain areas have many cannabinoid receptors; others have few or none. Many cannabinoid receptors are found in the parts of the brain that influence pleasure, memory, thought, concentration, sensory and time perception, and coordinated movement(5).<br><br>The short-term effects of marijuana can include problems with memory and learning; distorted perception; difficulty in thinking and problem solving; loss of coordination; and increased heart rate. Research findings for long-term marijuana use indicate some changes in the brain similar to those seen after long-term use of other major drugs of abuse. For example, cannabinoid (THC or synthetic forms of THC) withdrawal in chronically exposed animals leads to an increase in the activation of the stress-response system(6) and changes in the activity of nerve cells containing dopamine(7). Dopamine neurons are involved in the regulation of motivation and reward, and are directly or indirectly affected by all drugs of abuse.</span><br><br>There is nothing about monkeys here.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your report also fails to mention about increase heart and lung attack for marijuana smokers. So it is true tat it do harms these organs huh. Your reply is just avoiding the statistic below.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">One study has indicated that a userÂ’s risk of heart attack more than quadruples in the first hour after smoking marijuana(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. The researchers suggest that such an effect might occur from marijuanaÂ’s effects on blood pressure and heart rate and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A study of 450 individuals found that people who smoke marijuana frequently but do not smoke tobacco have more health problems and miss more days of work than nonsmokers(9). Many of the extra sick days among the marijuana smokers in the study were for respiratory illnesses.<br><br>Even infrequent use can cause burning and stinging of the mouth and throat, often accompanied by a heavy cough. Someone who smokes marijuana regularly may have many of the same respiratory problems that tobacco smokers do, such as daily cough and phlegm production, more frequent acute chest illness, a heightened risk of lung infections, and a greater tendency to obstructed airways(10). <strong>Smoking marijuana increases the likelihood of developing cancer of the head or neck, and the more marijuana smoked the greater the increase(11). A study comparing 173 cancer patients and 176 healthy individuals produced strong evidence that marijuana smoking doubled or tripled the risk of these cancers</strong>.<br><br>Marijuana use also has the potential to promote cancer of the lungs and other parts of the respiratory tract because it contains irritants and carcinogens(12, 13). In fact, marijuana smoke contains<strong> 50 to 70 percent more carcinogenic hydrocarbons than does tobacco smoke</strong>(14). It also produces high levels of an enzyme that converts certain hydrocarbons into their carcinogenic formÂ—levels that may accelerate the changes that ultimately produce malignant cells(15). Marijuana users usually inhale more deeply and hold their breath longer than tobacco smokers do, which increases the lungsÂ’ exposure to carcinogenic smoke. <strong>These facts suggest that, puff for puff, smoking marijuana may increase the risk of cancer more than smoking tobacco</strong>.</span><br><br>Please take note tat is mention INCREASE over normal tabacco. For immune system<br><br><blockquote>Some of marijuanaÂ’s adverse health effects may occur because THC impairs the immune systemÂ’s ability to fight off infectious diseases and cancer. In laboratory experiments that exposed animal and <strong>human cells </strong>to THC or other marijuana ingredients, the normal disease-preventing reactions of many of the key types of immune cells were inhibited(16). In other studies, mice exposed to THC or related substances were more likely than unexposed mice to develop bacterial infections and tumors(17, 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.</blockquote>Your data is also wrong since tests were done on human cells as well.<br><br><blockquote>Depression(19), anxiety(20), and personality disturbances(21) have been associated with marijuana use. Research clearly demonstrates that marijuana has potential to cause problems in daily life or make a personÂ’s existing problems worse. Because marijuana compromises the ability to learn and remember information, the more a person uses marijuana the more he or she is likely to fall behind in accumulating intellectual, job, or social skills. Moreover, research has shown that marijuanaÂ’s adverse impact on memory and learning can last for days or weeks after the acute effects of the drug wear off(22, 23).<br><br>Students who smoke marijuana get lower grades and are less likely to graduate from high school, compared with their non-smoking peers(24, 25, 26, 27). A study of 129 college students found that, for heavy users of marijuana (those who smoked the drug at least 27 of the preceding 30 days), critical skills related to attention, memory, and learning were significantly impaired even after they had not used the drug for at least 24 hours(2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. The heavy marijuana users in the study had more trouble sustaining and shifting their attention and in registering, organizing, and using information than did the study participants who had used marijuana no more than 3 of the previous 30 days. As a result, someone who smokes marijuana every day may be functioning at a reduced intellectual level all of the time.<br><br>More recently, the same researchers showed that the ability of a group of long-term heavy marijuana users to recall words from a list remained impaired for a week after quitting, but returned to normal within 4 weeks(29). Thus, it is possible that some cognitive abilities may be restored in individuals who quit smoking marijuana, even after long-term heavy use.<br><br>Workers who smoke marijuana are more likely than their coworkers to have problems on the job. Several studies associate workersÂ’ marijuana smoking with increased absences, tardiness, accidents, workersÂ’ compensation claims, and job turnover. A study of municipal workers found that those who used marijuana on or off the job reported more Â“withdrawal behaviorsÂ”Â—such as leaving work without permission, daydreaming, spending work time on personal matters, and shirking tasksÂ—that adversely affect productivity and morale(30). In another study, marijuana users reported that use of the drug impaired several important measures of life achievement including cognitive abilities, career status, social life, and physical and mental health(31).</blockquote>for mental development, your report never mentioned it. Tis is the full length of it and the tests given r not wrong.<br><br>ABout your addiciton rate, it is still true tat marijuana do cause addicition. It may be less addictive to coffee but coffee so much dangerous side effect.<br><br><a href="http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofax/marijuana.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofax/marijuana.html</a></div>

Much like other amphetamines, MDMA causes these neurotransmitters to be released from their storage sites in neurons, increasing brain activity. Compared to the potent stimulant methamphetamine, MDMA triggers a larger increase in serotonin and a smaller increase in dopamine. Serotonin is a major neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, sleep, pain, emotion, and appetite, as well as other behaviors. By releasing large amounts of serotonin, and also interfering with its synthesis, MDMA leads to a significant depletion of this important neurotransmitter. As a result, it takes the human brain a significant amount of time to rebuild the store of serotonin needed to perform important physiological and psychological functions.<br><br>One hypothesis to explain the long-lasting neurotoxicity of MDMA on serotonergic systems is that MDMA induces both oxidative and metabolic stress in serotonin neurons that, in turn, adversely affect the ability of these neurons to produce serotonin. Support for this hypothesis comes from a variety of studies, including those showing that MDMA perturbs the activity of various antioxidant enzymes; artificially boosting the levels of these enzymes reduces MDMA's effects on serotonin and dopamine neurons. Also, stress appears to increase the oxidative damage caused by MDMA.<br><br>It has been difficult to study the effects of MDMA in humans under controlled conditions, and virtually impossible until recently to conduct simultaneous neurochemical studies. However, several groups of researchers have chosen to study the behavioral pharmacology of MDMA in various animal species, showing that MDMA and related compounds produce a unique behavioral profile in rodents. Studies in non-human primates suggests that acute doses of MDMA may have subtle effects on higher cognitive functions, including memory and learning. Other experiments in laboratory animals suggest that MDMA is a drug that humans are likely to abuse, and that humans may develop tolerance to MDMA's reinforcing effects. Limited studies in humans have shown that MDMA negatively impacts short-term performance on a variety of measures of cognitive ability.<br><br>Controlled studies in humans have shown that MDMA has potent effects on the cardiovascular system and on the body's ability to regulate its internal temperature. Of great concern is MDMA's adverse effect on the pumping efficiency of the heart - in the presence of MDMA, increased physical activity increases heart rate significantly, but the heart does not respond in its normal manner, which is to increase the efficiency with which it pumps blood. Since MDMA use is often associated with sustained, strenuous activity, such as dancing, MDMA's effects on the heart could increase the risk of heart damage or other cardiovascular complications in susceptible individuals.<br><br>Pharmacokinectic studies have shown that MDMA is rapidly absorbed into the human blood stream, but once in the body the metabolites of MDMA inhibit MDMA metabolism. As a result, subsequent doses of the drug produce unexpectedly high blood levels, which could worsen the cardiovascular and other adverse effects of this drug without increasing its "pleasurable" effects, which tend to peak about two hours after taking an initial dose. MDMA interferes with the metabolism of other drugs, including some of the adulterants in MDMA tablets. </span><br><br>In short, it kills people nonetheless.<br><br><a href="http://www.nida.nih.gov/Meetings/MDMA/MDMAExSummary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nida.nih.gov/Meetings/MDMA/MDMAExSummary.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okay i really cannot be arsed typing it all out again.  here goes:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">fymk said, "All of those who are supporting rights for drug traffickers to live - good for you- go look at the pain and suffering they inflict on others. I will NEVER ever change my mind about the death penalty for drug traffickers. "</span><br>So what?  You want to live in a country (read: jailcell) that:<br>(1)has robots instead of people<br>(2)is uniform, and works like clockwork<br>(3)kills non-conformers<br>(4)is the perfect world<br><br>You smoke...you cant stop now can you?  Fair enough.  Suppose you had been educated differently, there is a good chance that you wouldnt have started in the first place.  Youre in australia.  You KNOW that the people in australia have a better knowledge about drugs than the people of singapore.  whys that?  its not word on the street (it is to an extent) - its whats taught in schoools.<br>You heard of the shooting up facility in kings cross?  You see the yellow bins for sharps disposal in public toilets?  Thats ongoing education.  You dont see that in singapore do you?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">drawer said, "The world is not as simple as u think"</span>--Respect.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">mr stupiddismart said,"In short, it kills people nonetheless" with regards to MDMA.</span><br>Uh huh...that report said that the potential was there.  Oh fuk!  shieet...lets BAN water.  Ecstacy CAN kill.  Water CAN kill TOO.  You just drink enough water to exceed your kidney's ability to process it, causing extracellular osmolality to fall resulting in cellular oedema, including cerebral oedema, which CAN be fatal.  Yay...its just the fact that it CAN...<br><br>================================================<br><br>Because my post that i lost was so much longer than this one...im tired.  So heres the last point (which believe it or not, is shorter than the one i lost):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"go look at the pain and suffering they inflict on others. I will NEVER ever change my mind about the death penalty for drug traffickers. "  --fymk</span><br><br>Well...if we HAD TO HAVE A DEALTH PENALTY FOR SOMEONE (and im saying we dont...but supposing we HAD to)...I'd give it to tobacco companies before i gave it to dealers.  Make sense?<br><br>Tobacco companies ARE drug traffickers?  Nicotine is a drug yes?  Then, naturally, tobacco companies ARE most definately drug traffickers.  They make ciggies, they sell ciggies...  Are they worse than dealers?  Yes.  How much money worldwide has been spent on lung-cancer paitient care, resulting from tobacco usage?  Passive smoke can cause lungcancer/breathing problems (this is debatable - theres lots of studies giving conflicting answers).  Ciggratte butts are just...everywhere.  They may or may not be harmful to nature (im guessing they are, but dont know for sure), but they're definately an eyesore.<br><br>On the other hand, how many times have you passively snorted coke?  How many times have you passively had a trip on LSD?  How many times have you accidently taken an E tablet instead of panadol?  Cigarettes affect MORE people than illicit substances.  I dont really want to go into intensity of those affected, or to what extent people get affected.  Why?  Because so far the arguments for harsh penalities +  zero-tolerance on drugs have been suggesting that harsh penalities are "in place for the greater good of society".  In that case, cigarette smoke is a far greater problem than other illicit substances.<br><br>Oh, and guess what?  Since we're sentencing tobacco companies to death, we may as well sentence the government to death too.  You know why?  Well, its just logical.  Tobacco companies are able to traffic (damn that word sounds so much worse than "sell") tobacco products BECAUSE ITS LEGAL.  Im guessing you're smart enought to realize where this is headed.<br><br>If you havent realized where im going yet, my point is: WHY THE F*** CAN CIGARETTE COMAPANIES SELL TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND GET AWAY WITH IT LAWFULLY, WHEN PEOPLE DEALING WITH "ILLICIT" SUBSTANCES GET SHOT?<br><br>Do you know who makes substances 'illicit' and 'legal'?  Er...lets think about that for a sec...maybe THE GOVERNMENT?  Oh damn...so technically, the government is also a drug trafficker (indirectly) because they allow the sale of tobacco.<br><br>Not too radical a concept?<br></div>
