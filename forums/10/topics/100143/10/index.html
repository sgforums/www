It is stable because we is controlled. If the supply is cut off, then we control consumption.

Similar to what is happening to cigarette. </blockquote>Don't u know economics of sale ? The more people buy, the more profitable it become even though the price has dropped.

            <div class='col-md body'>okay...sorry - i havent figured out how to quote yet and havent tried because im pretty busy...<br><br>There is something wrong with the example u have given about hot stove etc. Does the children or watsoever gain anything from touching stoves or hot plates ? NONE ! They do not feel high, do not get a kick, no peers ask them to do it or do it themselves and won't enjoy the effect a single bit. Wat about drugs ? They r supposed to have a "feel good" effect on people. They can feel high, they can feel stronger, they get a kick, peers ask them to do drugs and WILL enjoy thermseves thoroughly when the drug is in effect. BUT drugs have many other effects tat is gonna kill or harm people badly. They can killl, cause brain and health damage and addiction. Tat is why it has to be prohibited ! Education DON'T WORK well at all. If education works, then NO ONE will be smoking. Why does after so many decades of education, there r still people smoking ? Smoking have a similar nature of drugs isn't it ?<br><br>--&gt;fair point, there is a problem with it, but i'll tell you if i think of something else.  but if you catch the essence of what im trying to say from that...<br><br>smoking is quite different to weed and E...  actually, smoking is totally dissimilar to all other illicit substances.<br><br>smoking (nicotine) is...let me stress...extremely physiologically addictive.<br>weed (delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinol) is psychologially addictive...if anything.<br><br>its like alcohol...(assuming you're not religious/muslim/arent against drinking),...do you ever drink beer/or any other alcoholic drink because you're chasing the TASTE of it?  or do you drink for the feeling of being tipsy/drunk?  most people drink because they chase the feeling...not the substance.<br><br>people who smoke on the other hand, chase the substance...because their body cannot function without it.  ask any smoker...and most wil tell you they hate the tatse and smell of it...its always "im trying to quit".<br><br>weed, E...most users are in love with the feeling of it...not the actual substance.<br><br>=====<br>How come in a few countries guns and arms r legal ? How come in a few countries rape is an offence where only the girls get punished while the guys get away with everything ? How come in a few countries girls can never get to work ? We talk about how majority or international organisations work. We don't talk about a few countries here and there. There r always some kind of extreme countries arounfd the world. Just because a few countries made it legal meant tat this act is accepted ? Then rape when only girls get punished should be accepted in singapore.<br><br>--&gt;fine then we'll leave other countries and the UN out of this<br><br>==========<br>thought singapore is showing tat if u do drugs, u will get these effects bla bla bla... I tell u, I am a singaporean and I have been SHOWN many many education examples about the problems from drugs ranging from posters at every place (showing pictures of effect of drugs, statement by past drug abuser, hip youngsters saying no to drugs. These full coloured posters r free of charge and they encourage everyone to stick it at their work place etc) to TV programs (popular channel 8 soap operas and many shows do show the problem of drugs. There is a police show call crime watch where frequently they reinforce the problems of drugs) to speakers in schools (CNB officers giving talks about drugs, They go for talks in your primary shcool, secondary school and JC. They even set up booth in your University. It was written in textbooks for school kids to read and compulsory for teachers to discuss.) to drug-free campaign (a whole month or week per year where there will be high profile campaign ranging from walks to road shows to carnivals to commercials and shown prominently in newspaper, news broadcast). In fact, there is a whole division of CNB officers tat try to come out with many ways to educate the public. Other than tat, how do u suggest we educate ? I hope people, instead of complaining about how inadequate our education on drugs is, suggest wat else need to be done. I really can't think of another way to educate people about problems of drugs anymore. IMO, wat can be done has already been done.<br>--&gt; well i was born and raised there and thought that drug (and sex) education there was far from adequate.  educating properly doesnt mean chucking posters of things on the wall and saying its sufficient, or running campaigns that dont work.  its making the community RELATE (thats the key word) to what you're trying to say (hopefully on a really personal level), agree with it, support it, and spread it.<br><br>did a small study into drugs with some friends for an assignemnt  linking prices, i'll effects into society: crime etc and the supply (mainly government poliies/law affecting amounts on the streets) and found that outcomes suggested that places with a decently educated public (not ghettos obviously), not super-duper strict drug laws (just short jail terms), didnt have that much more crime, drugs were cheaper, quality of drugs were higher (meaning...that trips/effects were better...as well as pills not being laced with bad shit).  im not saying its conclusive, im not saying everyone should bow down and listen...because i could be quite wrong.  if you know of any additional info...please tell because my mates are still wondering if our conclusion was accurate.</div>

Agree with me yes?<br><br>now the physiological part of it is that nicotine remains in your system (for a period of approximately 24hours i think) but you lose the effects of it on you in a lot less time than that.  now, after a couple hours...your mind (psychological) will start telling you that you need another one.<br><br>lets say you ignore that voice in the back of your head...and wait 24hours till the nicotine gets out of your system.  you'll find (if youre not a light/causual/social smoker) that your body will start showing physial withdrawl symptoms...fevers, breaking out in a cold sweat...you feel sick, lethargic etc.<br><br>with weed (THC), it is psychologically addictive: your MIND tells you you like the high...the euphoria.  but your body (unlike cigerates) does not tell you that you need to ingest the substance for it to work.  its all in the mind.  since its all in the mind...one can actually ignore mental cravings for it (casual users of weed dont really crave).<br><br>btw the two links you posted.,..<br>the one on weed is crap.<br>the one on E is better...if i had drug education in singapore my way, everyone would know most of whats on that page.<br><br>education shouldnt just be civics and moral ed (i cant remember clearly...but i htink it was done in chinese in my primary school - and i failed chinese...lucky it was done in english in secondary school).  education should go as far as to make students (or allow them the option of doing english/GP essays on drugs.  they could be allowed to argue for, against, or write chem/bio papers on effects (both good and bad) of drugs.  when it gets to that extent, and if it still doesnt work, then i give up.<br><br><span class="large">Drugs have some substance tat give off these effects as well. R u saying cocaine or ice of drugs do not give off a substance dependent effect ? Weed also contain the addictive substance as cigerrettes as well.
