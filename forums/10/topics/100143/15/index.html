Then I guess no one can teach to others about anything ! FYI, showering is not equal to washing your head. According to civic and moral education they recomend u to wash your hair at least once per week. Anything wrong with tis statement or u just wanna argue for the sake of arguing ? Why don't u try to shred these few pieces of information ? Showering at least once per day, brushing your teeth at least once or twice per day and washing your hair at least once per week. Don't do drugs, don't have unsafe sex, don't change your sex partner often, be wary of cheats and strangers, be careful with money, wash your hands before eating, try to eat a balance diet, exercise regularly, drink plenty of water, sleep in a well ventilated room, when sick inform your parents etc. Tear these into shreds ! Show it to me ! Complain about it and tear it into pieces ! Tear any of the above list of actions to shreds lah ! </blockquote>They (the public) can be informed.  But they're brainwashed.  Can someone please tell me i'm wrong if they think i am because i dont want to start looking like a dickhead if no one else agrees with me?<br>My first point after reading that whole paragraph is: "dont do this", "dont do that", but...WHY NOT?  People are people.  People are aware.  People ask questions.<br><br>Try to eat a balanced diet?  There was Health Ed in singapore if i remember right... and that was in Primary school.  So how many teens know what an Atkins diet is?  Or what the pros and cons of low/high carb diets are?<br><br><blockquote>U r just biased against singapore education.. tat is all. </blockquote>Probably so.  You cant really blame me though.  Look at the forums in the papers about Mandarin being taught in school.  That was a fair while ago.  I'm not sure whats in the papers these days.  Havent read the straits times in a year.<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Washing and keeping really really clean actually doesnt allow your immune system to develop fully because you're so clean. </span><br>U r talking nonsense here. Then u r encouraging people not to shower lah ! U r encouraging people not to wash hairs lah ! U r encouraging people not to brush teeth lah ! Might as well teach people to eat unclean food and not visit doctor to build up your immune system as well. These guidelines r recommended by the doctors and health agencies. SO your idea is better than people from there ? </blockquote>Nonsense eh?  Well i only quickly got on the net, and just pulled the first article that i found.<br>(most papers ive read conern AIRBORNE allergies but i'll look around if you want me to find others)<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASTHMA/ALLERGY EPIDEMIC:<br>IS CLEANLINESS THE CULPRIT? (extract)<br>A lack of exposure to microbes may be contributing to the asthma and allergy epidemic in developed nations, a new Italian study suggests.  "Indeed, we found that infections transmitted by contaminated food and the orofecal route were inversely related--in a dose-dependent manner--to atopy and respiratory allergies," lead study author Paolo M. Matricardi, MD, recently told RESPIRATORY REVIEWS.<br><br>The results might help to explain why asthma and allergy rates have sharply increased in developed nations, where inhabitants typically practice good personal hygiene and have a semisterile diet. Ironically, some studies suggest that such cleanliness may prevent adequate exposure to pathogens that infect the gut and stimulate lymphoid tissue to produce the right (not allergic) immune response against airborne allergens.</span><br><br><blockquote>They ask u how often to shower u answer back tat don't shower at all to build up your immune system. U still deserve to fail. Simple as tat. </blockquote>really?  dont i deserve a spot with the researchers?<br><br><blockquote>Someone can also justify their reason if they go around murdering someone and commit theft too. Going by your theory, u can go and visit all prostitutes in the world when u r single as well. But then u r doing something not recomended. Do u recomend all your single friends or future children to visit prostitution ?  </blockquote>Yeah well if someone's starving, you wouldnt shoot him or her if they stole money for food would you?<br>If someone shot G W Bush, honestly i wouldnt really give a shit.<br>Yes, no ones stopping you from visiting hookers.  Why youd want to is a different matter though.  Would i recommend my friends and kids to visit a brothel?  Well, not really, because id like to think that my friends and kids are cool enough to get enough.<br><br><blockquote><br>Well, then A bengs r better than u since they can pass such a simple test while u fail at it. They probably know how to be more clean and hygiene than u... Now I know why u r so pissed off at it.. because u fail at it while people with poorer grades get better result than u. </blockquote>Yes, probably.  They must have sound morals and will most probably grow up to be extremely successful people running really lucrative businesses.<br><br><blockquote><br>It meant something to people who do not know of such things such as young children </blockquote>take your word for it.<br><br><blockquote>Yes, i listed everything, correctly too i might add. The point i was trying to raise was more like...what sort of stupid question is that? Supposing CME lessons actually worked...then you dont want to be asking dimwit questions like that. You want to be asking about harmful effects + such in the hope of "psyching" people into not doing drugs. Singapore's all about "psycho-ing" people not to do things due to serious, unreasonable, harsh repercussions. Since Singapore works that way, then CME papers should too. Wheres the consistency?<br><br>Why was it a stupid question ? it is meant to see if u pay attention during classes. If no one pay attention then CME lessons don't work. If tat is a stupid question then maths test r stupid questions as well. They give u a problem where the teachers have a problem finding it. Your latter part of question seems to be wierd. Knowing wat is the street names of drug is important too because if u don't know wat drugs to be wary of, u might be taking them yourself unknowingly. U can't expect the test to test on everything isn't it ? Tis is one aspect tat can be tested as well. They tell u about the possible repercussion of it. They tell u not to do drugs etc. And u have a problem with the test because they didn't test u on wat u had spotted before ? </blockquote>Ever heard that you dont eat what you dont recognize?<br><br><blockquote><br>How to tell your friend drugs is not a cool thing to do has a close formula for it ? I thought tis is so open ended ! It is a discussion question and u do nto like it as well ! Wat is the problem with u ? </blockquote>Oh im pissed of because ah bengs are better than me.<br>I didnt understand your sentence.  Want to reword it?<br><br><blockquote>Wat do u view eduction as ? Going by wat u say every thing is brainwashing. U tell people not to leave their needles around is also brainwashing. U tell them to do drugs safely is also brainwashing. U tell peopel not to do durgs is also brainwashing. Like tat how ? Don't educate meh? </blockquote>I think brainwashing is more of "dont do this".  Telling people not to chuck needles around is more of a "dont do this BECAUSE of this".<br><br><blockquote>More complains and no suggestions </blockquote>im too stupid.<br><br><blockquote><br>U tell people tat tis is a realistic world and there r people bound to be drug takers. And so wat does tis naturally point us to ? </blockquote>Obviously you're thinking that it points to the legalization of drugs.  Youve been smart enough to aruge this far, im sure your intellectual skills will help you come up with other solutions.  In other countries, they acknowledge the fact that there are drug users.  Have they legalized it?  Some have, but the ones that havent...what have they done?<br><br><blockquote><br>can we both agree that the law doesnt differentiate accurately between the two? or are you going to debate more?<br><br>They can. The amount is too much for a normal drug taker to have. </blockquote>So a drug user is someone with 19g of heroin, and a drug trafficker has 20g?  Thats real smart.<br><br><blockquote><br>U got a problem, I don't. U don't care about the laws in singapore, then why do u paste a passage from roberteh and want me to answer to them ? I answer it then u say u actually don't care ? Then ask me for wat ! </blockquote>I dont have a problem really.  You do.  You live there.  I mean I like singapore and such (omg the shopping), but education really seems to be lacking in some way.</div>

I will continue, but tis is probably the last reply I will post in tis thread because tis is too time consuming and getting to be more and more dumb by the minute.<br><br><blockquote>No, im saying that proper education will inform the general public better.

But at least you have things like Farenheight 9/11 being released in mainstream cinemas. If I came up with a movie like that about Singapore's leaders, I'd probably get shot. </blockquote>Do the United nations recommend all countries to come up with films tat ridicule the country's politicians ?

But it is not meant to be a lesson where many facts and figures r squashed into u. We r not training them to win "who wants to be a millionaire" or something. The more facts were put into CME lessons, the more boring it become and the more people will states tat CME lessons r brainwashing people. Looking at the question u have listed, frankly I only know the answer for a few of them. However, CME also don't even tell people wat happen if they take too much panadol, take too much proteins, shouldn't burn plastic as the fumes r dangerous, shouldn't rear a tiger in case u get eaten, looking at pollution in detail etc too. There is just too much facts out there in tis world ! U can't possibly teach them everything ! They didn't teach pollution of the environment in detail as well, so does tat mean the education do not care about the fate of the world ? NO ! CME is only meant as an introductory course to some basic facts. It is not a lesson tat fed u so much information tat u can become a mini expert in tat field.<br><br><blockquote>Well technically, crossing the road is actually NOT gambling. Gambling used in the above context as i used it in is defined by the online Merriam-Webster dictionary as "playing a game for money or propertly". I can't see how jay-walking wins you either money or property. Can you? Please tell me if you do...i like thinking laterally. </blockquote>There r several meanings to gambling. Yours is not the only one. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=gambling" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=gambling</a> states tat gambling also meant<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To take a risk in the hope of gaining an advantage or a benefit</span><br><br>The risk is getting killed by a car while the benefit is crossing the road. Certainly u do not ned to think too laterally to figure tat out.<br><br><blockquote>Well i think the average male under 17 isnt taught about females enough. How many males (we're talking in school, that arent science nerds) know how the contraceptive pill works? How many females in that same age actually know how to put on a condom properly? </blockquote>Frankly u really look down on the people here. IMO they know about these sexuality business more than u expect them to be. In fact they may had known much more than they should<br><br><blockquote>How about the ones that decide to do drugs? What do they get? What information do they get? What support do they get? Hmmm? </blockquote>They get a lot of information if they find hard enough.

People are people. People are aware. People ask questions. </blockquote>If going by your theory of brainwash, everything educational is brainwashing people. SIngapore Civic and moral education do not say tat "u must eat balanced meal" without telling them wat does each meant to an individual. They do explain wat happened if u take too little vitamins or take too much fat etc. They do explain the facts to them. It is a course where teachers is also present. If they do not understand, they can ask as well.<br><br><blockquote>Nonsense eh? Well i only quickly got on the net, and just pulled the first article that i found.<br>(most papers ive read conern AIRBORNE allergies but i'll look around if you want me to find others) </blockquote>And wat is your conclusion ? Don't bath, don't brush teeth and don't wash your hair ? Com'on the paper only say tat allergies MAY be because the environment is too clean. They do not go about saying tat WE MUST purposely keep ourselves dirty by not bathing etc. No one will know for sure if u will be affected by allergies etc if u bath too much. But they can be sure u get dental problems, baldness, skin dieseases and social problem if u do not perform proper cleanliness. The resercher themselves do kept proper hygiene as well. The bottom line is u still have to clean yourself properly.<br><br><blockquote>really? dont i deserve a spot with the researchers</blockquote>By claiming a fact tat even grandparents and children know it to be wrong (no bathing, brushing teeth and washing hair) ? No, u don't deserve a spot with the researcher yet.<br><br><blockquote>Yeah well if someone's starving, you wouldnt shoot him or her if they stole money for food would you</blockquote>No, but I will certainly call the police if a snatch theft steals my bag or pickpocket pick my wallet etc. U won't do tat ?<br><br><blockquote>If someone shot G W Bush, honestly i wouldnt really give a @%*&amp;. </blockquote>If someone kill your loved ones and give a sh!tty reason for it, will u give a danm ?<br><br><blockquote>Yes, no ones stopping you from visiting hookers. Why youd want to is a different matter though. Would i recommend my friends and kids to visit a brothel? Well, not really, because id like to think that my friends and kids are cool enough to get enough. </blockquote>The things is, it is normal and correct for people to discourage people from performing such actions. U on the other hand encourage peopel to visit prostitute and brothels just because no one is complaining about it. So wat should be taught and wat is not to be taught to these children ? Why don't u ask around and which person agree with u tat education for young children should remove safe sex and implement your versiob of wild sex.<br><br><blockquote>Ever heard that you dont eat what you dont recognize</blockquote>Peer pressure is very real. If a friend ask u to try out a new pill and u know nothing about it (never pay attention to CME lessons lah) most likely he will try it out as his friends recommended. If a friend ask u to try a new fruit or new chinese cuisine, u will have a high chance of eating it or try it out isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>How to tell your friend drugs is not a cool thing to do has a close formula for it ?

Wat is the problem with u ?<br><br>Oh im pissed of because ah bengs are better than me.<br>I didnt understand your sentence. Want to reword it?</blockquote>No problem. U like discussion question right ? So in your civic and moral test the teacher ask how do u discourage people to take drugs. Tis is an argumentative question and there r many possible answers for it. U can say it is not cool, it is not healthy, it is unlawful etc etc etc. There r many answers for it. However u do not like tat question, attempts to fail it and say it is not a real argumentative essay. Doesn't tat make u appears to be unreasonable and demand for argumentative questions yet hate them at the same time ?<br><br><blockquote> think brainwashing is more of "dont do this". Telling people not to chuck needles around is more of a "dont do this BECAUSE of this</blockquote>They do tell u the reason why we do not leave the sharp around.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Please don't keep assuming tat singapore education do not go about explaining thing to u. Frankly wat school have u went before ? I will not sent or recommend anyone to go to tat school.<br><br><blockquote>Obviously you're thinking that it points to the legalization of drugs.

So which side r u standing on ?<br><br><blockquote>So a drug user is someone with 19g of heroin, and a drug trafficker has 20g? Thats real smart. </blockquote>True, someone with 19 grams is safe. But is there anything funny with it ? In singapore the legal age to watch RA film is 21. SO 20 year old people can't see it. U think tat is funny ? Somewhere a line has to be cut isn't it ? If they put the age at 20, someone is gonna complain why 19 years old can't watch it too ? Don't u find tat lame ? Tat is real lame.<br><br><blockquote>I dont have a problem really. You do.

If information was fed to people in a way that informed them on reasons as to why or why not, and allowed them to make their own free choice, it'd be different.

I believe any student you ask will tell you that our education system is lackign in one way or another (includign me). And indeed it is; it places far too much focus on maths and Sciences, and as a result, our arts scene has suffered because LKY, for decades, considered it to be a "luxury". In fact, it is possibly still suffering, since the govt seems more interested in hiring foreign performers to the Esplanade, instead of local ones. well, a leopard can't change its spots....<br><br>*sigh*<br><br>the sincere pikamaster<br><br>(who IS a student btw)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ehh..We should not review our drug laws.So far, our country is having the strictest laws for drug offenders.Personally, I think the death penalty for drug traffickers itself is very cruel. In a case where someone is caught at the borders with drugs and only forown consumption, do you think that the government will bend it that way? Softening our DrugsLaw would meant more trafficker will try to bring in these things. As for the recently arrested high flyers who took drugs, I think they deserve it. Although rich, loaded and laden, it doesnt mean they will have some leeway because in the eyes of the law, everyone is fair and thus they should be treated the same way when a poor man is caught with drugs.</div>
