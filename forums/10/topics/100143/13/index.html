            <div class='col-md body'>Hey peoples, hows it going?  Its 40 friggin degrees here and my place lacks airconditioning.  Anyway, here we go again......<br><br><blockquote>fymk:<br>"Those illicit drugs are banned for a very good reason. They result in mind altering episodes which results in danger to self and danger to others. "<br>Illicit drugs can result in social problems of a bigger magnitude (stealing for drugs , homocidal paranoia etc). </blockquote>Those illicit drugs result in mind altering episodes of dangerous levels if abused.  Moderation is the key isnt it?  The topic of economics and drug laws has already been brought up so I wont go over it again.  Smoking is a big arse problem in society.  If im not wrong, cigerattes kill the most people.<br><br><blockquote>Don't tell me what you know about how it works - unless you have tried them . I've seen the human results of what those illicit drugs can do in australia and frankly I wish they have the death penalty for drug traffickers in australia as well."</blockquote>Yeah well, what sort of human results have you seen?  Okay, let me put 2 and 2 together here.  Youve said you work in a medical institute.  ASSUMING that you DO NOT hang around with drug users (at parties, etc), it is fair to say that the only human results you've seen have occured at the hospital.  May I ask if you're trying to say that what you see in the hospital is an accurate reflection of what is happening everywhere else?<br><br>I've seen results too, both o/d's and just normal usage.  May i ask you if you've tried any sort of illicit substance?  If you haven't, wouldn't it be a little out of place going on what reports and medical texts say?  I can quite safely tell you that you probably do not know what "extreme euphoria" actually is like.<br><br><blockquote>stupiddissmart<span style="font-style: italic;">a lot of difference. its really not my place to go around saying how to improve it, im just saying it should be revised. australian drug education actually happens to be extremely different, and i would comment on this if i knew more. let me read up a bit. </span><br>Then go and read up lor. But before u read up it is unfair for u to complain too much </blockquote>I would read up if i had the time.  Am i complaining?  Im just remarking.<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">i am a kid. i'll see if i can pull up statistics before i comment further. </span><br>I don't know man.. why do u keep harping ont he point tat u r a kid ? My guess is, u pika and gazelle r actually friends in the same school. Anyway it is just a guess </blockquote>1) because i am<br>2) because (assuming im correct in saying that you're older) i probably remember my school days better, and the methods of teaching i experienced were probably more updated than yours.<br>3) your guess is...i dont know about them - they may or may not know each other.<br><br><blockquote>I am sure, the report I have atached do claims tat the harmful effects r worse than cigerrettes </blockquote>and you're going to go on what you read in that report?  im pretty sure i could pull up a report written in the netherlands or someplace like that that says otherwise (with softer drugs).<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">it is impossible to ban it? are you saying that we dont ban it because "its too hard to"? marijuana has been out since plants were created. MJ and tobacco are both plant derived, dont tell me that mj is a new creation. when, may i ask, did i ever ask for drugs to be legalized? </span>Why not ? How long has people start smoking marijuana, not how long has it been evolved into marijuana. If u do not ask for drugs to be legalise, then how come u say keep talking about cigerrettes ? From tis statement u already do know the diff between cigerettes and drugs isn't it ? </blockquote>Er, what?  I didnt understand the 2nd bit of that paragraph.  In the first part im guessing you want to know how long MJ has been around for?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"In the Judaic world, the vapors from burnt spices and aromatic gums were considered part of the pleasurable act of worship. In Proverbs (27:9) it is said that 'Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart.' Perfumes were widely used in Egyptian worship. Stone altars have been unearthed in Babylon and Palestine, which have been used for burning incense made of aromatic wood and spices. While the casual readers today may interpret such practices as mere satisfaction of the desire for pleasant odors, this is almost certainly an error; in many or most cases, a psychoactive drug was being inhaled. In the islands of the Mediterranean 2,500 years ago and in Africa hundreds of years ago, for example leaves and flowers of a particular plant were often thrown upon bonfires and the smoke inhaled; the plant was marijuana." (Edward Preble and Gabriel V. Laurey, Plastic Cement: The Ten Cent Hallucinogen, International Journal of the Addictions, 2 (Fall 2967): 271-272.)</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>"It is recorded that the Chinese Taoist recommended the addition of cannabis to their incense burners in the 1st century as a means of achieving immortality." (Marijuana, the First Twelve Thousand Years, by Earnest Abel, page 5) </span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>"Herodotus in the fifth century B.C. observed the Scythians throwing hemp on heated stone to create smoke and observed them inhaling this smoke."(Herodotus, Histories 1.202.) </span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Cultivation of the Cannabis sativa plant dates back thousands of years. The first written account of cannabis cultivation is found in Chinese records dating from 28 B.C., according to the book "Buzzed: The Straight Facts About the Most Used and Abused Drugs from Alcohol to Ecstasy." However, the book's authors point out that the plant was likely cultivated long before then. They recount the discovery of a nearly 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy containing traces of THC, the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Prehistoric evidence for tobacco use in South America may go back som efifteen hundred years in the case of an assemblage of shamanÂ’s paraphernalia from NiÃ±o Korin, sixteen hundred years in a Nasca burial (WassÃ©n 1972:7-114; Bruhn et al. 1976:45) or even as far as three thousand years, in the case of tubular pipes from MarajÃ³ Island (Meggers and Evans 1957:197, fig. 5<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> and the lower Amazon (Hilbert 1968 pl. 12). But ritual tobacco is certainly much older on the continent than these dates suggest.Â” The parent species of Nicotiana rustica and N. Tabacum have have been cultivated as far back as 8,000 years ago, and may be the first cultivated plant of the Americas. (Furst 1976:27).</span><br><br>It seems that MJ may not be as recent as Tobacco (8,000years vs 3,000)...but they have virtually been around as long as civilazation.<br><br><blockquote>How do u know I am much older than u ? Maybe u r older than me, nobody knows. Wat r the things tat singapore disregards according to UN recommendations ? Please quote to me an example </blockquote>okay i dont know exactly.  i will check.  off the top of my head, and i cant remember much about this topic, singapore doesnt allow unions.  If i am correct, one of the articles in the Declaration of Human Rights recommends that the formation and joining of a union is to be allowed.  Another wild thought off the top off my head is the censored media.  ie, the government owns TV + Papers.  Sounds a bit dodgey...<br><br>Regarding the bible + religion debate, i think we should keep religion out.  Everyone knows the bible conflicts with itself here and there.  Also, if i remember correctly (and i might not), the book of Exodus came before the 10 Commandments.  So the 10 commandments could thus have "void" previous recommendations.  I could be very wrong though - its been ages since i last went to a service.<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">i did say that it doesnt reflect all views of singaproeans. but quite honestly, if you think the education is up to your expectations, id say you were wrong. feel free to tell me you think otherwise though.</span><br>U r wrong. I have said it. I have givewn countless examples and actions of wat gov had done to promote awareness of drugs. Wat had u provide other than a girl's account ? I hope tat girl is not u or your friend yourself<br></blockquote>Okay that was a mate.  But i didnt ask her to doctor that email, i just asked her what she thought personally.  But keep that out of the discussion since you dont want it.<br><br>Okay, you have given countless examples and actions of what the government has done to promote awareness of drugs?  Let me turn this argument right back at ya, and ask YOU if you think that your satisfaction for drug education reflects the other bloody 4 million people in the country.<br><br>Do you ever stop to think that your countless examples and actions (conducted by the gov't) that you may have noticed, may have gone unnoticed by everyone else?<br><br>Did you stop to think that your personal account reflects Singapore?<br><br><strong>What do others here think about drug education in Singapore when they were in school?</strong><br><br><blockquote>Qitai, "I believe this topic is on death penalty of drug Trafficker rather than drug user. "</blockquote>How do you differentiate between a user and a trafficker?  Ive seen people with more than 500g of MJ and they arent traffickers.<br><br><blockquote><br>fymk, "My stance on the death penalty is solid - I wish the drug traffickers death and the world free from drug abuse........If we cut off the drug traffickers' access to them(users) by killing off the drug traffickers , we will have less of a problem.........I don't see the same problems in Singapore as in australia - not in the hospitals.....Frankly I just wish I could bring in the capital punishment for drug traffickers for each and every drug abuse victim I see in australia. However I am only but one singaporean , so I just use australia to compare . "</blockquote>Holy $hit you are a bloody tyrant-nazi aren't you?  I can understand how easy it'd be to just kill people you didnt like, but thats a bit inhumane isnt it?  I mean i'd like to just walk around with a gun and shoot people that pissed me off, but it really wouldnt work.  You want a perfect world, and thats not gonna happen.<br>You dont see the same problems in Singapore?  Maybe thats because there are about 16million people less in Singapore compared with Oz.  And anyone in singapore wouldnt really want to go to a hospital because they'd get into trouble with coppers.</div>

We do not want to punish the user but instead focus on giving harsh punishment to trafficker. In singapore, they use the rule tat if someone carry more than the stipulated amount of drugs, then he is the trafficker. It sems to be reasonable since if the drug user knows tis rule, they will not carry so much drugs with them at all times. Only a trafficker will be forced to carry such amount when he need to sell or smuggle drugs into the country.<br><br>How long can 500 gram of pure weed last ?<br><br></div>

I think CME classes are really really lame excuses for a class.<br><br>So, how might one go about teaching a class about drugs (or morals etc)?  Maybe if it wasnt done out of a textbook?  Maybe if more active discussion was promoted?  Maybe instead of just putting a video into the VCR, watching it, and saying that "we've taught them about drugs", active discussions with brainstorms, and other activities that makes individuals RELATE to what the topic of concern is.  It's no use lecturing or reading out of a textbook, because unless someone relates to something on a personal level, it isnt retained very well.  Also, allowing teenagers to come up with their own 'ethics and morals' (if you will) regarding drugs would be better than drilling it into their heads.

            <div class='col-md body'>To: Gazelle,<br><br>If 20 grams and death are the key issues here, then it is only right to discuss these two issues more logically.<br><br>All the responses so far have not dealt sufficiently with these two issues in my opinion except for the persistent and repetitious emphasis on dangers of pure hard drugs.<br><br>Men in parliament may not be up to their missions in passing laws justly or objectively. It will be for citizens to tell them if their conscience or sense of justice still exist under our particular time and circumstances. Time has changed. People now not only want government to pass laws or take actions to prevent spread of dangerous drugs to protect the innocent, they also want to know how and to what extent drug possessor should be justly punished.<br><br>Just because drugs are dangerous does not mean that government must send possessor of some 20 grams of hard drugs to the gallow. Remember, we are not gods but by insisting on 20 grams, we may play gods. After all, humans are not perfect. Education counts. Preventative measures count. Unemployment situation (or performance of government) also counts.<br><br>If someone is found in possession of justifiably higher amount of hard drugs (experts can revisit the types and quantum) that point more conclusively to perpetration of drug evil, nobody will disagree with imposition of death penalty. However, if not, there should be at least some benefits of the doubt to avoid over-doing the death penalty.<br><br>Let there be a certain compassion if such possessor is able to expose the mastermind or direct drug syndicate. He may not be the satan himself to deserve death penalty. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thing is..the establishment wants to play God, that's why they set a definitive sentence of capital punishment where even the Appellate Judges cannot do anything to sentence otherwise, barring a Presidential pardon which would then be commuted to life imprisonment.I hardly think the people who sentence the traffickers to death have any capacity to decide how much the guilt is on each accused, instead the whole template is already in place and it emasculates judicial powers for rational and coherent legal debate.Thus, the judge is but a n instrument of an unjust law, because he is unable to perform the primary focus of his job, which is to intepret the law accordingly to each case.Therefore,I would call for the reformation of the death penalty statutes in Singapore.</div>

I have seen these ads on tv.  I have watched crimewatch (or whatever similar programs that were around up till 2000).  I have heard the talks too in school. And seen the videos shown in high school, primary school.<br><br>The only question im raising is - how effective are these classes/methods?  All your listed examples of 'education' basically give one message: dont do drugs.  Teens ask more than that.  Why not do drugs?  What happens if one does?  How should one consume a drug safely if one decides to take that option?  Can you, or any average student in Singapore answer that?  You might, but the average citizen cant.<br>Yes CME classes are lame.  Number one, they teach absolute values/morals.  In that i mean, they teach morals like Laws.  Moral education isnt about following an explicit set or rules that make one 'a good person'.  Moral education should be about nurturing and making subjects develop their own personal morals, based on personal values and principles.  That doesnt happen.  So yes, they are lame.<br><br>By the way, i failed a "Civics and Moral Education" test in secondary 2.  May i ask you what sort of riduciously retarded idea that is?  Who the hell goes about setting written exams testing one's "morals"?  Morals arent "Yes or No", "Right or Wrong" things that you can mark.  The whole point, it seems to me personally, of moral education is to make everyone believe the same morals and values.  Thats bs.  You cant make people do that agasint their will.  You may say that they are free to not conform with the "prescribed" values, but the consequence of that is failing a Moral Ed Test, or being labelled not morally-upright.  Anyway, CME classes seem more like brainwashing (and blackmailing) classes than educative/informative classes.<br><br>the officers et al just seem to spew bs about drug education.  They basically say: dont do them.  if you do, you'll get in shit with the law, and wreck your life.  Thats basically it.  Thats a bit pathetic coming from a trained professional that is supposed to educated public awareness.<br><br><blockquote>FYI, civic and edu do let the students talk and discuss about such issues as well.

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of people have gone out of point. U don't like the gov, fine. Every country have people who do not like the policies of the country. But then , wat has it got to do wth death penalty ? U feel singapore is a secular state, then u either go to join as a politician and change the country, migrate out or live with it. If u wanna talk about it, there r many other threads available for it. Please don't let your hatred for singapore cloud your judgement about the jurisdiction.<br><br><blockquote>If you havent know, you dont get death sentence for smuggling designer drugs. Go do some homework first before coming out here and question your uncle. Want to comment on tis statement?</blockquote>Why don't u tell me wat designer drugs r u talking about ? Maybe u r just ignorant enough not to know it is too banned in singapore<br><br><blockquote>I would presume that all the above are uneccesary since you have proven that death sentence alone is the most effective way to control drug problem in any part of the world? Should we consider getting rid of the CNB division so that we can save all tax payers money? </blockquote>Why will it be unnecessary ? U know wat u r talking about ?<br><br><blockquote>To: Gazelle,<br><br>If 20 grams and death are the key issues here, then it is only right to discuss these two issues more logically.</blockquote>Tat is good advice for u. The more u write the more dumber u look. If u have nothing sensible to say, then just keep quiet<br><br><blockquote>Men in parliament may not be up to their missions in passing laws justly or objectively. It will be for citizens to tell them if their conscience or sense of justice still exist under our particular time and circumstances. </blockquote>Tat is funny, the people who had the most qualification to set laws r the parliament. Othewise how ? No one set the laws and let the land become lawless ?<br><br><blockquote>Time has changed. People now not only want government to pass laws or take actions to prevent spread of dangerous drugs to protect the innocent, they also want to know how and to what extent drug possessor should be justly punished.</blockquote>Circumstances had not changed. In the past, people had placed protection of the public higher than compassion for criminals. Now they too placed protection for the public higher than drug traffickers.<br><br><blockquote>Just because drugs are dangerous does not mean that government must send possessor of some 20 grams of hard drugs to the gallow. Remember, we are not gods but by insisting on 20 grams, we may play gods. After all, humans are not perfect. Education counts. Preventative measures count. Unemployment situation (or performance of government) also counts. </blockquote>I had said many times till now. We hang drug trafficker. Drug traffickers sell drugs or facilate the selling of drugs to other people. How to judge if u r a drug trafficker or not, it is by the amount of drugs he hold. Is tis method accurate in deciding if he is a drug user or trafficker ? Drug users know wat is the amount tat will warrant the death penalty. They know it better than u or me because they do not want to die as well. 20 grams may sound to be little to u, but it can last them for a long time. Thre amount of nicotine in a cigerettes come to mere milligrams. A user won't need to have so much drugs with them. The only reason why does one carry so much drugs is because he is a drug trafficker.<br><br>Education counts, but we had done it. Preventive measures count, and we had done it. Unemployment situation is a bit off... So if economic propects of the country is not good, we let all the theives and drug traffickers off ?<br><br><blockquote>Let there be a certain compassion if such possessor is able to expose the mastermind or direct drug syndicate. He may not be the satan himself to deserve death penalty</blockquote>It is done tis way here. So our stand on tis issue is the same<br><br><blockquote>Thing is..the establishment wants to play God, that's why they set a definitive sentence of capital punishment where even the Appellate Judges cannot do anything to sentence otherwise, barring a Presidential pardon which would then be commuted to life imprisonment.I hardly think the people who sentence the traffickers to death have any capacity to decide how much the guilt is on each accused, instead the whole template is already in place and it emasculates judicial powers for rational and coherent legal debate.Thus, the judge is but a n instrument of an unjust law, because he is unable to perform the primary focus of his job, which is to intepret the law accordingly to each case.Therefore,I would call for the reformation of the death penalty statutes in Singapore.</blockquote>On com'on man.. talking about god again ? Then all countries r playing god since they too have laws tat have minimal allowances. When "god" play with laws, worse problems have surfaced<br><br>[</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>are you saying the proportion of deaths from illcit drugs is lower than the proportion of deaths from cancer caused my smoking? since youre so sure, show stats. </blockquote>The report I have given have given facts tat the proportion of death is higher.<br><br><blockquote>Higher probability of addiction? I know of more people getting addicted to nicotine than to coke+herion. </blockquote>As said before, u know more people. Why it is because smoking is popular everywhere. It is out of point.<br><br><blockquote>yes i have. how different? the degree of dissimilarity or the difference in methods? The degree is difference is massive. </blockquote>Wat is it tat is different ? Tell me about it<br><br><blockquote>do i look like a researcher? what level is singapore on? what sort of scale would you like me to answer that with? i cant really answer it accurately can i? can you</blockquote>Then why r u complaining about something u don't know much about ? U r no researcher so why r u talking about censorship etc ?<br><br><blockquote>The only question im raising is - how effective are these classes/methods? All your listed examples of 'education' basically give one message: dont do drugs. Teens ask more than that. Why not do drugs? What happens if one does? How should one consume a drug safely if one decides to take that option? Can you, or any average student in Singapore answer that? You might, but the average citizen cant. </blockquote>tat is the thing, they do not want u to do drugs. Why not do drugs, they show u all in the posters, talks, lessons and crime watch u had watched isn't it ? Wat happen if one does ? Then the advice is go to police. How can one consume drugs safely ? Because it is never safe when u do drugs. )But they do advice on not sharing syringes etc too) U have already perform something illegal. Do any country teaches u wat to do if u commit theft ? Do other country tell u wat to do if u murder someone ? Do other countries teach u how to gamble if u need to gamble ? We don't offer other options for these behaviors. It is the same as we don't offer choices to people to see if they want to murder or commit theft. Wat u r talking about is <strong>not education on not using drugs</strong>, u r educating people <strong>how to use drugs </strong>! Does gazelle and other talk education on how to use drugs or education on not to use drugs ?<br><br><blockquote>Yes CME classes are lame. Number one, they teach absolute values/morals. In that i mean, they teach morals like Laws. Moral education isnt about following an explicit set or rules that make one 'a good person'. Moral education should be about nurturing and making subjects develop their own personal morals, based on personal values and principles. That doesnt happen. So yes, they are lame.</blockquote>They r not lame. They inform people on expected society behaviors or correct livign lifestyles. It is not explicit rules or anything. They acts to inform u wat normal people should do. In primary schools, they tell u tat normal people shoud bath everyday. They tell u tat a person of moral should not have sex indiscriminately. They tell u to follow the laws. They also inform u tat doing drugs is not wat is expected of nrmal people. So u feel damned offended about it informing u and say it is lame ? All people have been exposed to diffeent things. I felt tat it is important for developing normal people. As said before, it depend on the attitude of the people taking the lesson. Perhaps they felt education is only about taking exams.<br><br><blockquote>By the way, i failed a "Civics and Moral Education" test in secondary 2. May i ask you what sort of riduciously retarded idea that is? Who the hell goes about setting written exams testing one's "morals"? Morals arent "Yes or No", "Right or Wrong" things that you can mark. The whole point, it seems to me personally, of moral education is to make everyone believe the same morals and values. Thats bs. You cant make people do that agasint their will. You may say that they are free to not conform with the "prescribed" values, but the consequence of that is failing a Moral Ed Test, or being labelled not morally-upright. Anyway, CME classes seem more like brainwashing (and blackmailing) classes than educative/informative classes. </blockquote>I don't remeber knowing anyone who fails their civic and moral education. I don't know man.. can u get wrong when they ask basic facts like asking u how many times do u need to bath ? Do u get a wrong answer if they ask u how should u view drugs. If a person answer tat doing drugs is perfectly fine, I will fail tat person outright as well. Why ? because it is really morally and a civic wrong.<br><br><blockquote>Actually I do expect secondary school students to come up with discussions like that. They are quite capable of it...they just dont excel in active discussions because most (seem) too afraid of being persecuted for coming up with ideas that are not seen as the norm. </blockquote>Another reason is because there is really nothing to argue about in dealing with drugs. U r arguing in a different manner than the rest of the people. U r arguing tat drugs is right, and people should do drugs. I guess u r really the only one arguing about tis now. The rest of the people do view drugs as a problem in society<br><br><blockquote>What do you mean by PURE weed? Theres different grades. For example, hydroponically grown weed would get you a lot more stoned than bush weed. Hashish/or bong resin would get you alot more stoned than hydro weed. </blockquote>Then lets just use a normal average grade on a normal average person. U don't get tis simple concept or u r avoiding the question ?<br><br><blockquote>500g would last at least a week. I dont know, i dont have that kind of money floating around. If you want to fund me and do a research experiment, im free in 2 weeks.</blockquote>a week ? I believe it will last much more considering the fact tat a joint is only at most 2 grams. U can probably make 250 joints with it. How long can 250 joints last u ? Lets just assume your standard of one week is correct. If u r a drug user, not trafficker, and u know tat the death penalty will be impose if u buy a week or more supply or drugs, will u not buy in only 1-3 days of drugs instead ? The only reason why people will have more drugs is only drug trafficker because they need to hold the supply of it for some time. Doesn't tat show the weight of the drugs is accurate in determing who is a user or a trafficker<br><br><blockquote>I am sure at this juncture of civilisation, man has gone over this issue many times and today society is more compassionate and foregiving when it comes to punishment dishing out death penalty only for the most heinous crimes.</blockquote>At tis junstion of civilisation, there r still people being drug traffickers. We r not as advanced as we think.</div>
