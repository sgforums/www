If u take drug in their pure form, u will die straight<br><br><blockquote>how are some drugs (e, weed, stuff like that) considered to be so bad even though they're not? </blockquote>They r.

Why don't u give a better suggestion on how to educate ? Singaporean have tis fault of complaining too much without giving suggestions<br><br><blockquote>one puff will hook you - is bs. </blockquote>Tis is true for some people.<br><br><blockquote>education in general, in singapore, seems to be "its like this...it just is...learn it and dont ask why". tell me im wrong?</blockquote>U sure ?

Tat is how law works isn't it ?<br><br>Letys play with some figure shall we  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>According to the report on singapore, there were a total of 0.19% of population being drug abusers. (assuming no overlap of data between the different drugs) Singapore population is 4,000,000. Tat makes the figure to be 7600 drug addicts in singapore. Lets suppose if hanging for drug trafficker is removed, we will follow the statistic on the figures on Asia. (Take note tat China, malaysia and many countries in asia do hanged drug traffickers. If we do not do any extraordinary things, we should expect to be normal compared with other nations) The total population will rise to 3.37%. Tat is still below the global average therefore it is believable. Wat will be the number of drug abuser then ? 134800. In short u have succeeded in making 127200 more people into drug taker because u refuse to show justice to 20 people in a year. Lets say 1 % of these people die or become badly brain damaged. Congratulations ! U have killed 1348 people ! Lets say again 20% of these people become theft or prostitute to support their drug habbit. We will see tat u had ruined 26960 people ! u do the maths and see if it is worth it or not. If u want to make it realistic and divde these whole figure by 10, u will still see u had ruined more people's lives than save it.</div>

Suggestions?  Proper drug education?  Well, one can already establish the fact that drug education ISNT good enough if people can die from o/ding (or dehydration) on ecstasy.

Education should go more along the lines of "dont do it because of these effects..blah blah blah", and  "if you want to do it, make sure you dont...and make sure you do...".<br><br>ie, dying from E if one uses it properly is quite...hard.

How many high school/tertiarty students (lets say upper sec, jc, uni...) know that you shouldnt mix alcohol and E?  How many know that you need to drink enough water, because you dehydrate unknowingly when you're dancing like theres no tomorrow?  How many know that overhydration is possible when you're on E as well?  How many know that a fair few clinical medicines mixed with E can work out fatal?  I havent really done any surveys or asked my mates in singapore, but i can tell you - not many.  Even if some of the issues just raised were pretty "common sense" issues.<br><br>i wont argue (lets use the word debate...its friendlier) about the "drug trafficker" bit...cuz im not sure what the "recognized" definition of trafficker is.</div>

NONE ! They do not feel high, do not get a kick, no peers ask them to do it or do it themselves and won't enjoy the effect a single bit. Wat about drugs ? They r supposed to have a "feel good" effect on people. They can feel high, they can feel stronger, they get a kick, peers ask them to do drugs and WILL enjoy thermseves thoroughly when the drug is in effect. BUT drugs have many other effects tat is gonna kill or harm people badly. They can killl, cause brain and health damage and addiction. Tat is why it has to be prohibited ! Education DON'T WORK well at all. If education works, then NO ONE will be smoking. Why does after so many decades of education, there r still people smoking ? Smoking have a similar nature of drugs isn't it ?<br><br><blockquote>then how come weed is legal in quite a few countries, and is used medicinally too?<br>complaining to the UN isnt going to do anything......because the issue here is Singapore. Not the world. </blockquote>How come in a few countries guns and arms r legal ? How come in a few countries rape is an offence where only the girls get punished while the guys get away with everything ? How come in a few countries girls can never get to work ? We talk about how majority or international organisations work. We don't talk about a few countries here and there. There r always some kind of extreme countries arounfd the world. Just because a few countries made it legal meant tat this act is accepted ? Then rape when only girls get punished should be accepted in singapore.<br><br><blockquote>Well many other countries do too then, since im not singaporean. Suggestions? Proper drug education?

I tell u, I am a singaporean and I have been SHOWN many many education examples about the problems from drugs ranging from posters at every place (showing pictures of effect of drugs, statement by past drug abuser, hip youngsters saying no to drugs. These full coloured posters r free of charge and they encourage everyone to stick it at their work place etc) to TV programs (popular channel 8 soap operas and many shows do show the problem of drugs. There is a police show call crime watch where frequently they reinforce the problems of drugs) to speakers in schools (CNB officers giving talks about drugs, They go for talks in your primary shcool, secondary school and JC. They even set up booth in your University. It was written in textbooks for school kids to read and compulsory for teachers to discuss.) to drug-free campaign (a whole month or week per year where there will be high profile campaign ranging from walks to road shows to carnivals to commercials and shown prominently in newspaper, news broadcast). In fact, there is a whole division of CNB officers tat try to come out with many ways to educate the public. Other than tat, how do u suggest we educate ? I hope people, instead of complaining about how inadequate our education on drugs is, suggest wat else need to be done. I really can't think of another way to educate people about problems of drugs anymore. IMO, wat can be done has already been done.<br><br><blockquote>dying from E if one uses it properly is quite...hard.

Slim 10 doesn't affect everyone too, thousands of people have ate it, but only 2 people in singapore had died from it. Even if u eat a small dose of poison, u r not going to die as well. It will just stay in your organs for decades to time and gradually cause organ failure. How many know about effects of E ? Well... those who go to schools should know. Those who watch TV shows should knows. Those who can read posters should know. Those who read newspaper should know. I can tell u frankly, anyone in singapore tat at least know where is afghanistan located should know the problem of E.</div>
