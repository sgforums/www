            <div class='col-md body'>First, I don't really trust the articles written by Amnesty International. They tend to exaggerate the claims and assume tat the world is a perfect place<br><br><blockquote>However there is no convincing evidence that the death penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than other punishments</blockquote>If u read carefully, it is shown tat there is statistic tat shows death penalty do deters traffickers. It is just tat they do not like them<br><br><blockquote>There is always a risk that minor traffickers or vulnerable drug addicts will be executed, while those who mastermind the crime of trafficking evade arrest and punishment. </blockquote>We always want to catch the big boss too. But surely it is no easy task. Just because we cannot catch the big boss doesn't means we can let their subordinates free to create hell<br><br><blockquote>In the countries which impose the death penalty for drug offences Amnesty International is aware of no evidence of a decline in drug trafficking which could be clearly attributed to the threat or use of the death penalty</blockquote>It should be viewed tat ALL the other nations r facing an <strong>increase</strong> problem of drug abuse. Being stabilise or mild decrease is a potential positive effect<br><br><blockquote>Claiming that the death penalty has been effective in controlling the trade in illicit drugs, the Singapore authorities reported an overall decline in the number of drug abusers arrested between 1994 and 2001.(37) However, despite the use of the death penalty and high execution rates, drug addiction continues to be a problem, particularly among the poorly educated, impoverished, unemployed and young people from broken homes</blockquote>Reading tis carefuly, it admit the figures do decline in singapore. Most drugs problem start in poorly educated, impoverished, unemployed and young people from broken homes in every part of the world. The key word is there is a reduction in the number<br><br><blockquote>According to the website of the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), a total of 3,393 drug abusers were arrested in 2002. The number of new drug abusers increased by 16% compared to the figures for 2001. The CNB announced that it had seized 63 kilograms of heroin and 34 kilograms of cannabis during 2002, and also reported a significant increase in the use of methamphetamine. This is despite the fact that the scope of the death penalty was increased in 1998 to introduce a mandatory death sentence for importing, exporting, or trafficking in more than 250 grams of the drug. </blockquote>It had fail to report the world wide trend of increased drug abuse throughout the world.Other coutries had higher increase compared to singapore. It do not show a general period between 1990-2000 but reflect statistic of single year.<br><br><blockquote>Those convicted of more minor drugs offences also face cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Persistent or so-called "hardcore" drug addicts who have been admitted more than twice to a drugs rehabilitation centre are treated as criminals and may be imprisoned for up to 13 years and sentenced to caning. </blockquote>It had said the key word. They had been caught twice for drug abuse. If u r a first time offender, u r not going to suffer the above mentioned treatment. if u r caught twice, by studies u r gonna be caught many times later.<br><br><blockquote>The eradication of the supply of drugs is important but equally important is the alleviation of social conditions that encourage would-be traffickers or addicts. The socially excluded young and poor school dropouts are the most affected and drug addictions are disproportionately high among males with poor education... Are we assisting the socially excluded to reintegrate into society or are we disposing them off [sic] as rejects</blockquote>Which country has been successful in alleviating social conditions ? Every country have their share of social rejects. DO u think America do not have these people ?<br><br><blockquote>In Iran, executions for drug crimes started before the revolution in 1979. It turns out that, later, over a thousand people have been sentenced to death; and yet drug abuse and trade are still a serious problem, not solved at all. </blockquote>He had said it himself. IRAN. Why compare to such country ?<br><br><blockquote>In Malaysia, where death penalty for drug crimes is compulsory since 1983, autorities have more than once publicly acknowledged its ineffectiveness. The general detective inspector affirmed in 1985 that capital punishment didn't seem to have deterrent effects against traffickers; in 1990, the Vice-minister of the Interior affirmed that capital punishment hadn't been able to decrease drug use or traffic and there was the need of a different approach to the problem. The list of the failures could go on. </blockquote>Wat is the comment recently ? The last coment is 15 years ago and now the situation has changed a lot.<br><br><blockquote>On the grounds of many experts' experience, the fact that as utmost punishment there is death penalty doesn't imply necessarily that it has particular effects against drug traffic: as a matter of fact in some cases it could complicate Public Prosecution's activity since law courts need much higher standards of evidence if death penalty is provided (particularly if it's complsory). The most effective deterrent is surely the certainty to be discovered and arrested. </blockquote>We do it both ways. Discover and arrest + deterence with high punishment. It had proven to be effective<br><br><blockquote>There are also options which we could use to deter drugs offence, such as drug awareness compaign </blockquote>If education works, there will not have smokers in singapore<br><br><blockquote>and tighten our check at the airport. </blockquote>Singapore is viewed as havign teh tightest check internationally. Not enough ?<br><br><blockquote>And why isnt there death sentence for rapist</blockquote>When u rape, u only affect 1 person. When u drug trafficking, u cause harm to hundreds of them. Tis one person, though scarred for life, still can led a more meaningful life than being a drug addict. She is not dead, she is not brain daamaged, society had changed their view towards such victims and she can live a better life than drug addicts. U might as well say why not give the death penalty to littering ?</div>
