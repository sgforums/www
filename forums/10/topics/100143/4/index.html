If u volunteer to go to a drug rehab center, they will help u kick the habbit and not give u a criminal record ! Only those who were caught having possesion and consumption of drugs get to have a criminal record. And if u r the first timer, u r not going to get a criminal record as well.

They want to do things the easy way. If the death penalty is enforced, he will find it much harder to get people to transport drugs over the borders. When the difficulty rises, the amount of drugs become less available. Therefore safely ensure singaporean to be drug free. Challenges ? If your teacher gives u a whole 3000 pages textbook to read and understand within a day, will u be delighted and glad someone had given u a challenge ?<br><br><blockquote>I feel that teh Death penalty actually gives an incentive for more people to pedal drugs here (or force Singaporeans to do their dirty work for them). </blockquote>Please elaborate.

U think thye will go around and tell people they r the boss or tattoo it on his forehead ? The authorities r pursuing them too, but it is not gong to be easy. So if u can't catch the "god father" we let all his subordinates to go scot free ? It has to go 2 ways. Find the leader of the drug ring and also cut off possible means of singaporean accessibility to drugs.

Kidnap take guts too. Arm robbery take guts too. So wat ? Do u think drug trafficker has 5% of the guts of armed robbers or 5% of the planning needed to comit kidnaping ?
