As Confucius once said, "a leader must rule with benevolence, and lead by example." I have a theory that the Death Penalty actually increases the possibility of intent for murder, even while on the surface deterring the actual act from occurring. Crouching behind Legal Codes doesn't make the action any more legal or moral: Hitler passed laws to condone the Holocaust, so the Holocaust was legal in germany at that time. My point is that the State cannot act as a morla custodian if it does not practice what it preaches.<br><br>Article 29 exists, as far as I understand, to enable Governments to handle crime in their countries. its text is, according to the official version:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(1) Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.<br><br>(2) In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.<br><br>(3) These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</span><br><br>As 29.2 states in the official version,  the purpose must be to "secure due recognition and respect for the rights and freedom of others." the Death penalty fails to provide these:<br><br>a) there is nothing to secure since the victim's life is already taken, and there is no proof that the murderer is going to kill the victim's family members without provocation. For Drug Trafficking, it si even worse since there is no proof that victims have even been existent. Jail and confiscation fo the possession (drugs) is sufficient.<br><br>b) the Death Penalty violates article 12, since the enaction of it will tarnish the reputation of the Accused' family, especially in Asian countries like SIngapore. Remember, we are a Chinese society, and it is tradition to have guilt by Association, whether or not we utilise Western legal codes officially. Thus, the Death penalty does not secureRespect for the rigths for the Accused' family.<br><br>c) In the event that a mistake is made, it is irreversible.<br><br>I hope you understand my position on this matter.<br><br><span style="color: red;">As a side note, there is an American advocacy group against the Death Penalty that is made up of murder victims' families. Let me ask you, if such a group can exist, what does that tell you about the Penalty?</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I like this point that you made..</span><br><br>the pikamaster sincerely<br><br></div></blockquote>for the words highlighted in red, i believe my story has given an answer to pika regarding my views, though he might not get what i'm trying to say</div>

The death penalty for murderers, the Catholic ChurchÂ’s most famous theologian argued, was a form of retributive punishment. He explained that this "punishment may be considered as a medicine, not only healing the past sin, but also preserving from future sin." Though life may be taken from a murderer, he will be better off with the punishment because "spiritual goods are of the greatest consequence, while temporal goods are least important."

Drug trafficking is also used to stop people from distributing drugs internally after the drug has successfully been smuggled in. They too deserve the death penalty.<br><br><blockquote>Since 1991, more than 400 people have been hanged in Singapore and mostly for drugs offences.

The number of people whose life was ruined in singapore is surely more than that. You just have to look at the number of drugs addicts in Singapore to know the implications of drugs. In 1989 alone, there were already 20,000 heroin drug addicts in Singapore.<br><br><blockquote>Did you know that Singapore Changi Airpot is the most popular transit point for drugs dealers?

The reason is because the other western countries will not check the people from singapore that closely when they had reached. They have the impression that singapore is keeping a very good control of drug trafficking, that is why they will conduct a less stringent check on them when they arrived. Another possible reason is that singapore is well connected by air to western countries.<br><br>If one wants to remove the death penalty for drug traffickers, they are just being kind to the drug traffickers and cruel to his potential victims.</div>

One passenger is allowed to carry no more than 20kg of checked in baggage for economy class. Handcarry is permitted to the extent of 7kg<br><br><blockquote><br>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes I think it is worth it, cause it will deter drug smugglers, there will be no drugs coming into Singapore, prices of drug will be out of reach to people and there will be no trafficker.  </blockquote>Haven't u heard of drug addicts committing acts of theft and bulgary to get money for their drugs?<br><blockquote><br>&lt;&lt;<a>&gt;&gt;<br><br>Yes, sure it is good enough. But how come there are still people out there who have mangaged to keep some bullets as souvenier?   </a></blockquote><a>They have one bullet ....no gun - no way to injure anyone. A drug smuggler has one packet of drugs which he can consume at his own risk or pass on to others to get a high.<br><br><blockquote><br>&lt;&lt;<i>&gt;&gt;They have the impression that singapore is keeping a very good control of drug trafficking, that is why they will conduct a less stringent check on them when they arrived. Another possible reason is that singapore is well connected by air to western countries.<br><br>yeah...thats what you think, but unfortunately thats not the case. Please dont THINK, we are talking about lives here. </i></blockquote><i>What lives? The ones forfeited because they did not obey the laws of our nation or the ones lost and destroyed because of the drugs?<br><br><blockquote><br>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>No one in this world enjoy being a drug trafficker. And guess what, you dont make alot of money selling drugs in Singapore cuase the market it too small. The reason why people get suck into it is because the need the money for whatever reasons, not that they wanna get rich. I believe some of these traffickers deserve a second chance.  </blockquote>Yeah poor them ...they are so poor . They can earn an honest living slow as it might seem.  They should avoid Singapore if they have drugs.  Simple.<br><br>People enter Singapore- they obey singapore's laws and abide by it. If they don't . Singapore has a right to serve penalty upon an individual breaking its laws.  So for all potential drug traffickers out there - find some other way of bypassing Singapore and Malaysia to get to your destination.<br><br></i></a></i></div>

This guy was unlucky to set off the metal detectors. Since the drugs were never intended for our market, he should have been handed to the Authorities in Melbourne instead. At least he can still return to his computer shop after serving 30 years in jail.</div>
