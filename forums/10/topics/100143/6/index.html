            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Didnt know that animals has religion</blockquote>Clearly u r avoiding the question on wat religion u belong to. Wat is your religion ? Or r u gonna tell me u r an animal and have no religion ?<br><br><blockquote>I would like to know if you have ever kill someone before. </blockquote>No. Do u yourself or know anyone who had their home and life wrecked because of drugs ?<br><br><blockquote>2001 is the beginning of a up trend if you havent notice. Didnt you read news that drug user of estasy and Ketamine are on the rise and that fact was not reflected in this pcs of data. </blockquote>Didn't u read tat tis is a world wide trend and all nations face tis problem ? However singapore appears to controlled the situation better than other foreign countries.<br><br><blockquote>This death sentence law has already been around for over 30 years, and if it is effective, why the number of drug offender is not below 100. Why is there still drugs coming into Singapore? </blockquote>Tat is plain talk cock and shows your inmaturity. British laws have been around for centuries, why doesn't the number of crimes committed in British within a year get below 100 ? Why is there still crimes committed in british or america ? Since it doesn't reduce the crimes to below 100, then it must definitely be a lousy law system in place ? Please face reality. Only in the ideal world will people not resort to crimes.<br><br><blockquote>You dont need to have a religion to believe that there is a God. My conscious mind tell me that we must learn to forgive sinners and give hope to those who are in trouble, and that include people like you, </blockquote>Just to clarify, I have no religion and I do not believe in a god. If u believe in a god, more or less u r already in a religion.<br><br>My conscience mind also realise tat there r always people who will not hesitate to commit crimes tat hurt other people for their own benefit. As such there is always a need for punishment to protect the general public. To be excessively kind to criminal is the same as encouraging them to do injustice to the innocent public.<br><br><blockquote>I am simply quoting what you have say about human are animals. so who is getting personal here? </blockquote>I am saying tat scientifically speaking men r classified as animals. Your mum and dad r human, therefore they r classified as animals as well. Unless u r gonna tell me they r aliens, blockheads or rocks, then I will be wrong. Who is the one getting ignorant and personal here ?<br><br><blockquote>Is life imprisonment consider KIND?</blockquote>Is letting your children and family members get hooked to drugs "kind" ? U know nothing about the problem of drugs.</div>

Therefore it is wrong to say that if there is more drugs coming to Singapore (which i doubt so), more people will consume them. </blockquote>Not true, under tis situation the demand for drug is cut off because the supply side is controlled. In economics, tis is the phenomenon where price will increase a lot and therefore reduces demand. If we increase the supply of drugs, naturally the demand will increase. Otherwise why do people pay so much for grass ? If we allow more drugs to be in, the supply will increase, price will fall, more people will get associated with drugs and therefore more people will be hooked to drugs. Tis will bring about more demand and further increase the supply to meet tis demand. As can be seen it will be a viscious cycle. The nature state of demand may be many times more than the controlled supply of goods or products. Let me ask u, if price of cigerrettes reduce, do u expect more people to be smokers or less ?<br><br>Why don't u explain why does an increase in amount of drugs not increase the number of addicts here ?<br><br><blockquote>Singapore government are not corrupted like in certain 3rd world countries, therefore removing the death sentence it is unlikely that we will see more drug activities in Singapore. </blockquote>People who easily get influenced by people. It has nothing to do with the Gov. When more people become drug addicts, they will influence more people to be like them. Why link Gov with tis ?<br><br><blockquote>Death penalty has little effect to deter trafficker, because any risk can be compensated with money. </blockquote>Surely it will demand MORE money and LESS people to become drug trafficker if there is a death sentence. As such the supply side of drugs can be controlled. Little effect ? Hardly<br><br><blockquote>Singaporeans are highly educated people and majority will stay away from drugs regardless of death penalty. </blockquote>Sorry man, in every society there r always people who r not highly educated. they will be the one tat will suffer because of your leniency towards drug trafficker. Addiction has nothing to do with a person education either. Even the very educated people can get to be hooked on cigerettes or gambling Note tat it only need 1 trafficker to ruin hundreds of lives.<br><br><blockquote>Drugs consumption has no relation with culture, history and the color of your skin. </blockquote>I am comparing the lives of different people, not only drug activity. It is just like crimes rate in a nation. Certainly richer countries r less prone to theft than poorer countries. We shouldn't compared singapore with europe, which education reached for centuries and being rich for donkeys years.<br><br>Furthermore, your assumption tat drug consumption has no relations with culture, history or color is wrong. In singapore, malays r more prone to drug abuse. It is a clear evidence tat drug abuse do have relationships with culture and races. In america the negroes r likely to be drug addicts than caucasians. Countries which have lesser control of drugs have more addicts than countries which enforce tight control of them. If u want to compare, why don't u compare with worse off countries like South America ?<br><br><blockquote>Unless there are scientific proof that dealth penalty can help deter drug abuse, one should not make the assumption it will help "improve" life. </blockquote>I thought tis is common sense ? The more harsher the punishment the less people will commit it. Why will it logically not decrease the number of drug trafficker ? The number of drug abuse in singapore is significantly lower than the rest of the world<br><br><blockquote>Developed countries are mentally well developed enough to make decision, regardless if it is good or bad. Should someone choose to take drugs, that is their choice. Why should a country like stockholm wanna sacrific someone's life just to protect those who choose to take drugs. </blockquote>There r many different people in the world. Some people r more gulible and more dependent on their peers. It is the same as protecting women below 14 by introducing a law tat states having sex with them is considered rape, irregardless of whether is she willing or not. Why should singapore sacrifice the lives of these innocent people by letting drug traffickers lightly. Surely these drug traffickers know how harmful drugs is to people.</div>
