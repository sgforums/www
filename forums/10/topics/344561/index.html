            <div class='col-md body'><p class="header">Singapore's deputy prime minister said the island state, which is hosting a summit of Asia Pacific leaders this year, may further tighten laws against public protests, according to reports. <br><br>Wong Kan Seng, who is also Home Affairs Minister, said the government is reviewing public order laws and may pass legislation to deal more effectively with illegal protests and other acts of civil disobedience. <br><br>The legislation is expected to be passed in time for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in November which could attract both local and overseas protesters, he said. <br><span><br>US president-elect Barack Obama, due to take office next week, is among the 21 leaders scheduled to attend the summit. <br><br>Public order laws are already tight in Singapore, where protests require a police permit if held outside a designated free-speech zone and gatherings of five or more people are illegal. <br><br>Nevertheless, Mr Wong said fresh legislation is needed to deal more effectively with political activities, while relaxing regulations on people gathering for social and recreational purposes. <br><br>He said police could be granted power to take action before protesters could gather at specific areas such as Parliament, and cited protests by the political opposition, and by Myanmar nationals against their country's ruling military government. <br><br>"They make a show of breaking the law," Wong said of the protesters. <br><br>"The police watch and do nothing and can only follow up with investigation after the show is over when they pack up and leave. This cannot go on," he said.<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/403068/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/403068/1/.html</a></span></p></div>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Singapore. The noose of repression tightens.</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The Singapore state controlled newspaper the Straits Times report of Jan 16, 2009 has this article, "Review of Public Laws".<br><br>It says <em>"the
                  government is reviewing existing public laws and may craft new
                  legislation to deal with civil disobedience acts such as illegal
                  protests. In the works could be a new law to give police pre-emptive
                  powers, for instance, to act earlier to prevent people from
                  congregating in certain places, such as Parliament House and the Istana"<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br></strong></span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In
                  other words, the government is going to enact even harsher laws to stop
                  anyone from protesting publicly against government actions.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>As
                  it is, the government is already violating the Constitution in several
                  ways</strong></span>, which guarantees freedom of speech and expression, by demanding
                  that people wishing to protest or speak publicly require a police
                  permit; denying them each time they apply.</p>
              <p>Constitutionally, the
                  requirement for permits is itself illegal and ultra vires the
                  Constitution.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> And worse, each time citizens apply for it, it is
                  routinely denied.</strong></span><br><br>Recently you have seen increasing numbers of
                  people deliberately breaking these unjust laws by protesting without
                  permits and being jailed as a result. John Tan, Shafi and Izrizal had
                  been jailed for 15 days and 10 days each respectively by judge Judith
                  Prakash a month ago for wearing T-shirts emblazoned with pictures of
                  Kangaroos in judicial robes at a trial where Lee Kuan Yew was engaging
                  in his usual pastime of suing opposition politicians for defamation of
                  character, the victim being Dr. Chee Soon Juan.<br><br>Only a few days
                  ago, a government Member of Parliament suffered the unusual attack at
                  the hands of an unhappy citizen, of being doused with kerosene and set
                  alight. I understand his whole body was on fire for several minutes
                  before the flames were subdued. He is now in a Singapore hospital
                  having suffered serious burns all over his body.<br><br>The same man
                  was attacked some time ago, when another Singaporean punched his face
                  at the meet the people session of the government.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Only
                  yesterday, Mr. Koh Chan Meng aged 47 was charged for 3 counts of
                  vandalism for writing the words "Go sue me Lee Kuan Yew" and "Hi, Harry
                  Lee, I love you" on a brick wall outside Singapore Parliament. </strong></span>Although, the government may call him a vandal, he too was exercising
                  his right to freedom of speech by showing his disgust at the ruling
                  party and Singapore’s dictator Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also a few days
                  ago, it was reported in Straits Times that Seelan Pallay and Kai Xiong,
                  2 young activists had mounted a protest outside the Singapore Ministry
                  of Manpower to show their solidarity with Burmese workers in Singapore
                  who were being deported to Burma for engaging in peaceful protests.</strong></span> The
                  Burmese face executions or decades of imprisonment at the hands of the
                  Junta. Seelan and Kai Xiong are being charged for criminal trespass
                  even though there was nothing criminal or trespass in their actions.<br><br>In
                  September of last year, I was imprisoned for 3 months for allegedly
                  insulting a judge, Belinda Ang even though I merely wrote a criticism
                  of her in her conduct of a trial in this blog. The Wall Street Asia
                  about the same time was convicted of contempt of court for writing a
                  criticism of the weird goings on in there. Another reason for their
                  conviction was because the article referred also to my case.<br><br>Trials
                  are now going on in Singapore courts against Gandhi Ambalam, Chee Siok
                  Chin and Dr. Chee Soon Juan for distributing flyers at the WTO meeting
                  2 years ago.<br><br>While all this repression goes on, the Singapore economy is fast declining with massive job losses and even more on the way.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The
                  writing is on the wall and Lee Kuan Yew has seen it.</strong></span> The people are
                  prepared to challenge these laws and suffer the consequences of
                  imprisonment and financial suffering. Lee Kuan Yew anticipates that
                  even more will brazenly break these unjust laws that deny them their
                  constitutional rights.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The problem is worsening with more job losses in
                  a country that does not provide any safety net for the people suffering
                  financial woes. So Lee Kuan Yew acts in the only way he knows; enact
                  even harsher laws to punish those who dare question the government.</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>What
                  Lee Kuan Yew fears the most is public protests, or people power. </strong></span>He
                  realizes that the people are prepared now to challenge these unjust
                  laws in increasing numbers. He remembers what happened in the
                  Philippines when people power, mass protests, brought down the dictator
                  Ferdinand Marcos. He knows that such protests in Singapore, a crowded
                  island state, will have devastating effects. He also knows that he will
                  die very soon and his minions cannot save his dictatorship.<br><br>Of
                  course he knows the already bad world opinion of him and his island
                  state will diminish even further. All international human rights bodies
                  including the US State Department condemn the human rights violations
                  in Singapore.<br><br>Singapore’s economy relies today principally on
                  money laundering for Burmese drug lords and Indonesian businessmen.
                  Even this business, a dirty one, is also going to end with the US and
                  the European Union demanding more transparency for banking transactions
                  of clients who have avoided American and European tax.<br><br>This
                  increasing bad publicity for Singapore, making it a pariah state, will
                  have devastating effects of every other sector of Singapore business.
                  Foreign universities will shun Singapore in their search for foreign
                  campuses. Even more people would emigrate, more than what they are
                  already doing. Tourism will decline further. Foreign businesses who
                  care for their reputation will loathe having dealings with a disgraced
                  country. Lee Kuan Yew will be facing gloom from every angle if he
                  indeed goes ahead with his plan to enact even more harsh and illegal
                  laws to muzzle dissent.<br><br>But with the impossible situation that
                  Lee Kuan Yew faces today in his fast declining country, I think he will
                  go ahead as he threatens. I expect longer prison sentences for those
                  who dare challenge him. Maybe even the brutal caning. Perhaps they will
                  also be ordered to pay the legal costs of the government running into
                  several thousand dollars each time. Perhaps the law will permit the
                  right to enter homes without warrants each time to seize and arrest
                  people and property of suspected protestors.<br><br>I hope the people
                  will not be deterred by these laws and do what is right, by protesting.
                  Your actions may be wrong in the law of Singapore but I can assure you
                  that in the law of natural justice, in morality and truth, you are not
                  committing any crime. You are in fact heroes willing to stand up for
                  the rights of your countrymen.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew relies on his
                  corrupt judges and his police force to do his dirty work. If these
                  judges and these policemen refuse, then he is powerless. I hope these
                  men and women who are made to do these bad things ask themselves the
                  question whether it is just. And I am sure, with time, even the
                  policemen and judges would one day say, enough is enough. I will not
                  lend my hand to hurt innocent citizens. And once they begin to jib, Lee
                  Kuan Yew will be powerless to hurt his people anymore. To them I say,
                  search your conscience. And do the right thing, for heaven sake.<br><br>Have
                  no fear. As some great man had said, it is better to die a free man
                  than to live a coward. The very fact that Lee Kuan Yew is coming up
                  with these laws means only one thing. The cause of freedom is winning
                  and he is losing. Take advantage of the momentum. Capitalize on your
                  victories. And show Lee Kuan Yew that in the end, the truth must
                  triumph.<br><br>Gopalan Nair</p>

              <p>I think WKS has got more important things to worry about rather than this. Protests in Singapore are only small-fry issues, it wont be like those you see in Thailand, Indonesia, etc.</p>
              <p>What he should worry about is how to tighten our borders so that in future, we won't be seeing 73 year old grannies suffering from dementia and depression sneaking into Singapore <strong><strong>unnoticed</strong>.</strong></p>

              <p>Ah .... I guess one way is to do small protest , 1 person .. If not considered as illegal then 2 person .. So that people can test to find where the actual boundaries lie .</p>
              <p>Of cos , I guess you can protest against  " the law of illegal protest ". If successful then you shoot 2 birds with 1 stone .</p>
