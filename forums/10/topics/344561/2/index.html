              <p>Singapore's deputy prime minister said the island
              state, which is hosting a summit of Asia Pacific leaders this year,
              may further tighten laws against public protests, according to
              reports.<br> <br> Wong Kan Seng, who is also Home Affairs Minister, said the
              government is reviewing public order laws and may pass legislation
              to deal more effectively with illegal protests and other acts of
              civil disobedience.<br> <br> The legislation is expected to be passed in time for the Asia
              Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in November which could
              attract both local and overseas protesters, he said.<br> <span><br> US president-elect Barack Obama, due to take office next week, is
              among the 21 leaders scheduled to attend the summit.<br> <br> Public order laws are already tight in Singapore, where protests
              require a police permit if held outside a designated free-speech
              zone and gatherings of five or more people are illegal.<br> <br> Nevertheless, Mr Wong said fresh legislation is needed to deal more
              effectively with political activities, while relaxing regulations
              on people gathering for social and recreational purposes.<br> <br> He said police could be granted power to take action before
              protesters could gather at specific areas such as Parliament, and
              cited protests by the political opposition, and by Myanmar
              nationals against their country's ruling military government.<br> <br> "They make a show of breaking the law," Wong said of the
              protesters.<br> <br> "The police watch and do nothing and can only follow up with
              investigation after the show is over when they pack up and leave.
              This cannot go on," he said.<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/403068/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/403068/1/.html</a></span></p>

              <h1><strong>Move on Laws: A New Mechanism for Police
              Control</strong></h1>
              <p><em>by Dennis Eggington and Kate Allingham</em></p>
              <p><em>Western Australian (‘WA’) ‘move on laws’ are used by
              police as a mechanism for the social control of Aboriginal people. The laws are
              used to move individuals from well known public places in city areas where
              Aboriginal people congregate. The laws have become another example of
              discriminatory policing of an already over-policed Aboriginal population and are
              further contributing to the huge overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in the
              WA criminal justice system. The Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia
              (‘ALSWA’) has repeatedly asked that the move on laws be </em><em>repealed. </em></p>
              <p><em>In 2004, the <a class="autolink_findacts" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/pa189275/">Police Act 1892</a> (WA) was amended under the Criminal Law
              Amendment (Simple Offences) Bill 2004 (WA) to enable police to issue individuals
              with move on notices ordering them to leave a specified area for a period of up
              to 24 hours.<sup><a name="fnB1" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/2006/62.html#fn1">[1]</a></sup> If a person returns to
              the area prohibited by their move on notice, they are in breach and can be
              arrested. The penalty for breaching a move on notice is a fine of up to $12,000,
              or imprisonment for up to 12
              months.<sup><a name="fnB2" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/2006/62.html#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Under section 50 of the
              <a class="autolink_findacts" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/pa189275/">Police Act</a>, police can issue a move on notice if they ‘reasonably
              suspect’ that the person is ‘just about to’ commit an offence.
              This leaves the implementation of the move on laws largely up to the discretion
              of the police. </em></p>
              <p><em>ALSWA has sent four letters to WA’s Attorney-General Jim McGinty
              outlining the disproportionate effect the laws have on Aboriginal people.
              Included in these letters are the non-confidential details of all ALSWA clients
              who were arrested and charged for breach of a move on notice. The record of
              circumstances for the issue of the move on notices and reasons for subsequent
              arrest demonstrate disturbing trends in the police implementation of the move on
              laws......EOQ</em></p>
