Traditional Catholics cheered the move, but more liberal ones called it a step back from Vatican II.<br><br>Benedict, who attended Vatican II as a young theologian, has long complained about what he considers the erroneous interpretation of the council by liberals, saying it was not a break from the past but rather a renewal of church tradition.....</blockquote>---http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2007-07-10-pope_N.htm?csp=34<br><img src="http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2007/07/11/pope_wideweb__470x334,0.jpg"><br><br>2.<strong><a href="http://www.vatican.va/latest/latest_en.htm" rel="nofollow">latest in the Holy Land</a></strong><br><br>3.<strong><a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html" rel="nofollow">CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH<br><br>RESPONSES TO SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING CERTAIN ASPECTS<br>OF THE DOCTRINE ON THE CHURCH,dated 29 June 2007<br></a></strong><br><br><blockquote>Second Question: What is the meaning of the affirmation that the Church of Christ subsists in the Catholic Church?<br><br>Response: Christ "established here on earth" only one Church and instituted it as a "visible and spiritual community"[5], that from its beginning and throughout the centuries has always existed and will always exist, and in which alone are found all the elements that Christ himself instituted.[6] "..........</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Other christians not true churches.   Sounds like cult.   This reminds me of Church in Singapore located in Derbyshire Road.  This Church believes that they are the only one and true church and that there can only be one church in a city.  They claimed that the bible says so.  So they claimed that Singapore is a city, so theirs is the church in singapore, the only church.<br><br>How strange?<br><br>The other strange and unrealistic thing is they believe once you are a christian you are forever a christian.  Even if the christian gives up the faith, the christian is still a christian, the christians are not given a choice but to be christians forever even they leave the church and denounce the faith.  What sort of twisted theory is this?   A friend is from this church, and she has been such a pain to brainwash people with the distorted theory.  A very agressive cult she is.   I went to their church the first time and they kept persuading me to baptise on the spot.  They are real good sales people you know!!!  My friend though backslided still behaves like before.  She is trying her ways and means to force me to believe that once a christian is forever a christian.  What crap is this?  In singapore, we are given religious freedom to choose our religion, told her this and she disagreed was very agressive and angry, still finding her ways to brainwash me.  No way will I be brainwashed by her.  She ever told me now she realised her church is a cult but she still goes on to brainwash people with the distorted theory.  Better still she sleeps around.<br><br>oops, do you think such a topic should be posted in the forum Eternal hope?</div>
