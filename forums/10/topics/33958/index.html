Does it mean that all pigs are inherently dirty? Even if I kept it in a surgically clean pen?<br><br>From what I see, there is all this scientific evidence of why pork is bad. All this scientific evidence is very interesting... but that by itself doesn't, to me, justify why the pig has been singled out...by God himself mind you. Surely lots of other animals are dirty and lots of other animals can pass all kinds of horrible diseases...<br><br>If what I understand is true...then there is something inherently evil about a pig? What did the poor animal do? Im looking for something in religion that says, "dont eat the pig for it is singled out from amongst all other creatures because..."<br><br>Im searching for that reason...there has to be one, right?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are many verses in Quran providing guidelines for our consumptions. The following are the most relevant with regard to our discussion. I will provide the translation in Malay since I do not have an English translation. This is to avoid any misleading information due to my poor translation to English:<br><br>Al-AnÂ’am:145<br>Katakanlah (wahai Muhammad): Â“Aku tidak dapati dalam apa yang aku wahyukan kepadaku, sesuatu yang diharamkan bagi orang yang hendak memakannya melainkan kalau benda itu bangkai, atau darah yang mengalir, atau daging babi, kerana sesungguhnya ia adalah kotor, atau dilakukan secara fasik, iaitu binatang yang disembelih atas nama selain dari AllahÂ”. Kemudian sesiapa yang terpaksa (memakannya kerana darurat) sedang ia tidak menginginkannya dan tidak melampaui batas, maka sesungguhnya Tuhanmu Maha Pengampun, lagi Maha mengasihaniÂ”<br><br>From what I understand from the above verse and related to our discussion, pork is prohibited because simply it is Â“kotorÂ” or dirty. So, what do we understand by the word dirty (in relation to food)? It is just simply means unhealthy or bad for health.<br><br>But then, at the end of the sentence it was announced that in a situation where a Muslim does not have any other choice, he is allowed to eat pork as long as not too much.<br><br>Religion is not only about the good and evil or God and devil. It is a guideline of how one should live.<br></div>
