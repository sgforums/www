Why can't a muslim and a christian marry ? Why must the other party forced to convert his faith ?<br><br>2. Why guys have to circumcise ?? (just a silly joke... no offence intended... is it to learn kui hua bao dian or bi xie jian fa  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )<br><br>I don't know... I felt tat instead of banning, maybe we should let the people decide themselves isn't it ? Something is confirmed unhealthy, like cigarettes... we can only inform people about the harms but not banned them right ?</div></blockquote>1. Each religion has their rules for marriage. In Islam, Muslims are only allowed to marry Muslims. The rule is given in Quran by using the word Â“marry among yourselvesÂ”. The following is one of the verses that I think most relevant to this issue. There is no such thing as a Muslim marrying a non-Muslim. Muslims only marry Muslims. That means a non-Muslim should not be converted for the purpose of marrying a Muslim. One should be a Muslim because of his faith on Islam not because of marriage.<br><br>24:32 Marry those among you who are single, or the virtuous ones among yourselves, male or female: if they are in poverty, God will give them means out of His grace: for God encompasseth all, and he knoweth all things.<br><br>This is to avoid complication especially in terms of rules and guidelines provided by the different religion on which one to be followed. Among the rules with regard to marriage in Islam is:<br><br>4:4 And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, Take it and enjoy it with right good cheer.<br><br>Other family related rules are among others:<br><br>4:11 God (thus) directs you as regards your Children's (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased Left brothers (or sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases ('s) after the payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by God; and God is All-knowing, Al-wise.<br><br>4:12 In what your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child; but if they leave a child, ye get a fourth; after payment of legacies and debts. In what ye leave, their share is a fourth, if ye leave no child; but if ye leave a child, they get an eighth; after payment of legacies and debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question, has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third; after payment of legacies and debts; so that no loss is caused (to any one). Thus is it ordained by God; and God is All-knowing, Most Forbearing.<br><br>This complication will surely result in difficulties on both sides especially for the sons or daughters on which religion he or she must be taught and eventually chosen by them. There is a great tendency that this kind of marriage will not be successful.<br><br>2. The reason is for cleanlinessÂ… better you ask doctor aaÂ… good or not circumciseÂ…sori aaa gang... i do not understand chinese... cause i am a javanese hehehh...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have nothing better to do so I guess I write something to end this message  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Let's use this scenario. 2 countries, one country  give very strict driving test, and tester will not accept bribes and up to standard. A lot of people have to try many times to pass. The other give very easy test. Tester accept bribes and will allow those tat bribe him to pass. Of course the latter country got more serious traffic accidents. Wen accidents happened, maybe u should think if it is the system fault or if it is the person fault.<br><br>It is like some countries, having serious crime problems (bribery, drugs legal, countries ruled by mafia). Do u blame the citizen or system for tat ?<br><br>There indeed r some isolated cases like singapore bank robberies etc but I am talking about generally. Generally speaking, other religion have fewer high profiles incidents. I never hear a buddhist related fights or crimes except for sword fighting novel (they r fiction)<br><br>In the case of muslim, there r many problems. They have very harsh punishment for disobeying, and fail to provide good reasoning behind actions. They believe in Jihab, and they believe in revenge, ((those who harm the muslim brother, u must take arms and harm them back etc etc)) Their lives will be vastly different from other groups (spending a lot of time in mosque, only with their own groups during tis time. Cannot eat same food or alcohol, leads to eating and entertainment with own group. Fasting and other practise not common, making them even look, behave and experience differently. Inter marriage and quiting religion not allowed, thus lead to not mixing of ideas), thus leads to isolation<br><br>Frankly, I don't know what do I hope to achieve from tis. I guess I am just not happy with fanatics of religion. I just hope to place some doubts hence = lesser fanatics, though I guess it is as hard as someone asking me to go to a church  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

Despite the best effort of the Government Leaders (who are moderate Hindus themselves), the Hindu fanatics proceeded to demolish the Mosque.<br><br>Also, you have some crazy Chrisian Cults, who preferred to interprete the teachings of the Bible and lead their faithful followers into mass suicide.<br><br>You have a point also, where if a Government do not remedy a faulty system, and allow the system to rot, and create rotten citizens, then it is the fault of the Government.<br><br>However, the Government is not just an abstract entity that has a Life of its own. The Government is made up of Politicians, who are Humans, and each have their own private agenda.<br><br>So again, the Constitution of a Country as to how a Government is to operate, can also be corrupted by the people that form the Government.<br><br>I think we should blame the individual human beings, who have some fanatical ambitions to power, and prefer to interprete some teaching in a manner so as to take advantage the gullibility of the less brilliant, and move them to commit crime against other humans.<br><br></div>
