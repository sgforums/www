              <p><strong>UPDATED</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, May 22 — Malaysia and Singapore are looking into a proposal to build a new bridge linking the eastern side of Johor to the island republic.</p>
              <p>The Causeway connecting Johor Baru to Woodlands in Singapore will remain under the new proposal.</p>
              <p>The new bridge will connect the east coast of Singapore near Changi airport to a point east of Johor Baru.</p>

              <td style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;">
              <div>
              <p>Malaysia is hoping to leverage off Changi airport’s connectivity to spur development in Iskandar Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The construction of the new bridge will allow investors and visitors to fly into Changi and travel by car or possibly use the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) train to Iskandar.</p>
              <p><em>The Malaysian Insider</em> understands that Malaysia hopes the plan for the new bridge will see more investments, raise land value in Johor and create more jobs.</p>
              <p>Singapore is also willing to go along with the new bridge because of the benefits it will bring to Changi airport. Singapore is also understood to be planning new townships near the airport.</p>
              <p>And if Iskandar takes off in a big way, Singapore would also share in the economic growth.</p>
              <p>Both governments are now expected to start talks on the new bridge which, based on previous discussions, could take some time.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak made the proposal to his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong during their meeting in Singapore today. Najib is in the republic on his first official visit as Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>“The objective is to facilitate movement of people, goods and services, making it a lot of easier.</p>
              <p>“So I brought up the possibility of having a new bridge on the eastern side because it is less developed and has huge potentials.</p>
              <p>“There is no great hurry, but let us commission a proper study to get viability (of the project)”, he told a joint press conference at the Singapore Prime Minister’s office.</p>
              <p>Lee said he fully supported enhancing ease of movement from both sides.</p>
              <p>“Najib suggested for a longer term look at a new link on eastern side because Malaysia is developing Pengerang and Desaru.</p>
              <p>“This is something which the joint ministerial committee can look into it,” Lee added.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is currently connected to Singapore through the Causeway and also the Second Link which links Tuas and Nusajaya.</p>
              <p>Former Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad had wanted the government to build a new bridge to replace the Causeway but the idea was shot down by Singapore.</p>
              <p>Dr Mahathir then proposed a “crooked bridge” to replace the Malaysian section of the Causeway.</p>
              <p>But the “crooked bridge” was eventually cancelled by the Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi administration.</p>

              <p>Bigger numbers of cheap Malaysian workers coming with the opening of third bridge ?</p>
              <p>Why adopt a paranoid view to such a development ?</p>
              <p>There is always positive and negative to any event, and it will require human effort to reduce the negative and increase the positive effects.</p>
              <p>The fear of more Malaysian cheap labor coming into Singapore may not happen - when Singapore SME can have access to cheaper land to expand their businesses and take advantage of the cheaper costs of labor on the Peninsular east coast.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian workers coming into Singapore will normally live in the outskirts of JB, and will need to leave their homes at 4.30 AM each morning, to get through the 1 hour congestion of motor-cycles, and commuting a total time of 3 hours to get to their place of work that begins at 7.00 or 8.00 AM.</p>
              <p>The daily evening hours are just as bad when they have to take as much as 3 to 4 hours to get back home. </p>
              <p>Even as the Singapore wages maybe higher, and may increase by two folds with a positive exchange rate - it becomes more taxing to make the journey as age catches up.</p>
              <p>With Singapore SMEs investing in the proposed Iskandar Industrial Zone, it will be more convenient for the Malaysians to find work there, and lessen the inconveniences of daily commuting.</p>
              <p>Any positive outcome can only result in a deeper bonding of relationships between the two peoples.</p>
              <p>When politics stabilize between the two countries, it provides more opportunities and benefits for Singaporeans - with cheaper housing options that can offer a higher Standard of Living as a result of the strength of the Singapore Dollar spent in JB, and giving rise to a lower Cost of Living for ourselves.</p>

              <p>If there is sincerity from both sides, then the POA will be resolved.</p>
              <p>The items in the POA will have to be comprehensively resolved that should not leave any lingering discontent leading to more frictions in the future.</p>
              <p>The required resolution will include the Railway Station at Tanjong Pagar being relocated to Woodlands or terminate at JB, the return of the land on which the Malayan Railway track runs, the resolution to the future price of fresh water to be purchased from JB, and the replacement of the Causeway with a suspension bridge.</p>
              <p>If the Malayan Railway should terminate its service in JB, then it may result in our MRT line being extended into JB - resulting in a higher volume of interaction between the people on both sides of the border.</p>

              <p>If they intend to continue using the train to enter Singapore, they will have to keep the Causeway as it is, as a suspension bridge will require the JB Train Station to be relocated further out of JB City, so as to allow a gradual climb onto the suspension bridge.</p>
              <p>In any case, the amount of cargo coming into Singapore by train cannot be compared to the amount that is coming in by trucks of all sizes and types, and the volume of cargo is dwindling as much as the passenger traveling by train.</p>
              <p>The fastest train service from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur is about 5 hours, which is about the same price as an Express Bus, and with both being longer then the 2.5 to 3 hours drive by car along the North-South Highway (toll-gate-to-toll-gate).</p>

              <p>This is quite obvious - as the Causeway can always be shut to prevent any human or vehicular traffic.</p>
              <p>However, does it benefit both sides for such a policy to be effected ?</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the Malaysian get to benefit with the amount of Singapore Dollars earned and brought back into Malaysia by more then 400,000 workers that transit daily across the border.</p>
              <p>Singapore gain with a larger pool of workers who are familiar with - and share our work ethics, our language, our way of thinking and almost same diet.</p>
              <p>The shipyards and electronic sectors benefit from a reliable source of good labor from Malaysia, while the general Singapore public enjoy the efficient, reliable and safe transport services that are largely manned by Malaysian operators at the wheel.</p>
              <p>It is a win-win situation to both Malaysia and Singapore.</p>

              <p>i think it depend on how you evaluate comparative advantage between the 2.  vs the politics behind the POA.</p>
              <p>Changi airport tend to serve long hual passenger so it will benefit travellers from southern JB.  But i also think that JB airport will served cheaper regional air rates.</p>
              <p>From the past experience, we tend to see MY changing policies after implementation of a project that affect the investment interest.</p>
              <p>Also, the major issue behind POA is also the rail, water, and bridge am i right? bridge is only the smaller of all.</p>

              <p>The resolution of the "Railway" will surely benefit Singapore with the return of the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station to Singapore, plus the length of the land on which the railway track cut across Singapore that hinder development on both sides of the route.</p>
              <p>Malaysia was also to benefit from the return of the "rail estate" - as Singapore had offered to Malaysia a piece of land at the new Marina financial downtown that will be of similar commercial value to the land area occupied by Malayan Railway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the resolution of the "Water" issue - Singapore will be assured of the future water supply albeit at a higher price when the existing water agreement expire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "Bridge" to replace the Causeway will not be an issue if the present agreement not to replace is continued until such time when the Causeway can no longer be upgraded to meet traffic loads.</p>
              <p>If the Second Link and the proposed Third Bridge can be a reality, can there be any issue in building a Bridge to replace the Causeway ?</p>
              <p>It is a matter of sincerity and willingness for the political leadership on both sides of the border to work together for the benefit of the people on both sides.</p>

              <p>Before Abdul Garni became the mentri besar, I was told Singapore and Malaysia had plan to use the 2nd link for truck transportation to export goods for export via PSA, a third link would be an underwater tunnel, like those built linking HK island and Kowloon, for bulk cargo, especiall dangerous cargo, and Malaysia would convert pasir gudang to bulk cargo port.</p>
              <p>The causeway would be used strictly for human traffic, with potential to link the MRT to their railway system.</p>
              <p>Then the central government was concerned that Johore became too dependent on Singapore, more prosperous than KL and Klang, too many Singaporeans in JB....</p>
              <p>the situation got worse when Financial Crisis struck in 1997 when Mahathir failed to get $1 B from GCT.....</p>
              <p>I agree that the issue is more than just the causeway. We saw Pk Lah lost favour with Mahathir because he abandoned the crooked bridge. Now there are voice to re consider the issue again.</p>
              <p>whether the two countries are linked by causeway, suspension bridge, underground tunnels, MRT, rail, bus or car....is not really important, altimately, there must be genuine belief, on both ways, that links are essential for a win win for both countries.</p>
              <p>It is easy for Singapore to agree, we need to know how the Malaysia domestic politics would affect their decisions on such issues.</p>
