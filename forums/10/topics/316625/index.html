              <p>Surprising with so many lawyers in the parliament none of them speak up
              on the issue of abuse of power in the way GIC invests trust monies in
              all the risky equities in the markets.<br> <br> In law, there is such a thing as criminality or immorality or
              wrongfulness when the judge decides whether a wrong amounts to a crime
              in the common law or tort not defined in the statutes.<br> <br> In our type of parliament it appears no one can question immorality or
              wrongfulness of any act of government even if it amounts to taking of
              public monies of any amounts the politicians in power like without real
              basis of comparison as long as bills are pushed through with the
              political party's own majority in parliament without conscience or
              rightfulness of conduct or behavior. It is like daylight robberies
              being approved by the judge or chief justice.<br> <br> This type of use of political power for one's own purpose and gain is happening right here in our parliament.<br> <br> It seems that as long as a party is in power and it has the majority in
              parliament it can take any monies for themselves even if it is morally
              wrong or unconscionable to do so.<br> <br> Legal corruption namely using of political power to grab power from the
              opposition like the GRC or whipping of MPs to pass bills to approve any
              amounts of salaries the power that be wants is the most sinister form
              of corruption and yet it is approved by our courts or parliament here
              with none of the lawyers in parliament voicing out such wrongs for the
              people. So where is the voice of conscience in our parliament when MPs
              are supposed to represent the voice or conscience of the people.<br> <br> When a power has this kind of power it can do anything he wants however
              immoral and by whatever means or power at one's disposal. <br> <br> Our power has such supreme power that it can simply use the people's
              monies or surpluses to do what it wants without accounting for losses
              whereas company directors like CAO punting in oil resulting in similar
              losses were sent to jail straightaway.<br> <br> Whereas company directors are required to follow laws in making
              investments in risky businesses GIC and MM Lee are exempted from such
              laws even if he loses billions.</p>

              <p>Laws are setup by humans.</p>
              <p>Who controls these humans that setup our laws?</p>
              <p>Thus, control on top of control?</p>
              <p>Laws as we know can change.</p>
              <p>Thus, what does this mean?</p>
              <p>Is what is legal = moral?</p>
              <p>oral sex was a crime that comes with LIFE IMPRISONMENT in the PORE. Many find it ridiculous and it was amended or abolished.</p>
              <p>Thus, what is legality?</p>
              <p>Its is determined by someone or someones. that , I think is the most important aspect to focus on.</p>

              <p>Pigsticker,</p>
              <p>If legal corruption is the way to do it, to take monies not entitled to then covert corruption is redundant, outdated and low class. All the same legal corruption is taking monies one is not entitled to take except by power which went unchecked or overboard. It is more immoral and contemptible and precisely because it is known to be wrong and it is done that it is to be condemned by all.</p>
