              <p>I am surprised that you will even compliment a fool who will prefer to measure with the worst in order to justify its false position as being the best.</p>
              <p>If a Tribe of Mankind had continuously compare its status quo with the worst tribes and become contented with its present supposedly advanced state of development, would there be any progress for its own kind ?</p>
              <p>What will happen to the development of the tribe - when being deluded by its own ignorance of other more advanced tribes elsewhere ?</p>
              <p>Should we not strive to be amongst the best, by comparing with the very best, so that our present status quo can be further advanced, instead of measuring ourselves downwards with the worst and be contented with our present status quo ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been a case for the Political Leadership to spur Singaporeans to achieve for Singapore Inc - the World Class Status in all our economic endeavors - for Singapore Airlines to be the Best amongst the Best, for Singapore to shine as the focal point of best practices to serve the region and beyond, and for Singapore to be a HUB of all Hubs ?</p>
              <p>Yet, in politics and in social progress - we are asked to compare ourselves with the Worst and be contented ?</p>
              <p>Why is there a need for such Double Standards ?</p>
              <p>Is this to serve the political agenda of the truly mediocre talent in the Ruling Party that claimed elitist status without any cause ?</p>

              <p>You posted several links to SDP's website, quite interesting to see. Unfortunately my political knowledge are limited to what i read and hear. The link to http://www.facebook.com/wall.php?id=123065927315&amp;page=0&amp;hash=25a966bc4271edd7c0cc08c16657fbe5#/group.php?gid=123065927315 (Facebook group page of SDP)<br>There's this dispute with the moderators and Corns Tan.. which was censored away. Not very impressed with why were the messages censored away and leaving only the moderator's comments.<br><br></p>

              <p>LKY is only a person. Indeed, he was a PM for many years and now
              a MM. During his rule, some people will have different views and
              crushed by him.</p>
              <p>BUT how many forumers have been crushed by LKY personally and
              hence curse him for his death every now and then ?</p>
              <p>Indeed, personal failures, unhappiness and many grouses of these
              forumers are directed towards a common target ie LKY.</p>
              <p>So when LKY really passed away, will their
              personal failures, unhappiness and many grouses will be gone ?
              Will they live happily thereafter ? No more personal failures and
              unhappiness ? The answer is an affirmative NO and they will look
              for another common target and direct their personnal failures,
              unhappiness and grouses towards the new common target.</p>
