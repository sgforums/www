              <p>Only a stupid "hum" will blame the world for its personal life problem as a "hum" - do Singaporeans blame their personal failures on the World ?</p>
              <p>How would a Taiwanese "hum" know if Singaporeans will not celebrate the passing of LKY, and if Singaporeans will not find a new brighter beginning without LKY ?</p>
              <p>With LKY in control for 52 years in Singapore, how will a Taiwanese "hum" know if Singaporeans will not live in a better political environment WITHOUT LKY ?</p>
              <p>If Taiwanese "hum" has nothing to contribute to its own Taiwan, even when it has found its own freedom from the iron clad rule of the Banana General Chiang Kai Shek - can anyone expect a Taiwanese "hum" to contribute anything worthwhile here ?</p>
              <p>It is only too obvious that the Taiwanese "hum" must live in a controlled environment as it has no abilities to think, act, or protect itself.</p>
              <p>What else can be expected from the life of a "hum" except as as slippery flop ?</p>

              <p>LKY is the PAP, which is the Government for 52 years since 1957 - should he and the PAP not be responsible for all the problems, when at the same time it is so quick and ready to claim all the achievements - as if these are accomplished without Singaporeans being involved ? </p>

              <p>Only a stupid "hum" will blame the world for its personal life problem as a "hum" - do Singaporeans blame their personal failures on the World ?</p>
              <p>How would a Taiwanese "hum" know if Singaporeans will not celebrate the passing of LKY, and if Singaporeans will not find a new brighter beginning without LKY ?</p>
              <p>With LKY in control for 52 years in Singapore, how will a Taiwanese "hum" know if Singaporeans will not live in a better political environment WITHOUT LKY ?</p>
              <p>If Taiwanese "hum" has nothing to contribute to its own Taiwan, even when it has found its own freedom from the iron clad rule of the Banana General Chiang Kai Shek - can anyone expect a Taiwanese "hum" to contribute anything worthwhile here ?</p>
              <p>It is only too obvious that the Taiwanese "hum" must live in a controlled environment as it has no abilities to think, act, or protect itself.</p>

              <p>Pardon me for saying that this sicko is not worthwhile to be considered a Taiwanese, he she was born in Singapore.   It is an insult to Taiwan if they ever acknowledge him her as a Taiwanese.     In general, Taiwanese are much more politically smarter than him her.</p>

              <p>It has now returned again to be further cursed for its insufferable arrogant ignorance that dared to be condescending to teach others on subjects that it knows nothing about.</p>

              <p>I am surprised that you will even compliment a fool who will prefer to measure with the worst in order to justify its false position as being the best.</p>
              <p>If a Tribe of Mankind had continuously compare its status quo with the worst tribes and become contented with its present supposedly advanced state of development, would there be any progress for its own kind ?</p>

              <p>Should we not strive to be amongst the best, by comparing with the very best, so that our present status quo can be further advanced, instead of measuring ourselves downwards with the worst and be contented with our present status quo ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been a case for the Political Leadership to spur Singaporeans to achieve for Singapore Inc - the World Class Status in all our economic endeavors - for Singapore Airlines to be the Best amongst the Best, for Singapore to shine as the focal point of best practices to serve the region and beyond, and for Singapore to be a HUB of all Hubs ?</p>
              <p>Yet, in politics and in social progress - we are asked to compare ourselves with the Worst and be contented ?</p>
              <p>Why is there a need for such Double Standards ?</p>
              <p>Is this to serve the political agenda of the truly mediocre talent in the Ruling Party that claimed elitist status without any cause ?</p>
