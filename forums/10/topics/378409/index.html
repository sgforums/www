              <p>Yoong Siew Wah, a former director of the Internal Security Department in the 1970s, has claimed on his blog <a href="http://sgblogs.com/entry/kuan-tarnished-reputation-director/364307">Singapore Recalcitrant</a> that his reputation has been tarnished by an inaccuracy in the book Men In White.</p>
              <p>I reproduce his full post here.</p>
              <p><a href="http://sgblogs.com/entry/kuan-tarnished-reputation-director/364307">An Unconscionable Injustice</a></p>
              <p>Occasionally, there can happen to an unsuspecting person an underbelly attack on his reputation from not entirely unexpected quarter.</p>
              <p>Quite frankly, I am baffled by the motive of the ebullient authors of the overhyped political book "Men in White" in giving me unflattering mention in it. Whilst it is purported to give an objective history of the PAP struggle I wonder what have I got to do with the intra-party struggle. Anyway, in page 441 of the book the ambitious authors made the following unverified disparaging statement about me under the sub heading "Another Foreign Hand" : "But in 1971, after a police raid on his (Francis Seow's) woman friend's apartment, he used his influence and friendship with the then director of the Corrupt Practices Investigations Bureau, Yoong Siew Wah, to have the four officers who had conducted the raid sacked. The attorney-general Tan Boon Teik intervened to reinstate the four officers. Seow was allowed to resign rather than have his actions investigated because of his track record in the Legal Service. Yoong was also asked to quit."</p>
              <p>On 28-9-09 I wrote to the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Press Holdings drawing his attention to this disparaging statement about me and requesting that a correction be made in his newspaper. I explained that the CPIB was duty-bound to investigate all formal complaints. Mr. Francis Seow made a formal complaint and CPIB carried out investigations of the four detectives. The investigation papers were sent to the Deputy Commissioner of Police who made the decision to dismiss the detectives. There was a prima facie case against the detectives. There was no question that I was asked to quit. I was appointed Director of Internal Security Department following my CPIB stint.</p>
              <p>My letter was passed to Mr. Richard Lim, one of the three authors of the book. Mr. Lim replied on 1 October that the material for the disparaging statement was taken from a speech made by the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew at the Select Committee Hearing of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill which was published in the Straits Times on 10 October 1986 of which a copy was attached.</p>
              <p>It did not come as a surprise to me as the then PM Lee Kuan Yew was like a god to some people and the accuracy of his denigration of a person's reputation was invariably taken at its face value. That he made the disparaging statement about me in the heat of the moment without regard to its accuracy in his heated exchange with a cool-headed eloquent Francis Seow at the Select Committee Hearing could not be ruled out. He is not unknown to have behaved erratically with venom in his speech when highly agitated. He was obviously so infuriated by Mr. Francis Seow's biting taunts that it escaped his normally lucid mind that I was not boarded out but appointed Director ISD after my CPIB stint. It was subsequently pointed out to him but humility is not his forte and he has not been known as one to apologise for his mistakes. Mr. Richard Lim, one of the authors, has assured me that he would add a line after the sentence that I was also asked to quit to indicate that I was actually appointed Director ISD after my CPIB stint in his next and future editions of the book in order to be fair to me.</p>
              <p>It was reported that the then attorney-general Mr. Tan Boon Teik intervened to have the four detectives reinstated. Very gallant of him. He must have read the CPIB file on the investigations and could not have missed that the dismissal of the four detectives was made by the Deputy Commissioner of Police. How the then PM Lee Kuan Yew was given the impression that I had the four detectives unlawfully dismissed is something I would like to get to the bottom of.</p>
              <p>Mr. Francis Seow was the solicitor-general at the time when I was director CPIB. He had overall supervision of CPIB investigation files sent to his department for final direction. That I should have had a cordial relation with Mr. Francis Seow was natural in human relationship development. For the then PM Lee Kuan Yew or for that matter the attorney-general Mr. Tan Booin Teik to give a sinister connotation to such a relationship seemed to raise doubt as to the soundness of the detractors' mind. Why should the affinity between Mr. Francis Seow and me be seen as something unwholesome?</p>
              <p>The most decent thing for the Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew to do now is to undo the harm he has caused me and to restore my reputation. But will he?</p>

              <p>Thank God for the Internet - where there is the possiblity for the sunlight to be cast onto the darkness cast by the long shadows of small men attempting to stand tall.</p>
              <p>It is even more critical to find out the truth of some many other events in which the word of LKY is taken as God, and which countless have fallen without evidence but simply on his word alone.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that he should be so desperate to scheme new schemes to prevent the Alternative Political Parties to succeed in the politics of Singapore ?</p>

              <p>For Yoong Siew Wah to get more then what LKY is worth, Yoong will have to prove his reputation is of some value.</p>
              <p>CSJ tried to prove that LKY's value is self-inflated and is actually worthless - when one is to consider LKY's dubious political career at "back-stabbing" Lim Chin Siong - who was introduced to David Marshall by LKY as the future Prime Minister of Singapore; but had instead conspired to have the British to arrest Lim.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, the British  Colonial Archive of Official Records opened their files and revealed that the British Colonial Government had rejected LKY's idea, as the British ISD had investigated Lim Chin Siong and did not find any links to the Communists.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>While I sympathised with Mr Yoong, my question is he must have been in the "good books" of LKY when he was appointed Director CPID and ISD.  Unfortunately,  he must have  "stepped" on LKY's toes, for his reputation to be suddenly tarnised by LKY.  There are some ex-Directors of ISD, who have been well rewarded by LKY (no names mentioned), they must have apparently toed LKY's  line.  On the debate between Francis Seow and LKY, everybody who understands English, knows that Francis Seow won hands-down. If my memory serves me, that was the 1st and last time that anybody was allowed to win in the debate with LKY.</p></div>

              <p>CASE STUDY</p>
              <p>ZONE A)WHAT ABOUT HONG KONG?SOUTH KOREA?CHINA?TAIWAN?JAPAN?</p>
              <p>zONE B)WHAT ABOUT MALAYSIA?INDONESIA?PHILLIPPINES?INDIA?</p>
              <p>AS FROM A  CASE STUDY,WHY DID HK,SOUTH KOREA,CHINA,TAIWAN GO FORWARD WHILE THOSE FROM ZONE B LAGGED BEHIND IN TECH  INDUSTRIES?</p>
              <p>MOST OF THEM HAD SOME SORT OF MEDIOCRE OR LOUSY LEADERS AND SOME WERE VERY CHAOTIC.BUT THE ONES THAT ADVANCED THRU WERE FROM ZONE A.</p>
              <p>ZONE A:75% DIDNT HAVE MUCH OF A LEADERSHIP AND WERE FREE TO DO WHATEVER AND ONE WAS A COMMUNISM TYPE OF LEADERSHIP WITH VERY LITTLE FREEDOM.BUT THEY ALL PROGRESSED RAPIDLY EVEN THOUGH 4/5 WERE ALL INVOLVED IN CIVIL WARS IN THE 1950STILL TODAY.MOST BELONG TO MONGOLOID CHINESE RACE THAT IMMIGRATED OUTWARDS SINCE THE EARLY CHINESE EMPERORS FROM THE SHANG DYNASTY.</p>
              <p>ZONE B:DIDNT HAVE MUCH OF A LEADERSHIP AS IN ZONE A COUNTRIES.THEY ALL PROGRESSED SLOWLY AND WERE PEACEFUL COUNTRIES WITH NO CIVIL WARS.THEY WERE CONTENTED AS IT APPEARS.MOST BELONGED TO INDIGINIOUS RACE THAT WERE CONTENTED TO LIVE PEACEFULLY EVEN IF IT MEANS WALKING TO WORK OR SLEEPING UNDER A COCONUT TREE ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON BY THE BEACH.</p>
              <p>IF WE TOOK LKY AND PUT HIM IN A ZONE B COUNTRY............I BET YOU WOULD CHANGE YER STORY ABOUT HIM BEING THE MAKER OF SINGAPORE TILL TODAY</p>
