            <div class='col-md body'>The folk song sung by Peter, Paul and Mary resound in my mind, each time I wonder what has happened to the team of Ministers serving under GCT.<br><br>With the recent batch of new Acting Ministers and Ministers of State taking office, the previous batch seems to have all gathered as Ministers Without Portfolio in the PM's Office.<br><br>The last count included - Lee Boon Yang, Lee Yock Suan, Lim Boon Heng, Lim Hng Kiang, Tony Tan, and anyone else missed out ?<br><br>With DPM soon to take office, and having a medical problem with his prostrate that require him to have more rest and less stress, one can only wonder if all these Ministers in the PM Office are there to handle the work load that LKY and GCT used to take on single handedly.<br><br>Will the salary for the new PM be docked, to pay for the salaries of all the Ministers in the PM's Office, since he cannot perform the task that a more able bodied and medically fit PM used to handle ?<br><br>The term 'Shadow Cabinet' seems to take on a new meaning a la Singapore Style.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A record of GCT's speech printed in the South China Post, Hong Kong on <span style="color: blue;">19 April 2000 </span>and had made reference to LHL medical problem that could have prevented the propects of ever becoming the next PM.<br><br><strong><span class="large">Lee Jr 'not sure bet' for leader </span></strong><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><span class="small">South China Morning Post. April 19, 2000<br><br>By BARRY PORTER</span><br><br>PRIME Minister Goh Chok Tong has ruled out a snap election and says it is not a foregone conclusion that Lee Kuan Yew's eldest son will be his successor after polls in 2002.<br><br>"In politics nothing is foregone," Mr Goh said.<br><br>However, he said 47-year-old Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong would probably get his vote, so long as he remained in good health.<br><br>"<strong><span style="color: blue;">He had a sort lymphoma some time ago</span>. Even if he doesn't have it now, health is something nobody can predict</strong>," he said.<br><br>Mr Goh, 58, said his deputy's medical condition differed from that of former president Ong Teng Chong, whom the Prime Minister urged not to run for a second term last year.<br><br>Mr Goh said <strong><span style="color: blue;">Mr Lee's lymphoma had been growing slowly, the easiest kind to treat. It had been in remission for six years, which met the doctors' definition of "cured"</span> </strong>.<br><br>"<strong><span style="color: red;">That does not mean that it will not occur again</span></strong>. But it would be regarded as a new episode," he said.<br><br>Mr Ong, on the other hand, has fast-growing lymphoma which is harder to control.<br><br>"With president Ong, the doctors could predict the trend of the disease.<br><br>"And up to now the doctors' prediction has been right," Mr Goh said.<br><br>During his trip to Hong Kong this week, Mr Goh said Singapore's next elections would be held in 2002 and reconfirmed he intended to step down at "some stage" after them.<br><br>"I do not mind if you speculate that there will be elections in the coming few months, but I'm saying it will be in 2002," he said.<br><br>Mr Goh, who replaced former veteran prime minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1990, said he was making his intentions clear to prepare people.<br><br>It would take time to find and nurture the next team to lead the long-governing People's Action Party.<br><br>"We did have some difficulties and still do in getting younger ones to join us," he said. "Attractions outside are quite wonderful."<br><br>Asked whether he would then like to stay around as senior minister like Lee Kuan Yew, to steer his successors, Mr Goh said "no".<br><br>"I would like to be where I can still contribute. But at that point of time, it does not depend on me. It must depend on the new prime minister and government where they think I could serve," Mr Goh said.<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/000419sc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/000419sc.htm</a><br><br></div>
