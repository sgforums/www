              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mundaneity: My beef 
                                        with Straits Times.</span></p>
              <p>By SigiL</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>http://myrialogues.blogspot.com/2008/03/my-beef-with-st.htm</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singaporean 
                                        news (from the ST) reads differently from international 
                                        news feeds. That may be a good thing - Singaporean journalists 
                                        have perhaps developed a certain Singaporean rhythm to their 
                                        writing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Also, 
                                        the content is local, and reading descriptions about local 
                                        events, people, in local contexts renders the Singaporean 
                                        in foreign lands homesick and keeps him/her engaged.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">I find 
                                        a distinctive feature of Singaporean news (through the ST) 
                                        though, is its preponderance with mundaneities. That is 
                                        not to say their news coverage is completely trivial. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Their 
                                        foreign news content is acceptable, though often careful 
                                        not to offend allies - hence, little unfavourable reporting 
                                        of Chinese politics (though they have a field day with Malaysian 
                                        politics). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Also, 
                                        the financial section is often technically detailed and 
                                        quite extensive, which may appeal to those so inclined.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                        Forum page is perhaps a microcosm of their focus on mundaneities. 
                                        The page is inundated with letters, often complaints, covering 
                                        bread-and-butter issues. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There 
                                        are (almost always) no political commentaries, reflections 
                                        on bigger issues, rather terse exhortations that the "Government 
                                        should act on zzz because zzz" or even personal rants 
                                        like "why was my club membership suspended"?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">I view 
                                        the forum page as a reflection of the national consciousness, 
                                        of what's going on in the collective Singapore mind. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While 
                                        issues like "why was the nurse rude at the polyclinic" 
                                        may be personally important, I hardly consider them important 
                                        for the national consciousness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Does 
                                        this mean that Singaporeans only care about trivialities? 
                                        A quick trawl through the web for "rejected ST letters" 
                                        will yield hundreds of results. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Many 
                                        of the letters are probably just as trivial as those accepted, 
                                        but many are well-written reflections or commentaries on 
                                        important issues. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Case-in-point: 
                                        this political commentary written by well-known local ecrivaine 
                                        Catherine Lim on <a href="http://catherinelim.sg/2008/02/23/a-challenge-for-the-future-democratising-the-lee-kuan-yew-model-of-governance/">Democratising 
                                        the Lee Kuan Yew system of Governance. </a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A flamboyantly 
                                        written but incisive reflection on the important issue of 
                                        our socio-political system, rejected by the ST in favour 
                                        of exhortations to "exploit technology to solve causeway 
                                        jams". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">No kidding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Perhaps 
                                        the ST is giving the market what the market wants. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">However, 
                                        if we are to raise the level of discourse in the country, 
                                        as well as the political maturity of the people, the national 
                                        soapbox has to stop inundating the national consciousness 
                                        with mundaneity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><br> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Comment: </strong></span><br> <strong>george said, </strong><br> I am 99% sure that the journalists at the Straits Times 
                                        are just as frustrated. People like Cherian George had left 
                                        for that very reason.<br> The people to gun for is the Editorial Board and the politicians/ex-politicians 
                                        who have a mighty big say in how things are run. <br> And as you know the ST had already previously declared their 
                                        undying support for the party in power - of course, this 
                                        after it had run out of excuses for its veritable jingoist 
                                        position. <br> To the ST and Media Corp making advertising money overrides 
                                        all other consideration...</span></p>
