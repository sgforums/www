I have just given a very good link in my response to some misleading information. These are done by academics in Hong Kong, with regard to the effectiveness of noise barriers, using different materials. However, if you are asking me to do a study in Singapore, please lah, this is the govt's job! I don't pretend to be the govt when I am not! Unless the govt is willing commission a study on this, fund this project, then I may do my best helping with the study, even though I am not a trained engineer, I think I could contribute.  That's what govt is for! To provide "public goods" such as infrastrucutres and such. One must understand the role of govt before we expect everyone to become govt.<br><br>If the workings of a government is based on "complains" from Singaporeans, then that's very sad. That's the would be the most ineffective govt. For problems we cannot see, we depend on feedbacks. For problems we spot, we solve it through our own initiatvies. Simple as that.<br><br>The most common misconceptions of Singaporeans are that when they vote for anyone, they expect them to be expert in everything; for opposition, they expect them to become govt! Hey, the whole govt is run by civil service! That's what parliamentary democracy is all about! Those ministers are decision makers, giving directions BASED ON whatever information the civil servants provide them! They do not necessary know every bolts and knots of the ministry!<br><br>You may not be affected by such noise level, but there is a simple way you could find out whether it is acceptable to you. Goto AMK MRT station, walk to blk 50X, sit down there for a couple of hours in the afternoon. OR just take a look at your street directory. Look for the block built in Simei which is just next to the highway. Visit that place, sit down there.<br><br>PAP has many resources to do their own research. We don't. But empathy is what I have because I am more aware of my surroundings, more aware of the problems my fellow Singaporeans face which most of the time, they prefer to suffer in silence.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br></div></blockquote>Orr.. like that har. But your initial post sounds very strong leh, like you already know building the sound barrier is the right thing to do leh. Now you say need to study. Not to say cannot suggest and comment. But don't like it when you behave like you know it is wrong. Then when asked, you say must study. I rather you highlight things in a more subtle manner if you are not so sure.<br><br>Anyway, not saying you are wrong. Just please do not come up with such a strong statement only to retract to "need to study" by government later.

I heard the same thing in Guangzhou when they moved to the new airport recently. I think we need to do a survey first to see how many people really are affected by noise, how bad is the noise and to what extend can we and do we want to improve the noise level. HDB, private condos or houses near MRT stations fetch higher values due to convenience. If noise level is reduced then values of properties near MRT would be enhanced further, may be should ask the owners to pay part of the bills. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Also, was this feedback given at all? Things like feedback to LTA and MP? (Yeap, I know maybe this sounds strange to approach a PAP MP from an opposition, but they should serve any resident regardless of who you support). Just curious as to what you have already done to conjure your level of confidence on this proposal.<br><br>From a more realistic angle, if I am in charge, such study will only be made if (1) there are a lot of feedback on this or (2) Someone made a very convicing argument that this is indeed a problem. If just one person complain and did not produce any convincing argument, this type of feedback will likely be not followup. If nothing is done even after either of the above is fulfilled, then some people is sleeping on their job. In this case, you need to approach MP. If the MP ignores you as well, then time to vote him away when you get the chance.</div>

Of course, it is good for govt to be able to listen to people's feedback, but itself must be able to take initiative in doing the right thing to serve the people!<br><br>You did not live near any MRT track nor highway, thus you don't know the inherent problems that those people are suffering in silence. No complains mean no problem? That's pretty naive. Tell you a typical story. We were doing walkabout in Ang Mo Kio and there were lots of complains about mosquito bites, due to the delayed upgrading projects. But when we tell them they should write to the Town Council or that we could help them to write to the Town Council, no one take up the challenge! Why? Nobody wants to be seen as "trouble makers"! And they are fearful of the "repurcussions" of being "marked"!

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Qitai,<br><br>As far as I know, there are no documentation available on the net by the Singapore govt authority on noise barrier for roads or land transport. LTA website does not carry any issue on noise control. I presume that they don't take noise control into consideration in their city planning of land transport. That is why I claim that Singapore govt is not human orientated when it comes to governing in my original post. How come you conclude that I don't know whether there are studies done on this topic? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> It is precisely I know they don't have any documentation on this put up on the net, I suggest you ask the PAP govt to do feasibility studies! You are jumping into conclusions that suit your bias view!<br><br>I could only provide what I have found here in Hong Kong. Due to their effort of putting priority in reducing noise pollution due to land transportation, much research has been done on this noise barrier topic. I express confidence because I see the benefits and I experience the problems back home. But if you are not convinced as most probably you don't live next to the highway or the MRT track, you will only be "convinced" by feasibility studies!<br><br>And you must understand something. Not even PAP itself could provide you any "data collection" or "research". All those research papers you see them presenting are done by instituitions funded by public taxes! You are not being objective but bias on this aspect.<br><br>In Hong Kong, if you are elected to be the representative in Legco, you are entitled to grants to rent a proper office and employ staffs to help you function as the representatives. Though there are some abuses on these grants, but overall, it helps the representatives to have funds to do more work and research on various issues. Do Singapore has that? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for the ineffectiveness of feedback unit, if you have issues on this one, please lah, go and talk to those who have participated in it! It is not my own opinion that it doesn't work that way, it is those people who have first hand experience that say it doesn't work! Have you done your own research by asking around? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Please lah, I have shown you enough details on why I think sound barriers are effective and beneficial to our living environment. And you still claim that these are "empty talks"? I think you are engaging in empty talks just to shoot people down without any justifications! If this is about empty talks, I won't be able to shoot people down of putting up misleading information here! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And for a people like you who will straight away proclaim opposition is useless or unworthy without doing any research into what we do in and outside of parliament, I really doubt you have the higher moral grounds to stand on to accuse me of the lack of research!<br><br>And it is strange that you could actually conclude the "whole opposition" as useless when what you have engaged here is only two of us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Talk about objectivity! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> This is the usual tactic used by PAP camp and the controlled mass media! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> You don't even know me well enough to come to any conclusion!<br><br>I respect Paperchicken for he would hold his fire and think again. Give credits to good idea when it deserves it. I may be wrong about him that he is not middle ground voter. But for people like you, I think you only deserve the mediocre PAP MPs and govt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Qitai:</div><div class="quote_body">You are right to say that one should not wait for feedback.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Qitai,<br><br>I qualify what I said but you don't. Yet, you keep saying we don't provide enough for your consumption? I am really puzzled.<br><br>Even PAP, as a political party, cannot provide you such "localized" research! They depended very much on the country's machineries to do all the dirty work for them! It is unfair for you to demand such detailed studies from us.<br><br>As I have pointed out, the comments made against the Feedback Unit are from people who used to get involved in the whole process. Eventually, they gave up. There are just too many OB markers around. Contrary to what you assert that I don't even try Feedback Unit, I did send my electronic "application" to them you know! OF course, to test out their truly "inclusiveness" I flatly state that I am a member of Workers' Party. So far, no reply! (I expect them to reply via email) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I have done this for about three weeks already, waiting for their reply and actions! Thus again, you have jumped the gun, from your biasness.<br><br>If you want to try, you could bring this idea to them. Tell them, look, LTA doesn't even put emphasis on noise control according to stuffs they put up in their website. Why not try this out.<br><br>The idea is definitely feasible, in my opinion and the research I have done so far. Places with scarcity of land are using such technology to improve their living conditions. MRT will definitely tell you all the story how the noise is kept "at minimum", but please don't forget, we are not the technology inventor of the train system! We cannot be "better" than countries like Japan or even Hong Kong! For your information, the MRT system is built with the help from BOTH the Japanese and Hong Kong consultants! Why I know? Because one of the consultant happens to be my Hong Kong friend! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you haven't notice, in the past, there were very few flats built just next to Highway. But in recent years/decade, we begin to see flats built just next to highways. They try to build those multi-storey carparks just next to the highway, acting as noise barrier; but that is not an effective way. Well, at least they recognize the need to have noise barrier but didn't explore further.<br><br>The problem cannot be and should not be expected to be solved at our level. This is public good that should be provided by the govt. That's what govt is for....not to set up GLCs and compete with local enterprise, but to provide public goods like these. This is the basic role of govt. The govt has apparently not updated their selfclaimed "World Class Transport System" protocol to include noise control barriers, basically because, in the past, very few flats are built next to highway and MRT tracks. It is just a good to make the wake up call.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Qitai:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, he is much better than the rest.
