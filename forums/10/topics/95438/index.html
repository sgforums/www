Capital spending is slightly different consumerable spending. A long term consumerable spending should be viewed strategically as a long term sustainable spending. If PAP govt actually thinks that they could possibly sustain a yearly $50m spending on the Durian, then we must ask ourselves, shouldn't these funds or part of it to be channeled to these funds? Capital spendings should come from the $600million spent in building that Durians!<br><br>I believe there are enough funds to go around, if we really care to do our sums and take our priorities right.<br><br>I will touch on this in the near future, the role of govt and public financing.
