There is also some indication that chronic noise, such as from nearby freeways, can lead to increased violence. A well-placed stand of trees can reduce noise by up to 15 decibels, approximately that provided by a typical sound barrier.<br><br>Now this is about man made noise barriers<br>http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/keepdown.htm<br>Noise barriers are solid obstructions built between the highway and the homes along a highway. They do not completely block all noise they only reduce overall noise levels. Effective noise barriers typically reduce noise levels by 5 to 10 decibels (dB), cutting the loudness of traffic noise by as much as one half. For example, a barrier which achieves a 10-dB reduction can reduce the sound level of a typical tractor trailer pass-by to that of an automobile.<br><br>So i will let figures speak for themselves. By the way, this info took me only 5 minutes to search on the world wide web. So next time you want to say something, please do a little research.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that sound barriers are quite unnecessary, and the way our MRTs now, are just fine. It's not really far from our houses. Also, I do not believe the MRT makes a lot of noise. I think most of the noise originates from all the announcements, bells and what have you's. Plus, the population density is higher in Hong Kong than it is in SG, so maybe that's why they need to pack it all closer, whereas we can have a more open environment.<br><br>Why should you have so many complaints about the government? Can you do better than them? If so, why don't you try to get yourself elected? If not, save your complaints.</div>

There is also some indication that chronic noise, such as from nearby freeways, can lead to increased violence. A well-placed stand of trees can reduce noise by up to 15 decibels, approximately that provided by a typical sound barrier.<br><br>Now this is about man made noise barriers<br>http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/keepdown.htm<br>Noise barriers are solid obstructions built between the highway and the homes along a highway. They do not completely block all noise they only reduce overall noise levels. Effective noise barriers typically reduce noise levels by 5 to 10 decibels (dB), cutting the loudness of traffic noise by as much as one half. For example, a barrier which achieves a 10-dB reduction can reduce the sound level of a typical tractor trailer pass-by to that of an automobile.<br><br>So i will let figures speak for themselves. By the way, this info took me only 5 minutes to search on the world wide web. So next time you want to say something, please do a little research.<br></div></blockquote>CenturionMBT<br><br>Cheers to you for coming out with the research.<br><br>However, your first remark was made at 1:10 am and reply was at 10:03pm<br>It supposedly took 5 mins. yet a span of almost 21 hours passed between posts.<br>You did the research, you get the credit - i wont deny that.<br>But i will let the figures speak for themselves too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why waste money ? those who want to live near MRT also must take the noise into consideration. they can choose to live further if they think they cant stand the noise.<br><br>whats next if u build sound barriers for highways and MRT tracks ?<br><br>Indoor stadiums in neighbourhoods for those '7th-lunar-month ge tai' ?</div>
