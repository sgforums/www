              <div>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">I think maybe your interpretation of the Chinese auto-industry might be misleading as well.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">China's auto-industry can survive very much on its domestic markets.  If you look at China's HUGE domestic market, and still low wage levels, it would thus make perfect business sense to produce cheap cars in large quantities so that the domestic market can actually afford them.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">What they are doing is essentially not repeating Latin America's mistake:  Making expensive cars that no one can domestically afford, and deemed to unreliable to export. </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">America's auto industry was badly hit in the crisis not because it was not cheap enough; but because it went into recession while China still had a gdp growth rate of 9.1%.  While America's domestic market stopped buying, China's domestic market barely flinched.  And that is why China is a rising economic superpower.  It has a strong domestic market, while at the same time it is export oriented.  The non-Chinamen didn't make any mistake, they just don't have an economy like China.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Another important question to ask is, "In context of the manufacturing sectors, are wage levels increasing or decreasing in China?"  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">You'll be surprised, wage levels are increasing, and provincial governments are looking into minimum wage laws!  BTW, Something we do not have in Singapore!  Hint: the causal relationship of the demand of the domestic market and wage levels may be reversed.  Because wage levels increase, people are able to spend more, further strengthening domestic demand</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">So another question is, do we have that kinda domestic market that China has? We don't and hence we are export oriented.  It means we get hit harder by global fluctuations.  And if the government pushes down wages, Singaporeans are just gonna be forced to spend even lesser, killing whatever domestic demand we may have.  It means our pillar of economics thus gets shifted even more heavily towards export orientation.  When the next round of global export dip comes in, we get hit even harder and then we get our wages pushed even lower.  I see big potential problems with this strategy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">The next part of your science and tech arguments sounds like propaganda to me.  And I am sure the Chinese are paying heed to it as well.  They too are embracing science and technology, and they have a lot more capability to take it further than we can in 50 years time.  They are buying over foreign MNCs, technologies and integrating into their own domestic companies, re-engineering them and re-exporting them out.  Singapore just cannot compete with China on that level.   </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Hence, I say its ought to be the end of our entire "cheaper" labor strategy and look at raising quality standards, efficiency and innovation.  And for that, the focus is not on science and technology.  In the long run, China's income gap and declining population may have a negative impact on their primary and secondary sectors.  Which means, their secondary sectors may suffer in quality and lack of standardization across its many different provinces. This is not a problem in Singapore.  In fact, we may even latch on to this and become final product assembly stations for Chinese products if we were to develop capabilities to support that.  Ie. "Made in China, Assembled in Singapore."</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">And if we want to be more than that, we need to look away from sciences and technology for a bit and start looking at how we can boost and build on our financial services sector.  That point I agree with MM Lee, that we need to strive to be the Switzerland of the East or if not at least the UK.  </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Whatever the case, the strategy of cheaper labor may do us in. </p>

              <p>Thanks for your reply. I sincerly appreciate your thoughts and efforts.</p>
              <p>Just a few quick points:-</p>
              <p>1. Yes, China has a domestic market, BUT NOT yet. Selling pots and pans would have greater demand than cars today but not high price items like cars.</p>
              <p>2. Leading to the cause which is a result of their low wages. They BETTER have a minimum wage because it is inhumanely low for the efforts they put in. Even our roadsweepers earn more than their supervisors today</p>
              <p>3. Which will ultimately lead to an eventual rise in cost in their productions and exported goods, in line with outside markets, if such markets still exists without being bankrupt by them in the first place.</p>
              <p>4. I agree fully with you cheap labour is not the way to go for ANY economy. But in time, eventually humans will seek for a better market share of profits between employers and govt taxes, as it had been throughout history.</p>
              <p>Lower wages is an anamoly for China today, but once the uneducated peasants becomes a huge educated middle class and more vocal thru capitalist policies, it will be a thing of their silent fearful commie past.</p>
              <p>5. I would disagree with you on science and tech part. Studying it and regugitating facts will not create the 'next big thing', otherwise anyone else would have created windows OS or handphone tech long time ago. It takes many factors for it to happen, but the most critical one is human ingenuity, which cannot be taught but nurtured by environment. Our 4th uni is the way to go to develope and nurture such talents. </p>
              <p>It had been a pleasure to partake in this discussion with you, but i guess time will prove who is right or had been wrong. But in the meantime, we all just have to buckle up, CBF style and face up to reality to put food on our table, which is more critical. As mentioned, we dont need the kind of money China needs, just a fraction of it as we are only a small population will see us survive secure and with savings for our next generations.</p>

              <p>I've gotta rest early tonight so I will make this quick as well.</p>
              <p>1.  You have been misinformed.  China's domestic market is there and its demand for goods is increasing.  That is why many countries also want to tap into its market.  Just cars alone, the total number of vehicles grew to 64.67 Million by the end of 2008, up by 18.1% from 2007.   Out of which, Private motor vehicles grew to 19.47 million, up by 28%.  China's domestic market is there, and is just waiting to be tapped in.  The recent financial crisis saw that happening when exports fell, and domestic demand being played up.   This is happening across sectors, not just the auto-industry.  So who ever who told you that China domestic market is not there yet, needs to go back to re-examine the statistics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.  Not sure what you meant by "the cause of the result is low wages."  What result is being caused by low wages.  That has been a very ambiguous statement that almost means nothing.  My point is that, wage levels are rising in China.  Again, statistical fact.  It is the rural primary sectors such as agriculture that is experiencing wage decrease.  Sooner or later, that is going to be a problem not only in terms of the huge wage differential, but also socially.  But as far as local demand is concern, the rising wage levels are positively correlated. </p>
              <p>3. Not sure what you mean by "which."  Low wages?  Or rising wages? What market being bankrupt by them?  Wage levels don't rise indefinitely, and especially not in China.  China's "federal" unitary system is kinda interesting because each province actually does compete against the other in terms of production costs, and even raise tariffs against another. So such competition within China itself may actually regulate production prices downwards if necessary.  I haven't seen a market being "bankrupted" by China, so I am unclear what you are referring to. </p>
              <p>4.  Low wages is not anomaly in NICs.  And China is still very much considered an NIC.  Not sure if you are clear about NICs.  Not sure what you mean by "humans will seek for better market share between employer and govt taxes," also.  Doesn't really make sense.  </p>
              <p>5.  Again, myth.  It is a myth to believe that innovation is part of culture and must be nurtured by environment.  That is a very deliberately ambiguous statement.  What constitutes the word "environment."  Innovation can be cultivated through education, but not if its so focused on sciences and technology.  Fact is, Liberal Market Economies such as the United States and United Kingdom particularly own most of the world's patents for ideas and innovations.  Their education syllabus leans more to the arts and social sciences and that has been seen to be a correlation to innovation.  That is because these arts and social sciences lean more towards finding out "why" and "what does it matter" type of education systems.  It is sciences and technology that requires students regurgitate what they learn without asking why.   Innovation can be cultured through education.</p>
              <p>And I fundamentally disagree with your conclusion. Singapore needs money, its a matter of what strategy to adopt and how to get money to come in.  Savings won't last forever, whatever that is supposed to mean.  </p>

              <p>Was that a threat to the Japanese automotive industry in the 1970s and the 1980s, when China's State-owned and managed factories could not even produce any kind of consumer goods that could be comparable to Hongkong's or Taiwan's ?</p>

              <p>There is no need to fear the chinamen. The reason is political. How long more can chinamen accept low wages? Again, compare our past. Malaysian labour was cheap, but when they improved, by piggybacking on our growth, their wages are no longer cheap as compared to the 60s.</p>
              <p>And with such ecomic growth came social problems as the educated growing middle classes demanded more share of the economic pie. So too will China become when their middle class grows up. They do not own every single resources or are self sufficient in production, as Japan was back in the 60s when powered up.</p>
              <p>They too dont call the shots and have to cooperate with the world. If the world feel threatened too much by the explosive Chinese juggarnaut, they too will react politically, espacially those with resources China needs.</p>

              <p>I've gotta rest early tonight so I will make this quick as well.</p>
              <p>1.  You have been misinformed.  China's domestic market is there and its demand for goods is increasing.  That is why many countries also want to tap into its market.  Just cars alone, the total number of vehicles grew to 64.67 Million by the end of 2008, up by 18.1% from 2007.   Out of which, Private motor vehicles grew to 19.47 million, up by 28%.  China's domestic market is there, and is just waiting to be tapped in.  The recent financial crisis saw that happening when exports fell, and domestic demand being played up.   This is happening across sectors, not just the auto-industry.  So who ever who told you that China domestic market is not there yet, needs to go back to re-examine the statistics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.  Not sure what you meant by "the cause of the result is low wages."  What result is being caused by low wages.  That has been a very ambiguous statement that almost means nothing.  My point is that, wage levels are rising in China.  Again, statistical fact.  It is the rural primary sectors such as agriculture that is experiencing wage decrease.  Sooner or later, that is going to be a problem not only in terms of the huge wage differential, but also socially.  But as far as local demand is concern, the rising wage levels are positively correlated. </p>
              <p>3. Not sure what you mean by "which."  Low wages?  Or rising wages? What market being bankrupt by them?  Wage levels don't rise indefinitely, and especially not in China.  China's "federal" unitary system is kinda interesting because each province actually does compete against the other in terms of production costs, and even raise tariffs against another. So such competition within China itself may actually regulate production prices downwards if necessary.  I haven't seen a market being "bankrupted" by China, so I am unclear what you are referring to. </p>
              <p>4.  Low wages is not anomaly in NICs.  And China is still very much considered an NIC.  Not sure if you are clear about NICs.  Not sure what you mean by "humans will seek for better market share between employer and govt taxes," also.  Doesn't really make sense.  </p>
              <p>5.  Again, myth.  It is a myth to believe that innovation is part of culture and must be nurtured by environment.  That is a very deliberately ambiguous statement.  What constitutes the word "environment."  Innovation can be cultivated through education, but not if its so focused on sciences and technology.  Fact is, Liberal Market Economies such as the United States and United Kingdom particularly own most of the world's patents for ideas and innovations.  Their education syllabus leans more to the arts and social sciences and that has been seen to be a correlation to innovation.  That is because these arts and social sciences lean more towards finding out "why" and "what does it matter" type of education systems.  It is sciences and technology that requires students regurgitate what they learn without asking why.   Innovation can be cultured through education.</p>
              <p>And I fundamentally disagree with your conclusion. Singapore needs money, its a matter of what strategy to adopt and how to get money to come in.  Savings won't last forever, whatever that is supposed to mean.  </p>

              <p>Your proposal is just a belief that higher wages would be possible with higher quality, efficiency and innovation.

              <p>No. I never claimed I am right here or anyway else. If it gives you that perception, then it is only your perception and not of my doing or any enforcement.</p>

              <p>Can the X-rated intellect contribute anything of substance that can benefit anyone it claims to be its fellow citizens ?</p>
              <p>Can the X-rat produce anything that will have any consequence to the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">livehood</span></em>" of itself without affecting the "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">livelihood</span></strong>" of the citizens, whom it claims no one owes anything to the Citizens and that include the Government ?</p>
              <p>Why will the X-rat want to be concerned with the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">livehood</span></em>" of those whom it claim to be its fellow citizens, when it does not owe anything to its fellow citizens ?</p>
              <p>The idiocy in the X-rated language skills have already shown its true colors in the other thread when it claims "<strong>civil obedience</strong>" <strong>is against the law.</strong></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/379345?page=3">‘<em>Only the complete idiocy of a X-rated intelligence can produce the word "<strong>outlawlery</strong>" that will surely "incite naive others to perform <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">civil obedience</span></strong>". Is there a crime in performing civil obedience ?</em>’ (*2) </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the X-rated intellect be depended to understand the simple English that the Shotgun had been indulging with in the replies made to the X-rated rat ?</p>
              <p>Yet, the X-rated intellect will want its own limited understanding of simple English to be further simplified, as it will arrogantly find fault with the simply structured sentences made by the Shotgun.</p>
              <p>This clearly shows the pretentious X-rated intellect that indulges in prose that it knows nothing about, as it attempt to plagiarize ideas that it delivers with the style that is no more then pure imitation without even the skills in comprehension nor in timing.</p>
              <p>The X-rated intellect of the imbecile rat is made worst in its undisguised pretentions as it attempt to be intellectual with its own limited understanding of simple issues that it is determined to make more complicated with its own stupidity:-</p>

              <p>Was there any mistake on the part of the Shotgun, or was it not due to the stupendous efforts of the X-rated intellect to find fault when none existed ?</p>
              <p>How did the brilliant intellect of the X-rat possibly have interpreted the Shotgun's view of science to be in the form of "quantum physics" - when Shotgun had clearly stated that -  "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">In areas</span> ..</em> (of science).. <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">such as quantum physics, that literally goes out the window</span></em> " ?</p>
              <p>These are the insufferable traits of the X-rated rat with all the pretentious efforts to be a pseudo-intellect - attempting to find its own relevance as it get itself lost in its deep set ignorance of its own existence and that of the world around it.</p>
              <p>Is there any further value in its pathetic X-rated being ? </p>
              <p>This must be the best X-rated joke to end a Sunday.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>So lets examine the statements shall we beginning with mine.</p>
              <p>S1:  <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #993300;">Hence, I say its ought to be the end of our entire "cheaper" labor strategy and look at raising quality standards, efficiency and innovation.</span></p>
              <p>I said that we should end the "cheaper labor" strategy.  AND look at raising quality standards, efficiency and innovation.  </p>
              <p>Which is Different from M1:  "end 'cheaper' labor strategy TO raise quality standards, efficiency and innovation."</p>
              <p>Which is also different from M2: "end 'cheaper' labor strategy BY raising quality standards, efficients an innovation."</p>
              <p>Lets look at your statement:</p>
              <p>X1:  <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px; color: #333333;">Your proposal is just a belief that higher wages would be possible with higher quality, efficiency and innovation.</span></p>
              <p> Firstly, that has been a misunderstanding between the "AND" , "TO" and "BY" operators.  Secondly, X1 reflects the misunderstanding of statement M2.  Which means you misunderstood S1 to be M2.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>S1 is my opinion that we should not always look into the option of reducing wages just to cope with economic challenges, especially competition from China. So what I meant was that we need to compete not in terms of just cost alone, but look at raising our quality standards, efficiency and innovation.  Basically things that value add instead of reducing our labor costs.  So my apologies if I did not clarify that. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, S2: "<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #993300;">What I do claim is that cheaper wages may suppress domestic demand."</span></p>
              <p>S2 is a claim while S1 is my opinion or recommendation.  S2 attempts to establish a piece of information, while S1 attempts to persuade the reader to a course of action. These two statements are fundamentally different in nature. It might have been confusing due to my lack of organization in a forum post I guess. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't meant to try to sound high and mighty.  I was just trying to establish that my views originate from what I have learnt in my studies which incorporate many analytical approaches besides just looking at statistics which you might have been mislead to believe.  What I hoped was that you could also tell me where you developed your views from, and perhaps understand the source of some of the rather "interesting" inaccuracies. </p>

                  figures. Stats are but guides, and it is dependent on how you use
                  it to twist it to support hypothesises.</p>
              <p>My faith is on science, which is irrefutable, no matter how many
                  times different methods are employed, you get the same answer.
                  History is also where my faith lies, for no matter how one hides
                  evidences, no one can shut up thousand others' mouth on what
                  actually happened.</p>

              <p>Why the need to twist what Minister Lim ACTUALLY said?</p>
              <p><br>Had our english detoriated to such low levels that we no longer understand simple words? Or a deliberate attempt to feel better by venting at others, even to the extend of twisting what had been candidly said?</p>
              <p><br><strong>Mr Lim said: "We are now upturning the downturn. As we move forward, let us go on the offensive. So let us move towards a cheaper, better, faster Singapore economy."</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> <strong>Mr Lim said that to be cheaper Singapore must improve its productivity. And that means producing better quality products and services in a more cost effective manner while being better meant nurturing new markets and broadening capabilities.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hate reality and truth just like you. It jettisons and jerks us from our comfort zone because ultimately, one way or another, we eventually would have to face reality. Better early than latter, as there will be more time to prepare ourselves mentally.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He is not saying we became a cheap labour force, only a more productive one whereby it would be worth the higher money paid to us to do a job, then to pay 2 or 3 lazy bickering uneducated indians or chinamen to do it for the same job at a lower price.</p>
              <p><br>At no time did he say we be paid as an indian or chinaman worker. It would be impossible to live on those wages. $100 a month will not even pay your transportion costs to get to work for a production worker. $500 a month as a supervisor or technician is not going to pay even rent for your house in Singapore.</p>
              <p><br>But no employer will pay a supervisor or manager $2000 a month if he idles more than he works, take long lunch breaks, disappears for hours on supposed outdoor jobs, long smoke breaks, reluctance to work long hours, avoid emergencies that may occur at work, and yet stay profitable. Worse if it is a critical production line where time loss is highly significant, where mistakes are costly in the range of thousands.</p>
              <p><br>Along with the rest of what he said, this is the only practical solution left till something better comes along, as the world reacts and we adriotly adapt to its changes. What he said and appealed is something to help us all put food on our tables.</p>
              <p><br>This is a battle of survival, for we, both employers and employees are in this crisis suffering together, threatened by cheap charlies. I am prepared to put in the hours and the sacrifices, but alone, I cannot help the economy or myself. It needs you to pitch in as well for the sake of our soceity made up of your family, relatives and friends and mine.</p>
              <p><br>But if you prefer to sit at home, rant and blame everyone else, then good luck. No one will force you. But it will not stop the rest of us from courageously doing what needs to done to get out of the crisis, and hope you too will join us soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our forefathers and even mothers had done it before in the 60s to give us what we have today. That courage and resilience is still in our blood even though pampered by the boom years of this generation.</p>
              <p><br>Thus we need not face our tomorrows with fear, doom and gloom. We are the captain of our lives, and the choices we make today determines who we will be tomorrow.</p>
              <p><br>Good luck.</p>

              <p>i think he said that to be productive, we must be multi tasking too, bao shuai bao hai, everything can do, well, that will make the employee more tough on the job and the employer laughing all the way. It gives a signal to employers to further exploit employees on doing more jobs and tasks with the same paid.</p>
              <p>Next, he failed to understand our local forces before talking about productivity, there are two types of labour here, one being old and not well educated, the other being highly education, young or middle age. Being old is not going to able to perform multi tasking, even if employers are willing to redesign jobs to suit the old, the old age labour forces will not be able to handing the physical attributes in it. Next the educated one will place themselve as management staff, ordering the lower peoples here and there giving multi tasking instructions. Productivity must not be taken as a tool for employer to exploit employee further, I think he is tracking on dangerous water.</p>
              <p>A simple productivity notion is to decrease the input and increase the output, we can do it in many ways, one is to cut high paying jobs, reduce layers of hierrachy to trim away the unwanted management staff who only knows how to walk here and there.</p>

              <p>I agree fully with what you said, except about the part with 'employers laughing all the way'.</p>
              <p>They too are equally squeezed by competition in this crisis, customers demand and overheads. Most Singaporean bosses are a responsible lot, but there is undeniably exist among them the more irresponsible ones.</p>
              <p>Democratic private enterprises brook no inteference from govts, unless it intends to become communistic in politics. But I agree that there must be a higher layer of regulation to protect workers from exploitation.</p>
              <p>On our part as citizens, we will have to shame them, dont work for them, dont support them and let them die out a natural biz death, so that our limited resources in land and human capital be put to better use working in better run organisations. </p>
              <p>But after what is said and done, having a job, performing well in it, as well as a cheaper but higher quality producation/packaging done in the fastest time, which is within our intelligent workforce's capability is the way to compete and put food on our tables.</p>
              <p>We have run out of options in the face of the commie economic revolution.</p>
              <p>Addeum: But we are not without other assets and weapons of our own. They are our geographical location, our close ties with neighbours built upon by bizmen and citizens for guanxi, as well as being friends with every other nation on Earth - 'you scratch a bit of my back, i scratch yours' tradeoffs. Its not all doom and gloom.</p>

              <p>Anyway, i do support productivity, we are way behind it, and if we dun do something about it, guess we are history. But we have to be firm about it, we need a tripartite support on it, employees willing to do more taskings, upgrade to better skills and willing to support the employers, employers on the other hand, must be committed to reward those good performers, sponsor employees for upgrading and have a long term version/plan for it employees and company. Lastly, Govt must reward companies who achieved high productivity and employees who are willing to upgrade and get recognised by govt.</p>
              <p>Such perfect tripartitism will be fine, but things dun seem to work that way, MNCs are not charity organisation, they can just hit rich and run,  SME got not time for employees' progression not to mention their own business which need more funding from govt inorder to survive. What is left are civil servants working in public sectors taking courses just to hold on to the 9 to 5 jobs.</p>
              <p>To churn productivity, Govt must take the lead, is the ministers or Perm sec willing to take on more task to reduce people inside the govt and thereby justify their paid?</p>
