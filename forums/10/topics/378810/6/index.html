              <p>I agree fully with what you said, except about the part with 'employers laughing all the way'.</p>
              <p>They too are equally squeezed by competition in this crisis, customers demand and overheads. Most Singaporean bosses are a responsible lot, but there is undeniably exist among them the more irresponsible ones.</p>
              <p>Democratic private enterprises brook no inteference from govts, unless it intends to become communistic in politics. But I agree that there must be a higher layer of regulation to protect workers from exploitation.</p>
              <p>On our part as citizens, we will have to shame them, dont work for them, dont support them and let them die out a natural biz death, so that our limited resources in land and human capital be put to better use working in better run organisations. </p>
              <p>But after what is said and done, having a job, performing well in it, as well as a cheaper but higher quality producation/packaging done in the fastest time, which is within our intelligent workforce's capability is the way to compete and put food on our tables.</p>
              <p>We have run out of options in the face of the commie economic revolution.</p>
              <p>Addeum: But we are not without other assets and weapons of our own. They are our geographical location, our close ties with neighbours built upon by bizmen and citizens for guanxi, as well as being friends with every other nation on Earth - 'you scratch a bit of my back, i scratch yours' tradeoffs. Its not all doom and gloom.</p>

              <p>This must be another light entertainment provided by the X-rated rat planning to retire as a bozo in this Speaker's Corner.</p>
              <p>It certainly reveal that it will take the idiocy of a X-rated bozo to interprete the imbecilic message in the speech of a Ministerial Bonzo.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it ironic that the bozo who has been proven for its poor language and reading skills should be asking - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Had our english <span style="text-decoration: underline;">detoriated</span> to such low levels that we no longer understand simple words?</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>Should this low level of English not be obvious in the X-rated pseudo-intellect, when it can be so brilliant as to find "<strong>civil obedience</strong>" <strong>to be a crime</strong>.</p>
              <p>The language skills of the X-rated pseudo-intellect has certainly <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">deteriorated</span></strong> to such low levels that the X-rated bozo could find questions and errors in the last response from the Shotgun when none existed.</p>
              <p>It now seems that the Shotgun had found it a waste of time to continue indulging the X-rated pseudo-intellectual bozo, as it never tire in its pretense to ride its high horse - that is no taller than a mole which is slightly taller then the X-rated rat.</p>

              <p><br><strong>Mr Lim said: "We are now upturning the downturn. As we move forward, let us go on the offensive. So let us move towards a cheaper, better, faster Singapore economy."</strong></p>
              <p> <strong>Mr Lim said that to be cheaper Singapore must improve its productivity. And that means producing better quality products and services in a more cost effective manner while being better meant nurturing new markets and broadening capabilities.</strong></p>

              <p>How does one achieve "<strong>cheaper</strong>" by producing better quality products and services in any "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more cost effective manner</span></strong>" ?</p>
              <p>Is the X-rated intellect crossing-its-tongue again with its X-rated intelligence that now conveniently forget that Singapore has no natural resources and has to import all materials with costs beyond our control ?</p>
              <p>With costs of imported raw materials beyond our control, high property prices subject to the scarcity of Singapore land, and utilities are subjected to foreign price fluctuation  - what other factor is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">within our control</span></strong> that will allow us to produce better quality products and services in a "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more cost effective manner</span></strong>" ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How ironical that this should be said at this stage, when it should have been realised in its conclusion with the earlier paragraph ? </p>
              <p>All the hot gas that continue to permeate from the X-rat that shroud itself with so much self-importance that it simply cannot appreciate its brilliant skills at crossing itself into irrelevance with its own ironical statement.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Is this an interpretation by the X-rated bozo of what the Ministerial Bonzo had said, or were the meaning deduced as a result of making assumptions of a series of words from the Bonzo that was designed to obfuscate without meaning what the message had intended ?</p>

              <p>The Ministerial Bonzo did say the following <a rel="nofollow" href="http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,13742,">‘in an additional press release on 15 October 2009’ (*1) </a>- which was the next day after his infamous "cheaper, better and faster" speech: </p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">He said two key performance indicators were met: Avoiding record layoffs and preventing a rapid rise in joblessness.

At the same time, <span style="color: #ff0000;">cheaper places</span> like China and India, <span style="color: #ff0000;">will also become better</span>.<br><br>'We are being squeezed on both sides,' said Mr Lim, adding that global competition will intensify in the next two to three years before the world's employment situation returns to normal.</span><br></span></em></p>

              <p>The Ministerial Bonzo will not dare to come clean and say so about <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">lower wages for Singaporeans</span></strong>, and yet the X-rated bozo can be depended on to miss the best part of the Bonzo's speech :-</p>

              <p>Only the X-rated intellect of a bozo will console itself to willingly accept the call from its Ministerial Bonzo - "until something better comes along".</p>
              <p>Clearly, even as the resident bozo pretentiously parrot the call of its Ministerial Bonzo, it has no clue to even resolve its own mess that is littered across</p>

              <p>Re-reading your meaningful post again instead of even looking into the egoistical babble from others that offers nothing as usual, long given up hope on them,  but with some time to spare, I would like to share an insight on the 'old' issue.</p>
              <p>In the 19th century, it was believed that not many would live past 70. Thus it was expected that a person in his/her 50s should be allowed to retire and enjoy what's left of life with pension and retirement funds, provided they had saved it in the first place or dependent on their children for assistance.</p>
              <p>However, modern science had evolved much beyond the ancients. Today, armed with DNA knowledge, we are in the cusp of curing common diseases such as cancer, alzhimer, etc, and even aging itself.</p>
              <p>Botax, lasik,Propecia Finasteride are those that can enhance physical appearance. Healthy living comprehension is avaliable to all. Even supposedly 'old men' are capable of performing marathons. Supposedly 'senile' old men are flying around the world helping societies...</p>
              <p>The 'old' is no longer what it is perceived to be anymore. The ancient standards no longer applies to aged humans in this day and age of modern science. We are living longer, and fully capable of even better performance based on one's experience.</p>
              <p>The only issue is the mental attitude of the aged. Do they think themselves old and senile, and let their bodies start to rot, or should they live healthily, with moderate drinking, food, and simple excercises such as swiming and jogging?</p>
              <p>Retire by all means, at even 30 years old, but one needs to eat to survive. Only by having a job can one put food on the table. The modern 'old' men are fully capable of performing what the young men can do, and with the necessary experiences to avoid pitfalls, which the young assumed are stubborness and unwillingness to change, till too late when the company fails.</p>
              <p>The young need not fear the aged or being unable to move up in the hierachies, for with the capable aged's guidance, more wealth can created instead of being fritted away on senseless 'change' strategies. With more wealth, more companies can be formed and created for expansion which will lead to more hirings.</p>
              <p>Whichever society can comprehend this concept will end up rich and propersous.</p>
              <p>It is time to change mindsets of both employers and employees, and our society as well on views of ' old'. Modern science and its capabilituies to enhance our lives is a reality and our friend to embrace. We are living longer today, if we do it right, and would bring meaning to life itself and others who love us.</p>

              <p>It is even more amazing that while it avoids answering real questions that were asked for its X-rated pseudo-intellectual replies, it will explicitly avoid imaginery questions that never existed in simple sentences made.</p>

              <p>One can delay one's ageing process in the manner that MM LKY has attempted to do, yet even he cannot deny that the ageing process has made him senile without himself even realising the onset of ageing - despite his best efforts with his overpaid wages from public funds to help him to stay relevant.</p>

              <p>The X-rated pseudo-intellectual should join a self-motivation Rah-rah team to help itself overcome its own disillusion of being an "insignificant being and as a nobody" - as it wll have more direct benefit to everyone that has to bear his insufferable senility while stuck as an infantile self-centered teenager.</p>

              <p>This part of the message must surely reflect the infantile efforts at sounding wise and experienced but without the substance of reality, especially when the pseudo-intellect has the innate ability to consistently double-Cross itself with its X-rated qualities. </p>
              <p>In the earlier response in this thread, the X-rated pseudo-intellect had cleverly stated that: - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">I would disagree with you on science and tech part. Studying it and regugitating facts will not create the 'next big thing', otherwise anyone else would have created windows OS or handphone tech long time ago. It takes many factors for it to happen, but the most critical one is human ingenuity, which cannot be taught but nurtured by environment. Our 4th uni is the way to go to develope and nurture such talents</span></em>."</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rated intellect had merely regurgitated what it presume to be facts about "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">modern science and technology part</span></em>" and had disputed the ideas behind it.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that it will now find any relevance from modern science and technology to benefit the aged in Singapore, and hoped that the critical human ingenuity can be nurtured by the environment.</p>
              <p>The X-rated pseudo-intellect is evident of a bad gamble by its parent to bring it into existence and hoped for the environment to nurture its critical human ingenuity - as its present final result is clear for all to view and assess, reinforced by its self-admitted declaration as an "insignificant nobody".</p>
              <p>Can "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">modern science and its capabilituies to enhance our lives</span></em>" be a reality ?</p>
              <p>What reality is there when the advancement made is at a high price that makes it unaffordable to the Singaporean aged ?</p>
              <p>The only one that need urgent treatment from advancement made in modern science and technology will be the resident X-rated pseudo-intellect.</p>

              <p>I respect your individual opinion, but it is interesting that you would want others to 'face the facts'.</p>
              <p>What 'fact'?</p>
              <p>Let's face this instead: Put yourself as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consumer</span> now instead of a worker. Will you:-</p>
              <p>a.) want to pay for  fresh, cheap and big boobs (to put it in a hokkien crude manner)</p>
              <p>b.) or pay for stale, expensive, and small boobs? And if you are THAT loyal, where will your money come from to support such loyalty? </p>
              <p>Economics does not end at the factory floor or the unloading of goods into the port. It ends in the hands of the purchaser/consumer, from which data is gathered as evidence of economic performances. Just equally some food for thought.</p>
              <p>PS: In response to your US republican ploy, an equally interesting food for thought though it may be, but rest assured that the 'cheaper, faster, better' products isnt going to last forever.</p>
              <p>Unless China is absolutely self sufficient in resources, needs no raw material imports and patented tech, and can teleport products directly into the homes of consumers, then the world will have to use CBF to compete forever.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, no. China is not self sufficient, its political idealogy while useful now to make its citizens automaton commie cheap charlies, but will face an increasing demanding educated large middle class thru its growing wealth for spoils and political dignity within another decade or so,  nor have teleport tech for more years to come.</p>
              <p>Thus CBF will not be forever. There is hope. And no, I do not presume to be right or made any claims so, nor impose my views on anyone,  but offering only an insight for consideration.</p>

              <p>I saw this really in your face cartoon about wage cuts on ST yesterday.  I believe it was the home section.</p>
              <p>First frame showed the boss cutting everyone's wages during a downturn.</p>
              <p>The Second frame showed everybody hoping the boss restores the wages when the economy was getting better... of course the boss was a bit nonchalance about it.</p>
              <p>I believe one of the forumers here echoed my sentiments towards this entire "cheaper, faster, better."  It was the hokkien saying of "want fresh, want cheap, want big boobs."</p>
              <p>Face the facts: People are not going to work faster, better or more efficient if you keep giving them disincentives to work slower and sloppier.  Naturally, such workers might get the sack, and raise unemployment instead.</p>
              <p>This may be unrelated, but interesting.  The US Republicans start off their new 4 year terms with constraints that raise unemployment and retard growth a bit.  Then, halfway through the term, the release these constraints.  Growth and employment follows.  Final step, claim the accolades for economic performance.  Just food for thought.</p>

              <p><br>Actually you can achieve a cheap, better, fast economy, IF you make the cost of living proportionate to cheap.</p>
              <p>If it costs $1.50 to have lunch, $2 to have dinner, and cars and houses are a fraction of the inflated prices they are now, then yes, people can accept lower wages.</p>
              <p>However, as far as I see:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>ERP goes up</li>
              <li>Transport costs go up</li>
              <li>Food costs go up</li>
              <li>Hawker centre rentals (the VERY thing that the govt CAN control) goes up after a makeover</li>
              <li>Housing costs go up</li>
              <li>Car costs go up</li>
              <li>Wages stay flat</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Just some examples above. How do you expect people to be cheaper, better, faster?</p>
              <p>Simply, the PAP just wants to have the cake and eat it. Spiraling costs of living, and yet asking the locals to accept lower wages.</p>
              <p>Only stupid people will accept such an arrangement.</p>

              <p>I respect your individual opinion, but it is interesting that

              <p>What 'fact'?</p>
              <p>Let's face this instead: Put yourself as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consumer</span> now instead of a

              <p>Economics does not end at the factory floor or the unloading of

              purchaser/consumer, from which data is gathered as evidence of

              <p>PS: In response to your US republican ploy, an equally

              <p>Its true that consumers want low cost, high quality n quantity.  And I don't have a problem with that.  I have a problem with Trade Unions, trying to drive down wages, while pushing people to work harder and faster.</p>
              <p>To me, paying them less for more labor is tantamount to slave driving.  Outside Singapore, eg Europe, US, trade unions help to negotiate better wages.  In places like Sweden, they negotiate for higher wages, while binding the workers to a level of performance. But over here, they seem to advocate wage cuts instead!</p>
              <p>China will be interesting in the next 50 years, that I agree. But however their wage levels rise, there are 2 factors that casts doubts on your predictions that CBF will not last forever.  1, the Chinese Central Government may push down wages levels.  2, China's production capabilities will always achieve greater economy of scale than ours.    Hence, if we were to directly compete against China, we may end up in CBF for quite a long time.  </p>
              <p>Finally, when it comes to "CBF", it should not be limited to just the employees.  Employers and firms themselves need to restructure themselves to be more efficient, faster and raise standards.  Why should the workers alone shoulder cost-reduction measures? Companies are inefficient and expensive not just because of their workers, but also because they are badly organized, and inefficient and generate greater overheads.  Some spend too little to retrain their workers and thus not improving the quality of their work force.  So why is it that it is just the workers that need to be cheaper, better faster?  </p>
              <p>I suppose "CBF" is just a bit too broad of a sweeping stroke in my opinion.</p>

              <p>I agree fully with you on the qouted passage above. Yes, CBF MUST include the employers as well, or our workers' effort would go to waste. Thus there is a need to weed them out. The market will determine which company will survive or fail.</p>
              <p>We, the citizens, can accelerate that if we know of any badly organised or abusive companies and shed light on them, so that they may free up resources and human capital to better organisations in this battle.</p>
              <p>As for soul_rage's comment that the cost of living is high here and thus CBF would be unworkable, I would like to take this opportunity to share my insight with him.</p>
              <p>1. The cost of living is within our control. Do we need the aircon to be turned on the whole night and cover ourself with thick blankets? Do we need to take a bus after a MRT ride for that last 1-2km walk? Do we need to eat at restaurants everyday. Must our kids be given money to splurge on lux items and food? I can go on with more.</p>
              <p>But the point is - we are in a financial crisis, thus our mindsets cannot expect to hope to maintain the standard of living during the boom years. If we persist, we will only doom ourselves by demoralization. The boom is ahead when CBF succeeds, but not now.</p>
              <p>2. Transportation is too a factor to achieve productivity. If our trucks and management are held up in traffic jams due to the rise of cars daily, our productivity gains on the workfloors will loose out on the roads. Thus there is a need to clamp down on our roads today, and make it costly for those who do not prosper by the roads and have no need for cars except as a status symbol. This is a crisis.</p>
              <p>3. I agree that hawker stalls rental are high and can be controlled. However, will the hawkers sell their food at a lower price. No, even when food and petrol prices had dropped, they had not lower their prices. Even those with rents at $300/mth continued to charge high fares for their wares, and splurge it on boy racer WRX for their sons, and ipods for their daughters.</p>
              <p>These hawkers, majority of them do not have academic background, nor the patience for it to comprehend the necessity for philosophy and humanities. They pay little or no taxes, which IRAS is impossible with its resources to keep track of. Thus, the higher rental is the only way to ensure they are made to pay back to society the profits they had squeezed out of us.</p>
              <p>4. Housing is another issue. I agree and would seek a morantorium on prices during this crisis, but let it be known that for each cheap hdb built and sold, it means lesser sqft space for our next generation. They will be paying the ultimate price, not us.</p>
              <p>In summary, the control on cost of living is in our hands. This is a crisis, and not boom times. Sacrifices and measures are needed to do battle from each and everyone of us.</p>
              <p>Again, I will NOT claim my insight is right, nor egoistically claim that if anyone who disagrees with me is stupid or intellectually challenged.  I only write so that readers may CONSIDER what had been written by me, and formulate their own perceptions and actions.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is true to say that lower down our expenses would be a solution towards cheaper labor but it is easier to say than done. The answer lies between human nature and the phenomenon of “NEW poor” and “the poor”. In human nature, it is often difficult or rather it is painful to take away the luxuries of people. Even if I can do it, can my love ones do it? You must remember the fact that I do have my love ones to support. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Well… in conclusion, I appreciate on the government coughing out money towards the economy and helping the workers. But I do think that they have a lack of understanding towards the employee and employers. And hence, it is difficult for them to strike a balance between employers and employee. If harsh to employers, they leave for another place. If harsh to employee, it is difficult for us to survive. “<strong>in making the economy and workforce cheaper, better and faster” </strong>are just mere words without understanding. </span></p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by xtreyier:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I agree fully with you on the qouted passage above. Yes, CBF MUST include the employers as well, or our workers' effort would go to waste. Thus there is a need to weed them out. The market will determine which company will survive or fail.</p>
              <p>We, the citizens, can accelerate that if we know of any badly organised or abusive companies and shed light on them, so that they may free up resources and human capital to better organisations in this battle.</p>
              <p>As for soul_rage's comment that the cost of living is high here and thus CBF would be unworkable, I would like to take this opportunity to share my insight with him.</p>
              <p>1. The cost of living is within our control. Do we need the aircon to be turned on the whole night and cover ourself with thick blankets? Do we need to take a bus after a MRT ride for that last 1-2km walk? Do we need to eat at restaurants everyday. Must our kids be given money to splurge on lux items and food? I can go on with more.</p>
              <p>But the point is - we are in a financial crisis, thus our mindsets cannot expect to hope to maintain the standard of living during the boom years. If we persist, we will only doom ourselves by demoralization. The boom is ahead when CBF succeeds, but not now.</p>
              <p>2. Transportation is too a factor to achieve productivity. If our trucks and management are held up in traffic jams due to the rise of cars daily, our productivity gains on the workfloors will loose out on the roads. Thus there is a need to clamp down on our roads today, and make it costly for those who do not prosper by the roads and have no need for cars except as a status symbol. This is a crisis.</p>
              <p>3. I agree that hawker stalls rental are high and can be controlled. However, will the hawkers sell their food at a lower price. No, even when food and petrol prices had dropped, they had not lower their prices. Even those with rents at $300/mth continued to charge high fares for their wares, and splurge it on boy racer WRX for their sons, and ipods for their daughters.</p>
              <p>These hawkers, majority of them do not have academic background, nor the patience for it to comprehend the necessity for philosophy and humanities. They pay little or no taxes, which IRAS is impossible with its resources to keep track of. Thus, the higher rental is the only way to ensure they are made to pay back to society the profits they had squeezed out of us.</p>
              <p>4. Housing is another issue. I agree and would seek a morantorium on prices during this crisis, but let it be known that for each cheap hdb built and sold, it means lesser sqft space for our next generation. They will be paying the ultimate price, not us.</p>
              <p>In summary, the control on cost of living is in our hands. This is a crisis, and not boom times. Sacrifices and measures are needed to do battle from each and everyone of us.</p>
              <p>Again, I will NOT claim my insight is right, nor egoistically claim that if anyone who disagrees with me is stupid or intellectually challenged.  I only write so that readers may CONSIDER what had been written by me, and formulate their own perceptions and actions.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>As a person who believes in Science, I truly am aghast at your comments made above.</p>
              <p>1. Are the majority of Singaporeans taking a bus just for 1km/2km? Are the majority of Singaporeans eating at restaurants?</p>
              <p>2. Must the solution always be expensive cars? Can it not be another solution? I have provided a suggestion before in the past, ensuring the quota of cars is distributed to the population with a $10 COE (admin charges). And each person may only register up to 1 car, and each person has to use the car for a min no. of years before he can bid again. There are many better possible solutions, only that it doesn't result in a profit-making scheme by the govt.</p>
              <p>3. You are stereotyping hawkers. As a man of science that you claimed yourself to be, such comments are irresponsible and misleading. You are suggesting that the majority of hawkers are rich millionaires when I see them slogging hours per day, and having to combat increasing rentals. True, there are always bad eggs (in your opinion), but these are only fruits of their labour (for cooking something that people love). Are you telling me that just because they are a hawker, they cannot enjoy some luxury in life?</p>
              <p>4. I disagree with the statement you made, that having cheaper HDBs means lesser sqft. More affordable HDBs results in more affordable resale market, resulting in more affordable private market. Again you are just making baseless remarks in order to support the profit-making stance that the govt is taking now. No one asked you to build more HDB flats. The suggestion was to ensure that HDB flats remain affordable, which in turn affects the secondary market.</p>
              <p>Of Course, for point 4, we are in a vicious cycle. We cannot afford to lower the prices of new HDB flats now, because if we do, people who have bought houses in the past stand to lose substantial value in their properties. Therefore there is no way but up for property prices in Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>Reality? Oh please. Don't make us laugh.</p>
              <p>You made a statement about Hawkers and them "charge high fares for their wares, and splurge it on boy racer WRX for their sons, and ipods for their daughters."</p>
              <p>This is reality? That ALL HAWKERS buy WRX and ipods for their children? You are a man of Science, trust you to make a "For all" statement, when Mathematics is telling you BLATANTLY you are stereotyping. the next thing I know, you will claim Mathematics is not Science *shakes head*</p>
              <p>Oh please, you are really a joke to all of us in this forum. I never claimed to be some great believer of Science. YOU DID. Therefore, you are falling head over your ass making stupid stereotyping like the above.</p>
              <p>And AGAIN (This is the FOURTH time) I post the below, which you have FAILED to reply, thereby continuing to show your total lack of credibility and graciousness.
