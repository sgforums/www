              <p> </p>
              <p>Some people might be capable and with some luck, they probably can achieve something for themselves, a better life even if not filthy rich. </p>
              <p>For majority of the people however, they are just average joes wanting to lead a stable life. But look at the living standards now and the reducing job securities with so many "cheaper, better &amp; faster" foreigners. Trust me that most employers look at the first criteria first.</p>
              <p>If you dun realized that lives are indeed getting harder and harder for them due to the many govt policies now, you are probably living in your own ivory towers also like those MIW. </p>
              <p>Dun compare to those worse off countries like wat the people on top like to do, for wat?! Anything to their favour, they will say compare this compare that. When you talk abt their salaries, they will say we dun compare ourselves to others haha. Joke. </p>
              <p>If you want to compare, compare with our own people in the late 80s to 90s. People's salaries at that time might be a bit lower (Note: A BIT) than now, but those are the times when people really can see themselves retiring with their CPF money. They can pay their housing loans in full in 10 yrs, and those money accumulated in their CPF after that are truely retirement money!</p>
              <p>But now, you probably dun even live to get back half of wat's remaining in your CPF, if any, with the never-ending increment of the withdrawal age. And stop those bullsh*ts that HDB flats are heavily subsidized when we know they're not.</p>
              <p>For the example of your business part, you are not wrong to say that it's your right to buy a ferrari even if you cut your employees' pay. What I want to mean is that you try doing that and see whether they will still sit down and "listen" properly to your words after that, or will they treat watever you said as bullsh*t from that point onwards. It is precisely the same kind of insensitive "so be it" attitude that angers many people now. Business is business, but are the govt running a business (Yes, actually they are) or leading a country now?</p>
              <p>You cannot blame people for repeating the ministers' pay saga because watever they said are just not convincing as compared to wat they are doing.   </p>

              <p>Basically, she just does not get it. The leaders tell everyone to lower their pay expectations, but they themselves are being paid so much, that what is 20%? There is no leading by example here.</p>
              <p>And don't forget that ministers who are over 55 will get pension per month, which is about 60% of their current salary. They get this in parallel with their salaries, so long as they are still working. The pension is not accounted into their pay, and is a hidden extra allowance.</p>

              <p>Theirs is the job that is the most secure in Singapore.  No sacking, termination, retrenchment, dismissal and so on.    No competition from FTs.  No need shoulder responsibility when things go wrong, no need accountability.  Theirs is the best job in the world.</p>

              <p>Dear Hum,</p>
              <p>To make them cheaper, better and faster, we shall apply the 3Ps method of leadership.</p>
              <p>1. Passion: All ministers must have passion in their duties and works. As such they must enjoy their work and also willing to give more to the country and it citizens, resulting in good, harmony and a peaceful society. That passion must leave on, and if they can do that, what we paid them is peanut, cheap and good too.</p>
              <p>2. Persistent: All ministers must be fighter, die die also cannot give up for the glory of Singapore, their persistency will enhance our citizens to follow and take them as good example, this will make us tough, durable and responsible in facing any issue or problem both in singapore and foreign affair. With a persistency in mind, they shall learn, gain experiences, become better and betteress.</p>
              <p>3. Perception: As perception change our behavor which in turn become our action, all Ministers must learn to change people perception, many leaders fail to realise that changing one perception is better than changing one behavor, usually you will see, leader complaining about people atitude no good, lousy and like shit, all because those leader have a wrong concept of change, they put their effort wrongly in trying very hard to change people behavor, which can hardly change if the perception is not changed. So our Ministers will taught on how to change people perception which in turn change their behavor and resulting in good action. This will mean faster in getting peoples to understand them, adapt to change and more votes.</p>
