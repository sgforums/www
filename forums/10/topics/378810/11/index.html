              <p>everyone multi-tasks. Full stop</p>
              <p>The question is, WHAT are you multi-tasking on? Something that adds value to you, or something that is just purely useless to you.</p>
              <p>angel7030 is advocating asking her waiters and waitresses, her bartenders, to do laundry, wash cups, wash pots and pans.</p>
              <p>To me, that is utter rubbish. As I mentioned in another posting, Mediacorp will never excel in our media productions because we make our artistes multi-task too much. In Hong Kong, artistes need only multitask on their core focus (acting, singing, emcee, direct, produce) while they have professional people taking care of their stage costumes, stage preparations, camera, lighting, etc.</p>
              <p>Here we ask our artistes to get their own costumes, prepare their own make up, etc.</p>
              <p>It's utter rubbish to me.</p>
              <p>If you believe in her crap, that will mean you probably won't get ahead in life, coz you do not know when to say NO.</p>

              <p>As an add-on, an interesting thing my boss said to me (he was a successful wall street consultant earning multimillion salaries) was that the ones who can go up the ladder are those who know when to say no.</p>
              <p>I am most afraid of my developers telling me everything is ok, when I pile the pressure on them. It's scary to hear them say, "sure, we can meet the deadline" when you ask them to perform extra effort.</p>
              <p>I am most pleased when my development lead comes to me and say "ok, we can meet the deadline, PROVIDED we get extra resource", for example, and not keep telling me ok, ok ok, and then misses the deadline.</p>
              <p>Anyone who believes in angel7030 definition of multitasking, will most surely continue to compete with the lowest forms of foreign labour</p>
              <p>Basically, in summary, multi-tasking is likened to the term "foreign talent", ie, both terms can be abused easily.</p>
              <p>Just like importing foreign labour in the guise of foreign talent, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">asking people to perform low-level jobs outside of their scope with the MAIN intent to cut costs, is NOT multitasking, but is better known as EXPLOITATION of labour.</span></span></p>
              <p>people like her should be ashamed. She would be prosecuted in other countries a long time ago.</p>
              <p>Ask Singaporeans to mature? I also ask the businesses to grow up and mature.</p>

              <p>In recent studies indicate that multi task is counterproductive to work.</p>
              <p><em><strong>"We may feel we’re doing two -- or more -- things at once, but it’s an illusion. Instead, we’re quickly switching our focus back and forth.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>That’s because the cerebral cortex can pay attention to only one thing at a time, says Hallowell. “What people really do is shift their attention from one task to the next in rapid succession. That reduces the quality of the work on any one task, because you’re ignoring it for milliseconds at a time.”</strong></em></p>
              <p>In other words mistake were made and employees could not fully horn indept in their jobs responsibilities.</p>
              <p>And so you get similar result from Angel7030....... answers every single thread but not able get too indept....constantly at superficial level.</p>
              <p>So Angel7030 demonstrate the result of her ablilities to multi bullshit...ha ha ha....  </p>
