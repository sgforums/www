              <p>I can't believe the guy's talking about cheaper, better and faster. In a real labour union, the members would have dumped him into a trashcan and rolled him down a slope. We need a minimum wage structure in place to protect the low-income workers, whats the point in training them if you're gonna pay them the same. There is no such thing as a upturn for them, they are forever in a downturn. Singapore is already ranked 2nd in the world in rich - poor income gap.</p>

              <p>I am tired and sick of seeing people from the lower income suffer non stop.    While they overpay themselves with world class and highest salaries in the world of politics, here we are we have locals who suffer earning low salaries to struggle to cope with surviving in Singapore.   There are insensitive, heartless people who condemn this group of people by telling them if they don't like it to get lost.   </p>
              <p>With the words from botak finance minister that he is going to do something to wages across the board, I am afraid he will urge govt and private companies to further reduce the salaries of the low income Singaporeans while they the ruling party continues to raise the costs of living.    </p>

              the govt only knows to create jobs which doesnt value add and pay that doesnt reflect our education level (we paid so much for studying) Furthermore aint singapore based on meritocracy? Yet they say we r picky.
              I credit them for others such as setting up tough legislation to keep singapore a safe place. But other than that, I cant think of any. On the other hand, the govt had failed in handling its internal affairs. They chose to turn a blind eye on them and continue to think that nothing's wrong with their policies.  
              For example, another NTUC (super market) was setup and created 500 jobs. But these are cashiers, stock labourers etc. Leave them to the unskilled foreigners. While they continue to be bosses and expect us to accept non value added jobs w/o minimum wage(hour rate $5 to $6) no educated singaporeans would accept.
              The working force in singapore is different from those in the past. They are more educated and had more aspirations. Instead of seeing it as an inevitable issue because of their meritocratic polies, they see it as a problem. Instead of considering and adopting policies to improve lives of the people, they want to suppress people with their "do or die your business" attitude. "Got peanuts eat better than no peanuts. Anyway you only eat peanuts" 
              Industries such as the finance sector, do we really need so many FTs? 
              Singapore really short of Talents? With so many graduates per year, I dun think so. FTs will only bring misery and dissentment to educated singaporeans with the cost of living rising so sharply. I still feel like the bowl of noodle that costs me $1.50 is only like yesterday's price.
