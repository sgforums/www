              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Interesting views, though I would appreciate you make your posting more readable, such as limiting each paragraph to not more than 8 lines.</p>
              <p>2 points, I wish to disagree, its all in relation to the white collar market</p>
              <p>In my view, I can split the white collar market into 3 categories. The basic grads (avg), the above avg grads (doing better than the avg), and those grads that excel.</p>
              <p>The basic grads ARE affected by the open door policy. PRC Nationals, and Indian Nationals, equipped with their local degree, come to Singapore and can easily push out any basic graduate (by virtue of cheaper labour). I can't comment for all industries, but I see Singaporeans in IT who are in the system development, and many other technical positions affected by this influx of foreigners</p>
              <p>The above avg grads usually do well, because their skillset are still not replaceable by the cheaper grads from the other countries. Of course, the word is STILL. Those foreigners are fast catching up, given more and more exposure to the global market.</p>
              <p>From what I see, for grads that excel in their field, some will probably stay in Singapore (esp those with a scholarship), or leave Singapore to find better paying positions. The wages in Singapore are suppressed to an extent, such that top grads who are not govt scholars are disgruntled that their counterparts in the govt are earning much more, and will move out of Singapore to find better paying positions.</p>
              <p>So I disagree with you that white collar workers are not affected. On the contrary, white collar are getting affected more and more as the time goes by.</p>
              <p>And of course, there are those who are above 40 years old. Singapore practises AGE discrimination, such that if you are over 40, you are considered too expensive (or as the govt encourages us to think, become stupid), and have to accept lower pay.</p>
              <p>This is something I WILL NOT accept, and hence, I am out of Singapore before I hit that age and find myself getting discriminated in the jobs market.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>haha, you sounded like a school teacher.</p>
              <p>i agree with your &gt;40y/o view. that said, i am not sure if this is unique to singapore. i have acquaintances over40 down under who relate to me that altho' one is not obliged to put age in his/her resume, they still have a higher risk of getting cut in the interview process in favor of younger ones; for different reasons.</p>
              <p>to an extent, i also agree with the views of the influx of overseas degree holders into singapore and the relative ease in which they land jobs. this is another area that irks me as it has a potentially disastrous side effect. the net result of this is, singapore is not getting what they have bargained for, i.e. contributing residents.</p>
              <p>case in point, an aquaintance here from mainland china now residing in melbourne have told me the relative ease of degree holders landing a job in sgp. both the husband and wife, after deciding to leave china a few years ago, landed jobs in singapore with relative ease. in fact, the hubby got a cushy lecturing job at ntu. and the singapore government too is pretty easy in school placement for their kids in top schools. the elder of the 2 was in a top institution in bishan (i supposed if your dad is a uni lecturer and you are from china, you must be smart). in truth, they openly admitted that singapore is never their top destination. with the relative wealth they amassed in singapore and obviously more polished english, they made their move to australia 2 years ago. i harbour no ill will against them. i would do the same if my circumstance were like theirs. what's interesting is many of these chinese nationals have the same line of thought. i believe the indians too.it's a known fact that singapore is a stepping stone. and a kind one at that.</p>
              <p>the kiasi and kiasu mentality of the singapore government mentality, which old lee admitted to, that it's better to admit lots and hopefully singapore will still get remnants of these` foreign talents' calling singapore home than not do so; would be singapore's undoing, imo. could it be that singapore tacitly admit that it did not have the necessary quality and conditions to attract the best to its shore; hence the need to `cast the net wide'?</p>
              <p>the impact of these free-flowing inbound immigrants have cast wide aspersions amongst singaporeans. whether this is something that the government either overlooked or did not anticipate; it's shortcoming is for all to see.  </p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by redDUST:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>i think the wage debate needs to be discussed in perspective.
              the discussion so far is in general terms.</p>
              <p>for a large proportion of blue collar jobs, the singapore
              government did not see it as beneficial `to pay more'. in fact, it
              doesn't make sense to try to retain this on the island. that's why
              a lot of contract manufacturing work has moved elsewhere. why, even
              malaysia finds it hard to compete with the likes of china and
              vietnam. especially in the unskilled sector, this is the most
              brutal of the lot. as these jobs are highly replaceable, and
              rightly the generally educated singaporean would shun these jobs.
              why would an `o' level singaporean sweep the floor? or at least
              that's what most singaporeans would think. arguably, if one
              pays the o level singapore acceptable wage, he/she may want to do
              it. but it will also push up the overall salaries
              scale of other job. hence, the foreigners in the
              neighbouring countries fill this gap. the salaries here
              unfortunately are depressed to near subsistence level by
              singapore standard. to a certain extent, this has a ripple effect
              on the skilled blue collar sector, where i believe the majority of
              singaporeans are affected. in the skilled blue
              collared sector, skills and technical knowledge
              upgrading are still paramount to maintain singapore's
              competitiveness in the market place. for instance, in the shipping
              or electronics industry, it is critical singapore maintain a
              competitive edge in efficiency and productivity. that said, the
              opening of the floodgate by singapore in the last few years
              attracted many of these skilled workers from neighbouring countries
              over. whereas in the past, predominantly malaysians are favored by
              the singapore government to `fill these gaps', now, it is not
              unusual to see other english-speaking nationals like filipinos and
              indians coming over and compete for these jobs. and these workers
              will continue to come in droves for as long as the singapore
              government keeps an open door policy. the wages here gotten by
              these foreigners, though manageably low by singapore standards,
              still represents a quantum increase from where they came from. and
              there are not that many jobs available either in those countries.
              no wonder they flocked in and singapore welcomes them with open
              arms as these people fill a gap and yet maintain an acceptable wage
              structure for singapore to be competitive. singaporeans in these
              skilled blue collar sector, unfortunately, are caught between a
              rock and a hard place. that's why there are increasingly more
              disgruntled singaporeans. and as the immigration policy continues
              to be relaxed, the majority of singaporeans will continued to be
              sidelined.</p>
              <p>in white collar jobs, wages are not exactly depressed.
              professionals with a few years of experience are still getting good
              wages. i think any singaporean with a degree worth his/her salt
              should be able to compete reasonably well and live the good life.
              unfortunately, singapore still see a need to maintain a 
              facade that it is an international or regional centre in this part
              of the world by having many expartriates to keep up with the image.
              obviously, the high salary comes with the package.</p>
              <p>i think the singapore government maintain a strategic
              view of wage/vocation in overall scheme of
              things. </p>
              <p>blue collared unskilled/highly replaceable jobs - cheapest
              possible wage </p>
              <p>blue collared skilled - managed wage strategy, higher than
              neighbouring countries but not outpriced in the market place</p>
              <p>white collared - market rate   </p>
              <p>my grouse is that the government did not weigh in its moral and
              social accountability to the citizens more. to me, social cohesion
              is equally important in maintaining providing a good balance in the
              overall health of the country. i know it is a fine line
              between appeasing its citizens and doing the right thing for the
              long term survival of the country. in this case, i think singapore
              erred.</p>

              <p>There are some points in your post that seem a bit unclear and contestable.  </p>
              <p>Firstly, the white collared ( I'm not sure if I like that term or not) market rate notion contradicts the Cheaper, Better, Faster strategy of competing.  After all, Singapore does not compete in the "unskilled" sectors.  Hence, being CBF in the unskilled sectors may have little impact.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the white collar jobs which are significantly more high paying, there is also more retention.  Experience and qualifications in these areas are harder to come by, and hence companies benefit from retraining and upgrading these professionals.  The skilled blue collars on the other hand, as you mentioned, suffer from more hire and fire policies.  </p>

              <p><br>U r absolutely right,</p>
              <p>Foreign immigration fall under the same catergory as our class diffferentiation, the lower class, where most are workpermit holders, the sandwich group, where most are PRs living in HDB, and the RIch Class with E or S employement pass.</p>
              <p>The problem facing local are basically focusing on the Middle class, ie the PRs, the question now is, are they really needed in singapore, as for the lower class, no question about it, they are needed and only a merely 10% make it to PR status. As for the Rich class, they are travellers who just want to make money at every opportunities, currently our property market surge have attracted many of them, but they are not permannent.</p>
              <p>In breakdown immigrants, we are in better position to focus on the excessive group, and that is the PRs, the question now are, do we need so many PRs? Is the purpose giving PR status able to truly help our economy. Or is that PRs is for the sole purpose of adding population.</p>

              <p>haha, you sounded like a school teacher.</p>
              <p>i agree with your &gt;40y/o view. that said, i am not sure if this is unique to singapore. i have acquaintances over40 down under who relate to me that altho' one is not obliged to put age in his/her resume, they still have a higher risk of getting cut in the interview process in favor of younger ones; for different reasons.</p>
              <p>to an extent, i also agree with the views of the influx of overseas degree holders into singapore and the relative ease in which they land jobs. this is another area that irks me as it has a potentially disastrous side effect. the net result of this is, singapore is not getting what they have bargained for, i.e. contributing residents.</p>
              <p>case in point, an aquaintance here from mainland china now residing in melbourne have told me the relative ease of degree holders landing a job in sgp. both the husband and wife, after deciding to leave china a few years ago, landed jobs in singapore with relative ease. in fact, the hubby got a cushy lecturing job at ntu. and the singapore government too is pretty easy in school placement for their kids in top schools. the elder of the 2 was in a top institution in bishan (i supposed if your dad is a uni lecturer and you are from china, you must be smart). in truth, they openly admitted that singapore is never their top destination. with the relative wealth they amassed in singapore and obviously more polished english, they made their move to australia 2 years ago. i harbour no ill will against them. i would do the same if my circumstance were like theirs. what's interesting is many of these chinese nationals have the same line of thought. i believe the indians too.it's a known fact that singapore is a stepping stone. and a kind one at that.</p>
              <p>the kiasi and kiasu mentality of the singapore government mentality, which old lee admitted to, that it's better to admit lots and hopefully singapore will still get remnants of these` foreign talents' calling singapore home than not do so; would be singapore's undoing, imo. could it be that singapore tacitly admit that it did not have the necessary quality and conditions to attract the best to its shore; hence the need to `cast the net wide'?</p>
              <p>the impact of these free-flowing inbound immigrants have cast wide aspersions amongst singaporeans. whether this is something that the government either overlooked or did not anticipate; it's shortcoming is for all to see.  </p>
              </div>

              <p>Din mean to be a teacher, just that you have good views, but need to put it in a more readable mode so that others don't miss it :) Otherwise it would be a great waste.</p>
              <p>The Govt either overlooked, did not anticipate, or chose to ignore the problems of free-flow of inbound immigrants. I cannot say this is a fact, but somehow I feel that they are using foreigners as a leverage against the locals. By converting a foreigner into a citizen, usually these folks have a higher probability of voting for the PAP during election time. Therefore, I view this as essentially a tactic to dilute the local's voting power.</p>
              <p>In addition, I feel that the age discrimination here is worse than overseas. It is true that you may be discriminated against during an interview, but AT LEAST you have the opportunity to impress the interviewers. In Singapore, there is a high probability that once you hit over 40s, you don't even have the opportunity to attend the interview, coz they would have discriminated against you right from the start.</p>
              <p>Coming back to the foreign talent policy, I had a friend who has immigrated to down under, who has a Korean wife. During his time working in Singapore, his Korean wife, after marrying him, also came to Singapore to work. Initially she was worried that as a foreigner, it would be more difficult to find a job (like in Korea), but the headhunter assured her that PRECISELY BECOZ she is a foreigner, she would stand a better chance of getting a job than the locals. This is how the situation is in Singapore. This friend is so peeved with the Govt, that he is now in Australia, coz he is protesting at how Singapore has turned against its own population.</p>
              <p>As a citizen, I feel we are becoming 2nd-class. This influx of foreigners does not hurt me, coz the job I am doing is not something the Chinese or Indians can do in the next decade or so. However, I am very concerned with how I see our fellow Singaporeans losing their jobs to the foreigners at all levels.</p>
              <p>It's no joke that the resident population's unemployment rate is higher than the foreigners in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Can the pathetic cry of a desparate X-rated pseudo-intellect be of any use when it has been repeatedly trounced as a fraud, who can only retaliate with irreverent burst of frustrated insults - with words that reflect its own intimate knowledge of turd that can only come from its infatuation with a word which it cannot create but must plagiarize from one who is as impotent as the X-rated fraud ?</p>
              <p>It is pathetic that a dumb, gullible and undiscerning X-rate pseudo-intellect will claim that others "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">believes that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">no change</span></span> should be made</span></em>" - when it is the X-rated fraud who will defend the PAP and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">insist that change is unnecessary</span> but to maintain the political status quo that has led Singapore to the present and continued future low wage environment.</p>
              <p>The X-rated pseudo-intellect that has been repeatedly proven to be a fraud, and will now attempt to deflect from the fact that it is afraid to change the political status quo when the PAP had scrapped the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/reports/private/hansard/appendices/19810306/19810306-HA-0400357.htm">‘Singapore’s Economic Development Plan for the Eighties’ – Parliamentary Report No 5, Session No 1, Vol 40, Sitting No 6 – 1981-03-06 (*6) </a>that had recommended - "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">high wages from higher value added products and services for a secure future</span></strong>".</p>
              <p>This plan was scrapped by then DPM LHL in his 1998 report to Parliament - when he had stated that - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/print/news_room/statements/1998/Coping_With_the_Asian_Financial_Crisis__The_Singapore_Experience__30_Sep_1998.html">‘High wage increases during the boom years of the early 1980s had been built into fixed wages. Workers expected these to be permanent and had planned on that basis. The increases could not be cut back when conditions changed and companies could no longer afford to pay as generously. As a result we suffered a sharper recession than we needed to.’ (*7) </a></p>
              <p>This had resulted in the <strong>Flexi-Wage Plan</strong> that saw Singaporean Workers wages and CPF contributions cut up into fixxed and flexible components; and subsequently this was tweaked into <strong>Flexible Work Contracts</strong> of 3 to 5 years - all designed to benefit Employers.</p>
              <p>Without any clue as to how to bring Singapore into the future while insisting to continue with the politics of suppressing wages and encouraging the idiocy in the distraction with a slogan to be "cheaper, better and faster" - <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">change is not to be expected even from the PAP</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>It is surprising that  a separate 2006 report titled - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eaber.org/intranet/documents/42/784/SCAPE_Shandre%20_2006.pdf">‘Lessons from “Benchmark” Countries: Korea &amp; Ireland’ – Shandre M Thangavelu and Hu Guangzhou, Singapore Centre for Applied and Policy Economics, Department of Economics, National University of Singapore (*8) </a>- had stated that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the open economies of Ireland and Korea, and reported their success in tackling the skills shortage problems faced by their economies and have adjusted their industrial structures to produce higher value-added activities</span></em>." </p>
              <p>Can the X-rated Fraud substantiate its desparate claims and redeem any credibility to its characteristic outlandish statements that it will not even dare to qualify ?</p>
              <p>The X-rated Fraud can only be an outlaw to its own hypocritical pseudo-high values.</p>

              <p>If CBF is the only way to go, it is surprising that no other Ministers is tagging on to the idiotic slogan created by a miscreant that is idolised by the foolish gullible mind of an entusiastic X-rated Fraud that is ever willing to plagiarize another line from the PAP.</p>

              <p>Furthermore, we are a tourist, education, economic hubs as well as building massive infrastructures on our land for couples starting out in new homes, as well as future employment in such structures, there will be a MASSIVE inflow of foreigners on island, today and in the future too.</p>
              <p>In your past, the foreign elements were small, but so then was wages and a way of life. But we had progress beyond the 5 foot walkways, just as the world had progress beyond typewriters, so too must we adapt if we are to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">survive</span>.</p>
              <p>I am truly sorry you feel that way, of the good old peaceful kampong days where mostly were uneducated not because of choice but due to lack in money and opportunities, but not many would want to relieve those days ever again, of uncertainties, low wages, smelly drains,  little public infracstrutures and amenities. Not even aircon or costly cathode ray tubed TVs, nostalgic though it may be. Even if we stopped immigration today, kick out foriegners, if we tried. No one.....sorry pops.</p>
              <p>But if you can change your mindset, and adapt, life may still be rewarding for you as you will get to open up yourself and soak in the new cultures and progress you and our forefathers who had work so hard to achieve and bestowed upon us.</p>

              <p><br>Is this not another faudulent statement from the resident X-rated Fraudulent Rat to claim that there are only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">30% of immigrants</span></strong> in Singapore ?</p>
              <p>In the earlier thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://politics.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/377254?page=9">‘<strong>Citizens constitute only 63% of Singapore’s population’</strong> (*1) </a>- the following was offered in my post on 14 October '09. 8:41AM on Page 9 of the thread:- </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>[<strong>QUOTE</strong>]</p>
              <p>If based on the 2009 statistics, it is confirmed that Singapore Citizens make-up only 63.3% of the entire population, what if the baseline is moved back to 1970 or 1989 ?</p>
              <p>Using the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/themes/people/hist/popn.html">‘Statistics Timeline of Population Census’ (*1) </a>- the rate of increase in the number of citizens to the total population ratios during 1989, 1999 and 2009 - will reveal a more shocking trend.</p>
              <p>From 1970 to 1989, the increase in citizens to the total population had reflected closely to the natural birth rate, showing the slow growth - (low birth rate and tight immigration rules) - of only 634,000 over a period of 19 years.</p>
              <p>From the data reviewed, one will notice that the percentage of citizens to the Total Population is declining through the years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1970 - Total Population Nos: 2.074.5 - * - No of Citizens: 2,013.6 -  * - 97.064%</p>
              <p>1989 - Total Population Nos: 2,930.9 - * - No. of Citizens: 2,647.6 - * - 90.334%</p>
              <p>1999 - Total Population Nos: 3,958.7 - * - No of Citizens: 3,229.7 - * -  81.585%</p>
              <p>2009 - Total Population Nos: 4,987.6 - * - No of Citizens: 3,733.9 - * - 74.863%</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From 1989 to 2009, the increase in new citizens showed a steep growth that can only be from a liberalised entry of foreigners - amounting to a total of 1,086.3 million, which form about 41% of the number of citizens in census year 1989.</p>
              <p>If 1970 is used as a baseline, the increase in citizens between 1979 to 2009 will amount to 1,720.3 million of new citizens arriving since 1971 onwards.</p>
              <p><strong>This new citizens will number <span style="color: #ff0000;">85.43%</span> on the total number of Citizens in 1979</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If population arrival is used to influence the Elections Results, coupled with the total grip on government machineries to block the legitimate political activities of all Singaporeans, plus the total control of print and broadcast media, and further boosted by the political gerrymeandering prior to and during Elections - do we need to wonder how the Ruling Political Party managed to keep itself in power for 52 years ?</p>

              <p>We can certainly trust the intelligence of a X-rated Fraud to avoid addressing the controversies that it has so creatively organised but has been exposed again for the fallacies that have been filled with the hot gas from the piece of plagiarized turd that it is infatuated with.</p>
              <p>Can anyone of the wished for audience trust the ability of the X-rated Fraud to even begin to understand or regurgitate what it can understand to be its own facts ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rated pseudo-intellect - proven repeated as a Fraud - will not have any abilities to make any inference nor reference to statistics - when it can brilliantly claim that <strong>Statistics is NOT</strong><strong> a Science</strong>.</p>
              <p>If we use the  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/themes/people/hist/popn.html">‘Statistics Timeline of Population Census’ (*1) </a>- and change the time line to the 1989 census which had Singapore Citizens at 2,647.6 million out of a total population of 2930.9; and comparing this to the 2009 census with citizens at 3,733.9 million from a population of 4,987.6 million - it is obvious that the number of citiznship given is: 1,086.3 million.</p>
              <p>This makes new immigrants at 41.029 per cent from the 1989 citizenship total.</p>
              <p>We can certainly trust the X-rated Fraud to skew the interpretation of data based on its unique "<strong>outlawrely</strong>" understanding that <strong>Statistics is NOT a Science</strong>.</p>
              <p>Afterall, to the X-rated pseudo-intellect it possess the fraudulent belief that "<strong>civil obedience</strong>" is "<strong>outlawrely</strong>" against the Law.</p>
