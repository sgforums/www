              <p><br>Reality? Oh please. Don't make us laugh.</p>
              <p>You made a statement about Hawkers and them "charge high fares for their wares, and splurge it on boy racer WRX for their sons, and ipods for their daughters."</p>
              <p>This is reality? That ALL HAWKERS buy WRX and ipods for their children? You are a man of Science, trust you to make a "For all" statement, when Mathematics is telling you BLATANTLY you are stereotyping. the next thing I know, you will claim Mathematics is not Science *shakes head*</p>
              <p>Oh please, you are really a joke to all of us in this forum. I never claimed to be some great believer of Science. YOU DID. Therefore, you are falling head over your ass making stupid stereotyping like the above.</p>
              <p>And AGAIN (This is the FOURTH time) I post the below, which you have FAILED to reply, thereby continuing to show your total lack of credibility and graciousness. It's in RED fonts now, just in case you give an excuse its not obvious enough. I can bold in as well, in case you STILL cannot read it.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">This is a gentle reminder to the dumbass that he has not replied to the questions. If he doesn't reply, it further shows his lack of graciousness and blind ego</span></em></p>

              <p>I had initially decided against replying to your egoistical self. But the compassionate side of me tells me that I have no right to make use of any human, espacially if he is a fool.</p>

It is not you that I am replying to personally,  so drop that complacency, for you are just another egoistical fool here.

              <p>Laugh all you want. What more can one expect from an stupid inflated egoist like you? </p>
              <p>Furthermore, am I writing a peer reviewed researched article for presentation to a scientific seminar ? No, I am only writing in my personal capacity offering only an insight in an annonymous forum made of intellectuals and those yet to be, not about some specific scientific article, but still based on analysis of the reality on the ground, to others in a simple manner for easier comprehension, AND KEEPING TO THE TOPIC, unlike you, hell bent on twisting words and distracting this topic to suit your selfish aims.</p>
              <p>To answer your questions is a futile excercise, for you are neither in a postition to comprehend nor accept any other words other than those that comes out from your idiotic mouth, to twist and only to distract further issues. You may have the time, but i have more pressing issues that is more deserving than entertaining your over inflated ego.</p>
              <p>Dont you even care about your fellow citizens, or are you away so long that you dont give a damn to them,  except making use of whatever dissatisfied sectors to suit YOUR aims in the belief that you are right and everyone else - from the scholars, experienced bizmen, and administrators are wrong,?</p>
              <p>Is you ego so big that you think you are Singapore, and that everyone else who dont agree with you is stupid, not to see issues by YOUR light and agree to YOUR perspective? Dead wrong, dumbass. Be glad I am telling you the truth here and now, only because my compassionate side is kind to you now, in the hope that your blinkers may be removed to face the realities of what you had done and what you really are.</p>

              <p>Big words coming from a stupid fool who doesn't know what Science is (and claims he does), and what stereotyping is, and thinks he is a compassionate person. *Shakes head*</p>

              <p><br>Surely this is a classic self-defeating piece of trash composed in the typical style by the only resident X-rated pseudo-intellect in this Speaker's Corner.</p>
              <p>It is pathetic to claim others to be egoistical when the X-rated pseudo-intellect is the only one to believe it is addressing a wider audience with its poorly research material that it consider as "facts" - when most participants take on issues in a one-to-one exchange.</p>
              <p>Is the X-rated pseudo-intellect as capable as it believe itself to be - in holding its own position with its pathetic intellectual standard, its remarkable command of the English Language, and in its dependence on plagiarizing words, catch-phrases, political ideas and slogans - and without the slightless clue in the timing to use anything at its disposal ?</p>
              <p>Surely the audience of the X-rated pseudo-intellect will understand <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/379345?page=3">‘the complete idiocy of the X-rated intelligence to produce the word "<em>outlawlery</em>" that will surely "<em>incite naive others to perform civil obedience</em>"? ’ (*1) </a></p>
              <p>Only the X-rated intellect will possess the great intellect to believe there is a law that makes it illegal for "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">civil obedience</span></em>" to exist.</p>

              <p>This is another remarkable display in the ability of the X-rated pseudo-intellect to double-XX itself in its claim that it is not to soul-rage that it is "<span style="color: #0000ff;">replying to personally</span>" but still it will see fit to address the supposedly "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">idiotic statements</span></em>" made by soul-rage's last response.</p>
              <p>It is even more remarkable that the X-rated pseudo-intelligence of a rat did claim in the opening paragraph that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the compassionate side of me tells me that I have no right to make use of any human, espacially if he is a fool</span></em>".</p>

No, I am only writing in my personal capacity offering only an insight in an annonymous forum made of intellectuals and those yet to be, not about some specific scientific article, but still based on analysis of the reality on the ground, to others in a simple manner for easier comprehension, AND KEEPING TO THE TOPIC, unlike you, hell bent on twisting words and distracting this topic to suit your selfish aims.</p>

              <p>Is there any excuse to be sloppy in ensuring that analysis are based on substantiated facts and not merely based on one's personal opinion ?</p>
              <p>It is simply disingenius and self-defeating to claim others to be "<em>twisting words and distracting</em>" from the topic when it is obvious that the X-rated pseudo-intellect is already exposed for its bankrupt and hollow positions that it prefer to stand firm for the sake of the X-rated ego. </p>

              <p>Surely the "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">wider audience</span></em>" must be keenly awaiting for the words of rebuttals which the X-rated pseudo-intellect of a rat had desired to entertain ?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>With the X-rated ability to forget its claim to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">speak to a wider audience</span></em>" - can the concern of the X-rated fraud towards "fellow citizens" be real, or is it another high fallutin text that it shamelessly plagiarized from others to shore up its embarrassingly X-rated exposed position ?</p>
              <p>Can "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the scholars, experienced bizmen, and administrators</span></em>" be wrong on the side of the X-rated pseudo-intellectual fraud, or could they not be on the side on the issues expressed by soul_rage ?</p>
              <p>It is disingenius and shameless for the X-rated intellectual fraud to make false and hollow assumptions when it has no basis to associate its own opinion to be followed by any other groups of people - let alone the wider audience.</p>

              <p>Should the X-rated pseudo-intellectual fraud not be similarly grateful for the lessons that have been spoon-fed to correct the many exposed X-rated flaws and poor skills that were shamelessly displayed by the resident X-rated intellectual fraud ?</p>
              <p>It is amazing that somehow the X-rated intellectual fraud has still not learnt to grasp all the honest efforts given to it, but will indulge in wicked retaliation towards the honesty of soul_rage ?</p>

              <p>At the end of this entire exercise that started off with a declaration not to be speaking to soul_rage but to "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">speak to a wider audience</span></em>" - has ended up with an entire piece that is no more then a unfulfilled release of pent-up frustration.</p>
              <p>All the words used are the standard trashy reasoning from a self-defeatist mind that pretend to be larger then its own shadow but is no more as solid than the whimsical shadow of itself that vanishes when the spotlight of truth is turned on.</p>
              <p>At the end of it all, the X-rated fraud is no better being a pseudo-intellect - even as it attempt to be the best plagiarizer and imitator of the styles and ideas while standing in those with larger shadow then the X-rated fraud, who will be dumb not to realise that those larger shadow will similarly disntegrate under intense light.</p>

              <p><br>In any economy senses, unemployment will alway lack behind growth, in fact, you will see  more unemployment in the first and second quarter of next year.

              <p>The last economic crash was in 1997 - with the financial meltdown, and this had barely been resolved when 9/11 occurred in 2001, followed by the Bird Flu in 2002, then SARS in 2003 - followed by the economic slowdown in 2004 that led to the huge retrenchment exercises that lasted till end-2005 and lingered on through till even now.</p>

              <p>Are you expecting the Singapore Labor to be automated machines, or do you expect the employers and entrepreneurs to make heavier investments in automation so as to increase the productivity of each unit of Singapore labor that is employed ?</p>
              <p>With more automation - how will labor be deployed in their employment ?</p>
              <p>Will that not result in excess labor as the machine replaces the output of each labor unit that is being employed ?</p>
              <p>Can the labor and entrepreneur make any major decision to speculate about any uncertain future in the economic prospect of the World so as to determine if they should proceed to invest in automation to increase productivity ?</p>
              <p>Can the productivity of the human labor unit be tweaked like an automation machine so as to achieve an increase in manufacturing "productivity" by making the product "cheaper, better and faster" ?</p>

              <p>India may not be opening up to foreign investments in the same way as China, but that does not mean that they are not better and faster even as they are cheaper.</p>
              <p>India is protecting herself from being ravaged by the MNCs that will take advantage of its domestic consumer market, and have preferred to open her doors only to foreign entrepreneurs that are willing to set up manufacturing facilities for export only.</p>

But I know that the open debate is a painful process for closed minds...But let me make this point: that 5 million adult minds in Malaysia cannot be closed - definitely not in the lifetime of the people in authority.

              <p>The unemployment and growth negative correlation caught my eye here. </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/37167679/Growth-and-Unemployment-Theory-Evidence-and-Policy">http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/37167679/Growth-and-Unemployment-Theory-Evidence-and-Policy</a></p>
              <p>The above theorizes that the structural changes caused by economic growth creates unemployment that could fuel further economic growth.  Or at least thats what my 30 second glance through tells me.. =P  Please correct me if you think I made a mistake somewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, I don't really agree with that explanation as it seems to have generalized growth and unemployment.  My opinion is that a magnifying glass is needed to examine the growth and unemployment by sector.  Unemployment and growth in different sectors could have different causes or even reversed causality.  </p>
              <p>For example, if the hi-tech industries are not spending money to train and upgrade their labor force, unemployment may rise later on because the existing labor force will be insufficiently equipped to handle new developments in the industry.  </p>
              <p>This is why I feel strongly that when we make our labor force too cheap, companies will not be positively motivated to spend money to upgrade their existing labor force.  Why spend the money to send lower-tier employees on upgrade courses when they can fire them and hire new entry-level employees equipped with the relevant skill sets (ie, latest bunch of graduates from the polytechnics).  The labor force must be sufficiently "expensive" to motivate companies to upgrade their workforce instead of engaging in hire-fire policies. </p>

              <p>The unemployment and growth negative correlation caught my eye here. </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/37167679/Growth-and-Unemployment-Theory-Evidence-and-Policy">http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/37167679/Growth-and-Unemployment-Theory-Evidence-and-Policy</a></p>
              <p>The above theorizes that the structural changes caused by economic growth creates unemployment that could fuel further economic growth.  Or at least thats what my 30 second glance through tells me.. =P  Please correct me if you think I made a mistake somewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, I don't really agree with that explanation as it seems to have generalized growth and unemployment.  My opinion is that a magnifying glass is needed to examine the growth and unemployment by sector.  Unemployment and growth in different sectors could have different causes or even reversed causality.  </p>
              <p>For example, if the hi-tech industries are not spending money to train and upgrade their labor force, unemployment may rise later on because the existing labor force will be insufficiently equipped to handle new developments in the industry.  </p>
              <p>This is why I feel strongly that when we make our labor force too cheap, companies will not be positively motivated to spend money to upgrade their existing labor force.  Why spend the money to send lower-tier employees on upgrade courses when they can fire them and hire new entry-level employees equipped with the relevant skill sets (ie, latest bunch of graduates from the polytechnics).  The labor force must be sufficiently "expensive" to motivate companies to upgrade their workforce instead of engaging in hire-fire policies. </p>

              <p><br>You are 100 per cent correct - especially in your last statement - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">that when we make our labor force too cheap, companies will not be positively motivated to spend money to upgrade their existing labor force</span></em>".</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>14. We shall <span style="text-decoration: underline;">upgrade and restructure our economy to achieve higher skill and value-added manufacturing and services</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We will then realize the full economic potential of our people</span></span>. We will also be in a stronger position to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pay for higher oil prices</span>, overcome protectionism and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">remain competitive in the export markets</span>.</p>
              <p>15.

Wage increase alone is not enough to achieve economic restructuring. We must step up training at the universities, technical and industrial training institutions.

              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was that pursuit of upgrading Singapore's industrialization efforts into higher value added activities in areas of higher technology, so as to wean our industries from the low end, low value products that our neighboring countries can easily be more competitive than we can ever be.</p>
              <p>To achieve this goal, the wages of Singaporeans were increased to encourage the employers to upgrade the Singaporean workforce and to switch to higher value added products and higher technology.</p>
              <p>This led to a structural change in the economy with many low end manufacturers - that needed an army of labor at cheap wages - to move out of Singapore.</p>
              <p>When the 1997 financial meltdown hit Singapore, the PAP Government had taken another look at the previous economic strategy for the 1980s, and quietly changed their position again.</p>
              <p>This time it was seen that - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/print/news_room/statements/1998/Coping_With_the_Asian_Financial_Crisis__The_Singapore_Experience__30_Sep_1998.html">‘High wage increases during the boom years of the early 1980s had been built into fixed wages. Workers expected these to be permanent and had planned on that basis. The increases could not be cut back when conditions changed and companies could no longer afford to pay as generously. As a result we suffered a sharper recession than we needed to.’ – DPM Lee Hsien Loong,<strong>1998</strong>(*2) </a></p>
              <p> This time, the PAP Government called for Singaporeans to accept the flexi-wage plan that will allow employers the flexibility to adjust bonuses and wage levels so as to better cope with the economic uncertainties.</p>
              <p>Suddenly, silently and desparately, actions were taken to remove the earlier plans for a high value added workforce that will be able to move up the scales in sophisticated technlogical manufacturing processes.</p>
              <p>Ten years later, in 2008 - the PAP Government aided by the NTUC - advised that the Singaporean workforce must assist Employers by accepting that there cannot be an iron rice bowl, and that Employment Contracts must reflect the new economic reality to be based on short 3 to 5 year term.</p>
              <p>In 2009 - we have the idiocy of a NTUC Secretary-General to tell Singaporeans to be "Cheaper, Better and Faster" - even as the PAP government is ever willing to open the Singapore doors even wider to attract more foreign skilled and unskilled cheap labor to compete with Singaporeans for the same jobs without even the protection of a minimum wage for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Singaporean employers are even encouraged by the NTUC Secretary-General to train foreign laborers as well - instead of retrenching them.</p>
              <p>The goal now seems to be an attempt to compete - or to complement - China's low cost capacities - as seen by the various policies that contradict the strategic plans that were drafted for the 1980s that were never fulfilled.</p>
              <p>An interesting economic research titled  - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eaber.org/intranet/documents/42/784/SCAPE_Shandre%20_2006.pdf">‘Lessons from “Benchmark” Countries: Korea &amp; Ireland’ – Shandre M Thangavelu and Hu Guangzhou, Singapore Centre for Applied and Policy Economics, Department of Economics, National University of Singapore (*3) </a>was written in September 2006, and will show that the policies for the 1980s remain correct.</p>
              <p>This NUS research paper had highlighted the fact that with "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">the intensification of competition caused by the emergence of China and India, many East Asian countries have to restructure their economies to produce more skilled- and capital intensive goods to remain globally competitive. This shift in the industrial structure has greatly increased the demand for skilled labor, creating significant skills shortages and mismatches as the workforce try to upgrade their skills level to meet the demand</span></em>."</p>
              <p>The report have studied the open economies of Ireland and Korea, and reported their success in tackling the skills shortage problems faced by their economies and have adjusted their industrial structures to produce higher value-added activities. </p>
              <p>Are we having the right elitist talents at the helm that MM LKY had boasted in a speech made on Sunday night and reported over ChannelnewsAsia ?</p>

              <p>i think the wage debate needs to be discussed in perspective. the discussion so far is in general terms.</p>
              <p>for a large proportion of blue collar jobs, the singapore government did not see it as beneficial `to pay more'. in fact, it doesn't make sense to try to retain this on the island. that's why a lot of contract manufacturing work has moved elsewhere. why, even malaysia finds it hard to compete with the likes of china and vietnam. especially in the unskilled sector, this is the most brutal of the lot. as these jobs are highly replaceable, and rightly the generally educated singaporean would shun these jobs. why would an `o' level singaporean sweep the floor? or at least that's what most singaporeans would think. arguably, if one pays the o level singapore acceptable wage, he/she may want to do it. but it will also push up the overall salaries scale of other job. hence, the foreigners in the neighbouring countries fill this gap. the salaries here unfortunately are depressed to near subsistence level by singapore standard. to a certain extent, this has a ripple effect on the skilled blue collar sector, where i believe the majority of singaporeans are affected. in the skilled blue collared sector, skills and technical knowledge upgrading are still paramount to maintain singapore's competitiveness in the market place. for instance, in the shipping or electronics industry, it is critical singapore maintain a competitive edge in efficiency and productivity. that said, the opening of the floodgate by singapore in the last few years attracted many of these skilled workers from neighbouring countries over. whereas in the past, predominantly malaysians are favored by the singapore government to `fill these gaps', now, it is not unusual to see other english-speaking nationals like filipinos and indians coming over and compete for these jobs. and these workers will continue to come in droves for as long as the singapore government keeps an open door policy. the wages here gotten by these foreigners, though manageably low by singapore standards, still represents a quantum increase from where they came from. and there are not that many jobs available either in those countries. no wonder they flocked in and singapore welcomes them with open arms as these people fill a gap and yet maintain an acceptable wage structure for singapore to be competitive. singaporeans in these skilled blue collar sector, unfortunately, are caught between a rock and a hard place. that's why there are increasingly more disgruntled singaporeans. and as the immigration policy continues to be relaxed, the majority of singaporeans will continued to be sidelined.</p>
              <p>in white collar jobs, wages are not exactly depressed. professionals with a few years of experience are still getting good wages. i think any singaporean with a degree worth his/her salt should be able to compete reasonably well and live the good life. unfortunately, singapore still see a need to maintain a  facade that it is an international or regional centre in this part of the world by having many expartriates to keep up with the image. obviously, the high salary comes with the package.</p>

              <p><br>Great post that feature clear thinking on your part.</p>
              <p>On the part concerning Singaporeans not wanting to take on jobs unless the wages are high enough - you may get some serious detractors to your opinion if this group of people have any access to this forum.</p>
              <p>In the last great retrenchment exercise that began in 2004 and bleeding so many families in 2005, and which continued through 2006 until now in 2009 - many from the age groups 40+ to 60+ remain jobless, while the younger blue and white collared in the age group of 25+ to 30+ were able to find work within six to fourteen months at wages that are at least 30 - 50 per cent lower than previously enjoyed.</p>
              <p>Some older workers from the white collared group from 40+ to 60+ were reported to be even looking after Public Toilets in Private Clubs and Swimming Pools - when table clearing and floor sweeping jobs were all taken up.</p>
              <p>Some moved into "higher class" environment in office buildings and hotels - cleaning toilets and sweeping public areas, or taking on the housekeeping jobs in the guest rooms in the hotels.</p>
              <p>One can only ask why will most Hotels employ foreigners to be head of even the hotel housekeeping departments, and who in turn will also pull in his own familiar national to be the assistants - when there are so many retrenched Singaporean white collar managers that can easily be retrained for such management work.</p>
              <p>There are many hotels also employing 'Caucasians' in the role of General Managers, Sales or Marketing Directors, Food &amp; Beverage Managers - many of whom will look for an assistant who is also a 'Caucasian'. Similarly, the Chef after being employed will also pull in a Sous Chef and a Pastry Chef who are all Caucasians - even as there are many Asians graduating and working overseas for many years.</p>
              <p>Similarly, in the banking and finance sector, there are many 'Caucasians' filling up posts in the various departments for their expertise and connections, and they will also engage fellow-Caucasians to fill up the other supporting positions, and largely leaving Singaporeans to do most of the menial administrative works, with none being trained to even scratch the surface of a close knit group of international traders.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, since the 2004 retrenchment, the older workers remain largely under employed, with some taking on low pay menial jobs ushering passengers into MRT trains, working part time as Security Guards, or as Taxi Drivers.</p>
              <p>Some of the white collar workers who were previously in senior managerial positions with their high wages, bonuses and retrenchment benefits - will strike out into new areas to become the new entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>Many have joined together to enter the food &amp; beverage businesses opening food courts and new style coffee shops.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, a large pool of experienced older white collar workers remain available and untapped even as the doors are open ever wider for more foreigners to enter Singapore - as we can see the workforce employing more China nationals to work as check-out cashiers at Supermarkets and even neighborhood 7-Eleven Stores, and as workers manning hawker stalls at Food Courts, as well as helpers at small neighborhood eateries and restaurants, and in wet markets.</p>
              <p>This is where the PAP Government has lost its moral compass and its social accountability towards Singaporeans - when it has lost sight of its own goals that were clearly established for the 1980s, and seemingly now have no clear vision as to how to lift Singapore out of the vicious trap of low wages.</p>
              <p>It becomes even more stupefying when it refused to control the cost of living in Singapore by giving priority to the profitability of the Government Owned Companies with their respective monopolies to provide all essential services needed by private and commercial sectors in Singapore.</p>

              overall health of the country. i know it is a fine line
              between appeasing its citizens and doing the right thing for the
              long term survival of the country. in this case, i think singapore
              erred.</p>

              <p>Interesting views, though I would appreciate you make your posting more readable, such as limiting each paragraph to not more than 8 lines.</p>
              <p>2 points, I wish to disagree, its all in relation to the white collar market</p>
              <p>In my view, I can split the white collar market into 3 categories. The basic grads (avg), the above avg grads (doing better than the avg), and those grads that excel.</p>
              <p>The basic grads ARE affected by the open door policy. PRC Nationals, and Indian Nationals, equipped with their local degree, come to Singapore and can easily push out any basic graduate (by virtue of cheaper labour). I can't comment for all industries, but I see Singaporeans in IT who are in the system development, and many other technical positions affected by this influx of foreigners</p>
              <p>The above avg grads usually do well, because their skillset are still not replaceable by the cheaper grads from the other countries. Of course, the word is STILL. Those foreigners are fast catching up, given more and more exposure to the global market.</p>
              <p>From what I see, for grads that excel in their field, some will probably stay in Singapore (esp those with a scholarship), or leave Singapore to find better paying positions. The wages in Singapore are suppressed to an extent, such that top grads who are not govt scholars are disgruntled that their counterparts in the govt are earning much more, and will move out of Singapore to find better paying positions.</p>
              <p>So I disagree with you that white collar workers are not affected. On the contrary, white collar are getting affected more and more as the time goes by.</p>
              <p>And of course, there are those who are above 40 years old. Singapore practises AGE discrimination, such that if you are over 40, you are considered too expensive (or as the govt encourages us to think, become stupid), and have to accept lower pay.</p>
              <p>This is something I WILL NOT accept, and hence, I am out of Singapore before I hit that age and find myself getting discriminated in the jobs market.</p>

              <p>For simpler understandings using simple words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. There is no way our govt would be concerned with only grads, and then leave the non-grads on their own with low wages or die out, simply because we are a democracy. Such concepts are more likely in dictatorships such as China or Mynmar, where the rich are encouraged to get richer, and the poor kept in poverty under control thru the use of the bullet.</p>
              <p>Any democratic govt that follow such concepts will find themselves booted out long, and would not have survived for 50+years in our free election State.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. The manufacturing process and its viability depends on many factors, not just wide opened area alone. Russia attempted to build industrial zones, even in Siberia, which is a joke and will only waste investors money as the final product will be costly due to high transportation costs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, we had realized that competition will be stiff in comming years way back in the 80s. We are still in the best geographical location to make the best of profits in terms of manufacturing to end user, provided we go for high value products with our intelligent workforce and leave the labour intensive productions to our neighbours.</p>
              <p>The Chinamen, are like us genetically. They are currently a force to be reckon with in terms of economic output in any product, either now or within years.</p>
              <p>In order to survvie, we may not be able to compete on the small landsize we own, but we are stacking the factories high, creating more space for industrialists to set up shop here, filling the low skill jobs with cheap foriegn labour and increasing the pool of employment for our own citizens in mid management positions that we would never had if we had not 'stack em high'.</p>
              <p>At the same time, we had been the forefront of seeking technological improvements, being one of the best research centres in asia, with talents that discoveries will become a spinoff for market production quickly within our shores.</p>
              <p>3. Manufacturing is but only one of our assets. There are other assets, such as our service sectors that other countries will find it hard to compete, not that competition do not exists.</p>
              <p>We are at the crossroad of asia, a shipping entreport with all kinds of goods avaliable, various amenities for any traveller on short or long term biz stays. It contributes to our economy as well as provide jobs for our fellow citizens, both grads and non grads.</p>
              <p>No matter what bullshit had been said about foreigners taking over such positions, the FACT remains that a qouta system is in place for these competitors, and within the electorate control come election time. The foreigners that exists in this sector are only to make up for the shortfall of places our citizens may be shunning for one reason or the other, not just the wage itself and should be studied and remedied.</p>
              <p>So far, our polices had been successful in attracting travellers to our shores, and will continue to be the way.</p>
              <p>4.So it is not all doom and gloom for the grad and non-grad citizen, or the need to be demoralized. The self admitted piece of Turd here, a turncoat and a commie bastard asshole wiper, will attempt to spread her commie whitewashing here as proven by her previous posts.</p>
              <p>To believe her will only lead one to killing himself and others, that it is game over. She herself have no courage to face the future, to be adaptable and believes that no changes should be made. This will be her doom. But not a necessary belief we should suscribe to, nor something our elected officials believe so.</p>
              <p>5. I ask not that you believe my words, but to take a look at the reality around you and ascertain the facts yourself. This is a crisis now or at least at its tail end. We had made many sacrifices and pulled through. We must stay nimble and adaptable for survival.</p>
              <p>No one knows the future, but no one will be or had been left behind in our society as we do battle. We have the best brains in govt and the civil service. CBF, unmisinterpretated, is the only way to go now till a clearer picture emerges from the ashes of our current world financial crisis.</p>
              <p>The choice to be demoralized or give our best  shot without rolling over and say die is within your hands. No one will be left behind unless they want to be left behind.</p>

              <p>There are many hotels also employing 'Caucasians' in the role of General Managers, Sales or Marketing Directors, Food &amp; Beverage Managers - many of whom will look for an assistant who is also a 'Caucasian'. Similarly, the Chef after being employed will also pull in a Sous Chef and a Pastry Chef who are all Caucasians - even as there are many Asians graduating and working overseas for many years.</p>
              <p>Similarly, in the banking and finance sector, there are many 'Caucasians' filling up posts in the various departments for their expertise and connections, and they will also engage fellow-Caucasians to fill up the other supporting positions, and largely leaving Singaporeans to do most of the menial administrative works, with none being trained to even scratch the surface of a close knit group of international traders.</p>
