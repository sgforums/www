              <p>Maybe recruit foreigners with so-called talents and employ them for 1/3 rd of the salaries of the current ministers wages and utter the same mantra they they are do: that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">foreigners are subsidizing them</span> lar. That is being exemplary and worthy of these views that he/she is espousing in the local media. Otherwise, don't go around deluding and sugar-coating what is actually crap.</p>
              <p>Moron Minister is of the view that two-party does not work. Yes, it does not work for them, the ruling party and govt lar. Why? Cos there a lots of things that they now know they are getting away with scot-free. To cite egs, too numerous lar!</p>

              <p>Seems the thunderstrike party are the only people to deserve to be paid high salary, all the rest must get paid the lowest salary for cheaper economy.</p>
              <p>It makes more sense to pay the ruling party less than half of what they are getting to create cheaper economy.   By doing so I believe very likely there will not be so much of rapid rise in the living costs in sg.</p>

              <p>I agree 1000% with Mr Lim.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the government should illustrate the concept by leading as example.</p>
              <p>Cheaper - Cut all minister's pay by 70%. We should be cheaper than President Obama. The pay should be earmarked with the lowest pay.</p>
              <p>Better - One minster should head three ministries. This is the best way of showing the world that we have truly capable elite scholar running the red dot. Excess mentor, perm secretary, MP, senior ministers should not be in place as we are truly world class and not mentoring is needed.</p>
              <p>Faster - Cut the three working day response from all government agencies to one day. If we are employing truly elite as civil servant, three days to response is not acceptable.</p>
              <p>As for the world class transport system, cheaper, better and faster rule also MUST apply.</p>
              <p>If the above conditions cannot be comply, then the CBF concept is not applicable.</p>

              <p>Yes to that.    Do away with the position Minister Mentor.   Split the job of MM between SM and President.    Remove the other ministers in PM's office, leave only one minister to help PM.   Cut the pay of the the ministers who no longer are assisting the PM in his office.</p>
              <p>Cut the pay of PM by 70%.   </p>
              <p>Heard from reliable source that staff at Temasek are paid bonuses a few times a year.    Limit temasek to only pay bonuses once a year and bonuses paid should be up to maximum of 1.5 month.  </p>
              <p>As for all other ministers, reduce their pay by 60%.</p>
              <p><strong> But first let he who suggested lower pay be the one to start the ball rolling by accepting low salary.   ------   Lim Swee Suay!</strong></p>

              <p>I agree 1000% with Mr Lim.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the government should illustrate the concept by leading as example.</p>
              <p>Cheaper - Cut all minister's pay by 70%. We should be cheaper than President Obama. The pay should be earmarked with the lowest pay.</p>
              <p>Better - One minster should head three ministries. This is the best way of showing the world that we have truly capable elite scholar running the red dot. Excess mentor, perm secretary, MP, senior ministers should not be in place as we are truly world class and not mentoring is needed.</p>
              <p>Faster - Cut the three working day response from all government agencies to one day. If we are employing truly elite as civil servant, three days to response is not acceptable.</p>
              <p>As for the world class transport system, cheaper, better and faster rule also MUST apply.</p>
              <p>If the above conditions cannot be comply, then the CBF concept is not applicable.</p>

              <p><br>You are right, and neither has any Government of countries that are bigger then Singapore has there been so many Ministers-WITHOUT-Portfolio, two DPMs, two SMs, and one MM - and all being in the PM's Office.</p>
              <p>Obviously, LHL's cancer remission still remains a threat, and he cannot be exposed to any form of stress for fear the cancer recurring; and LHL needs as much time as he can to practise his Yoga plus his other excerises to keep cancer away.</p>
              <p>About the other Ministry having more then a Second Minister in the same portfolio, and also assisted by Ministers-of-State (with or without the prefix "Senior" attached) - the excuse given was to have Ministers being familiar with the works of a second Ministry other then their own.</p>
              <p>Ministers given more then one ministry are seen to be groomed for higher office, and in the workings of LKY's mind as he had once stated that the best in an individual can be seen when they are put under situation of stress - a case similar to the training at NASA, where astronauts are put through an intensive environment to weed out the less capable.</p>
              <p>One can only wonder how did LHL slip through such high stress environment to become the PM of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Counting the cost of having so many Ministers to be in the PM's Office is enough to confirm that this PM is too costly to be productive, let alone to be effective in any way.</p>

                                They have lost their moral authority long long time ago, thus
                                causing many of us lost respect for them.   This leads to
                                rising resentment from the people towards the ruling party.</p>
                                <p>I am still wondering what is their rationale of exercising
                                oppression in allowing Singaporeans to draw reasonable salaries, I
                                am not talking about world class salary like they are paying
                                themselves here.  Besides, these days we are seeing more and
                                more contract jobs from the civil service.   That
                                attitude of "you die your business" is disturbing and affecting
                                locals.</p>
                                <p>It is unfortunate we in Singapore have a government who
                                think for themselves only, seems they are interested in self
                                serving more than anything.  </p>

              That's strong words coming from Singaporean. Are you in any chance presently not on the island? I don't know whether I can be that tough if I were living on the island. You got my respect anyway bro! It seems we share more than one passions too lol.
              <br><br>
              Anyway your government is run by a certain motto that is Be happy or we kill you!lol
              I must admit that nowadays the dogs haven't been that active on the internet calm before the storm? lol.
