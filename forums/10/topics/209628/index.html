            <div class='col-md body'><br>We all know our gov is all out to impress the delegates of IMF. But looks to me, they only know how to take care of things for their own needs but overlooks or thought nothing of retailers within Suntec City.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>=======================================================<br>Wondering how a big international event affects your life? Well, read on.<br>BIG SALE IN SUNTEC CITY<br>Thanks to the World Bank and IMF meetings, Singapore gets...<br>By Tan Mae Lynn<br><br>September 11, 2006<br><br>ALL it The Great Suntec City Sale.<br>The tight security around the Suntec area for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings might deter local shoppers.<br><br>But retailers at Suntec City Mall are banding together to entice them with discounts, freebies and lucky draw prizes that include Singapore Airline tickets to places like Tokyo and Paris.<br><br>The retailers' message: If you're willing to brave the expected traffic snarls and blockages, we will make it worth your while.<br><br>If the thought of air travel doesn't appeal to you because you are more of a homebody, Carrefour is giving away free gifts such as a DVD player, an LCD TV and even a home theatre system, depending on how much you spend.<br><br>--Jonathan Choo<br>Need snacks for TV-watching? Rack up $60 at the supermarket and you can get a porcelain enamel iron wok at $10 to toss up a quick meal of fried rice, or a four-tier cabinet (also $10) to store your crisps and cookies.<br><br>Looking for a laptop?<br><br>Courts at Suntec will also be offering discounts of up to 10 per cent on selected electronics and accessories.<br><br>Mr Patrick Lum, chief executive officer of Suntec City Development, said: 'The mall continues to operate at normal hours and is working closely with its retailers to plan a 10-day shopping extravaganza with a host of special promotions that will attract both delegates and local visitors during this period.'<br><br>To further sweeten the deal for shoppers, the mall management will also have daily lucky draws and a 'Sure Win Lucky Dip' for shoppers, offering prizes such as air tickets - taxes fully paid - on Singapore Airlines to destinations like Tokyo, Paris, Sydney and San Francisco, as well as Suntec City shopping vouchers.<br><br>SLUMP EXPECTED<br><br>Judging by the reaction of shoppers, retailers are understandably worried that they will face a dip in business over the next 10 days.<br><br>Their concern is not out of place.<br><br>Of 100 shoppers we interviewed at the Suntec City area, only nine said they would want to be around the area during this period.<br><br>Even some regular shoppers are put off by the road restrictions.<br><br>Madam Rita M, 65, said: 'It's very inconvenient. If I have to take my grandchildren with me, I'd have to go in a cab. But with the road blocks, I would have to drop off somewhere and walk.'<br><br>Talk like this makes retailers glum.<br><br>Store supervisor Catherine Lim is anticipating up to a 40 per cent drop in business at her women's wear boutique in the coming week.<br><br>The big retailers - Carrefour, Courts and brand-name outlets like Warehouse and Topshop - don't expect to be spared from a potential dip in business either.<br><br>But a spokesman for Carrefour said: 'With the free shuttle bus services picking shoppers up at City Hall MRT station and dropping them off right in front of our store, this will greatly reduce the inconvenience.'<br><br>Furthermore, all carparks except the blue zone directly below the convention centre remain open.<br><br>Managing director of Courts Singapore, Mr Terry O'Connor, said: 'We do expect a dip in our sales of around 20 per cent for the Suntec City outlet during the IMF/World Bank meetings.<br><br>'(But) we are working closely with the Suntec City management team to minimise the impact.<br><br>'We have put together special promotional prices for delegates as well as Singapore customers (during this period) at Courts Suntec City.'<br><br>Wing Tai Retail's spokesman said: 'We will be working with American Express Credit Cards (and will have) special promotions to attract shoppers to Suntec City and Marina Square, as well as with the Singapore Tourism Board to offer special shopping privileges for visiting delegates and their accompanying spouses/partners during this period.'<br><br>Wing Tai Retail has 15 clothing outlets in Suntec City and Marina Square, including stores like Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and G2000.<br><br>Other retailers are more optimistic.<br><br>Ms Helen Goh, partner of Habanos, a shop selling cigars and tobacco products, said that while she expects a dip in business, she hopes that the large number of visiting delegates in the area would make up for the loss in business from her regular customers.<br><br>DIFFERENT THIS TIME<br><br>She said that during the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meet in July last year, business slowed due to tight security measures.<br><br>'But the profile of visiting delegates at this meet will be different from the IOC visitors, which comprised lobbyists and many sportsmen.<br><br>'This time round, there'll be senior officials and bankers.'<br><br>They, she hopes, will be more willing to shop and spend.<br><br>Restaurants in the area are also waiting eagerly for the event to start as they believe it will ring in more business.<br><br>Some shoppers were pleased to hear about the bargains.<br><br>NSman Michael Tan, 19, said: 'It's an added perk that shops are offering discounts on their products.<br><br>'It's an exciting time to be in Singapore anyway, and who knows what sort of activities will be going on around the area.'<br>- Additional reporting by<br>Belle Charlene Kwan and<br>Dominique Mosbergen<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Bars, restaurants more hopeful<br><br>WHILE some shops are worried about a potential dip in business, restaurants and bars at the Suntec City and Marina bay area are expecting to benefit from the influx of 16,000 delegates for the IMF-World Bank meeting.<br><br>At least one bar has made special preparations to meet the expected increase in demand.<br><br>Mr Michael Lu of Suba bar at Millenia Walk said: 'We're very excited about it... We have beefed up our manpower strength and increased our order of supplies.<br><br>'We have been actively engaging all the concierges of the hotels where the delegates will be and working with the tourism board to cater to the delegates and media who will be here.'<br><br>He said that most of his customers work in the area.<br><br>'We do expect to enjoy an increase of business. It's hard to tell at this stage how much of an increase we will enjoy, but I think a 50 per cent increase would not be a stretch.<br><br>'There are a lot of people coming to town. With the road closures, it also means people are 'stuck' in the area as well,' he said.<br><br>Among its promotions next week, Suba will be offering delegates a first drink on the house when they show their passes. Everyone else will also get to enjoy one-for-one beer (some brands only) for the whole month.<br><br>Similarly, Paulaner Brauhaus' general manager, Mr Henry Quah, said that with the restaurant-bar's location opposite the Suntec City Convention Centre, he is looking forward to spin-off benefits that come with the visiting delegates.<br><br>16,000 POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS<br><br>Mr Quah said: 'While our regular customers may stay away, 16,000 delegates will be here to cushion the loss, so we're not worried about a loss in business. Besides, we are (favourably) located between the event location and hotels housing delegates.'<br><br>He said that although the restaurant is not fully booked ahead of the event, he expects last-minute bookings for the visitors.<br><br>The restaurant will offer a 15 per cent discount to delegates who show their passes at lunch.<br><br>Over at Balaclava bar, the sentiment is less optimistic because it is at the convention centre, which means access to the area is restricted.<br><br>The bar's main entrance is along an area blocked off from public access, so customers can only get to the bar using via a side door inside the mall.<br><br>Balaclava's marketing manager, Ms Carol Anne Wah, said: 'We have many regular customers and they are not just those who work in the area. It will be difficult to get to us (next week), so business will be affected.'<br><br>Ms Wah said the bar's capacity will also be reduced during the event because they had to shut the seating area outside its main entrance for security reasons.<br><br>'I'm not too sure (the event) will have a 100 per cent positive impact on our business, but I don't think there'll be a significant dip either because the delegates will at least make up for some of the loss from our regulars.'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no way i will go Suntec area to shop and I pity the shop owners during this period of time.<br><br>Ppl will be put off by the security checks, the road blocks &amp; security clearance...hello, i am going shopping not the airport, why, police scared I take knife go stab ppl ? imagine the hassle that i have to go through to scan my bag, pass thru metal detector and triggering it becos i am wearing a belt, and i have to take off belt, take off shoe, wah se...no thank you.<br><br>The roads will be blocked, parking is going to be a problem.  Although I don't drive, i will have to walk to Suntec becos I dunno whether the shuttle service still plying ?  Maybe not.<br><br>As for shopowners, they still face the same rent but less crowd, hmm, i say the developer shld waive / offer rental discount for this period.  And do you think seriously the delegates will splurge at the shops ?  Well, maybe those high class / branded clothing stores, those lower end stores - maybe not.<br><br>And putting myself as one of the delegates, after a long day of meeting, u think i still want to shop at Suntec ?  No way, since I have a BMW 7 at my disposal, i will hop on and go Orchard / Geylang to shop and be happy..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

When they increased prices for anything could anyone do or say anything to change it?? They say we may express ourselves but what happens when we do?<br><br>Utter TKSS!!<br><br>Whatever they do, they only look after their interests and convenience while we are EXPECTED to in so many of their terms "move forward", "tighten our belts", "upgrade ourselves", "bear with it", and all that crap!<br><br>When the hell are they going to "IMPROVE" on their policies and their top-down governence of Singapore?<br><br>By right, they should have the cow-sense to announce a discount in rentrals of all those retail and office tenants at Suntec City!<br><br>Imagine, if this IMF meeting is going to be an annual affair, and my business is there, I will definitely move out of Suntec City! Pretty sure every tenant will consider moving out of Suntec City if every year they have to suffer losses in sales because of it.<br><br></div>
