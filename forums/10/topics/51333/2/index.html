            <div class='col-md body'>im not sure about u people, but when i went to Europe, porn ads, mags were everywhere , even their local TV like our CHannel 5 show porn shows very late at night...like around 10pm which is very late for them. In Germany, they even have a 1 hour documentry on how a pussy is like and instructions on how to have sex and after that and 1 hour of porn videos... now back to Singapore. I believe the issue here is not why the govt dun allow porn mags, its a matter of how much they are willing to go. Example: if u see porn mags, pple will say why not have porn tv? since we have porn mags already,next pple will demand strip clubs and so on and so on...so its a matter how far u are willing to go... n u have to see society's mindset... there is still the older generation who are still conservative...to them this is totally unacceptable.<br><br>ps: Dosent mean u watch porn makes you a rapist n pervert or what,but it does encourage pervtism leading to sexual crimes</div>

Yes on the surface it would easily pass as a correct statement but the mind works in a more complex way than as in like ...er... see the boobs so nice and woww  then you close the cover .. thats that and carry on with your original assignments(if it were only to be so simple )<br>NO is it not. When you see some new equipment some electronic device even if it is just an advertisment surely it lingers on your mind  doesnt it? wow-ing at the amazing features of the device and for perhaps the females would seem to  be awed by the new youth -retaining product ....<br><br>---these examples are to be used as examples to the general likes of both sexes  please do not get offended<br>Ulitmately you would wan tit ...right ?time is of the limiting factor i have to stop  here pls post your comments<br><br>PS my english is not as powerful or perhaps used as elegantly as the others  so thank you for bearing with me</div>

The argument Allan Issacman (Flynt's lawyer) used in their defense was that, yes pornography may be objectionable to some people, but nobody is putting a gun to their head to read that magazine or watch that video just like every other item in the mall.
