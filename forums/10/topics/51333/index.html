            <div class='col-md body'>Gee.... Now this is a really gray of discussion, considering the fact that there can be neither absolute rights or wrongs on this one.<br><br>Nevertheless, I just strongly feel that porn should not be legalized.<br><br>Not in Singapore.<br><br>Not now.<br><br>Not ever.<br><br>If we are talking about artistic pieces of work such as still life photographs or exhibits, that is still ok.<br><br>But to allow moving images that convey a primary intention to sexually stimulate, that in my personal opinion, is not healthy.<br><br>Suppose that the viewer is of a mature age and mentality to view and interpret such contents, then in the least, we can be at least assured of the fact that there would no or little risk of potentially motivated crimes as such primary instincts are in large, better well controlled in adults.<br><br>In the case of juveniles however, this would be an age group where the risk is significantly higher, since at the adolesence age, certain issues such as family planning are really never seriously thought about.<br><br>If there are really tonnes of money which would be lost to the closing of the porn industry in Singapore, so be it.<br><br>SG has so many talents in here with diversified focus and depth. Dun tell me that the whole of SG will really starve to death if we were to remain close to one such social ill industry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore remains a largely conservative society, bound by its fundamental Asian concepts of morality.  The large majority of the population would not want porn to be legalised, even if u can throw up real practicial reasons to do so.<br><br>Secondly, porn, while not legal, continues to be popular among people, albeit privately.  Isn't that allowing people choice as well?  Like someone else mentioned, the police don't come storming into ur house and arrest u for possession of porn. (unless u sell it)<br><br>The selling of pornographic material openly on the streets would also attract school going kids, and expose them to such objectionable material earlier and from even more sources.<br><br>Currently, I doubt people are making porn in Singapore for commercial sells.  With the legalisation of porn, some producers are going to start making their own as well, after all, its cheap to produce and the profit margin is high.  Somehow I'm not agreeable to the idea of Singapore being a porn-manufacturer as well. . .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>I think this only goes to show that the human race society is degrading morally. Women are no longer treated with respect and instead they are being treated like a plaything. Legalisation means that the government thinks this way too. THank God they did not.<br><br></blockquote>Judging from your name and the way you speak i'm guessing you spent your time reading a holy book(Most likely christian, but i could be wrong)<br><br>What the heck do you mean when you say we're degrading? Women are gaining more respect and already in some ways i feel is unfair. Kindly read more and get into the sun before judging the human race. Or do you only read about the women in the Middle East?<br><br>I believe the restriction on nudity should be relaxed a little but porn ? No way.<br><br>Haven't they legalized porn in some ways already though? i seemed to see a few of those kinky shops in orchard road area selling sex related magaziness and items.</div>
