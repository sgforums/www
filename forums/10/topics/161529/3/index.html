Don't think it'll be easy. u can't change a mindset that has been in place for the past 40years overnight.<br><br>and from another perspective. the citizens have a right to complain. they voted the government in to represent their interest.. so if they can't find jobs the government should be accountable. i'm not advocating a welfare system (the day s'pore adopts this... is the day our competitiveness ends - adverse selection.. enough said) but i do hope to see the government setting in place social safety nets.<br><br>What abt overseas job placement? it's just a thought.. although i dun think its feasible.<br><br>this is indeed a problematic issue.<br><br>o and 1 thing that i am pissed abt.. is the government adopting contract employment. i am really dissapointed with that.</div>
