"</strong><br><br>So by micro manage you mean "who qualified enough". By your definition, all govt do micro manage to variable degrees based who qualified enough. What so nonsensical about my statement?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>What are you talking about?<br>Govt already have quotas and levees.<br>What guys like Robert Teh wants is true what I call micro manage based on who is qualified enough etc. Not only is this impossible, this will really make the govt look very silly. </strong></blockquote>I quote what you wrote <strong>"I say let the companies decide whom they want to hire. There are already quotas, levees and restrictions on the hiring of foreigners." </strong><br><br>If your meaning is to let firms have total free access to labour given the restrictions in placed. You missed the whole argument altogether.<br><br>In Singapore context, restrictions of labour are for semi-skilled or non skilled labour. These restriction were in placed to protect the lower income group only.<br><br>But if your are talking about the professional (by this, I mean graduate entry level), generally (I use the term "generally" because professions like medicine, law are still protected industries) there is no restricton or whatsoever.<br><br>I think one of Robert's points is "selective professional labour restriction based on supplementary needs rather than based on mere paper qualification so that we can grow our professional industries as well as our economy.<br><br>Mere entry based paper qualification may not necessarily add up to a quantum increase in performance, output or productivity. And I think he has a good point here.  But the think we all looking at the migration issue from the wrong tree.<br><br>From media articles, the govt's strategy is to grow our population size so that we can be a well populated vibrant city state.  It wishes to grow our population to 5 million (quickly, if not by x year).<br><br>One reason is to have a sizeable population of domestic consumers to conter the vagaries of international trade.  Another is that with this sizeable population, it would be easier for us the project and grow our soft industries like the arts,  movies, know-how export etc.<br><br>But it remains to be seen if these new migrants from India and China are here for the long haul or mere fair weather people on transit.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I quote what you wrote "I say let the companies decide whom they want to hire. There are already quotas, levees and restrictions on the hiring of foreigners."<br><br>If your meaning is to let firms have total free access to labour given the restrictions in placed. You missed the whole argument altogether.</blockquote>Thats exactly what shld be done. You want the govt to control the economy more? It will cause many companies to collapse.<br><br><blockquote><br>In Singapore context, restrictions of labour are for semi-skilled or non skilled labour. These restriction were in placed to protect the lower income group.<br><br>But if your are talking about the professional (by this, I mean graduate entry level), generally (I use the term generally because professions like medicine, law are still protected industries) there is no restricton or whatsoever.<br><br></blockquote>Not true, there are quotas in place. You are not aware of it because you don't run a company.<br>A lot of start ups simply cannot take place w/o Indian professionals. Same for MNCs. They would have left if they were not allowed to hire these educated foreigners cos locals don't want such jobs. The result would be, locals will not have any jobs at all if the MNCs pull out.<br><br></div>
