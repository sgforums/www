            <div class='col-md body'>The government can make the whole economy vibrant and then will be more jobs by doing the following:-<br><br>(1) Stop GLCs from competing against domestic businesses.<br><br>(2) Do not tax and recover all costs and do not double charge on land for essential government services so that there will be liquidity to create economic activities and vibrancy. Then the private sector will grow and create more jobs with more businesses, contracts. Since the 1980s when government went into business to compete against the people for business, the domestic sector has been languishing but there is no admission of this fact.<br><br>(3) Use more of surpluses to stimulate growth by investing such monies in growths and technology start-ups.<br><br>Once the government takes care not to hurt the economy then everything will be vibrant again. Then there is no need to give excuses or talk about more foreigners leaving and property becoming vacant. When domestic businesses are good there will be no such problems.</div>

However, since then no matter how many economic restructuring or reviews we have not yet upgraded the economy to value-adding or technologically advanced economy as was being built by other Asian tigers. Clinging on to the past success forgetting that we have lost ground in important key areas is no solution. The comparison made on GDP without looking closely at our own people's sector of the economy will not answer this issue honestly and objectively. The fact that we have surpluses in the government does not mean that people are successful.<br><br></div>

Please advice.<br><br><blockquote><br>What did our ministers and scholars in public service do during the last two recessions. More significantly what did they propose to do to get out of the last two recessions.<br><br>All I could remember is that all the ministers only gave excuses that Singapore was too vulnerable to external economic downturn and that there is nothing that can be done to save jobs due the phenomenon called structural unemployments. They conveniently forgot that some of the tiger economies were turning around faster than Singapore because they were more resilent owing to their less reliance on foreign investments and more nurturing of their own local companies and falents.</blockquote>I think they did a great job. In fact, they averted a recession in 98 even when much of Asia went into deep recession.<br><br><blockquote><br>Yes up to the 1970s, we do have growths. However, since then no matter how many economic restructuring or reviews we have not yet upgraded the economy to value-adding or technologically advanced economy as was being built by other Asian tigers. Clinging on to the past success forgetting that we have lost ground in important key areas is no solution. The comparison made on GDP without looking closely at our own people's sector of the economy will not answer this issue honestly and objectively. The fact that we have surpluses in the government does not mean that people are successful.<br></blockquote>Growth not only in 70s but 80s, 90s and today too.<br>The greatest growth occured in the 90s. Looks like you do not know the Singapore economy very well.<br>Can I suggest you do more research before your next post?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You want fact so here are some facts to tell us how well Singapore has performed.<br><br>Read the latest rate of migration of Singaporeans (indicating brain drain and explaining the dropping economic competitiveness from the 1970s) by comparison with other higher migrating countries:-<br><br>1. Singapore 26.45 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>2. Qatar 20.12 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>3. Anguilla 17.23 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>4. Kuwait 14.31 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>5. Croatia 13.37 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>6. Cayman Islands 12.58 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>7. San Marino 11.45 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>8. British Virgin Islands 11.39 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>9. Afghanistan 11.11 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>10. Sierra Leone 10.23 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>11. French Guiana 10.14 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>12. Luxembourg 9.26 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>13. Macau 9.25 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>14. Bosnia and Herzegovina 8.91 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>15. Eritrea 7.91 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>16. Hong Kong 7.90 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>17. Monaco 7.85 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>18. Jordan 7.18 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>19. Andorra 6.82 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>20. Canada 6.13 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>21. Somalia 5.96 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>22. Liechtenstein 4.98 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>23. New Zealand 4.71 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>24. Ireland 4.69 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>25. Palau 4.45 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br>26. Australia 4.19 migrant(s)/1,000 population<br><br>So Singapore leaders have done such a great job that many people decide to part for greener pasture again and again? May be they should replace all the citizens and start all over again from a clean slate since the citizens are not worth of the government.<br></div>
