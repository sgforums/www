            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by robertteh:</div><div class="quote_body">However the fact is Singaporeans now cannot do any smaller or start any new business because of all the high costs due to pushing up of salarlies of government, high transportation costs. high HDB flat prices (due to double charged on lands) to all unwarranted bus fare increases, and triple taxes on vehicles.[quote]<br><br>Agreed.  We need a solution for the land cost... this may not happened overnight as too much is at stake for the citizens.<br><br>For vehicles, it is not really a BIG impact as SGP is small.  Weighing the pros and the cons, I would agreed on the high tax for the vehicles... it goes also that we should be looking at lowering of the tax for business used vehicle.<br><br>We should contain the cost increase for basic necessity. Bus fare I agreed is one of them.  I am also against the privatization of essential services (transport, utilities, telecommuncation) as there is a conflict of interest.  Especially when competition is not allowed in this area (transport).<br><br>[quote]<br>Let us face the fact: how many people can start a business with such high costs being created by the government under Goh Keng Swee doctrine.<br><br>The only businesses that can still survive now are the GLCs, NTUC, MNCs, and bigger long-established companies because they can unilaterally like SBS or SPH increase the prices they like.<br><br>How can the citizens be expected to keep quiet and not whine or complain when the whole business environment is so anti-businesss and anti-job creation.<br><br>The worse is to pretend that such problems do not exist thereby postponing solutions of problems. By all means, citizens should be self-reliant but can there be self-reliant when the system is so against them.<br><br>We must ask all the ministers to come down from the high horse and all the talking down on people and set themselves as examples to walk the talk.<br><br>It is the system which is mostly at fault and this fact has to be changed to undo all the past policies that cause this from valuations of HDB flats to medical and utility to see that there is no more hidden charges like land costs and double taxing.<br><br>If forumers still don't believe go to the neighbourhood shops and see for yourself how empty are the shops. Only fools can pretend such problems do not exist in today's Singapore and still pretend that we are doing well.<br><br>Let people have better opportunity to start their own business in Singapore by changing some of the past charging system to reduce the high costs due to all the corporatized high charges, double taxes and triple taxes on vehicles.</div></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;"><br><br>High salary is ok with me as long as the place is well run and maintain.  I got nothing against it.  However, one should not use their own earning capacity as a measurement of wat is effortable (600k peanuts scenerio).<br><br>I would say that in term of corruption, infrastructure, ease of doing business, SGP is up there... however due to the size of the local market, it is not practical to set up shop here.  I would also agreed that there are more to be done in reducing the red tapes and increasing the flexibility in which the citizens can do business... even if it is small time.  For example, why not a car repair shop be converted to a resturant at night if all the hygiene requirements are met?  CBD area is dead at night.  Why not convert it to a permanent night market? Like Women Street in Hong Kong, Shi Lin in Taipei?<br><br></span></div>

Not practical lah fren.<br>If you regard such a thing as inflexibility on the part of the govt, I have nothing to say.
