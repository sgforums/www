            <div class='col-md body'>is it the first time we know the real reasons of sand ban<br>and cancellation of military training in Indonesia?<br><br><strong><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/202558.asp" rel="nofollow">Friday, July 27, 2007<br>This 'punching bag' will bounce back, says MM</a></strong><br><blockquote>This 'punching bag' will bounce back, says MM<br>SINGAPORE is a convenient punching bag for Indonesian law-makers Â— that is why they have been making loud protests over the defence treaty signed between the two countries recently.<br>.<br>That was the view of Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew when asked to comment on the ongoing spat over the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) and the Extradition Treaty.<br>.<br>At the people-to-people level, the Indonesian public knows that Singapore meant no harm to Indonesia, said Mr Lee at a forum in Jakarta on Indonesia's Vision for Year 2030.<br>.<br>"But at the rhetoric level Â— for the media Â— it is convenient to have me as a punching bag. I'm accustomed to being a punching bag. I'll bounce back," Mr Lee said, referring to the law-makers' rejection of the DCA.<br>.<br>The Minister Mentor brushed aside allegations that the DCA would allow Singapore to infringe on Indonesia's sovereignty. He pointed out that Singapore's armed forces have conducted training in Indonesia's territories for more than 20 years.<br>.<br>"At the end of the day, you're a big country, we're a little red dot. But please give this little red dot a certain breathing space. We need to have our obligations homoured."<br>.<br>Mr Lee stressed that the DCA must be honoured. "Otherwise, every time you want to get something from us you would say Â— if you don't do this, I'll do that."<br>.<br><strong>Mr Lee also explained that the Indonesian government had cancelled Singapore's military training arrangements in Indonesia. Jakarta also stopped exporting sand to get the Extradition Treaty with Singapore backdated by 15 years.</strong><br>.<br>On the Extradition Treaty, the Minster Mentor said that Singapore's fund industry would not go into a steep decline if Indonesia were to pull out the money allegedly being hidden in Singapore.<br>.<br>He clarified that only about 3 per cent, or US$30 billion ($45 billion), of the US$890-billion foreign fund managed in Singapore, is from Indonesia.<br>.<br>Apart from his appearance at the forum, Mr Lee, accompanied by Mrs Lee on a six-day trip to Jakarta, also took time out to see two former Indonesian heads of state yesterday.<br>.<br>The first stop was a private visit to Mr Su-harto's house in Jakarta. The former President, who stepped down in 1998, appeared to be in good health, spending half an hour with the Lees before sending them off.<br>.<br>The two men last met during Mr Lee's visit to Indonesia last year.<br>.<br>The Minister Mentor also met another former President, Ms Megawati Sukarnoputri, at her residence.<br>.<br>According to Ms Megawati, who is expected to run again in the next presidential election, Indonesia's political situation was among the topics discussed during their 30-minute meeting.

            <div class='col-md body'>Lee very late in understanding changes in RI : legislator<br><br>Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Senior Singaporean politician Lee Kuan Yew is very late in understanding the political changes that have happened in Indonesia, a legislator said.<br><br>"Lee`s statement that the Singapore government can conclude bilateral cooperation agreements, including the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA), only with the Indonesian government shows he is beginning to become senile," Andreas Pareira, a member of the House of Representatives (DPR)`s Commission I representing the Indonesian Democratic Party- Struggle (PDI-P), told ANTARA News here on Wednesday.<br><br>He said Lee Kuan Yew still regarded present-day Indonesia as being the Indonesia during the era of former president Soeharto who was his close friend.<br><br>"Wake up, Mr Lee. Present-day Indonesia is much more democratic and open than during the era when the two of you (Lee and Soeharto) could make bilateral agreements on your own on behalf of the two countries," Andreas said vehemently.<br><br>Hence, the young PDI-P politician said he would like to give Lee a political lesson on the new democratic era to Indonesia.<br><br>"The senior Singapore politician should know that in Indonesia now strategic decisions relating to the interest of many people can be made only with the approval of the House of Representatives which consists of political party members elected through elections that are possibly among the most democratic in the world," he said.<br><br>As to political democracy, according to Pareira, Singapore still needed to learn much, including from Indonesia.(*)<br><br>Antara News.</div>
