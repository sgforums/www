              <p>The problem with the traffic situation on Singapore roads is that there is no single authority that ensures the plans is finally executed according to the original intention.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Transport will work with LTA and the Traffic Police to make some ambitious master plan, with the LTA seeing to its construction, while leaving the Traffic Police to best manage the roads according to their assigned responsbilities.</p>
              <p>Is the Traffic Police assigned responsibilities - in ensuring road safety - in tune with the Traffic Mangement Master Plan  ?</p>
              <p>Ironically, the Ministry will only look at the macro view of Traffic Management,  and do not seem to make any follow-up review if the Traffic Police are managing the roads according to the Master Plans.</p>
              <p>With roads that are constructed for travel speeds of up to 120 kmh, the Traffic Police will insist on a travel speed of only 90 kmh along expressways, 70 kmh along most arterial roads throughout the island, with occassional alternative speeds of 50 kmh and 80 kmh appearing as rare sights.</p>
              <p>The Ministry and LTA will utilise the ERP Gantry to manage traffic to ensure smoother flows and hope to allow for a higher volume of traffic to be accomodated on the roadways.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the efforts - from the Ministry and LTA - are sabotaged by the Traffic Police conservative mentality in restricting travel speeds to 25 percent below the road design speed.</p>
              <p>With the speed limits that are set  below that of the designed road speed, are the roads used at an optimum efficiency level, or are the conservative speed limits causing unnecessary higher traffic volume on the roads, as no one is allowed to get home faster than what is allowed ?</p>
              <p>In any eventuality, no driver can get any faster than the traffic condition that block his path, or slow him down. Can the driver simply fly over the traffic in front ?</p>
              <p>The Traffic Police should trust Singaporeans more by allowing for higher speed limits along our roadways, and leaving the drivers with the discretion of travelling at higher speeds according to traffic condtitions at different times of any given 24 hour day.</p>
              <p>It is ridculous to restrict a vehicle from travelling any faster during off-peak hours - especially at 2.00 a.m. in the morning when traffic is nearly non-existent..</p>
              <p>How often have we seen a line of cars suddenly hitting the brakes - when the lead car start the entire chain reaction as he approaches a Traffic Speed Camera - even when the cars are will within the speed limit will slow even farther to be on the safe side ?</p>
              <p>It is time for the Minister to take charge of the entire Traffic Management Master Plan, and come up with clear guidlines to ensure that all the government agencies that are  involved with traffic management should be guided by a single master plan.</p>
              <p>During Peak Hours, road speeds should be correctly managed according to road conditions. The Traffic Police should get vehicles to observe designated speed lanes, as well as for vehicles to move at higher speeds that road conditions allow..</p>
              <p>Perhaps the PM should also get into the act, as the Traffic Police is with the Home Ministry even as it work closefly with the Transport Ministry.</p>
              <p>Is punitive financial methods the only ways to manage our traffic situation ?</p>
              <p>The answer is obviously negative, as the current frequencies of ERP price increases have still not improved the traffic situation, and neither will more ERP gantries help solve the situation.</p>
              <p>The answer to it all is in the acronym - KISS.</p>

If he is unable to do so, he will have to let someone do it. Perhaps, let a FT take over his job. Why not? What is so sensitive about the traffic portfolio?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>From
              time to time, we have heard that the government's original policy
              intention was to ease traffic congestion in imposing punitive vehicle
              excise duty, COE, car park fees and ERP. It is a shame that one by one
              all these measures have failed to achieve the original intention as
              announced. Have they?</p>
              <p>So if some analysts were to now
              explain the road congestion problems as attributable to some other
              factors like speeds or traffic police's coordination problem or some
              problems with other agencies, all these might well be only second
              guesses.</p>
              <p>The key issue is Minister's accountability. When
              minister Mah introduced the COE with the solemn intention or objective
              as being to replace the excise duty as the more effective means to
              solve traffic congestion problem he has to be honest and have the
              integrity to follow-up with abolishing the excise duty after COE or ERP
              were introduced. Has he?</p>
              <p>MM Lee condemns oppositions as
              liars. What we have seen here are ministers making serious and solemn
              promises about replacing excise duty but failing to keep to their
              promises. So who are telling lies? Are ministers for telling lies or is
              failing to keep promises not a lie?</p>
              <p>So honestly although
              many professionals have different views of traffic problems and may
              have other perceived solutions or alternatives with extensive
              researches and good analytical datas and statistics the real problem is
              only one - accountability of the ministers.</p>
              <p>I should like
              to think that if Ministers are honest, and do seriously keep to
              promises made in parliament why should the oppositions like CSJ be
              challenging government for not telling the truths or telling lies. Who
              started telling lies anyway?</p>
              <p>Trouble is for too long now
              ministers are not being made to be accountable to the people or willing
              to keep to solemn promises made.</p>
              <p>That is perhaps the reason
              for our defamation suits to shut off problems. The root cause has to be
              established. But two wrongs do not make one right.</p>

              <p>... here's an observation of mine;</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... I noticed that for commercial vehicles, there are various Speed Limits they are allowed to travel at:</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; 40Kmh</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; 60Kmh</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; 70kmh</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... now, because of this, I see vans with the 70Kmh label speeding up and overtaking other vehicles with either the 40Kmh or 60Kmh limitations. This often leads to vehicles in the center lane, having to slow down to give way to these commercial vehicles that is intent on 'keeping' to their ENTITLED SPEED of 70Kmh. Clearly, this is one Traffic/Road Rule that keeps our roads or expressways congested - even during off-peak periods, with or without ERP Gantries...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... one fine example is to drive along AYE towards Keppel on any given working day... you will notice many vans, lorries, pickups with both 60kmh and 70Kmh labels occupying the center lane because they are trying to overtake slower moving 40Kmh and 50Kmh (in the case of Army trucks) &amp; 60Kmh vehicles... they end up driving in the center lane longer than necessary at sub 80Kmh because they couldn'y cut back into the slow lane because of a long line of trailers which are limited to 40Kmh, and some who either doesn't know thay cannot remain in the center lane or, think it's their God Given Right to remain in the center lane because the left most lane is occupied by super slow moving trailers and Army trucks...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>... I say this variable Speed Limitations for Commercial Vehicles, is half cooked, and LTA will do well to relook or RETHINK this one...</p>

              <p>1.maybe LTA should consider banning trucks, vans, pick up from using the expressway during the peak hours. more than often, they are the ones that causes the massive jam when one truck was trying to overtake another thus causing the spill over the center and overtaking lane.</p>
              <p>i cannot understand the logic why we need to pay ERP charges when we are not sure whether we gona caught in a jam. the LTA is exploiting this blur logic to keep charging singaporeans dispite the current difficult economic environment.</p>

              <p>1) fixed the direct problem - just too many cars on the road !!! Every tom and harry can go show room and drive of with a car.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) change the SBS &amp; SMRT &amp; TIB concept !!! We need more efficient and cheaper services - not fancy things like air-cond bus terminal, and stupid extra - that does little to transport people but cost more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Take a page from Shanghai. They have problem of traffic, and without land to expand on roads. So they go for what they call sky highway system. They just build a road or highway on top of existing road or highway, it may cost more, but fastest and earier way then to dig underground.</p>

              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: The full impact of the extensive ERP changes announced on Tuesday is beginning to sink in for many motorists and businessmen in the Central Business District (CBD).</p>
              <p>Many feel they do not have much option but to prepare to pay more.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Come July 7, many motorists who travel frequently into the CBD will have to pay at least double of what they are paying now in ERP charges — from S$2 a day to an expected S$4 or S$5.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Multiply that by at least 20 days of work and workers are definitely going to feel the pinch.</p>
              <p>Medical Sales Representative Muhammad Shamir said: "If I want to avoid Esplanade Drive, I can head north and use the CTE but if I’m not mistaken, there’s also another gantry there and it might be more expensive. The road to exit the PIE may be more congested, so that’s the difficulty I face."</p>
              <p>Going home is another problem.</p>
              <p>"Maybe I can go home later in the evening (to avoid the ERP), that’s one option because there’s not much that I can do since there’s no other way from my office to Tampines," he said.</p>
              <p>Other motorists have mixed concerns.</p>
              <p>"Every day, I have to travel out to go to Tuas and back to my office, and every time I have to pass through one of the gantries," one said.</p>
              <p>"For those of us who travel, we’ll of course find the shortest way to go. If we go the long way, we will incur more petrol costs. So in the end, drivers are losing out," another added.</p>
              <p>In an email response to Channel NewsAsia, the Automobile Association of Singapore reiterated its view that the introduction of more ERP gantries and increasing ERP charges may not help to alleviate traffic congestion and slow—moving traffic.</p>
              <p>The association maintains that the authorities should allow more time for the proposed changes to the public transport system and the effects of its recent enhancements to kick in and stabilise, before reassessing the whole situation.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers make up a big group of those who will be affected by the new ERP landscape. Some taxi associations have announced different measures to help their drivers, but there is still some concern on the ground.</p>
              <p>One taxi driver said: "The intention is good, but if we are going back into the area and my cab is empty, I’ll have to pay for the charges myself, so that’s quite a burden."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, public transport operators SMRT and Comfort DelGro are doing their bit to make it easier for commuters to get to the city.</p>
              <p>From June 30, SMRT will add two new premium bus services to take passengers from residential areas like Woodlands and Bishan to the city.</p>
              <p>On the same day, SBS Transit will roll out six new premium services. The company will also enhance eight other bus services along the ERP corridor.</p>
