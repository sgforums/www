              <p>Minister Raymond Lim was taken to task at his Meeting with Sin Min residents about one year ago for repeatedly raising ERP charges and increasing ERP gantries without solving the traffic congestion problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have posted alternative solutions to many forums namely :-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(1) Divide all roads into three tiers, (a) Expressway (ERP controlled)</p>
              <p>(b) Major Roads (non-ERP alternative routes to city or CBD or high traffic economic zones like Jurong or Tampines etc (c ) Local Roads (Non-ERP roads where congestions do not affect economic activities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Under such a 3-tier road network, there will be proper justifications and basis for charging ERP such as the following:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(1) ERP Gantries will be set up only in Expressways leading to CBD</p>
              <p>(2) Alternative routes are always available to those to CBD, EZ.</p>
              <p>(3) Citizens will be able to accept rationale for paying ERP for faster travel to CBD and EZ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Home-going journeys should not be ERP-chargeable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being paid millions of salaries, do our PM, MM, SM, Ministers or senior civil servants have good ideas how to justify additional taxes to lessen people's burden and lessen the rising costs of living and economic competitiveness for the economy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just look at what Minister Raymond Lim has done during the past few months after meeting the many angry residents of Sin Min.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead he ignored their complaints and problems and carried on increasing the ERP charges and building more ERP gantries and expect the hard-pressed citizens to continue to bear with such system of authoritarian rule which does not benefit the road congestions nor any citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reform Party chief JBJ should be asked to raise this question in parliament as soon as possible. (WP seems to be switched off just like the PAP MPs because of some praises from the government about CST or LTK)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Leaders must have the convictions and passion to serve the people and not listen to half-baked million-dollar ministers who could hardly justify the ERP based on proper road planning as shown in the lack of systematic speed-congestion planning of roads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sin Min residents were right - by increasing ERP charges there were no improvements in the congestion problem but instead more and more ERP gantries are now set up even at residential areas without a distinction to differentiate need for ERP control for economic or non-economic travel.</p>

              <p>There is no alternative solution to this problem unless you can tell the car owners to dump their car.</p>
              <p>Due to inflation, lots of people are not paying tax and not buying more.</p>
              <p>So, it is the duty of the poodles to formulate ways to ensure that they can get their pay check every month.</p>
              <p>This is how they are graded every year for their performance.</p>
              <p>How much money can they cheat, swindled from the peasants ?</p>
              <p>There is only so much they can do and there is nothing the peasants can do about it.</p>
              <p>Next thing they do is impose road tax for cyclists as the number of foreign talents are increasing in MASS.</p>

              <p>solution, back to BASIC,</p>
              <p>in 1970's, our main road, is till geylang serai, for EAST,</p>
              <p>NORTH is bukit timah main road.</p>
              <p>south is north bridge road, not even marina south.</p>
              <p>west should be till west coast</p>
              <p>since now most ERP grantry is surround near Last time CBD.</p>
              <p>should not allow public buses to travel in side shanton way, orchard road.</p>

              <p>nowadays everything also rise, petrol rise lah, food rise lah, GST rise lah, hospital charges rise, Minister pay also rise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>logical that ERP must rise to keep the trend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>rise more better, the more the merrier, P4P is the best. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>just now on news, somebody was saying that increasing the ERP charges won't solve the traffic congestion. that is so stupid, what makes you think that traffic congestion is their agenda. it's to increase ERP so that they can collect more $$$ and show a good surplus next year.</p>
              <p>after 5 years can show Singaporeans how much reserves we have. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: About half of existing ERP gantries islandwide will see their rates increase from July 7.
              
              </p>
              <p>The electronic road pricing (ERP) rates for 32 of 65 gantries will increase by between 50 cents and S$2.00. The gantries are primarily in the Central Business District (CBD) and Orchard Road.</p>
              <p>Five new ERP gantries along the Singapore River will also be activated on July 7.</p>
              <p>Traffic in the CBD is slowing down, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA). So in January, as part of its Master Plan, the LTA came up with a new way to measure speed.</p>
              <p>It is called the 85th percentile method — this is when motorists experience smooth traffic at least 85 percent of the time on roads that have ERP gantries.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Another new LTA initiative is for bigger ERP rate increases because, LTA said, motorists are less sensitive to the existing rate structure.</span></p>
              <p>In addition, ERP operating hours in the CBD will be extended by one hour on weekdays — from 7pm to 8pm — while gantries in the Orchard Road cordon will start an hour earlier on Saturdays, at 11am.</p>
              <p>To reduce congestion further, LTA is putting in five new gantries along the Singapore River.</p>
              <p>This essentially divides the CBD into two parts — the predominantly shopping—commercial district around the Bugis—Marina area and the office—based areas in Robinson Road.</p>
              <p>LTA hopes that these gantries, which run from Eu Tong Sen Street to Fullerton Road, will cut down on what they call "through traffic".</p>
              <p>LTA’s chief engineer for transportation, Dr Chin Kian Keong, said: "The gantries along the Singapore River will deal with traffic passing through. They (some motorists using the roads) are not destined for that part of the city, but merely passing through to get to other parts of Singapore. If we can discourage some of these trips from city roads, traffic levels on these roads will become better."</p>
              <p>Currently, a third of all traffic in the area is what LTA calls "through traffic" and LTA hopes to cut this by half, with the new ERP gantries.</p>
              <p>Five of these gantries — at Fullerton Road, Eu Tong Sen Street, New Bridge Road and South Bridge Road — will operate on weekdays from 6pm to 8pm daily. Motorists will pay S$2.00 from 6pm to 7.30pm and S$1.00 from 7.30pm to 8pm.</p>
              <p>Two of the gantries — at Fullerton Road and Eu Tong Sen Street — will also operate on Saturdays from 12.30pm to 8pm, and motorists will have to pay S$2.00.</p>
              <p>More changes may be coming up. In November, LTA will again use its new criteria to review gantry rates within and up to the outer cordon. And in February next year, LTA will look at all other gantries islandwide.</p>
              <p>The question many motorists may have is "why is the government increasing the ERP rates now?", considering that there is a freeze on all government fees till the end of the year.</p>
              <p>The Transport Ministry said things like the ERP rates are excluded from the freeze and that traffic congestion, left unchecked, will have a negative effect on the economy. — CNA/ir</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>quite obvious, in no time, private transportation will only be exclusive to the rich ones.</p>

              <p>I cannot find that word too except to agree with what Li Ao said: Singaporeans are easy meat. However they fight among themselves over very small things like a hello kitty or a free textbook. They also like face and do not want to lose an argument.</p>
