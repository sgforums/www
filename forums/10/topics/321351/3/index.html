              <p>this is like the mao's time in china when all commoners need to contribute grain as a form of tax to the central government. because of the need to show higher productivity and also corruptions that exists then where grains are siphoned along the way, the common people, who is at the end of the food chain; needed to contribute more than their fair share and were reduced to nothing to eat. some of them had resorted to eating tree bark and soil. meanwhile, the guys at the top are boasting how successful the system is, as there is now record yield of grains from the farm plots. these stockpile of grains are then kept in huge quantities in godowns centrally, some rotting because of the excess collected. they could have been used to feed the hungry. unfortunately, the all the info the  state controlled media report were the success of the system of governance; improved yield, farmers prospering because of higher productivity, etc.</p>
              <p>here, the exact is being done, only this government is smarter. they stockpile cash where it won't rot. but the methods is the same, it tax the hell out of everybody, enrich themselves to no end, and report statistics that show that people are better off, employment up, economy doing well, traffic management is working, etc.</p>
              <p>hidden behind these set of numbers, singapore remain a country the misled 66.6% can call home.</p>

              <p>Minister Raymond Lim was taken to task at his Meeting with Sin
              Min residents about one year ago for repeatedly raising ERP charges
              and increasing ERP gantries without solving the traffic congestion
              problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have posted alternative solutions to many forums namely :-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(1) Divide all roads into three tiers, (a) Expressway (ERP
              controlled)</p>
              <p>(b) Major Roads (non-ERP alternative routes to city or CBD or
              high traffic economic zones like Jurong or Tampines etc (c ) Local
              Roads (Non-ERP roads where congestions do not affect economic
              activities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Under such a 3-tier road network, there will be proper
              justifications and basis for charging ERP such as the
              following:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(1) ERP Gantries will be set up only in Expressways leading to
              CBD</p>
              <p>(2) Alternative routes are always available to those to CBD,
              EZ.</p>
              <p>(3) Citizens will be able to accept rationale for paying ERP for
              faster travel to CBD and EZ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Home-going journeys should not be ERP-chargeable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being paid millions of salaries, do our PM, MM, SM, Ministers or
              senior civil servants have good ideas how to justify additional
              taxes to lessen people's burden and lessen the rising costs of
              living and economic competitiveness for the economy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just look at what Minister Raymond Lim has done during the past
              few months after meeting the many angry residents of Sin Min.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Instead he ignored their complaints and problems and carried on
              increasing the ERP charges and building more ERP gantries and
              expect the hard-pressed citizens to continue to bear with such
              system of authoritarian rule which does not benefit the road
              congestions nor any citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reform Party chief JBJ should be asked to raise this question in
              parliament as soon as possible. (WP seems to be switched off just
              like the PAP MPs because of some praises from the government about
              CST or LTK)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Leaders must have the convictions and passion to serve the
              people and not listen to half-baked million-dollar ministers who
              could hardly justify the ERP based on proper road planning as shown
              in the lack of systematic speed-congestion planning of roads.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sin Min residents were right - by increasing ERP charges there
              were no improvements in the congestion problem but instead more and
              more ERP gantries are now set up even at residential areas without
              a distinction to differentiate need for ERP control for economic or
              non-economic travel.</p>

              <p>a simple summary of a certain group of leaders in a certain little island..y bother looking at alterantives and hurt our precious brain cells when we can just "justify" rising charges?citizens will only whine and pay. better use our precious little amount of grey matter to think of other ways to siphon $$ from the citizens.</p>

              <p>the problem lies with our dear raymond dont like traffic jam when he is going home from work. when he is going home in his car, he see himself travel too slow that why he up the ERP. cos he is pay million and who care about the $2, $20 or $50 charge? as long he can go home with smooth traffic, you think he care if you have to pay more meh?</p>

              <p>well... In Singapore, if you own a car, you are either</p>
              <p>1. damn rich----- Well then the increase is good news to u, less ppl on road.<br>2. really need it ---- well.. nth u can do.. have to pass the cost to customers if possible.<br>3. a show off. ---- HAhahaha.... Too bad.</p>
              <p>Personally, I think this is a good move by the gahmen, If you want to own a car can... but you pay as you go, no money, can... keep the car in garage lor, every day polish it.... Cos u dun really need one in singapore... This to me, is a better way to increase tax revenue  than GST which is broad spectrum.</p>
              <p>Its unfair to public transport(ie. taxis), you want ppl to take public transport mah... how can u also increase their prices?</p>

              <p>I agree that to the stinky rich, even if ERP per entry costs $20 would mean nothing to them but would be unimaginable to the majority. I guess a stinky rich man would be more happy when less can compete with them , in this case, road usage.</p>
              <p>Other aspects of life:</p>
              <p>1. Justice for all : Legal service.  If you are not stinky rich, could you sue a stinky rich bad man when you could not afford the legal services required ?</p>
              <p>2. Medical service for all : if you are not stinky rich, could you afford the medical service you need?</p>
              <p>Is this world meant for the rich?</p>

              <p>does motocycle has to paid ERP? it seem this is nor related to the car only. truck?  vans? pick up? why penalise the company transportation vehicle when it is necessary for them to use the road for business. to me it is just lame excuses for govt to increase their tax coffers.</p>

              <p>1) fixed the direct problem - just too many cars on the road !!!

              <p> </p>
              <p>2) change the SBS &amp; SMRT &amp; TIB concept !!! We need more
              efficient and cheaper services - not fancy things like air-cond bus
              terminal, and stupid extra - that does little to transport people
              but cost more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Take a page from Shanghai. They have problem of traffic, and
              without land to expand on roads. So they go for what they call sky
              highway system. They just build a road or highway on top of
              existing road or highway, it may cost more, but fastest and earier
              way then to dig underground.</p>

              <p>The cost of living is already risen to high level.</p>
              <p>Many services transportation cost would be passed to consumers. Taxi is public transport. People are encouraged to take public transport. But the ERP hike would pass the cost to consumers. Businesses transport their goods &amp; foods from place to place. They are also affecting passing the cost to their business partners and consumers.</p>
              <p>Would the recently announced ERP hike , compounded with oil price hikes incur to the people a higher cost of living?</p>
              <p>And 'coincidentally' in the same news on ERP hike, it was announced  that new bus services would be introduced and sounds like not cheap. </p>

              <p><br>Actually a simple way to solve all this would be to implement flexible 24 hours workday. The issue right now is everybody knocks off at around the same time, resulting in crowding in MRTs, Buses and Roads.</p>
              <p>Like the recent changes to the Taxi charges, I find it ridiculous, most of the time during peak hours, you find the Taxi drivers waiting in queues, not doing any productive work, yet they are paid more for doing nothing. They actually get paid more for doing less or no work. Something grave errors in their policy implementation.</p>

              <p>Singapore is very good at this one =&gt; build flyovers along CTE over the commonly congested exits like AMK ave 3 &amp; 5, so that those going further north do not need to join in those exiting at these areas.</p>
              <p>However, one thing I do support at the moment is the construction of KPE to attempt to ease some traffic off CTE; parallel expressways solution.</p>
              <p>Afterall, LTA do have the survey results of cars entering and exiting these exits along CTE.</p>
