They believe we will vote mostly for our own race, and hence the minority race will most likely have no representatives. This is directly telling us that they do not trust us singaporeans to uphold the meritocratic policy that has been running singapore for years. If PAP do not trust us, why do they insist in us trusting them? We singaporeans definitely recognize the ability of other races, and will not vote someone of less capability and charisma just because someone is the same race as us.</div></blockquote>If the comments in these forums are indicative of the sentiments of Singaporeans in general, then no, I do not trust Singaporeans not to vote laong racial lines.

            <div class='col-md body'>PAP's style of government is that PAP is the government, and opposition are just for the sake of some sort of opposition in the parliament. Their ideology is also that the opposition are cmi pple, and they are the elite, therefore they should govern the country. Opposition are not really checks and balances to them; they are just a nusiance that PAP wants to eliminate.<br><br>Speaking of checks and balances, the strongest check that a democracy is that of the media. However, PAP controls the media such that this check never exists in singapore. LHL once said "Who gives the media the right to criticize the government when they are not elected". The singapore media is very pro-government simply because they have to. Furthermore, they put the opposition in bad light, and this has lead some to think that it is anti-government when u oppose policies crafted by the PAP.<br></div>

The legislation (Parliament, incl the cabinet)<br>3. The Judicary (Judges/courts, Police Force)<br><br>Part 1 - An independent Judicary Council to appoint Judges and CJs with no interference absolutely from Parliment. Approval by the President.<br>The <strong>constitution was amended</strong> to give the PM power to appoint Judges and Chief Justices (CJs) on short tenures, hence also giving the PM the power to "not renew" the judge's appointment on "unsatisfactory performance". I'll leave the definition of "unsatisfactory performance" to you imagination. I think it may have something to do with Lee and son and all their libel suits. Their salaries are also determined by the Executive. When the Judicary is totally independent, with no influence from the Executive, it will take on its original role and becomes a check to the Executive.<br><br>Part 2 - The Police force reports to the parliment directly, not run by one minister, a corpratized police force, much like in the UK. Which makes the police commisioner or chief of police force, answerable to the parliment as whole.<br><br>The legislation, 1st and formost, more than 66% percent gives approval to amend the constitution. PAP amended the elections act, add this act, amend that act.... to entrench themselves. All the laws about free speech and publication (or lack of) is done thru the constitution. As said in the first post, first is to wrest control of the constitution from PAP. only then part 1 and 2 can be achieved.</div>

Majority power is fine, but with judicial checks and balances to be exercised when absolutely necessarily.<br><br>In this illiberal democratic system, the Chief Justice cannot check the excesses of a Prime Minister, not even in consultation with others.

Quite simply, there would be a conflict of interest if any branch of Government had to answer to another.<br><br>Taking 2 models of democracy which you'd probably be familiar with, you might wish to consider the US and Great Britain.<br><br>In the US, the Executive and Legislature are elected seperately and do not answer to each other (although they often work together to reach a compromise should both branches of Government fall in the hands of different parties as no bills can be passed without the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">joint approval</span></span> of the Executive and Legislature). For the Executive, the people elect the President and Vice-President (the Legislature and Judiciary cannot overrule the results of elections for Executive and vice versa). The Legislature comprise of elected representatives to both the Senate and House of Representatives which form Congress. The Judiciary, however, comprises of 9 justices nominated by the Executive (ie.the President) and approved by the Legislature through Senate. Although the Judiciary comprises of members appointed by the Executive and approved by the Legislature, the Judiciary does not account to the Executive or Legislature in any way for its actions are not bounded by either.<br><br>In Great Britain, their brand of parliamentary democracy - the same brand which the fascists of this regime base themselves on (in theory, at least) as do most former British colonies - is different from that of the US. The Legislature, comprising the House of Commons and House of Lords (most policies are passed in the House of Commons where the MPs are elected and the House of Lords have very limited powers), functions in such a manner that the leader of the party with the most seats in parliament will become the Prime Minister (even if the largest party does not have enough seats to form its own government, a coalition government will then be form with the Prime Minister being the leader of the party with the most seats). However, the power of the Executive is actually vested in the Monarch (ie.Queen Elizabeth II at this point in time) and exercised through the Monarch's ministers. Note that the Prime Minister actually exercises his power, via the Monarch, through the Executive and not the Legislature - the PM's role in the Legislature(ie.House of Commons) is no different from the other 646 elected MP's as far as power goes. The power of the Judiciary lies in the hands of the UK's courts of law and function as an independent entity from both the Legislature and Executive.<br><br>In essence, both models yield examples whereby no branch of Government is actually "inferior" or accountable to another - and that's how things should be for any civilised democracy to function in the manner stipulated by its Constitution.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are probably right, maybe the 3 bodies shoul not be answerable to each other. Then again, most importantly, the 3 bodies have to be independent of each other. While here in Singapore, the constitution has been amended to a point where teh Executive has total control over the other 2 bodies(Judicary/Legislative)</div>
