            <div class='col-md body'>http://power2thepeoplesg.blogspot.com/<br><br><strong>Voting for Opposition a bad move? What about Check and Balances?</strong><br><br>Fearful of supporting the opposition? I think, firstly its probably due to the government swinging the Sledgehammer, with "ISA" engraved on its side so prominiently in the past. Every time I talk about how much I respect people like Jeyaretnam, Chiam See Tong and about how much I root for the opposition parties... it really saddens me, to the point my heart aches, to hear my loved one tell me " Please think of your future, don't get into trouble". Opposition politics is synonymous with trouble? It really saddens me, it is a very real sign, to me, that there is an acute need for political reform. To quote the venerable Mr Jeyaretnam "A complete and thorough reform of the system" "no more tinkering".<br><br>Then there is another kind of fear, As Mr Lee Kuan Yew had once said - paraphrase "Elections are about your futures and your children's' futures" It really does make one, standing in the voting booth stop and think doesn't it? Especially those who have families or kids to raise. He does seem to have a talent for it doesn't he? Striking fear in the hearts of people... one way or another.<br><br>Many people worry, or fear, that voting the for the opposition will threaten the security of this country, both civic and economic security, if indeed, the PAP is to be ousted from its entrenched seat of power. The operative word being "if". yeah, I know it sounds kinda pessimistic.<br><br>A thought I was toying with, there are many people whom I have come across, see the sledgehammer of the PAP and don't really like it. Some would like to see more transparency and accountability from the government. Some feel that more press freedom is in order, but if these people voted for PAP, why?<br><br>My take?Here's where they trip, they are not willing to risk the economic future for checks and balances. They don't see the perceived required calibre within the opposition at the moment, so "hmm ok I'll vote PAP for now till WP/SDA get better people" becomes a common self justification line they use for voting for the incumbents or PAP. But its no impossible to find capable people isn't it? even in a coup de'tat like in thailand, they still found people to run the country. But thats far from what we should be doing tho, just saying that its not impossible to find capable people.<br><br><strong>So how will Singapore get a credible opposition?</strong><br><br>Firstly, a credible opposition doesn't equate to overthrowing the government, or even a revolution. Overthrowing the government is not the objective here. Placing a credible opposition in parliament has to start gradually, by taking small steps....<br><br>Firstly, the opposition has to build up strength.... which so far, WP is ahead among the opposition parties, but not enough, yet. Although its a rather significant step. They do not have to match the PAP, man for man. Its a big step, considering 15-20 years ago or even 5 years ago, if a graduate were to openly join an opposition party, chances are, that there was actually a social taboo attached, even regarded as insane by some. Get enough talent, win a GRC, or even 2. Establish a foothold.<br><br>Then the 1st real step to the main objective to establishing Checks and Balances. Something I consider the Achilles heel of the PAP, hard to get to, but when you get to it, its the key. What is the most important key to rule? Its the absolute power and control of the law. And what is the supreme law of the land? It is the Constitution of The Republic of Singapore.<br><br>So the first step is to wrest away total control of the constitution from the PAP. As many of you already know, 66% votes in parliament gives them(PAP) the right to amend the constitution, and thats where PAP gets its power. Having all but 2 out of 84 seats in Parliament, needless to say that the PAP has absolute control over the constitution. Amendment to this act, introduce that act, amend this act, introduce that act, easily done to entrench themselves. Like what they did to the elections act, and also amended the constitution to give the PM the power to appoint Judges and CJs, on short term contracts, which means, also gives him the right to "not renew" those contracts on "unsatisfactory performance" and I leave the definition of "unsatisfactory performance" you to your imagination.... I think it has got something to do with Lee and son and all their libel suits....<br><br>Anyway, I digress, first major objective, is to gain like 40% seats in parliament.. PAP will still be in power, with most of their ministers still in cabinet, just that the power over the law will no longer be absolute. And when that happens, the opposition parties will start to have more credibility to attract capable people. Joining the PAP will no longer be a nobrainer for potential politicians. Voting will then really involve serious deliberation on the part of the voters. Bear in mind, the first step is to wrest absolute power from PAP's hands<br><br>Competition can breed quality.... absolute power can breed stagnation, and then corruption..<br><br>The ultimate goal, is to win at least 66% and then remove all entrenching amendments from the constitution. Relinquish the power from the Executive to appoint judges. The police force, answerable to the whole parliament, not just 1 minister. These are things to watch out for when a new party does take over. If a new party take over, and still retains all the entrenching laws, we might just get another PAP, but by another name.<br><br>Think about it, lending your support to the opposition may not be such a big a risk as the PAP may have you and I believe. Do you honestly think that singapore will crumble if PAP has 60% seats?<br><br>Well thank you for reading this longish essay, if 1 out of 20 people who read this, begins to lend his or her support to the alternative parties, I would be glad to have been able to even make a small difference.<br><br>Competition can breed quality.... abosolute power can breed stagnation, and then corruption.</div>
