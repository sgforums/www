Let others judge our achievements and not keep blowing our own trumpet day in and day out!<br><br>Just imagine if one of your colleagues earn double your pay while doing the same job as you monthly, how would you feel if you know the truth? How will you feel if you know that one of them earn 50-100 times your salary monthly? We are all human and the tolerance of human is limited. You will not  feel "buoy song" if you know that your immediate neighbours are rich.

It isn't bias, please check the meaning of 'anecdotal' before you make another stupid remark.<br><br>And did i ever say I was taking any sides? I was only showing what other evidence i collected on the case and I did say that there wasn't enough facts to substantiate the claim, the facts which were made known to the public though.<br><br>You get so hyped up being anti-msian that you don't use your brains to think about what is really going on, you just want to fuel your own prejudices. To me, it's just a case of, not enough proof, so the claim will just 'die' eventually.(Unless there is new, factual evidence).<br><br>Please don't think like a schoolboy, think like a matured adult. Maybe you are still in school that's why you react like that.<br></div>

It is up to us, the public, to not believe what these politicians say all the time. And we only know what is reported by the media, we don't really know the full story of what is actually happening.<br><br>Politicians are high profile people, so they got easy access to the media. How are we suppose to stop them from making unsubstantiated allegations? The only way is to either become politicians ourselves or create our own news media, but as ordinary people, we stand a better chance if we dispute the claims ourselves using logical thinking.<br><br>Anyway, I was referring to the writer, audiovideo as 'jakun' because he called msia and other nearby countries 'bastard'.</div>
