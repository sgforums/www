It then ruled that the reclamation could continue, but ordered both sides to set up an independent group of experts to study the impact.<br><br>It was agreed that the recommendations of the experts would be used as the basis of a "mutually acceptable and beneficial solution".<br><br>Ghani said Kota Tinggi was in urgent need of new flood mitigation measures.<br><br>"One option is to widen the banks of Sungai Johor."<br><br>There was a need for new and radical measures as Kota Tinggi would otherwise suffer from repeated flooding.<br><br>To worsen the problem, excess rain water from upstream and the surrounding catchment areas also flowed into Sungai Johor, causing its banks to burst.<br></blockquote><img src="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Wednesday/National/20070131091211/floods.JPG"><br>fr NST<br><br><img src="http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k84/puzzylion2/tekong.jpg"><br>Tekong reclamation boundary<br><strong><a href="http://www.mpa.gov.sg/circulars_and_notices/portmarine_notices/pn06-151.htm" rel="nofollow">No. 151 of 2006,03-11-2006,RECLAMATION AT PULAU TEKONG</a></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read this last week from Malaysia today cum forum.... alamak.. there was also the other side of the story which I am not sure whether you have read sometime back published in ST.  Its SG rebuttal  to MY allegation and the World court ruling on SG &amp; MY claim.  Someone put the blame on SG, but their PM is asking for investigation into their drainage system which may be the cause of their flood.  and worse, lots of other reason posted by MYsian....<br><br>Do take note if SG re-claim work is the cause for their flooding, what about the flooding in SG too during that same period?  Do you mean we are to blame for our own action?  Do you think you would do something to harm your own environment?  There are more to that than casue of their flood.  there are also others who refuted their claim.  Just look at what SG has done over the decades just to reduce or prevent more floods more happening.  For MY, its just a thing waiting to happen, look at how they handle the crisses and where the aids are going too? people can claim that they will send help after the Hari Raya holiday, what attitude is this when people's life are at stake and they can takew their own sweet time.<br><br>I have been following up with on this untill I also give up reading, just pity the poeple in Johore, hte way the MY relief work was carried out.<br><br></div>

Ya, the reasons why their stupid police are corrupt is because Singapore are too clean liao and thus make them look corrupt and bad.</div>
