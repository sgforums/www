They would rather print letters concerning stray or noisy dogs and cats. This is the extent of meritocracy where scholars were engaged to do the bidding of autocratic leaders to serve their own interest.<br><br>Here is one as printed in Today (29.1.2007) :-<br><br>STRAY CATS POSE RISKS<br><br>Letter from Goh Kian Huat<br><br>"I refer to the letter, "'Because cats scare me', is not a good reason" (Jan 20-21). While I appreciate Dr. Tan Chek Wee's care and concern for stray cats, I do not understand the reasons for not supporting the way stray animals are treated - qualified verterinarian consultants carry out euthanasia humanely by lethal injection.<br><br>HDB dwellers are not allowed to keep cats as pets as they are nomadic in nature and it is difficult to confine them to flats. They shed fur, dirty public places, make noise and casue a disturbance.<br><br>While community cats could perform an important function in catching mice, their role is diminishing with the decline in the rat and mouse population in cleaner housing estate...(Letter quite long ..read for yourself"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hypocrisy, and shame. Just look at how our newspapers are being run nowadays. If scholars dare not publish letters which criticise government policies or actions, just say do and tell the truth.<br><br>Instead all scholars working in Straits Times and Today seem to be fond of  telling lies to readers, for not publishing their truthfully written letters as can be seen from one of their template replies below:-<br><br>Dear Sir,<br><br>Thank you for your contribution to our VOICES section, but I'm afraid we aren't able to use your letter.<br><br>Please however continue to send your views to TODAY.

I don't want to even farking hear about another dumb pay raise since I am seeing more and more dumb policies after the pay raise.
