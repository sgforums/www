Nathaniel Bacon 1676<br><br>"Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself, in all cases, as the ages and generations which preceded it." Thomas Paine<br><br>"Where wealth is hereditary, power is hereditary; for wealth is power. Titles are of very little or no consequence. The rich are nobility, and poor plebeians in all countries. And on this distinction alone the true definition of aristocracy depends. An aristocracy is that influence or power which property may have in government; a democracy is the power or influence of the people or members, as contradistinguished from property. Between these two powers -the aristocracy and democracy -that is, the rich and the poor, there is constant warfare." A Farmer in the Maryland Gazette 1783<br><br>"I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country."

Is the government honest in saying that they corporatize these services to prevent abuse or welfarism.<br><br>(3) How much salary increases are enough ? ministers, MPs, Civil Servants - aren't their continous past increases already causing public sector salaries to be much too high and uncompetitive.<br><br>After NKF, it is as if Minister Ng does not know the real issues are not justification for workfare but the economy is losing competitiveness due to non-stop building of reserves and witholding of essential services to the people paid originally by taxes.<br><br>It is a great pity that such a distinguished panel like Dr. Amy Khor and Flying Dutchman cannot see the real issues facing the country today and still pretend to talk about the need to look after future when government could easily look after them by taxing them lesser or more moderately and try to tell us "what is enough" for reserves and witholding of essential transport an utility services.<br><br>Real issues which should be asked include: Is the HDB flats morally or legally entitled to sell its flats to citizens under low-cost or home-owners for the people scheme at market price with a little discount claimed to be a subsidy.<br><br>When lands were acquired using taxpayers' monies under low-cost housing, at dirt cheap prices, should HDB sell flats to the people under such housing schemes at market prices with pretentious discounts passed off as subsidy like the NKF.<br><br>Should HDB be compelled to buy lands for low-cost housing which were already acquired for this purpose from the SLA at market prices and then sell flats to the people who paid for the lands through taxes at market prices with such hoax subsidy which is actually a form of discount in the market place.<br><br>why government still needs so much reserve? After government has encouraged the problems of over-building of reserves in NKF, is it still confidently saying that Durai was right in using 30 years as yardstick for NKF reserves.<br><br>The real issues today is not nitty gritty about the need for workfare but whether government after NKF has learned a lesson - How many years of reserve must the government continue to build with GST and double-tax on HDB land costs and withold provision of essential services through corporatizations?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To: Editor, Straits Times, Today<br>c.c. PM Lee Hsien Loong<br><br>Dear Editors,<br><br>Arising from the malpractices disclosed in NKF and Youth Challenge, we will need to ask ourselves many questions.<br><br>Has the system of meritocracy worked for Singapore?<br><br>To me, it would seem that meritocracy or pseudo-meritocracy has produced the following:-<br><br>(1) Scholars engaged in Commissioners of Charity, Ministry of Youth and Community Development, Regulatory bodies in Ministry of Health and all the audit firms like Ernst and Young or KPMT for past twenty years have failed to detect wrong doings and malpractices of the kind as witnessed in NKF, Youth Challenge. (It will be indeed be a shame for scholars given their high calibre often painted to the citizens by leaders to give any excuse of the kind like the NKF patron Mrs. Goh Chok Tong or Ex-PM Goh were close to Durai who would be too powerful for them to exercise their respective professional duties and responsibilities; they should resign from their jobs if they are unable to make appropriate recommendations to correct mistakes or get their ministers and even MM or SM to correct wrong doings)<br><br>If our scholars do not have the gut to report wrong doings or change wrong policies they are not worth being employed to serve us the people or look after our country.<br><br>(2) Scholars at the upper echelon i.e. Ministers, MPs, and the whole government should have the ability to implement all policies once they are announced but many of them have failed to introduce proper efficient and effective system of government, processes for accountability and transparency.<br><br>During the last three recessions, scholars have conveniently failed to answer to their lack of implementation of past economic restructuring plans (to broad-based value-adding technology-start up model like the Koreans or Finnists have done) and were seen only to be good in giving excuses or blaming the problems on the people.<br><br>If our leaders want to talk so much about meritocracy as their secrets of success and distinguish themselves as world-class leaders they must prove by their actions and deed that all the meritocratic scholars given opportunities to sit on high positions as strongly recommended by them are people who could solve our structural unemployment problems and work towards lowering our high costs of living and avoid such malpractices as now reported.<br><br>So the whole system of meritocracy is too theoretical and conceptual giving rise to hidden malpractices of all kinds as seen in NKF where eminent directors put on various boards simply chickened out on their basic moral duties and legal duties to the people at large.<br><br>They were there only to compromise and cover up wrongs and malpractices committed against the people.<br><br>Our system of leadership and meritocracy so often bragged to the citizens and to the whole world should be overhauled to one where men and women working as ministers, ministers of state, MPs, Top civil servants are subjected to checking and supervision by the people through adoption of key processes which can be examined and not by audit or other close-door committees which are under the control of self-interested politicians.<br><br>Alternatively, an Ombudsman system incorporating self-checking processes can be introduced as without such processes, everything may end up controlled by back-door interested politicians who will be too afraid to check on their own party's wrong doers.</div>
