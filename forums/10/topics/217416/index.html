            <div class='col-md body'>The rationale that I can think of for such a decision is that the convicts are accessories of crime. I mean sure, these are not bad people, but they are crucial to these loan sharks in their unlawful deeds. If these people are not punished harshly and highly publicised, many more people will do what these people are doing, passively helping the loan sharks, which only assist the loan sharks in harming even more people of similar financial status. Now that these people are punished harshly, and highly publicised, it would be less likely for others who hope to get an easy way out of their 500-2k debt to become an accessory of crime. Yes, sure, there will still be those who will be really desperate and has no other choice, but they are not the intented target, the ruling is perhaps aiming at people who, like the accused, are looking for an easy way out without considering for others who are in similar situation.</div>
