              <p><strong>Introduction<br></strong><br>Schools
              teach our children that Lee Kuan Yew heroically delivered Singapore
              from the evil clutches of the communists and gave us what we have
              today. <br><br>Whether such an assertion is historically accurate or
              not, the Government seems intent to seal this version in the annals of
              Singapore. When filmmaker, Mr Martyn See, released Zahari's 17 Years in
              which Mr Said Zahari talked about his 17-year detention, the Government
              promptly banned it. <br><br>It, it stated, "will not allow people who
              had posed a security threat to the country in the past to exploit the
              use of films to purvey a false and distorted portrayal of their past
              actions and detention by the government."<br></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Top-secret
              documents held by the British Government, now declassified, reveal some
              jaw-dropping facts about Lee Kuan Yew and how he came to power.<br></strong><br>When
              Lim Chin Siong, another of Lee Kuan Yew's prisoners, died in 1996, the
              PAP was equally anxious to make sure that Lim's portrayal as a
              revolutionary communist remained etched in the minds of the people.<br><br><img src="http://yoursdp.org/images/stories/SDP_limchinsiong1.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="200" align="left">In
              response to a tribute that the SDP had written about Lim, the PAP
              through then MP Dr Ow Chin Hock, said that the Barisan Sosialis
              (Socilaist Front), of which Lim was its leader, fought the Government
              in 1966 "on the streets, according to the teachings of Mao Zedong in
              the Cultural Revolution."<br><br>It was a bald-faced lie. Lim was already in prison under ISA detention in 1966 and could not have led his party in anything.<br><br>This, it seems, was not the only untruth that the PAP has been telling us. <br><br>For
              example, Dr Ow pointed out that Lim was not fighting for a democratic
              Singapore (the cheek) but a communist one. Lim would have turned
              Singapore into "Mao's China or Ho Chi Minh's Vietnam", the PAP
              insisted. <br><br>Besides, it was the Internal Security Council (ISC)
              under the command of the British and not the PAP Government, who
              ordered the arrest and detention of Lim and colleagues.<br><br><img src="http://yoursdp.org/images/stories/SDP_limchinsiong2.JPG" border="1" alt="" width="200" align="left">This
              was because there were only three PAP representatives on the ISC and
              they were "outnumbered" by the other four members on the Council, three
              British and one Malaysian.<br><br>Nothing could be more untrue. <br><br>Top-secret
              documents held by the British Government, now declassified, reveal some
              jaw-dropping facts about Lee Kuan Yew and how he came to power. <br><br>Two
              history scholars studied these papers and presented their findings in
              the book Comet In Our Sky (available at Select Books at the Tanglin
              Shopping Centre).<br><br>The first is Tim Harper who teaches Southeast
              Asian history and the history of the British empire at the University
              of Cambridge in London. <br><br>The second is Greg Poulgrain, a
              professor at Griffiths University in Australia who has been researching
              Southeast Asian history for more than 20 years. <br><br>This SDP feature presents a summary of Dr Harper's and Dr Poulgrain's chapters. It contains some shocking archival material.<br><br>It
              also attempts to answer questions like who were people like Lim Chin
              Siong and Said Zahari? Did they really pose a security threat to the
              country? Were they communists hell-bent on undermining
              constitutional/democratic means of governance in Singapore? Was it
              really the ISC that was responsible for their arrest and imprisonment?
              Most important, is the PAP's version of history based on fact?<br><br>Remember,
              this narration is not the SDP's rendition of events past. It is a
              collective summary of the research done by two historians.<br><br>To
              ensure that this present essay remains faithful to Professors Harper's
              and Poulgrain's works, quotes from the historians' chapters are used
              liberally.<br><br>Still, don't take our word for it. Get a copy of
              Comet In Our Sky and read for yourself the real history of the PAP and
              Barisan Sosialis.<br><br><strong>Why bother?</strong><br><br>But why is
              this important? Why should Lim Chin Siong, a man who died more than ten
              years ago and who led a party which is now defunct, be relevant to the
              world in which we now live?<br></p>
              <blockquote><strong>Hard,
              historical facts are the greatest antidote to fear mongering by the

              </div>
              <p>First,
              because those events are part of our history, and history defines who
              we are as a people and, more important, shapes the way we plan our
              future.<br><br>The textbooks that the Ministry of Education writes for
              our kids are not history but rather fables, starring Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
              We have a duty to teach our youths the truth.<br><br>Also, what
              happened in the 1950s and 60s continue to be relevant because many of
              Lim's colleagues are still alive and the sacrifices they made for the
              independence of Singapore have been all but erased. Their stories must
              be told and their honour restored.<br><br>Third, and perhaps most
              important, not only is the PAP's cloroxed account used to mentally
              condition (brainwash, if you prefer) our children, it continues to be
              used as a weapon to intimidate and silence voices of dissent.<br><br>If
              Lee Kuan Yew can manipulate the security apparatus for his own
              political ends in the 1950s and 60 as you will note from Dr Harper's
              and Dr Poulgrain's revelations, what does that say about the present
              use of the ISD to detain other Singaporeans? <br><br>More ominously,
              what if the PAP feels sufficiently threatened politically and resorts
              to concocting another conspiracy to detain without trial more
              Singaporeans and opposition politicians like it did to a group of
              professionals in 1987? <br><br>Hard, historical facts are the greatest
              antidote to fear mongering by the state and to the use of national
              security as a bogey to suppress freedom and democracy.<br><br>Knowledgeable citizens with a keen sense of history are the best protection against acts of repression in the future.<br><br>So
              if you are a discerning Singaporean unwilling to let the authorities
              tell you what to think and how to think it, if you are one of those who
              don't want your mind raped, then introduce yourself to this four-part
              Special Feature and take part in the forum discussion.</p>

              				Chin Siong vs Lee Kuan Yew: The true and shocking history <br><br>Part
              				I: Our man <br></strong>08 Jul 07<strong><br><br></strong>"The
              				men who led Singapore to self-government and independence were
              				swift to produce an authorized version of their struggle…,”
              				historian T N Harper observes, "it began with Lee Kuan Yew's
              				dramatic broadcasts as Prime Minister on Radio Malaya in 1961.
              				The plot and the moral of this story are clear: by the political
              				resolve and tactical acumen of its leaders, the fragile
              				city-state weathers the perils of a volatile age and emerges into
              				an era of stability and prosperity."<br><br>However, much to
              				the discomfort of the Minister Mentor who hitherto has had a
              				relatively free reign in portraying "the period as one in
              				which Lim Chin Siong and the left were outmanoeuvred by the
              				tactically more astute Lee Kuan Yew," Harper cautions that
              				"authoritative new archival research sheds new light on the
              				high politics of the period."<br><br>In other words, Lee's
              				bravado with which he presently speaks covers up much that took
              				place during those years. <br><br>In truth, Lim Chin Siong's fate
              				was sealed right from the very beginning by the power of the
              				British colonialists – and not Lee Kuan's political
              				prowess. <br><br>At that time British authorities were already
              				devising ways on how to stop Lim's ascent in Singapore's
              				politics. Southeast Asia historian, Greg Poulgrain, writes that
              				"In the Public Record Office in London are some of the
              				observations and stratagems pursued by both the Colonial and
              				Foreign Office – revealed now more than thirty years after
              				the events – on how to deal with this rising star, Lim
              				Siong Chin."<br><br>With Singaporeans becoming more educated
              				and the advent of the Internet, events surrounding the heroics of
              				Lee and his PAP during the period of independence and merger with
              				Malaya "no longer looks so unilinear and uncontested."<br><br><strong>The
              				emergence of Lim Chin Siong<br></strong><br>Harper recounts the
              				"meteoric" rise of Lim Chin Siong as a student and
              				trade union leader in the early 1950s who was at the heart of the
              				anti-colonial politics that had erupted all over Asia following
              				World War II. <br><br>By unifying the labour movement and
              				galvanizing the overwhelmingly Chinese-speaking electorate
              				through his formidable oratorical skills (he once told his
              				massive audience: "<em>Saya masuk</em> first gear, l<em>u
              				jangan gostan</em>!" – "When I go into the first
              				gear, don't you go into reverse!"), Lim captured the
              				attention of the masses.<br><br>And Lee Kuan Yew's too. This led
              				to an association between the two men and the subsequent
              				formation of the PAP. The anglophile Lee (Harry, as he once
              				wanted to be called) saw the power of his younger
              				Chinese-educated comrade. <br><br>Even within the PAP, "Lim
              				eclipsed Lee Kuan Yew and other leaders in the popular following
              				he commanded..."<br><br>But in his memoirs, <em>The Singapore
              				Story</em>, published in 1998 Lee Kuan Yew condescendingly
              				described Lim as "modest, humble and well-behaved, with a
              				dedication to his cause that won my reluctant admiration and
              				respect."<br><br>The truth is that Lee didn't have much of a
              				choice. Lim Chin Siong was at the front, back and center of a
              				political movement that commanded national attention. From all
              				accounts, Lee would have been marginalized if his parasitic
              				instincts had not been so acute.<br><br>Popular as he was
              				locally, Lim Chin Siong did not confine his politics to within
              				Singapore. Despite British efforts to isolate the island from
              				anti-imperial movements that engulfed much of Empire, Lim would
              				draw inspiration from liberation movements elsewhere in Africa
              				and Asia. <br><br>His speeches in the early 1960s repeatedly made
              				reference to events in the colonial world as well as to South
              				Africa, Korea, and Turkey. This sense of internationalism had a
              				"deep resonance" in Singapore. <br><br>The colonial
              				government countered by censoring imported reading material.
              				"This," writes Harper, "would continue, even
              				intensify, after self-government as the PAP government
              				increasingly saw itself as pitted against what Lee Kuan Yew was
              				to term the ‘anti-colonialism' of global liberation
              				movements." <br><br>In other words, Lee was not the hero who
              				led the fight for Singapore's freedom. This might come as a shock
              				to some but as declassified documents reveal, it was Lim Chin
              				Siong who insisted that Singaporeans' freedom and independence
              				were not for compromise.<br><br>It was also "what really
              				caused the British authorities to consider [Lim] such a
              				threat."<br><br><strong>The talks collapse…<br></strong><br>When
              				David Marshall became the chief minister after his Labour Front
              				won the elections in 1955, he organised a delegation to London
              				the following year to negotiate independence from the British.
              				Marshall included both Lim Chin Siong and Lee Kuan Yew in his
              				team.<br><br>The chief minister fought hard, some say too hard,
              				to wrest power from the British in the internal affairs of
              				Singapore. He opposed Britain's power to appoint the police chief
              				who in turn had power over the Special Branch, as it was then
              				known. It was the Special Branch that gave the authorities the
              				power of detention without trial. <br><br>The idea of retaining
              				the power of internal security whilst granting self-government,
              				Marshall accused the British, was like serving "Christmas
              				pudding and arsenic sauce." <br><br>Lim Chin Siong supported
              				the chief minister on this and demanded a constitution that
              				transferred power to the local government with only defence and
              				foreign relations left in British hands. <br><br>The British
              				refused the demand and the talks collapsed. Marshall returned to
              				Singapore frustrated and, amidst condemnation by Lee Kuan Yew,
              				resigned as chief minister. <br><br><strong>...Lim Chin Siong is
              				detained…<br></strong><br>Lim Yew Hock took over the position
              				and led another visit to London the following year, which again
              				included Lee Kuan Yew. But this time, Marshall and Lim Chin Siong
              				were not part of the negotiating team. <br><br>More accurately,
              				Lim Chin Siong could not go because Lim Yew Hock, as chief
              				minister, had placed him under arrest, ostensibly for instigating
              				a riot.<br><br>The episode began when Chief Minister Lim closed
              				down a Chinese women's group and a musical association. A week
              				later, he banned the Chinese Middle School Union which provoked
              				further unhappiness with the locals.<br><br>Undeterred he
              				arrested Chinese student leaders and shut down more organizations
              				and schools, including the Chinese High School and the Chung
              				Cheng High School. Given the already tense situation between the
              				Chinese-speaking people and the colonial authorities, this was a
              				highly provocative act. <br><br>At that time any Singaporean
              				leader worth his salt could not have sat by idly. And so Lim Chin
              				Siong came to the fore and spoke up for the students. The late
              				Devan Nair, former Singapore president, joined in.<br><br>A
              				12-day stay-in was organised at one of the schools and Lim Chin
              				Siong was scheduled to speak at a nearby park one evening. <br><br>It
              				wasn't long before the police appeared and ringed the crowd.
              				Suddenly a mob started throwing stones at the police who then
              				charged with batons and tear-gas.<br><br>Violence erupted and
              				spread, with police stations being attacked and cars burned. By
              				the end of the chaos 2,346 people were arrested and more than a
              				dozen Singaporeans were killed. <br><br>The blame was squarely
              				pinned on Lim Chin Siong who was arrested.<br><br>But did Lim
              				Chin Siong really cause the mayhem? Who was the "mob"
              				that started attacking the police?<br><br>At that time, Chief
              				Minister Lim made no bones that the Lim Chin Siong was the front
              				man for the communists who had started the violence. Lim was
              				arrested by the Special Branch the following day. <br><br>Lim
              				vehemently denied this accusation and countered that the chief
              				minister was a colonial stooge. As declassified documents now
              				reveal, Lim Chin Siong was largely right.<br><br>Entitled <em>Extract
              				from a note of a meeting between Secretary of State and Singapore
              				Chief Minister, 12 December 1956</em>, the archival note recorded
              				that it was Chief Minister Lim who "had provoked the riots
              				and this had enabled the detention of Lim Chin Siong."<br><br>Poulgrain
              				even documents that full-scale military assistance was requested
              				by prior arrangement. Singapore Governor, William Goode,
              				acknowledged that the colonial government was not beyond
              				employing the tactic of provoking a riot and then using the
              				outcome to "achieve a desired political result."<br><br>Indeed,
              				Poulgrain noted that "[Public Record Office] documents show
              				these were the tactics of provocation that were employed in the
              				1956 riots that led to Lim Chin Siong's arrest." <br><br>A
              				few weeks after Lim Chin Siong was behind bars, Lim Yew Hock
              				visited London in December 1956 and was "warmly
              				congratulated on the outcome by Alan Lennox-Boyd, Secretary of
              				State for the Colonies."<br><br>And yet, in his memoirs, the
              				Minister Mentor concludes that the Malayan Communist Party "in
              				charge of Lim Chin Siong" were behind the whole affair and
              				that Lim Yew Hock had purged Singapore of the communist
              				ringleaders.<br><br>…<strong>and the talks are resurrected<br></strong><br>And
              				so in the 1957 with Lim Chin Siong under detention, Lim Yew Hock
              				led the delegation to London. But during the negotiations, it was
              				Lee who "played a crucial role in sweeping away the earlier
              				obstacles to agreement on internal security by resurrecting the
              				proposal for an Internal Security Council (ISC)." <br><br>The
              				ISC was structured in a way that Britain and Malaya outweighed
              				Singapore in the outfit. Why was the PAP supportive of such an
              				arrangement? <br><br>Historian Simon Ball said it best: "Lee
              				wanted an elected government but not one that could be blamed for
              				suppressing its own citizens."<br><br>Even more damning was
              				an archival "Top Secret" document that recorded: "Lee
              				was confidentially said that he values the [Internal Security]
              				Council as a potential ‘scape-goat' for unpopular measures
              				he will wish to take against subversive activities."<br><br>But
              				the PAP continues the charade. Recall what Dr Ow Chin Hock wrote
              				in his letter in 1996 about the arrest of Lim Chin Siong and
              				other Barisan leaders: "The [ISC] had a British chairman,
              				two British members, one Malaysian members and three Singaporean
              				members. Together these four non-Singaporeans outnumbered the
              				three Singaporeans on the council."<br><br>In any event,
              				unlike the one led by David Marshall, the negotiations in 1957
              				had little spine and gave away too much of Singaporeans' rights.
              				As a result, both sides expeditiously reached an agreement for
              				self-government, an agreement that Marshall called "<em>tiga
              				suku busok merdeka</em>" (three-quarters rotten
              				independence).<br><br>But self-government was not the only
              				subject being discussed. On the side, the British also wanted to
              				introduce a clause that would bar ex-detainees, or subversives as
              				the authorities called them, from standing for elections.<br><br>Lee
              				supported such a move – one that he would surely have known
              				would cripple party comrade Lim Chin Siong's political career.
              				<br><br>In his memoirs, however, Lee Kuan Yew wrote: "I
              				objected to [the introduction of the clause] saying that ‘the
              				condition is disturbing both because it is a departure from the
              				democratic practice and because there is no guarantee that the
              				government in power will not use this procedure to prevent not
              				only the communist but also democratic opponents of their policy
              				from standing for elections'."<br><br>A declassified British
              				memo contradicts this: "Lee Kuan Yew was secretly a party
              				with Lim Yew Hock in urging the Colonial Secretary to impose the
              				‘subversives ban'."<br><br>Perhaps this is not
              				surprising as the British had noted that the "present
              				leadership of the PAP is obsessed with the need to persuade the
              				politically unsophisticated masses that the PAP is ‘on
              				their side' and this involves demonstrating that the PAP is not a
              				friend of the foreigner…"<br><br>And this is perhaps
              				the reason why Lee told Britain's Secretary of State, Alan
              				Lennox-Boyd: "I will have to denounce [the clause]. You will
              				have to take responsibility."<br><br><strong>London to the
              				rescue…again<br></strong><br>A few months after Lee returned
              				from the constitutional talks in London in March 1957, the PAP
              				conducted elections of its executive council. Lim Chin Siong was
              				still under detention and could not challenge Lee for the party's
              				leadership. <br><br>Lim's supporters, however, outnumbered Lee's
              				rightwing faction and were elected to the executive council of
              				the PAP. <br><br>The British, through Lim Yew Hock who was by
              				then "viewed as an altogether more compliant tool of the
              				security apparatus," ordered the arrest of Lim Chin Siong's
              				supporters, thereby securing Lee Kuan Yew's continued control of
              				the party. <br><br>Harper records, that despite Lee's protests
              				against the crackdown of his party's leftwing, "not all were
              				convinced of his innocence in the matter."<br><br>In his
              				1998 memoirs, Lee Kuan Yew describes the fateful detention of the
              				PAP's leftwing leaders by giving much prominence to Lim Yew
              				Hock's decision while adroitly playing down the role of the
              				British.<br><br>After the talks in 1957, and given the
              				stubbornness of Marshall and Lim in the 1956 talks, the British
              				were persuaded that Lee was their man.<br><br>Another set of
              				talks were arranged in May 1958 and thereafter "there was an
              				unspoken assumption that the PAP would govern after the 1959
              				elections."<br><br>Writer T J S George repeated this
              				observation that "repeated [British] intervention to ensure
              				Lee Kuan Yew's political survival confirmed the feeling that Lee
              				was by now Britain's chosen man for Singapore."<br><br>Poulgrain
              				recounted his own experience with British intelligence officers
              				who were operating in Singapore in the early 1960s. One told him
              				about a group of officers who were listening in on Lee Kuan Yew
              				making a speech, railing against British imperialism. <br><br>"The
              				diatribe," Poulgrain writes, "brought only a jocular
              				response from this group, one of whom openly commented that Lee
              				was going a ‘bit over the top' considering that he was
              				actually ‘working with us.'" <br><br>The historian
              				states plainly that Lee Kuan Yew personified the essential
              				long-term interests of the United Kingdom in Singapore.<br><br>Lee
              				himself played up this position when he told the British
              				government that the PAP was really London's "best
              				ally."<br><br>The British agreed. Secret documents now show
              				that London's assessment was that Lim Chin Siong was increasingly
              				bringing pressure to bear on Her Majesty's Government and "unless
              				forestalled by Lee, may well be able to make the pressure
              				decisive."<br><br>Lee was grateful. He indicated that "he
              				and his other reputed moderates in the PAP regard the continued
              				presence of the British in Singapore as an assurance for
              				themselves."<br><br>From then on, despite the British
              				concerns of Lee's "totalitarian streak that rides roughshod
              				over all opposition or criticism", Lee's PAP and London
              				"became locked closer together."<br><br><br><em><strong>Part
              				II: Get him!</strong><br><br>In the next instalment read how an
              				emboldened Lee Kuan Yew, with British backing, officially breaks
              				with Lim Chin Siong. To be posted tomorrow. You won't want to
              				miss this.<br><br><strong>Preview</strong>:<br><br>In his memoirs, Lee
              				wrote that "Lim Chin Siong wanted to eliminate the Internal
              				Security Council because he knew that…if it ordered the
              				arrest and detention of the communist leaders, the Singapore
              				government could not be held responsible and be stigmatized a
              				colonial stooge."<br><br>What the Minister Mentor did not
              				say, but what Harper reveals in his chapter, is shockingly
              				contradictory: "In mid-1961, therefore, to seek a way out,
              				Lee suggested to the British that his government should order the
              				release of all [the remaining] detainees, but then have that
              				order countermanded in the ISC by Britain and Malaya."<br><br>Such
              				a craven act was even rebuffed by the British. The acting
              				Commissioner, Philip Moore, stated that the British should not be
              				"party to a device for <strong>deliberate</strong> misrepresentation
              				of responsibility for continuing detentions in order to help the
              				PAP government remain in power." (emphasis added)</em></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">9
                          				Jul 07</span><strong><br><br></strong>After securing control
                          				of the PAP with the aid of the British, Lee Kuan Yew was still
                          				left with the problem of the detained Lim Chin Siong and his
                          				supporters. <br><br>This was a source of embarrassment for him.
                          				Seeing this, Lee announced that he would secure the release of
                          				his party comrades before taking office if the PAP won the
                          				elections in 1959. <br><br>Behind the scenes, Lee negotiated and
                          				secured the private agreement of then British Prime Minister
                          				Harold Macmillan that the prisoners would be released by
                          				promising that he (Lee) would "move against them if they
                          				departed from the party line." <br><br>In return for
                          				promising to secure their release, Lee had secured Lim Chin
                          				Siong's and other detainees' pledges of allegiance to the party's
                          				manifesto.<br><br>Following PAP's victory in the 1959 election,
                          				Lim and six other detainees, were released. <br><br>Question: If
                          				Lim Chin Siong had really been the one who started the riots in
                          				1956, shouldn't he have been charged and imprisoned, rather then
                          				released? <br><br>In truth the PAP and the British themselves
                          				were playing fast and loose with the law. The affair confirmed
                          				suspicions that all the backroom dealings was for political ends,
                          				not national security.<br><br>In any event, Lee assigned Lim –
                          				who, if not for all the machinations, would have been the leader
                          				of the PAP and prime minister – the post of political
                          				secretary in the ministry of finance, the Siberia of politics at
                          				that time.<br><br>In the meantime, detentions without trial
                          				continued under the new Lee government and the ISC continued to
                          				be used as a front for the PAP's acts.<br><br><strong>An indecent
                          				proposal<br></strong><br>Fed-up with Lee's autocratic style and the
                          				delay of releasing the remaining detainees, PAP MP and mayor Ong
                          				Eng Guan denounced the government for its dictatorial methods and
                          				moved a motion in the Legislative Assembly to abolish the ISC.
                          				<br><br>Harper wrote that because of the secrecy under which the
                          				ISC operated "not all members of Lee's cabinet were aware
                          				that the Singapore government had not pressed for the releases
                          				since early 1960."<br><br>In his memoirs, Lee wrote that
                          				"Lim Chin Siong wanted to eliminate the Internal Security
                          				Council because he knew that…if it ordered the arrest and
                          				detention of the communist leaders, the Singapore government
                          				could not be held responsible and be stigmatized a colonial
                          				stooge."<br><br>What the Minister Mentor did not say, but
                          				what Harper reveals in his chapter, is shockingly contradictory:
                          				"In mid-1961, therefore, to seek a way out, Lee suggested to
                          				the British that his government should order the release of all
                          				[the remaining] detainees, but then have that order countermanded
                          				in the ISC by Britain and Malaya."<br><br>Such a craven act
                          				was even rebuffed by the British. The acting Commissioner, Philip
                          				Moore, stated that the British should not be "party to a
                          				device for <strong><em>deliberate</em></strong> misrepresentation of
                          				responsibility for continuing detentions in order to help the PAP
                          				government remain in power." (emphasis added)<br><br>Moore
                          				suggested that the best solution would be "to release all
                          				the detainees forthwith." Lee, however, "was unwilling
                          				to present the left with such a victory." <br><br>In a most
                          				damning indictment, Moore said that Lee "has lived a lie
                          				about the detainees for too long, giving the Party the impression
                          				that he was pressing for their release while, in fact, agreeing
                          				in the ISC that they should remain in detention."<br><br>And
                          				if one thought that Lee Kuan Yew could not sink any lower, he
                          				did. He turned to his saviours and warned that should he lose in
                          				an upcoming by-election, he would call for a general election,
                          				which he fully expected to lose. <br><br>This was because he was
                          				facing defections in the Legislative Assembly on his refusal to
                          				release the remaining detainees. And should he lose the
                          				elections, he warned the colonial masters, David Marshall, Ong
                          				Eng Guan and Lim Chin Siong would form the next government.
                          				<br><br>This, he calculated, would be so distasteful to the
                          				British that it would rally them to his side. <br><br>He
                          				presented the scheme at a dinner with Commissioner Lord Selkirk,
                          				Philip Moore (Selkirk's deputy), and Goh Keng Swee: Lee would
                          				order the release of the prisoners, the British would stop it
                          				through the ISC, and he would then announce a referendum on
                          				merger with Malaya (the story behind merger is explained below).
                          				<br><br>This would provoke opposition from his party mates as
                          				well as Lim's supporters whom he would then banish to Malaya.<br><br>A
                          				1961 memo between the then Commission in Singapore and the
                          				Colonial Office in London revealed that Lee calculated that this
                          				move "would force Lim Chin Siong to reveal his hand
                          				completely and resort to direct action, in which event the
                          				Singapore Government would relinquish power and allow the British
                          				or the Federation to take over Singapore."<br><br>In short,
                          				Lee was willing to sacrifice the efforts to secure the
                          				independence of Singapore to achieve his own political ends!</p>
              <p>As it turned out,
                          				Selkirk wanted to have nothing to do with the "unsavoury"
                          				proposal.<br><br><strong>Merger – on one condition<br></strong><br>At
                          				about this time, Malaya's Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman
                          				revived the idea of a federation of Malaysia consisting of the
                          				Borneo territories (now Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei), Malaya (now
                          				peninsular Malaysia), and Singapore. <br><br>In exchange for
                          				territorial concessions in Borneo, the Tunku as the head of the
                          				federation would allow Britain to maintain a strategic presence
                          				in Singapore.<br><br>The proposal was put forward because the
                          				Tunku was having problems of his own with the left in Malaya.
                          				This was not helped by the strength of Lim Chin Siong's left in
                          				Singapore. Kuala Lumpur saw the necessity of crippling Lim's
                          				support and wanted Lee to be its hit-man. <br><br>For the
                          				British, the idea of a Malaysian federation was an acceptable
                          				compromise because it allowed London to maintain influence in the
                          				region while relinquishing its colony which it was going to lose
                          				anyway given the irresistible anti-colonial sentiment fanning the
                          				globe at that time. <br><br>As for Lee Kuan Yew, the idea was
                          				heaven sent. Harper documents that Lee saw the Tunku's concept of
                          				a "Malaysia" as crucial to his own political survival
                          				because of the growing strength of the left.<br><br>The left's
                          				strength was amply demonstrated when Lee's rightwing faction lost
                          				two by-elections in quick succession – the first to Ong Eng
                          				Guan in April 1961 (Hong Lim) and the second three months later
                          				to David Marshall (Anson). <br><br>Lee was rattled. Then PAP
                          				chairman, Toh Chin Chye, recalled: "He was quite shocked. He
                          				drew me aside after the results were announced and asked me what
                          				to do. I said, 'Hang on!'" <br><br>Toh also revealed that
                          				Lee had written to him that "the trade unions, the Middle
                          				Road crowd wanted him to resign" and that they wanted him to
                          				replace Lee as the prime minister. <br><br>Toh did not recommend
                          				Lee's resignation. But the reason he gave was that it "would
                          				divide the government and it would appear to the people of
                          				Singapore that we were being unsteady," hardly a ringing
                          				endorsement of Lee's leadership.<br><br>These developments
                          				precipitated an open split between Lee and Lim Chin Siong. Lim's
                          				group suspected – correctly – that Lee was up to no
                          				good in his pursuit of merger with Malaysia and they openly
                          				called for the abolition of the ISC.<br><br>In July 1961,
                          				legislative assemblymen, parliamentary/organising secretaries,
                          				and members of the PAP split from the party and formed the
                          				Barisan Sosialis. Lee's party was shaved to bare bones. <br><br>At
                          				the time, Harper writes, "there was an immense political
                          				momentum, a sense that the future lay with the Barisan
                          				Sosialis."<br><br>Even then, Lim Chin Siong never wavered in
                          				his commitment to governing Singapore in a democratic way when he
                          				wrote in a press statement that "any constitutional
                          				arrangement must not mean a setback for the people in terms of
                          				freedom and democracy."<br><br>This contrasts with the PAP's
                          				demonisation of Lim as a front for the communist out to destroy
                          				the democratic way. <br><br><strong>Closing in on Lim<br></strong><br>Meanwhile
                          				In Malaya the Tunku insisted that Lee re-arrest Lim Chin Siong
                          				before he would allow Singapore into the federation. <br><br>One
                          				of the reasons was because if the detention was conducted after
                          				merger, the Kuala Lumpur government would be responsible for it
                          				and it would be seen as cracking down on the Chinese in
                          				Singapore, increasing communal tensions.<br><br>As for Lee's
                          				part, he saw the detention of Lim as his trump card and wanted to
                          				secure the merger first before he moved against the Barisan
                          				leader; Abdul Rahman would have no incentive to proceed with
                          				merger once the threat of Lim was removed.<br><br>But the Tunku
                          				was firm: No detention of Lim, no merger. Lee knew he had to
                          				act.<br><br>And so a two-part plan was hatched to bait Lim and
                          				colleagues: "In the first phase, the Barisan would be
                          				harassed by the police and the government. This was designed to
                          				provoke it into unconstitutional action, which would initiate a
                          				second phase of detentions, restrictions and other actions to be
                          				sanctioned by the ISC."<br><br>Lim's opposition of allowing
                          				the British to retain powers of detention during the
                          				constitutional talks in 1956 rang truer than ever and Marshall's
                          				colourful description of "Christmas pudding and arsenic
                          				sauce" were beginning to sound very apt.<br><br>The
                          				diabolical scheme was vehemently opposed by the British
                          				Commission in Singapore. Lord Selkirk told his superiors in
                          				London that "in fact I believe that both of them (Abdul
                          				Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew) wish to arrest the effective political
                          				opposition and blame us for doing so." <br><br>In the months
                          				leading up to Lim's arrest, Selkirk wrote to his superiors in
                          				London again, imploring them not to cooperate with Lee:<br><br>"Lee
                          				is probably very much attracted to the idea of destroying his
                          				political opponents. It should be remembered that there is behind
                          				all this a very personal aspect…he claims he wishes to put
                          				back in detention the very people who were released at his
                          				insistence – people who are intimate acquaintances, who
                          				have served in his government, and with whom there is a strong
                          				sense of political rivalry which transcends ideological
                          				differences."<br><br>Contrast this to what Lee wrote in his
                          				memoirs in 1998: "Lim Chin Siong…knew that if he went
                          				beyond certain limits, [the ISC] would act…"<br><br>Lim
                          				need not have gone "beyond certain limits" as
                          				declassified documents now reveal, Lee was determined to put him
                          				in prison, communist or not, limits or no.<br><br>More
                          				shamefully, Lee will not admit that he was the one who had pushed
                          				for Lim's detention.<br><br>Selkirk's deputy, Philip Moore,
                          				reviewed intelligence reports and concluded that there were no
                          				security reasons to detain Lim Chin Siong: "Lim is working
                          				very much on his own and that his primary objective is not the
                          				Communist millennium but to obtain control of the constitutional
                          				government of Singapore."<br><br>But London was determined
                          				not to allow democratic scruples from getting in the way of its
                          				strategic presence in Southeast Asia. It acquiesced to Lee's
                          				plan.<br><br><br><em><strong>Part III: The end of Lim Chin Siong<br><br></strong>The
                          				next instalment will examine the treatment of Lim Chin Siong in
                          				Lee Kuan Yew's hands. More evidence of Lim's persecution.</em></p>

              <p><strong>Part
                      					III: The end of Lim Chin Siong</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">9 Jul 07<br><br></span>In
                      					February 1963 the ISC, under the direction of Lee, ordered
                      					Operation Coldstore where 113 opposition leaders, trade
                      					unionists, journalists, and student leaders who supported the
                      					left were arrested. Top of the list was, of course, Lim Chin
                      					Siong.<br><br>Historian Matthew Jones recorded that the arrests
                      					"primarily reflected the imperative felt by the
                      					decision-makers in London to respond to the needs and demands of
                      					the nationalist elites."<br><br>Not for the first time, the
                      					British had come to the rescue of Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>Behind
                      					bars, torture and psychological abuse were meted out in liberal
                      					doses. Amnesty International documented much of this in a report
                      					in 1981. <br><br>The state of Lim Chin Siong under detention
                      					makes for sordid reading. According to (the late) Dennis
                      					Bloodworth, Lim came close to taking his own life while in
                      					detention. He had gone into depression. In 1965, when he was at
                      					the Singapore General Hospital Lim tried to hang himself from a
                      					pipe in the toilet. He was rescued just in time. After he
                      					recovered he was sent back to prison. <br><br>Four years later,
                      					he penned a letter to his former comrade-turned-arch-enemy and
                      					capitulated, saying that he had "finally come to the
                      					conclusion to give up politics for good" and repudiated the
                      					"international communist movement."<br><br>Even then,
                      					Lee banished Lim to London in 1969 and allowed him to return to
                      					Singapore only ten years later.<br><br>What kind of treatment
                      					Lim received at the hands of his foes that turned him from a
                      					spirited and charismatic national leader who walked tall among
                      					his people into a forlorn political non-entity, Singaporeans can
                      					only imagine.<br><br>For Lim is not talking, he passed away in
                      					February 1996, forever carrying his secrets with him to his
                      					grave.<br><br>It was not Britain's finest hour. Far from the
                      					honest-broker that everyone had expected Britain to be, the UK
                      					Government had actively engineered Lim's downfall and Lee Kuan
                      					Yew's capture of the prime ministership. <br><br>As it is, the
                      					historic account is hardly a heroic tale of the PAP's courageous
                      					triumph over the Barisan, as official accounts would have us
                      					believe. <br><br>Instead, declassified documents now show that
                      					it was a sad tale of private dealings and cowardly machinations
                      					for the attainment of power. <br><br>At his funeral which
                      					overflowed with his former Barisan comrades and supporters,
                      					eulogies recounting Lim's selfless dedication to a free and
                      					democratic Singapore were read. As his casket was pushed into
                      					the furnace, a thunderous and defiant applause
                      					resounded.<br><br><strong>Referendum: To merger or to merge?<br><br></strong>After
                      					having fulfilled his promise to Tunku Abdul Rahman to arrest Lim
                      					Chin Siong before merger, Lee set his sights on taking Singapore
                      					into Malaysia. He called for a referendum to obtain the people's
                      					mandate for the move, a decision that Britain and the Tunku
                      					objected to.<br><br>A referendum was hardly necessary as Lim and
                      					other Barisan leaders were behind bars. One suspects that a vote
                      					was needed to give the PAP the mandate to move in this
                      					direction. <br><br>Indeed Lee, with not little false bravado,
                      					wrote in his memoirs: "I remained determined that there
                      					should be referendum." <br><br>Democratic? Hardly. Instead
                      					of asking Singaporeans to vote for ‘yes' or ‘no' to
                      					merger, Lee proposed a ballot that allowed the people to vote
                      					only for merger under three options:<br><br>Do you want
                      					merger?<br>A. in accordance with the white paper, or<br>B. on
                      					the basis of Singapore as a constituent state of the Federation
                      					of Malaya, or<br>C. on terms no less favourable than those given
                      					to the three Borneo territories?<br><br>And so after the
                      					referendum in September 1962, Singapore moved one step closer to
                      					becoming a part of an independent Malaysia. <br><br><strong>Regrettable
                      					but necessary?<br><br></strong>Lee Kuan Yew, would have us believe as
                      					he wrote in his memoirs, that the use of detention without trial
                      					was "most regrettable but, from my personal knowledge of
                      					the communists, absolutely necessary."<br><br>Harper
                      					dismisses this argument: "It was…inadmissible to
                      					argue, as Lee Kuan Yew did, that the exercise of these powers
                      					was ‘regrettable', but dictated by historical
                      					necessity."<br><br>The truth is that "through this
                      					adversity…the Barisan Sosialis still adhered to
                      					constitutional tactics."<br><br>Indeed, in the entire
                      					campaign to cripple the opposition, Lee Kuan Yew and his
                      					rightwing PAP faction has repeatedly resorted to using desperate
                      					measures of detention without trial, brazenly accusing his
                      					opponents of being a front for the communists.<br><br>Harper
                      					makes it even more explicit:<br><br>"After 1959, Lee Kuan
                      					Yew had urged the necessity of defeating the radical left
                      					through open democratic argument, whilst trying to provoke them
                      					into extra-legal action. The left, however, had not been
                      					deflected from constitutional struggle. Therefore, from mid-1962
                      					at least, Lee concluded that this confrontation could only be
                      					resolved by resort to special powers that lay beyond the
                      					democratic process. This merely exposed the extent to which the
                      					crisis, as the British argued, a political one, and not a
                      					security one."<br><br><strong>The last chapter<br><br></strong>Lim
                      					Chin Siong's fight for Singapore may have come to a close, but
                      					another one is just beginning – the fight for history to
                      					be written the way it should be. <br><br>Declassified secret
                      					papers are beginning to provide a glimpse into what really took
                      					place during the 1950s and 60s, especially in the
                      					behind-the-scenes dealings. <br><br>Beginning with <em>Comet In
                      					Our Sky</em> more will be revealed. But as Harper tells us "many
                      					files remain closed and many files that have been released have
                      					had key documents ‘retained' by the original government
                      					department." These include key documents on Lim Chin
                      					Siong's detention in Operation Coldstore in 1963.<br><br>As the
                      					real story emerges, the Singapore Democrats will play our part
                      					to urge this process along – in cyberspace – thus
                      					ensuring that the memory of Lim Chin Siong and what he and his
                      					Barisan colleagues did for Singapore will forever remain with
                      					us. <br><br>This is crucial as our past is still our present.
                      					Lim had argued that arbitrary powers of detention without trial,
                      					in whoever's hands be they white or yellow, will continue to
                      					make Singapore unfree and our struggle for independence elusive.
                      					<br><br>"The people ask for fundamental democratic rights,"
                      					he argued, "but what have they got? They have only got
                      					freedom of firecrackers after seven o'clock in the evening. The
                      					people ask for bread and they have been given stones
                      					instead."<br><br>More than half a century later, can any
                      					Singaporeans say with hand on heart that Lim Chin Siong was not
                      					right?</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1.66in; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><strong>Part
              				IV (final): What they teach in school<br><br></strong>In case
              				you're wondering what they're teaching our kids in school about
              				Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP, take a look at this. <br><br>One
              				textbook for GCE O-level students and approved by the Ministry of
              				Education started off thus:<br><br>"There was always a
              				significant Chinese-educated faction within the party that held a
              				different political view. From its founding, this faction was led
              				by Lim Chin Siong, who adopted violent strategies through riots
              				and street demonstrations. As this division developed, it split
              				the party into two wings: the non-communist wing led by Lee Kuan
              				Yew and the communist wing led by Lim Chin Siong."<br><br>Describing
              				Lee as someone who "championed the causes of ordinary people
              				and gained their trust and respect," the book goes on to
              				enumerate some of Lee Kuan Yew's political activities that
              				brought him to prominence. <br><br>One such activity was Lee's
              				cooperation with the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) who wanted to
              				work with the PAP "because Lee Kuan Yew was reliable and his
              				name inspired confidence." <br><br>The textbook also teaches
              				that the constitutional talks in 1955 happened because as "major
              				leaders such as David Marshall and Lee Kuan Yew both demand[ed]
              				self-government (and merger with the Federation of Malaysia), the
              				British were forced to increase the speed of reforms." <br><br>But
              				the British, apparently, found David Marshall to be a "weak
              				and indecisive <br>leader" and were thus "reluctant to
              				grant self-government to such a leader." This, the text
              				says, was the reason why the London talks in 1955 were
              				unsuccessful.<br><br>Then there was the crackdown on the PAP's
              				leftwing in 1957 after Lim Chin Siong's faction won the
              				leadership of the PAP. The book left us with no doubt that "The
              				communist success in this party election…was achieved with
              				some deception." <br><br>As a result Lee Kuan Yew and five
              				of his closest supporters resigned from the executive offices of
              				the PAP "in disgust" which meant that "the PAP, a
              				legal party, was now captured by the illegal communists."<br><br>The
              				text adds that this was "the classic strategy that the
              				communists called the ‘united front'" and that "this
              				incident explained why the PAP leadership regarded election as
              				serious business even till today." <br><br>Following the
              				resignation of David Marshall, negotiations with the British to
              				grant self-government went much smoother because, with Lim Yew
              				Hock as Chief Minister, prospects of reaching an agreement on how
              				to "deal with the threats posed by the communists" were
              				much better.<br><br>There was no mention of Operation
              				Coldstore.<br><br><br><strong>And the correct answer is…</strong><br><br>Another
              				book, a self-study revision programme for Secondary 2 students
              				"based on the New Syllabus by Ministry of Education",
              				compiled a series of study notes and questions. Correct answers
              				were provided at the back of the book.<br><br><br>Some of the
              				multiple-choice questions went like this:<br><br>I. The
              				______________ in the PAP supported the Communists.<br>(1)
              				radicals <br>(2) liberals <br>(3) proposers <br>(4) proponents.
              				<br><em>Answer</em>: (1) radicals<br><br><br>II. Which statement
              				about the man in the picture is incorrect? [Picture of LKY]<br>(1)
              				He was the one who wrote the Singapore's national Pledge.<br>(2)
              				He was Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959-1990. <br>(3) He
              				changed Singapore from a third world country into a first world
              				state. <br>(4) In 1956, he stood as a PAP candidate in Tanjong
              				Pagar Constituency.<br><em>Answer</em>: (1) He was the one who
              				wrote the Singapore's national Pledge.<br><br><br>III. The party

              <p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1.66in; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>Answer</em>:
              				(c)<br><br><br><br>IV. The PAP had a _________ plan for Singapore
              				and it was an honest party. <br><em>Answer</em>:

              				Yew?<br></strong><br>Students were also asked to read extracts and
              				then answer questions.<br><br><em>Extract A</em>: <br>"And we
              				needed somebody like Lee Kuan Yew, who can be strong and firm
              				when needed to be, to get things done. I think Singapore was
              				fortunate to have men like Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee at the helm
              				in 1965 to do what was needed. It was Lee Kuan yew's' [sic]
              				characteristic [sic] – when you accept to do a job, do it
              				well – or else don't' [sic] accept the position if you are
              				incapable of doing it."<br><br><em>Question 1</em>: <br>In
              				your opinion, to what extent is the above write up true of Lee
              				Kuan Yew correct (sic)? (5 marks)<br><br><em>Answer</em>: <br>I
              				feel the above extract is very true. He was Singapore's first
              				Prime Minister. He held that post from 1959-1990. He is widely
              				acclaimed by Singaporeans and people world over as the architect
              				of Singapore. He is responsible for transforming Singapore into a
              				modern city. He made Singapore stable and secure. He saw
              				Singapore through the years of merger and separation. He fully
              				understood the challenges a small independent nation would face.
              				Singapore had no natural resources. Singapore had limited land.
              				The only asset Singapore had was its people.<br><br>To make an
              				island with any constraints prosper must have been a challenge to
              				him. His philosophy was if you take on the job, you have to do it
              				well without any excuses or "ifs" and "but".
              				If you feel you cannot handle a particular job, then don't take
              				it.<br><br>The Singapore after the Japanese occupation, the
              				Singapore after its separation from Malaysia was one full of
              				problems, full of challenges. He, as Prime Minister, at the helm
              				of the government, was worried but not negative in his thinking.
              				He knew Singapore had to survive as an independent nation and he
              				was determined to make Singapore succeed.<br><br>It is true that
              				we needed someone of Lee Kuan Yew's calibre to steer Singapore at
              				that time. It is also true that Singapore and the people of
              				Singapore were fortunate to have him at the head. What we are
              				enjoying today, all the comforts, high standards of public
              				health, education, housing, transport and communications are all
              				the results of the dedicated, untiring, unselfish work of Lee
              				Kuan Yew and his team of leaders.<br><br><em>Question 2</em>:
              				<br>Enumerate some of the qualities of Lee Kuan Yew that you can
              				infer from the passage. (3 marks)<br><br><em>Answer</em>: <br>Strong
              				character. Firm when one has to be firm. A man with a vision. An
              				optimist. An untiring worker. Determined and dedicated. One who
              				is not daunted by problems or challenges. One who executes
              				whatever job he takes well (sic). One who sets a goal and works
              				towards that goal.<br><br><br><em>Extract B</em>:<br>"Indeed,
              				the traits by which Singaporeans are known today are the very
              				same ones that characterize Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Like the man, the
              				country and its people are known for being pragmatic,
              				law-abiding, hard-working and fond of a clean, clinical
              				environment be it in business rules or physical
              				landscape."<br><br><em>Question 1</em>: <br>What traits of Mr
              				Lee are mentioned in this extract?<br><br><em>Answer</em>: He is
              				pragmatic, law-abiding, hard-working, corruption-free (clean). He
              				is a man of integrity.<br><br><em>Question 2</em>: <br>What is your
              				opinion of the above extract?<br><br><em>Answer</em>:<br>The
              				extract gives a very true picture of Mr. Lee. His government is a
              				clean one. The hand of the law come hard (sic) on those who
              				commit offences or resort to corrupt practices. His hard work is
              				evident in all sectors. We are enjoying a trouble free life
              				because of his hard work. Singapore is clean and green city
              				(sic). The honest leaders have succeeded in attracting foreign
              				investors to invest their money in Singapore. What is more than
              				all these is:- The leaders have set a good example and have
              				passed on all their good qualities to the people of Singapore.
              				Most Singaporeans are hard working, law abiding and honest in
              				their dealings - be it business or personal commitments. I fully
              				agree that all the peace, stability and security that the people
              				of Singapore are enjoying today are the result of our hard
              				working, honest and sincere Prime Minister and his team.</span></p>

              developed, it split the party into two wings: the non-communist
              wing led by Lee Kuan Yew and the communist wing led by Lim Chin
              Siong."<br> <br> Describing Lee as someone who "championed the causes of ordinary
              people and gained their trust and respect," the book goes on to
              enumerate some of Lee Kuan Yew's political activities that brought
              him to prominence.<br> <br> One such activity was Lee's cooperation with the Malayan Communist
              Party (MCP) who wanted to work with the PAP "because Lee Kuan Yew
              was reliable and his name inspired confidence."<br> <br> The textbook also teaches that the constitutional talks in 1955
              happened because as "major leaders such as David Marshall and Lee
              Kuan Yew both demand[ed] self-government (and merger with the
              Federation of Malaysia), the British were forced to increase the
              speed of reforms."<br> <br> But the British, apparently, found David Marshall to be a "weak and
              indecisive<br> leader" and were thus "reluctant to grant self-government to such a
              leader." This, the text says, was the reason why the London talks
              in 1955 were unsuccessful.<br> <br> Then there was the crackdown on the PAP's leftwing in 1957 after
              Lim Chin Siong's faction won the leadership of the PAP. The book
              left us with no doubt that "The communist success in this party
              election…was achieved with some deception."<br> <br> As a result Lee Kuan Yew and five of his closest supporters
              resigned from the executive offices of the PAP "in disgust" which
              meant that "the PAP, a legal party, was now captured by the illegal
              communists."<br> <br> The text adds that this was "the classic strategy that the
              communists called the ‘united front'" and that "this incident
              explained why the PAP leadership regarded election as serious
              business even till today."<br> <br> Following the resignation of David Marshall, negotiations with the
              British to grant self-government went much smoother because, with
              Lim Yew Hock as Chief Minister, prospects of reaching an agreement
              on how to "deal with the threats posed by the communists" were much
              better.<br> <br> There was no mention of Operation Coldstore.<br> <br> <br> <strong>And the correct answer is…</strong><br> <br> Another book, a self-study revision programme for Secondary 2
              students "based on the New Syllabus by Ministry of Education",
              compiled a series of study notes and questions. Correct answers
              were provided at the back of the book.<br> <br> <br> Some of the multiple-choice questions went like this:<br> <br> I. The ______________ in the PAP supported the Communists.<br> (1) radicals<br> (2) liberals<br> (3) proposers<br> (4) proponents.<br> <em>Answer</em>: (1) radicals<br> <br> <br> II. Which statement about the man in the picture is incorrect?
              [Picture of LKY]<br> (1) He was the one who wrote the Singapore's national Pledge.<br> (2) He was Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959-1990.<br> (3) He changed Singapore from a third world country into a first
              world state.<br> (4) In 1956, he stood as a PAP candidate in Tanjong Pagar
              Constituency.<br> <em>Answer</em>: (1) He was the one who wrote the Singapore's
              national Pledge.<br> <br> <br> III. The party symbol of the PAP is __________.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1.66in; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>Answer</em>: (c)<br> <br> <br> <br> IV. The PAP had a _________ plan for Singapore and it was an honest
              party.<br> <em>Answer</em>: comprehensive<br> <br> <br> <strong>What is your opinion about Lee Kuan
              Yew?<br></strong><br> Students were also asked to read extracts and then answer
              questions.<br> <br> <em>Extract A</em>:<br> "And we needed somebody like Lee Kuan Yew, who can be strong and
              firm when needed to be, to get things done. I think Singapore was
              fortunate to have men like Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee at the helm
              in 1965 to do what was needed. It was Lee Kuan yew's' [sic]
              characteristic [sic] – when you accept to do a job, do it well – or
              else don't' [sic] accept the position if you are incapable of doing
              it."<br> <br> <em>Question 1</em>:<br> In your opinion, to what extent is the above write up true of Lee
              Kuan Yew correct (sic)? (5 marks)<br> <br> <em>Answer</em>:<br> I feel the above extract is very true. He was Singapore's first
              Prime Minister. He held that post from 1959-1990. He is widely
              acclaimed by Singaporeans and people world over as the architect of
              Singapore. He is responsible for transforming Singapore into a
              modern city. He made Singapore stable and secure. He saw Singapore
              through the years of merger and separation. He fully understood the
              challenges a small independent nation would face. Singapore had no
              natural resources. Singapore had limited land. The only asset
              Singapore had was its people.<br> <br> To make an island with any constraints prosper must have been a
              challenge to him. His philosophy was if you take on the job, you
              have to do it well without any excuses or "ifs" and "but". If you
              feel you cannot handle a particular job, then don't take it.<br> <br> The Singapore after the Japanese occupation, the Singapore after
              its separation from Malaysia was one full of problems, full of
              challenges. He, as Prime Minister, at the helm of the government,
              was worried but not negative in his thinking. He knew Singapore had
              to survive as an independent nation and he was determined to make
              Singapore succeed.<br> <br> It is true that we needed someone of Lee Kuan Yew's calibre to
              steer Singapore at that time. It is also true that Singapore and
              the people of Singapore were fortunate to have him at the head.
              What we are enjoying today, all the comforts, high standards of
              public health, education, housing, transport and communications are
              all the results of the dedicated, untiring, unselfish work of Lee
              Kuan Yew and his team of leaders.<br> <br> <em>Question 2</em>:<br> Enumerate some of the qualities of Lee Kuan Yew that you can infer
              from the passage. (3 marks)<br> <br> <em>Answer</em>:<br> Strong character. Firm when one has to be firm. A man with a
              vision. An optimist. An untiring worker. Determined and dedicated.
              One who is not daunted by problems or challenges. One who executes
              whatever job he takes well (sic). One who sets a goal and works
              towards that goal.<br> <br> <br> <em>Extract B</em>:<br> "Indeed, the traits by which Singaporeans are known today are the
              very same ones that characterize Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Like the man, the
              country and its people are known for being pragmatic, law-abiding,
              hard-working and fond of a clean, clinical environment be it in
              business rules or physical landscape."<br> <br> <em>Question 1</em>:<br> What traits of Mr Lee are mentioned in this extract?<br> <br> <em>Answer</em>: He is pragmatic, law-abiding, hard-working,
              corruption-free (clean). He is a man of integrity.<br> <br> <em>Question 2</em>:<br> What is your opinion of the above extract?<br> <br> <em>Answer</em>:<br> The extract gives a very true picture of Mr. Lee. His government is
              a clean one. The hand of the law come hard (sic) on those who
              commit offences or resort to corrupt practices. His hard work is
              evident in all sectors. We are enjoying a trouble free life because
              of his hard work. Singapore is clean and green city (sic). The
              honest leaders have succeeded in attracting foreign investors to
              invest their money in Singapore. What is more than all these is:-
              The leaders have set a good example and have passed on all their
              good qualities to the people of Singapore. Most Singaporeans are
              hard working, law abiding and honest in their dealings - be it
              business or personal commitments. I fully agree that all the peace,
              stability and security that the people of Singapore are enjoying
              today are the result of our hard working, honest and sincere Prime
              Minister and his team.</span></p>

              <p>If the answers to the questions above is all no, than i say the textbook is evil. If not, this is like only showing me clips of german soldiers winning battles and concluding that german won the war.</p>
              <p>pure PAP propaganda is bad, but so is pure anti-PAP propaganda.</p>

              who provided the answers to the extract? surely not MOE? 
              
              the textbook i can't say, as i have not seen the secondary 2 history textbook. but i have spoken to history officers in MOE before, who have told me that the instruction from the top down is to promote national education in a more subtle way. 
              
              so, I question if the extracts you have provided are indeed from a self-study revision programme for the history syllabus. pls let us have the book title.

              <p><br>thanks for the links. "comet in the sky" looks very interesting. i've heard many stories abt lim chin siong fr my dad who remembers him when he was politically active. and i've always felt it a pity that singapore history taught in schools has largely forgotten abt pple like him.</p>
              <p>how abt the book where the sec 2 history questions and answers came from? what is the title of this "self study programme" book of questions? in ur earlier post, it's implied tt these questions and answers came direct from MOE. can u clarify if they written by people from MOE, or if they were by an assessment book company based on its interpretation of the syllabus? there is a huge difference. and i hope for the sake of integrity, u will be able to reveal the source.</p>

              <p>it seems tt the "sources" are indeed selectively chosen to put the PAP in a bad light. there's no response to our questions requesting for more info on the history revision questions and answers.</p>
              <p>it's disappointing tt pple who are in the opposition are repeating the very same things tt they loathe in the PAP. :/</p>

              <p>any history, whether written by the victors, or written by the losers, will have to deal wif the criticism of it being subjective.</p>
              <p>and one of the most clear-cut ways to spot an unbalanced account is one without any attempt to address issues tt may contradict the writer's view. an 'a' level GP student can tell u that.</p>
              <p>who is uncle yap in the blog?</p>
              <p>dun get me wrong, i'm nt their supporter. jus someone who feels tt the oppo shld try to be more credible, and provide gd and accurate sources, instead of taking short-cuts like sensationalising history. :/</p>
