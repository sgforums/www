              <p>Actually, there's nothing wrong when LKY decided to seize power, rid PAP of so called "detractors" and govern Singapore. Singapore was still a largely uneducated and swampy area in those times and he surely couldn't have foreseen Singapore becoming first world in one generation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The problem is, he has lost the plot since the 90s and continues to whitewash history and brainwash the young. And as TOC puts it, there really isn't social justice these days. Look at assholes like Teo Ho Pin and one can deduce why.</p>

              Siong vs Lee Kuan Yew: The true and shocking
              history</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><em>It will forever change how you see Lee Kuan Yew and
              the PAP</em></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <div style="float: right; width: 90px;"><img title="Lim Chin Siong" src="http://yoursdp.org/images/stories/limchinsiong.jpeg" alt="Lim Chin Siong" width="90" height="143">
              <p>Lim Chin Siong</p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Introduction<br></strong><br> Schools teach our children that Lee Kuan Yew heroically delivered
              Singapore from the evil clutches of the communists and gave us what
              we have today.<br> <br> Whether such an assertion is historically accurate or not, the
              Government seems intent to seal this version in the annals of
              Singapore. When filmmaker, Mr Martyn See, released Zahari's 17
              Years in which Mr Said Zahari talked about his 17-year detention,
              the Government promptly banned it.<br> <br> It, it stated, "will not allow people who had posed a security
              threat to the country in the past to exploit the use of films to
              purvey a false and distorted portrayal of their past actions and
              detention by the government."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Top-secret documents held by
              the British Government, now declassified, reveal some jaw-dropping
              facts about Lee Kuan Yew and how he came to
              power.<br></strong><br> When Lim Chin Siong, another of Lee Kuan Yew's prisoners, died in
              1996, the PAP was equally anxious to make sure that Lim's portrayal
              as a revolutionary communist remained etched in the minds of the
              people.<br> <br> <img src="http://yoursdp.org/images/stories/SDP_limchinsiong1.jpg" alt="" width="200">In response to a tribute that the SDP had
              written about Lim, the PAP through then MP Dr Ow Chin Hock, said
              that the Barisan Sosialis (Socilaist Front), of which Lim was its
              leader, fought the Government in 1966 "on the streets, according to
              the teachings of Mao Zedong in the Cultural Revolution."<br> <br> It was a bald-faced lie. Lim was already in prison under ISA
              detention in 1966 and could not have led his party in
              anything.<br> <br> This, it seems, was not the only untruth that the PAP has been
              telling us.<br> <br> For example, Dr Ow pointed out that Lim was not fighting for a
              democratic Singapore (the cheek) but a communist one. Lim would
              have turned Singapore into "Mao's China or Ho Chi Minh's Vietnam",
              the PAP insisted.<br> <br> Besides, it was the Internal Security Council (ISC) under the
              command of the British and not the PAP Government, who ordered the
              arrest and detention of Lim and colleagues.<br> <br> <img src="http://yoursdp.org/images/stories/SDP_limchinsiong2.JPG" alt="" width="200">This was because there were only three PAP
              representatives on the ISC and they were "outnumbered" by the other
              four members on the Council, three British and one Malaysian.<br> <br> Nothing could be more untrue.<br> <br> Top-secret documents held by the British Government, now
              declassified, reveal some jaw-dropping facts about Lee Kuan Yew and
              how he came to power.<br> <br> Two history scholars studied these papers and presented their
              findings in the book Comet In Our Sky (available at Select Books at
              the Tanglin Shopping Centre).<br> <br> The first is Tim Harper who teaches Southeast Asian history and the
              history of the British empire at the University of Cambridge in
              London.<br> <br> The second is Greg Poulgrain, a professor at Griffiths University
              in Australia who has been researching Southeast Asian history for
              more than 20 years.<br> <br> This SDP feature presents a summary of Dr Harper's and Dr
              Poulgrain's chapters. It contains some shocking archival
              material.<br> <br> It also attempts to answer questions like who were people like Lim
              Chin Siong and Said Zahari? Did they really pose a security threat
              to the country? Were they communists hell-bent on undermining
              constitutional/democratic means of governance in Singapore? Was it
              really the ISC that was responsible for their arrest and
              imprisonment? Most important, is the PAP's version of history based
              on fact?<br> <br> Remember, this narration is not the SDP's rendition of events past.
              It is a collective summary of the research done by two
              historians.<br> <br> To ensure that this present essay remains faithful to Professors
              Harper's and Poulgrain's works, quotes from the historians'
              chapters are used liberally.<br> <br> Still, don't take our word for it. Get a copy of Comet In Our Sky
              and read for yourself the real history of the PAP and Barisan
              Sosialis.<br> <br> <strong>Why bother?</strong><br> <br> But why is this important? Why should Lim Chin Siong, a man who
              died more than ten years ago and who led a party which is now
              defunct, be relevant to the world in which we now live?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <div style="float: right; width: 150px;"><img title="Lim Chin Siong (right) and Lee Kuan Yew" src="http://yoursdp.org/images/stories/limchinsiong&amp;amp;LKY.jpeg" alt="Lim Chin Siong (right) and Lee Kuan Yew" width="150" height="111">
              <p>Lim Chin Siong (right) and Lee Kuan Yew</p>
              </div>
              <p>First, because those events are part of our history, and history
              defines who we are as a people and, more important, shapes the way
              we plan our future.<br> <br> The textbooks that the Ministry of Education writes for our kids
              are not history but rather fables, starring Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We
              have a duty to teach our youths the truth.<br> <br> Also, what happened in the 1950s and 60s continue to be relevant
              because many of Lim's colleagues are still alive and the sacrifices
              they made for the independence of Singapore have been all but
              erased. Their stories must be told and their honour restored.<br> <br> Third, and perhaps most important, not only is the PAP's cloroxed
              account used to mentally condition (brainwash, if you prefer) our
              children, it continues to be used as a weapon to intimidate and
              silence voices of dissent.<br> <br> If Lee Kuan Yew can manipulate the security apparatus for his own
              political ends in the 1950s and 60 as you will note from Dr
              Harper's and Dr Poulgrain's revelations, what does that say about
              the present use of the ISD to detain other Singaporeans?<br> <br> More ominously, what if the PAP feels sufficiently threatened
              politically and resorts to concocting another conspiracy to detain
              without trial more Singaporeans and opposition politicians like it
              did to a group of professionals in 1987?<br> <br> Hard, historical facts are the greatest antidote to fear mongering
              by the state and to the use of national security as a bogey to
              suppress freedom and democracy.<br> <br> Knowledgeable citizens with a keen sense of history are the best
              protection against acts of repression in the future.<br> <br> So if you are a discerning Singaporean unwilling to let the
              authorities tell you what to think and how to think it, if you are
              one of those who don't want your mind raped, then introduce
              yourself to this four-part Special Feature and take part in the
              forum discussion.</p>
