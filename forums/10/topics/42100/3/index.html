NO! for every strike and riot u see in South Korea, the korean stock exchange goes into a tailspin... does that help? u tell me...<br></div></blockquote>You are right with all these.

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun like NS as much as the next guy, who wants to spend 2 years earning a meagre salary doing something they don't like?<br><br>oh wait, that sounds like alotta ppl out there, working their lives away aimlessly, earning minimum wage, and have no goals in life other than next week's happy hour.<br><br>NS is not about the no u turn syndrome. NUTS is something that many of us have been taught since young, and it is not necessarily a singaporean trait, i'd rather call it a chinese trait, something passed down from our ancestors, if you think about it, it's kinda similar to the ancient views of fillial piety. it's not a good thing, and really needs to go, and this is something that'll take at least 1 generation to change.<br><br>ns is about national security. without defense, a country would be considered unstable, without stability, investors stay away, without investors, what fu[/i]ck economy are you even talking about?<br><br>then again, 2.5 years is really 1 year too long. looking at my friends, they spend a year training, and the rest nua-ing. watever physical training they did during the 1st year goes all to waste after.<br><br>but i still love my country.</div>
