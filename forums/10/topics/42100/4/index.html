Of course i agree, fellowship, friendship, relationship and comradeship can never be bought but have to take time to nuture. I hope you are not implying only NS can help an individual to nuture all this. Even CX had recognised that NS has no monopoly in helping an individual to grow in these fields. Stop glorifying it as if it is the only mean to make a guy grow.<br><br>As for asking me to go back to where i came from, i guess you need to analyse your limitation. If i am not mistaken, FT are welcomed here by your government even if they don want to do NS. If the government conscript them instead, i don't think anyone would come here in the first place. As for citizenship? who would appreciate? I don have it in the first place cos i m just a PR. I guess  PR status worth more than citizen status in the following sense. By converting to sg citizenship, we have to give up our own citizenship and land our next generation in conscription. Which idiot would do that?</div>

One thing that is absolutely, certainly, definitely, for sure, is that the place you originate from was unable to offer you the same perks you are getting now and hence that's why you are here. You do have your right to your own view that NS is bad. In the same context, for us who had gone through NS, there will be a number of us who feel that NS is necessary.

However to us who have been through NS, true friendship is very commonly forged by the common training, s.h.i.t and grind that we went through. Should there be a war, most of us will trust our mates to fight for us so that the person next to us can go home to his family. For you, it will be pathetic that there is no one to do that for you. You might have the means to flee overseas but at the end of the day, you will not know what is truly a home, a country we call our own. For us, home is something precious, belongs to us and no one else, and we will do our utmost to protect it. And NS regardless if it is a blessing or bane, is the tool we will use to achieve that.<br><br>PR to you is precious but that's only applicable to people with your level of mentality. To most of us, local born and bred Singaporean, our country is precious to us and hence all the more most of us will discharge our national service duty without a doubt.<br><br>There is no need for you to go back to where you came from.

That is why we earn from singapore but spent at home, get it? As for NS, that term only applied to singapore and not for most. Please take note that singapore is not the only or the first listed nation for foreign investments. Everywhere else in the world can be your desirable work place not just singapore. E.g. my cousin is working in USA and earning big buck to spent at home. </div></blockquote>Of course I get it, earn big bucks elsewhere and spend at home typical "hidden brain" like you. Do you think we are really that hard up for that few bucks that you have in your pocket? Just think the company you are working has already contributed to our economy, and hence you can keep your spare change (i.e your big bucks).<br><br>As for NS, of course it is Singapore I was talking about. Never in my reply did I state any other countries. Talk about assumptions, maybe you are the one who is not only making assumptions but jumping into conclusions as well. Definitely it is true that other countries perhaps minus plentiful-palm-oil-no-one-wants swine land is a desirable work place. However, what makes them so desirable? That's the crux of this discussion. It is exactly what makes them so desirable that we are talkling about here. Have you wondered what makes us one of the desirable places to live and work in? With your "big" talent  isn't it amazing that you have not figured out? Really felt sorry for your company employing you, kind of a waste of money? Oh, by the way, your cousin working in USA? Do you know that USA has BIG ARMY, BIG NAVY, BIG AIRFORCE and let's not forget BIG GUNS to probably decimate your Lala land up north? What does this tell us? A capable armed force is part of the equation to  a stable political state so as to induce (i.e. promote, encourage etc) foreign investments. Foreign investments generate wealth to a country and create job opportunities which is why you are here and not feeding pigs or plucking coconut or harvesting palm oil to barter in the market (get the pun?). As USA have a large population and most of her armed forces personnel are volunteers there is no need for her to resort to conscription. For Singapore with a limited population, we have to conscript to maintain a capable deterence force. And if conscription is not useful, then why are countries like Israel, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea etc doing that? Oh before I forget, wild boar country up north is also introducing NS soon isn't it? Really pathetic, apart from being copycats, it (not she as wild boar is an animal) aren't capable of any other things.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MYPR:</div><div class="quote_body">Well, That would be admirable but provided you are able to exploit the know how from FT first.

If we don't know, then why are you putting in so many hours of work and in turn producing good results, good returns for our economy? Duh?! Just think we are giving you a slightly bigger peanut, and we get a "professional" haplorhine primate to work for us. I mean that's a bargain , isn't it? You don't have Singaporean colleagues? That's because we are rather busy engaging in feeding the animals which we are exploiting. Of course you are providing facts, I don't deny this. Arrogant...hmm..yes, you are very arrogant. Otherwise, why did you state in your earlier post that you are so "capable", owned your car, announcing your assets, not cheap to employ...blah..blah..blah. Of course in Singapore, most of the unemployed are local. If you go to back to palm-tree-that-you-think-paradise, then most of the unemployed are the citizens there.

            <div class='col-md body'>Gents/<br><br>Just a little background before I start. I am 30 years old, still a young chap and I ORDed back in 97 as a LTA, so I am one of your so-called screwed-up oxcifer currently posted to one of the reserve battalion in 3rd Div.<br><br>It seems that in every single forum, there will be people complaining about having to serve NS. However, this single discussion thread really made me laugh. Imagine, spending all that effort and time from your work that allows you to bring home the bacon to argue so passionately over something as elementary as area-cleaning??<br><br>I don't know, but I have been brought up without a maid. So seriously, I don't know what it is like not having to clean up after my own mess. It has always been a case of after you shit, if you left stains in the toilet bowl, you're responsible for cleaning the toilet bowl. After eating, you're responsible for cleaning your own plates. I don't know, perhaps nowadays all NS boys have their personal maids to do all their cleaning up for them, but for my peers and me, we really don't enjoy the luxury of having a paid maid to pamper us.<br><br>So, what is all this argument about area-cleaning being part of regimentation, the ability to obey orders or even complaints about the government being responsible for making sure that the bunks are clean for the soldiers???? I am totally confused or maybe I am just way too bloody stupid to understand the arguments. You stay in a place, you mess it up, you clean it up. Simple logic. Maybe some people are right by saying that since the government owns the place, then they should be responsible for cleaning it up. However, lets take an analogy. We stay in HDB flats. We don't own the HDB flats, we merely lease it from the government for 99 years at ridiculous prices. So does that mean the government has the obligation to clean our toilet bowls after we take a crap????<br><br>Perhaps maids is an integral part of every young Singaporean's life now. Perhaps that explains why when I went back to ICT, I was so shocked when I realised I can simply dump my plate in the sink and let an old auntie wash. Perhaps that also explains why I was so shocked when I realise that when the rain-pour is too heavy, exercise gets cut immediately. I don't know what all that cat 1 to cat 3 rain stands for, all I know is that war don't end when it rains.<br><br>Perhaps we should just have an entire legion of domestic maids to help us clean our butts when we shit, or better still, to follow us into the field and carry our full packs. That way, we can concentrate on being soldiers and obeying orders and fight, or even better, that is the best way to prevent rape, by having an entire battalion of maids following the active battalion. 1 is to 1 Relative Screwing Power. Hmmmm, maybe I can get a WITS reward by suggesting that. After all, it is so apparent from so many discussions that our new generation soldiers are so used to having maids clean up after them that we should really continue that culture.<br><br>I agree totally with so many of you here that f--ked-up oxcifers like me are totally without personal hygiene and we live like pigs. We should be responsible for cleaning all the toilets, all the bunk areas and have 10 hours stand-by universe. Perhaps then in that case, somebody can take over us when we have to leave our projects halfway at work and inprocess for reservist a week earlier than the men and specialists and then outprocess only after all the men has done so and to stay for debriefing etc etc. Or perhaps, somebody can take over me while I stay up until late at night doing ops planning while the men are sleeping soundly.<br><br>Of course, I'm talking like a f--k up reservist oxcifer. So, please ignore my crap ok.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Well, if so, i can start praising NS for goodness sake but of course i myself will not be stupid enuff to be slave for the government for a pink IC when others can get a similar one freely.</div></blockquote>Of course the truth always hurt. And a couple of us did prick you in the place where you hurt most. You are definitely not a slave for the government, but you are definitely the foolish one to stay and help Singapore's economy gets better. Ouch!!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MYPR:</div><div class="quote_body">After reading all the reply, i guess only soh's msg worth replying.<br><br>The rest of you guys should analyze your own message instead.

Our age has absolutely no bearing on this discussion. It is not that you find it not worth your while in rebutting us, it is just that the fact most of us here can contradict what you say and make you look not like a fool but <span style="color: red;"> <strong>THE FOOL</strong> </span>. Makes me wonder are you <span style="color: red;"><strong>OLD AND SENILE</strong></span> or <span style="color: red;"><strong>YOUNG AND STUPID</strong></span>.<br><br>As for your kid wearing our helmet, don't count your chicken before they hatch. Born somewhere else? Who knows he might end up being a conscript in that Â‘somewhere elseÂ’. And heÂ’ll come home praising and glorifying NS! Poor little MYPR junior, perhaps, youÂ’ll end up measuring his helmet size. So doesn't that mean at the end of the day, you cannot call the place you originated from, your home. Too bad for you, you pathetic little man - dying somewhere else.<br></div>
