As for officers, they do have their own bunk and they do keep it clean. The reason is in discipline. If you don't have the discipline to keep your area clean, then how can you be expect to maintain discipline in operational time. In any organisation, there will be bad sheep, but don't assume that one bad officer or specialist equal to the whole organisation is full of them. And again for your info, my OC often order stand by bunk for officers, specialists and man once every month.<br><br>No one is arguing who has a sense of belonging when cleaning toilet. It is the bloody refusal to do area cleaning because the soldier is lazy to do it that irks me. Who doesn't do area cleaning during his stinct in NS?<br><br>No, I will not shoot the soldier that does not follow order with my M16 but with my carbine. And you did not even understand what I wrote, do you? I said charging an MG position as in attacking it not to take charge of it.<br><br>As what CX has pointed out, you will be surprised at what some parents will do to ensure their precious son does not go through what they perceive as tough training.<br><br>I did say provide the soldiers with cleaning equipment and ordered the soldiers to keep the bunk clean. Tell me is there any soldiers in any armed forces that do not perform area cleaning? If you can point that out, perhaps you can suggest it to Mindef. So what's the big deal in cleaning a toilet after someone use it? There is only 2 ways from what I can see, you either clean it and forget about it, or you clean it, continue to complain and be upset about it and still get to clean it again next time. I for one is not someone who spent my NS days grumbling about the toilet cleaning duties, there are far more better things for me to do.<br><br>I don't need your pity. In fact, I should be the one doing that to you afterall I enjoyed my NS days and still look forward to my ICT.<br><br>I am not an officer at all. I got my 2 stripes within 8 mths into NS. And after my 1st ICT, I got my 3rd stripe. And I still sleep with my platoon mates. There is still no dedicated quarters to specialists and man. So for all your guessing, you are hopelessly wrong. Remember assumptions is the mother of all f.u.c.k-ups.</div>

However, sad to say, there will always be that asshole you mentioned who does not recognise and appreciate the labour and effort in maintaining the toilet. Then again life is sometime like that, just take it in your stride and move on. Someone can grumble, spit, curse and swear but when there is a standby, that person still have to clean it.<br><br>I met some really screwed up officers and my team did got back at them during their navex.

By taking good care of one's quarters is a very obvious reflection of one's self discipline and level of responsibility. It does not matter if other people from other bunks don't do it.

In case the rest of you haven't noticed, nothing is fair in this world.<br><br>With reference to what sillyme has pointed out, as a martial artist myself for 4 years, the senseis and the seniors will always ask me to do things that I don't like or I felt that wasn't part of my training. Of course during the time I always complain it's not fair and stuff like taht. Later I found that what I was going through then, was what they went through before and what my juniors are going through now.

NO! for every strike and riot u see in South Korea, the korean stock exchange goes into a tailspin... does that help? u tell me...<br><br></div>
