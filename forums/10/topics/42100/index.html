It is to instill discipline, foster responsibility as well as to get the soldier to have the habit of keeping his own surroundings clean. The obvious reason being hygiene. Even in a battlefield HQ or resting area, resting soldiers are still required to do area cleaning due to the fact that it is simply a waste of human resources by employing a dedicated company or more cleaners to perform cleaning duties when they can be better utilised as a fighting force.<br><br>Two years is enough for a minimum oversea degree, but the two years of friendship through NS bonding is something you can't get anywhere. From what I know, area cleaning nowadays is a lot less given the fact that outside contractors are brought in to clean up less sensitive areas in the camp. The cleanliness of the bunk is the responsibility of the soldiers. If a soldier is not responsible for his bunk, then how can it be shown that he will be responsible for his action as well as for his own weapons and equipment in operational times?<br><br>A soldier is meant to obey orders. If a soldier questioned about the order of area cleaning, what about if the order to charge a MG position in time of war?
