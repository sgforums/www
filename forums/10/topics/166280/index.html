            <div class='col-md body'>quotes:<br><br>Look, Singapore is its own country that sets its own laws and punishments. Whilst we dont have to agree with them we have no right to tell them what they should be. If they have a mandatory death penalty then so be it. We should respect them for upholding these laws and standing by their convictions. To my mind its a much better system then ours that lets Rapists walk free with the best wishes of the judge. Its about time we got tougher on criminals like they are. Singapore has my total respect.<br><br>I wonder why the Singaporean govt does not consider executing all immediate members of the prisoner's family too? Certainly that would be a greater deterrent to all drug trafficking activities. Maybe we can have the death penalty for chewing gum too, hey, don't you REALLY want to end this menace? &lt;-- lol. crap.<br><br>Give me a break. Singapore is making a strong stand against the trafficking of drugs and must be supported for doing so. Our 'limp-wristed', pro-injecting room advocates just encourage it! As for the 'minutes silence' and Ms (wow, I've just had a baby) Stott-despoja's outburst - back to the Student Union office at Adelaide Uni with you.<br><br>Capital punishment is a barbaric practice, but then Nguyen knew the penalty for being caught trafficking (or possessing) drugs. The media is whipping up a frenzy with talk about having a minute's silence out of respect for Nguyen, and John Howard's 'disgraceful' behaviour in attending a cricket match on the day of the hanging. This prisoner had no regard for the potential effect of his cache of heroin on both users and their family members, and should under no circumstance be hailed as some kind of hero. If you don't want to be convicted of the death penalty in Singapore, don't travel there with drugs. Simple.<br><br>Has anyone checked the Australian Institute of Criminology on the drug related deaths stats recently?<br><br>There were almost 8000 Opiate overdose deaths since 1988!! Thats more than 1 death a day and why is that so, its because people like NVT who brings the drugs into this country.<br><br>Should we have a one-minute silence for every single person too? We have to thank countries like singapore who stops people like him bringing drugs in!!</div>
