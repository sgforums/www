            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Why do you persist in arguing irrationally? I say let individuals decide whether they wish to become addicted to drugs. You say, why not allow weapons into the country? The two issues are not related. You may as well say since I advocate choice on the issue of drugs, why not let people choose to commit rape or not? It is an absurd way to tenuously connect two different issues by citing choice as the factor. </blockquote>As said by u before, u mention tat we should let people have a choice to be hooked onto drugs. Since we r already so liberal as giving people a chance to be hooked onto drugs, might as well give the people a chance to use guns and explosive substance isn't it ? If u understand why we do not give people a chance to use guns and explosive substance, then u will understand why I do not support giving people a chance to be "hooked onto drugs".<br><br><blockquote>Also, I am not advocating people to be addicted to drugs. Substance abuse is undesirable. But it is a growing problem. How does one solve the problem in the best way possible? My contention is that just imposing draconian measures against drug users and traffickers may not be the best way to handle the problem. </blockquote>As I said before, your previous solution will make the situation worse. If we allowed drugs to be imported freely, it will only increase the numbers of addicts by a lot. Do u believe tat the numbers of addicts will inevitable increase if drugs is imported freely ? Is tat desirable for society ?</div>

Why do we banned certain drugs and not others ? It depends on the side effects associated with it and the possibility of being addicted to it. As said by CX, for sleeping pills and panadol, following the doctor orders will result in maximum benefit and minimum side effects. Sleeping pills is relatively controlled stricty in singapore too. I believe some doctors from Grace clinic were prosecuted because they sell out restricted drugs freely.<br><br><blockquote>It may very well be true that when drugs are legalised, there will be more addicts.</blockquote>So it is good for society to have more addicts or less addicts ?<br><br><blockquote>But even if this is so, the benefit of not having to imprison drug abusers should be taken into account.

But do you realise what your attitude towards addicts is? Condemn them before they have committed any criminal acts, aside from taking drugs -- which may or may not be criminal acts -- it's just that as a society, we have chosen to criminalise these acts.<br><br><blockquote>Second, certain drugs r known to give people brain damage (reaction and thinking becomes worse thus result in getting lower end job) , sudden change of emotions and moods (beating up friends and relatives , laugh and cry without reason), and severe health problem including death (hospital bills).

If they insist on going ahead anyway, we should still try to talk them out of it. Or we should send them for medical treatment. Or finally, we have to respect that it's their decision. Why should we make things worse for them by putting them in prison?<br><br>People do all kinds of harmful things to themselves and their families in society. They become depressed, they take alcohol, they kill themselves by smoking, they neglect their children and spouses, they commit adultery etc. Many families are ruined through these and other countless actions. Why aren't they jailed?<br><br>Just jailing? You must be joking. Do you know what it is like to be sent to prison? Do you realise the many repercussions for a person who has been to jail in Singapore? Just jailing indeed.<br><br><blockquote>If u really want to classify, then it is more accurate to classify it as a society problem. BTW wat is your objectives in classifying the problem? </blockquote>Yes, substance abuse is a societal problem. Classifying the problem could be important to understanding the nature of the problem. Whether the act of taking drugs is seen as an individual right, (why can't I do what I want to myself) a medical problem (I cannot help taking it), or a criminal problem (I mean to harm society) could contribute towards a more ideal solution to the problem, rather than throwing people into jail.<br><br><blockquote>They already do it thoroughly in drug rehabitation centres.

We shouldn't just throw them into jail and think the problem is solved. Who sees the heartaches and pain they experience once they get out of jail and try to re-start their lives? But who put them into jail in the first place? And for what? Consuming addictive substances? And for this they deserve their lives to be ruined?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>We could be addicted to all kinds of stuff. One thing for sure, it is better to have less prisoners, especially those who are in prison not because they are criminals, but because they are drug addicts. </blockquote>Drug addict r much worse than other form of addicts. Do u agree with this statement ? U still haven't answer tis question... is it better to have more or less drug addicts in a socety ?<br><br><blockquote>What offence have they committed? Consuming addictive substances? What sort of offence is that, really?  </blockquote>This argumant can be applied to guns and explosive substance again isn't it ? Why give the death penalty to people who just had possession of firearms ? Why punish people who had possession of explosive substance ? They just had possession of these prohibited items and had not kill anybody with it isn't it ? Why punish them when they just possess it ?<br><br>The answer is, do u really have to see the end effects before acting ? Isn't it the duty of law to prevent crimes from happening instead of just punishing offenders ? Do u want to see streets filled with drugs addicts or they r forced to commit crimes before we catch them. Isn't the harm already done ?<br><br><strong>BTW they had already abetted the crime of knowing or buying thus suporting a drug trafficker and do not disclose tis information to the police. Tat by itself is another crime. It is the same as passing a knife to a person who want to commit murder. </strong><br><br><blockquote>Why not jail alcoholics? sex addicts? tv addicts?</blockquote>Is sex banned ? Is TV banned ? Is alcohol banned ?<br><br><blockquote>If drugs do damage, people should be told about them. If they insist on going ahead anyway, we should still try to talk them out of it. Or we should send them for medical treatment. Or finally, we have to respect that it's their decision. Why should we make things worse for them by putting them in prison? </blockquote>First, people r told about them through education, advertisement and campaigns. Second, if u volunteer to go to a drug rehab center, u will get no criminal records no matter how many times u need to go there. A lot of warning has been given out too. Everyone can make their own decisions, but they had to be prepared to pay a price for it. Buying drugs is a way of supporting drugs.<br><br><blockquote>Just jailing? You must be joking. Do you know what it is like to be sent to prison? Do you realise the many repercussions for a person who has been to jail in Singapore? Just jailing indeed. </blockquote>Compared with the above examples I had made, how bad is jailing compared with drugs ? Not only r u going to end up with a worse job (brain damage is permanent. If u get a criminal record at least your brain is still alive and u can make a comeback or learn new skills) and bad reputation than jailing, u r going to hurt your family and friends physically, mentally and waste away all their resources<br><br><blockquote>Yes, substance abuse is a societal problem. Classifying the problem could be important to understanding the nature of the problem. Whether the act of taking drugs is seen as an individual right, (why can't I do what I want to myself) a medical problem (I cannot help taking it), or a criminal problem (I mean to harm society) could contribute towards a more ideal solution to the problem, rather than throwing people into jail. </blockquote>So now u and I agree it is a society problem. So now wat ?<br><br><blockquote>Education is ongoing. We cannot have enough of it. Drug addicts are people too you know.  </blockquote>How much further do u think the Gov should educate people ?<br><br><blockquote>We shouldn't just throw them into jail and think the problem is solved. Who sees the heartaches and pain they experience once they get out of jail and try to re-start their lives? But who put them into jail in the first place? And for what? Consuming addictive substances? And for this they deserve their lives to be ruined? </blockquote>We can see it from another perspective.<br><br>Who sees the heartaches and pain of their family members when people r poisoned to death due to taking of prohibited drugs. Who can see the problems of people who suffered from permanent brain and health damage in adapting to society caused by taking of drugs. Why r there drugs around tat ruin their lives ? They could have been healthy individual tat can contribute more to society. Why do people have to tolerate crimes committed by drug addicts ? Do u see the pain and anguish felt by the victims over their loss of possession and sometimes love one due to drug abuse ? The victims had done nothing wrong at all, why do they deserve to suffer tis fate ?</div>

When an addict is imprisoned, that punishment is imposed by the law. What right does the law have to impose such punishment on an act that does not do anyone else direct harm?

Lets use the example u have given of a TV addict. If u deprive him of TV, he will only feel miserable mentally. He feel itching to watch TV, think nothing but TV and etc. For drugs, not only r they tormented mentally such as desiring for the high or floating feeling, they r also physically tormented by the drug withdrawal effects.

Is society better with lesser drugs tat will cause brain damage, health ailments and crime laden streets ? Let's put it simply... is society better off with smarter, healthier and safer people ?

Do anyone do any wrong to other people just by merely having possession of it ? No, but the law still lable them as criminal offences because they want to prevent it from using it against the benefit of society. I am talking about the rational of writing laws such as possession of drugs and firearms, not talking about the potential committing of crimes by drug addict.

(entertainment)<br>Is there any good benefit tat can be derived from taking drugs ?<br>(nope)<br>Wat is the percentage of people tat will be addicted to TV when they watched it ? (1 in a million bah)<br>Wat is the percentage of people tat will be hooked onto drugs when they ingest it ? (should be pretty high... 1 in 2 ?)<br>Wat is the problem of withdrawal of drugs compared with TV ?<br>(as stated in earlier passage)<br>Wat is the side effects of drugs compared with TV ? (Drugs: brain damage, hazard to health, prone to crimes... TV: bad eyesight, waste of time)<br><br>Drugs is a total new ball game altogether.<br><br><blockquote>For ingesting something that harms yourself, you get to go to jail. We are so used to this that we do not see how absurd this law is. </blockquote>For possession of a controlled drugs before u take it, for failing to report to authorities when one know of potential drug dealers, for supporting the drug industry to flourish.<br><br><blockquote>No matter how much damage drugs does to a person, then damage is self imposed.

In general, the more freedom the better, as long as the freedom does not impinge on the rights of others. </blockquote>First I have to state again tat u get a chance to prevent being imprisoned by going through drug rehab.<br><br>Second, I got to ask again does possession of firearms cause any hurt to any people ? It is only after u have used it to kill someone before it had caused harm to other people isn't it ? If u acknowledge why firearms need to be controlled strictly, then u should realise why drugs have to be controlled as well. Possession of firearms does not impinge on the rights of others too isn't it ? They have not fired any shots from it, how can u claim they will fire it off and harm any person ? A cardinal principle of law is presumption of innocence. Unless a person criminally harms others, he shouldn't be treated as a criminal. It is erroneous to make the connection, whether justifiable or not, that possession fo firearm are likely to commit crimes, and then jail them for the crimes they have yet to commit.<br><br><blockquote>At the bottomline, you need to respect the freedom of each individual to live the life he wishes to live.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's bring this discussion to a close so that we don't keep going round and round the mulberry bush.<br><br>Firstly, it's irrational to link drugs and weapons. Thought this point is obvious, but some people just don't get it. Supporting a more liberal drug policy does not mean supporting a more liberal policy towards arms. There is nothing illogical or inconsistent about wanting a more liberal policy towards drugs and continuing to support our strict stance against weapons possession.<br><br>Next, there is the common argument that substance abuse is bad because not only does it harm the user, it also affects his family and society at large. It is therefore justifiable to imprison substance abusers.<br><br>The above argument is fallacious because many actions of humans affect others adversely but we do not imprison these people for such actions.<br><br>As for the justification that substance abusers should be imprisoned because drug taking hurts the abusers, my contention is that the cure is worse than the disease because of the very real repercussions of imprisonment. At the bottomline, we should respect the right of the individual to live his life so long as he does not directly harm others.<br><br>Finally some people think it is a big deal that drug users should be punished because they have broken the law by possessing drugs and you can't consume drugs without first possessing them. This way of thinking overlooks the fact that we have consciously chosen to criminalise drug possession and consumption. But is it rational to do so in the first place is the question I raised.<br><br>This shall be my last post on the topic. It has been an interesting discussion.

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, the using of weoponary is an analogy. However there r some people tat refuse to accept tis explanation and totally refuse to think in such a manner. I have explained many times tat if u accept and understand why do we impose some extreme measures in terms of weoponary, then they will realise why do we have such a firm stand against drug. However some people just refuse to treat it as an analogy and blindly accuse me me linking 2 irrelevant topics together. The keyword I need to emphasis is "ANALOGY"<br><br>Next we mention the problems drug brought to our society. It has been tediously argues tat the negative effects of drugs is far more destructive compared with other negative society norms or other forms of addicts. However there r some tat insist it is no less harmful than TV addicts which in my opinion, is like comparing the size of an ant to an elephant. Many explanations have been given on the destructive nature of drugs, which sad to say seems to be ignored. One even feel tat having more drug addicts is not necessary a bad sign for society jus because society isn't perfect.<br><br>On the part about having "the cure being worse than the diesease", I have mentioned tat drug takers r given one chance to kick the habit in drug rehab centres. They r already well educated and free of drugs when they leave the centres. Those who goes to jail r the ones who still take in drugs after they r released. The diesease if left unhandled, is certainly more harmful than the drugs. I hjave stated many times tat drugs can cause brain damage which will in turn let the addict to have poorer job too. Drugs also end up hurting their health badly which may requires the addicts to take long term medication or even death. Isn't tat already worse than just being jailed ?<br><br>We cannot acknowledge all the rights in the world. If we do not prohibit drug addicts from taking drugs, then we will have a hard time combatting tis problem. Again I will use an analogy about weoponary here. Mere possession of firearms is a very serious offence tat can be punished by death. R we respecting the rights of these individuals here ? If u understand why do we ignore the rights of the individual in tis case, then u will realise the answer to your question.<br><br>Drugs is a severe problem of society if left unhandled. The Gov had banned prohibited drugs from entering the country to protect the people here. Since it is a banned substance, then won't it be illegal to have possession of it ? Even chewing gums is banned in singapore. If someone is found to have in possession of some chewing gums, then they too get punish by having the gums confiscated. Why is it so hard to understand why do we punish people who had possession of drugs ? Clearly if an individual had possession of drugs, they can influence others easily into being an addict by passing it to them isn't it ? Isn't tat the same as harming more people ?<br><br></div>

What is interesting to ask is whether harsh penalties against drug addiction is a good (though never perfect, cos nothing is perfect) solution to the problem.<br><br>Is the war against drugs being won in Singapore? It seems not, judging from the number of people still addicted to them. America also institutues tough penalties against drug users and traffickers, and America's prisons are filled to overflowing with drug-user inmates who, in the view of many, have committed victimless crimes.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The Europeans have taken a radically different approach to the problem. The attitude towards drug use is much more liberal and they close one eye to (and in some cases even legalise), the use of soft drugs such as marijuana and ecstasy. We would think that European society would go to the dogs by now, but no, life still goes on.</span><br>We could learn a lot from the American and the European attitude towards the drug problem.<br><br>Perhaps we should simply legalise all drug usage, allowing individuals to decide whether they wish to be addicted. This may not seem as outrageous as it appears. We leave it to individuals to decide whether they wish to consume alcohol or cigarettes, which are both addictive substances as well, after all. If all countries do this, the black market for drugs would disappear overnight, and the link between drug abuse and crime would be practically severed.<br><br>Still, difficult for Singapore government to let go because it does not trust in the wisdom of the populace enough and deems any relaxation of the drug policies as anathema to the nation. Part of the price of belonging to a small nation with almost no natural resources perhaps. We are a paranoic people.</div></blockquote>The Swiss carried out a social experiment called Needle Park abt ten years ago. It failed miserably.
