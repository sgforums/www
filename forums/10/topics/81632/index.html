            <div class='col-md body'>The root of the drug problem is not the traffickers; it is the producers.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>NYT June 3 2004 OP-ED<br><br>North Korea's Drug Habit<br>By VICTOR CHA and CHRIS HOFFMEISTER<br><br>Reaction to last month's meeting between Junichiro Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister, and Kim Jong II, the North Korean leader, was nothing short of underwhelming. Critics said Mr. Koizumi gave up too much Â— millions in medical aid and thousands of tons of rice Â— to secure the return of five children of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea more than two decades ago. He also failed to obtain a definitive commitment from Mr. Kim to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons programs.<br><br>The critics notwithstanding, Mr. Koizumi's diplomacy should be judged a success. The lesson the United States and Japan should learn from it is that moderate pressure on the North Korean regime works Â— and can be used to limit the North's ambitions not only in weapons development but also in the drug trade.<br><br>After all, Japan has been pressing for the release of its citizens and their relatives since the day two years ago when Kim Jong Il admitted North Korea had kidnapped them. Yet it was not until Japan made clear it was prepared to curtail trade with the North Â— cutting off financial remittances to the North, imposing an import ban on North Korean goods, banning Japanese ships from making North Korean ports of call Â— that North Korea made any concessions.<br><br>International commerce is clearly important to North Korea, and threats of trade sanctions obviously get the regime's attention. Yet there is an even better reason for the United States and Japan to employ this strategy: there is increasing evidence that in recent years <strong>North Korea has expanded its role as producer, shipper and trafficker of narcotics throughout East Asia and Southeast Asia.</strong><br><br>According to the Pacific Forum of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Pyongyang has directed North Korean farmers to produce opium poppies since the late 1970's, with cultivation areas expanding exponentially in recent years. These farms are thought to produce as much as 40 tons of opium annually. Government-subsidized factories process the opium into heroin, which is then distributed through companies and diplomatic conduits. According to some sources, North Korea now ranks among the world's largest opium and heroin suppliers.<br><br>Because the North Korean state is so secretive, it is difficult to prove any direct links between the regime and drug trafficking. But there is some evidence that the government may be taking over and enlarging the trade, as it has done in other areas of the North Korean economy. A 2003 report from the Congressional Research Service cited nearly 50 arrests or drug seizures involving North Koreans in more than 20 countries since the early 1990's, with at least 11 documented cases involving North Korean diplomats or intelligence agents. In the last five years, both Russian and German police have detained North Korean diplomats on counterfeiting or heroin smuggling charges. And between 1999 and 2001, more than one-third of all drug seizures by Japan and China were methamphetamines en route from North Korea.<br><br>This problem is likely to get worse. In part, this may be the unintended consequence of other diplomatic policies. The American-led Proliferation Security Initiative, for example, which began almost two years ago and aims to block trade in nuclear and other weapons, may have caused Kim Jong Il to rely on drug trafficking and counterfeiting to try to compensate for lost revenues. North Korea's foray into illicit activities has been further spurred by United States efforts at taking customers like Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen and Libya off North Korea's missile sales roster, which has cut the North's revenues in this area to one-tenth of their usual volume.<br><br>As they continue their on-again, off-again diplomacy, the United States and Japan may find that North Korea's drug trade is a more visible component of the regime's threat. The good news, for the United States and its allies, is that the North's growing drug threat means that diplomacy aimed at eliminating its missile exports is working. The bad news, for North Korea, is that continued drug trafficking is not likely to be tolerated by the region.<br><br>If it continues to increase its trade in drugs, North Korea is likely to become the eventual target of a regional initiative to restrict the drug trade Â— which, in conjunction with the American-led curbs on its weapons trade, will put moderate yet deliberate pressure on North Korea. And if Japan's recent experience with abductees is any indication, such patient but comprehensive diplomacy may be the key to attaining Mr. Kim's flexibility on nuclear disarmament.<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/03/opinion/03CHA.html?th" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/03/opinion/03CHA.html?th</a></div>

One thing that Henry Ford learnt when he invented the assembly line was that as long as a supply is present, you can always create a demand, no matter how hard. Remember, the point about this is that teh Death Penalty looks like the miracle cure, and traffickers are supposed to sell drugs to innocent, pure people, but the other aim of this business is to sell drugs to drug abusers. In the USA (and most probably in SEA), addicts are given drugs as salary if they act as subsidiary pushers. You execute the subsidiaries, the Big Boss goes away unharmed; the most damage you do to him is irritation.<br><br>As an example, look at Microsoft. Israel's and China's rejection of it gave it a shock, but the real thing that sent it reeling was the recent EU condemnation of its business practices.<br><br>the pikamaster<br></div>

This may not seem as outrageous as it appears. We leave it to individuals to decide whether they wish to consume alcohol or cigarettes, which are both addictive substances as well, after all. If all countries do this, the black market for drugs would disappear overnight, and the link between drug abuse and crime would be practically severed.<br><br>Still, difficult for Singapore government to let go because it does not trust in the wisdom of the populace enough and deems any relaxation of the drug policies as anathema to the nation.

You say, why not allow weapons into the country? The two issues are not related. You may as well say since I advocate choice on the issue of drugs, why not let people choose to commit rape or not? It is an absurd way to tenuously connect two different issues by citing choice as the factor.<br><br>Also, I am not advocating people to be addicted to drugs. Substance abuse is undesirable.
