              <p>good morning, guess we have to go through this debate here again...</p>
              <p>all i did was listed out the advantage of us Chinese, Indians, Malays, Others living here in Singapore. i did not say it's due to our government entirely. i never implied that we have no natural disaster because of PAP.</p>
              <p>first issue; crime rate. Johor Bahru itself isn't 20 times bigger than Singapore but look at the crime rate. it's reputation precedes itself.</p>
              <p>second; you mentioned SPF... guess you must have a bad experience with them but still, we are looking at a very safe country compared to our neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p>third; i have not used Australia as a main competitor but seriously, though some areas are less prone to racism, we know we will be treated a little different there by the whites. i've been to Brisbane as a tourist and i can assure you, you can really feel the difference in treatment.</p>
              <p>fourth; income taxation at 42% and GST at 10%? woah! if you earn less than $30,000 in Singapore, no tax. period.</p>
              <p>fifth; "In sg is u can only do something if they allow you to. In Oz, u can do anything you want unless they say you can't." - i see no difference. if they don't allow you to steal in Singapore, are you saying that you can do that in OZ?</p>
              <p>sixth; you mentioned that Singaporeans have no rights? then fight for it! if you feel that you have been wronged by the minions of the government, seek redress instead of letting them walk over you. but get your facts right first and if you feel you've been short-changed, go f*ck somebody in that chain of command. you can write to newspapers, forums, Stomp, see your MP and make lots of noise. i assure that you will be heard.</p>
              <p>i am not saying Australia is not a good country. it's perfect for retirement! i am also planning to move there one day but not at our prime and not when there is work to be done here on Singapore's politics. if you read my posts, you will see that i'm calling for the youths of Singapore to get involved in politics and try to change our systems if they feel that some policies are not beneficial to the growth of Singapore.</p>

              <p>third; i have not used Australia as a main competitor but seriously, though some areas are less prone to racism, we know we will be treated a little different there by the whites. i've been to Brisbane as a tourist and i can assure you, you can really feel the difference in treatment.</p>
              <p>fourth; income taxation at 42% and GST at 10%? woah! if you earn less than $30,000 in Singapore, no tax. period.</p>
              <p>fifth; "In sg is u can only do something if they allow you to. In Oz, u can do anything you want unless they say you can't." - i see no difference. if they don't allow you to steal in Singapore, are you saying that you can do that in OZ?</p>
              <p>sixth; you mentioned that Singaporeans have no rights? then fight for it! if you feel that you have been wronged by the minions of the government, seek redress instead of letting them walk over you. but get your facts right first and if you feel you've been short-changed, go f*ck somebody in that chain of command. you can write to newspapers, forums, Stomp, see your MP and make lots of noise. i assure that you will be heard.</p>
              <p>i am not saying Australia is not a good country. it's perfect for retirement! i am also planning to move there one day but not at our prime and not when there is work to be done here on Singapore's politics. if you read my posts, you will see that i'm calling for the youths of Singapore to get involved in politics and try to change our systems if they feel that some policies are not beneficial to the growth of Singapore.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>==== errm...i beg to differ. Lower tax rates &amp; no tax rates is not necc a good thing. Why do we have low tax rates ? Bcos if you raise it higher, the rich will fly out of the country - duh...you think its for the benefits of the citizens? \</p>
              <p>Think twice, from beginning, we are run like a company - the objective is to generate profits - in terms of taxes and revenues. Thats why the government have to use instruments like income tax and company tax to attract the high-earners and multinational companies to invest here. Too high a tax rate, people will fly the flock. Australia have high tax rates but what is their national &amp; average pay? And although Australia have high unemployment rate - they can survive without a job. Land is cheaper there, you can own a land, build a ranch and rear some animals, grow vegetables and be sustainable and lead your own carefree life.</p>
              <p>Regarding rights - sure, each country, based on its requirements do sometimes set what is required and what is not. Perhaps, at the onset of independance where we are facing uncertainties and the unity &amp; obedience of the people are required, we may be strict and draconian. But overtime, as the society progress, things change and so do policies. With Internet and blogs, no matter how you try to stifle, we are still able to get news and listen to views that may not neccessarily be plesant to the ears of the government. Things like porn are so accessible nowadays that its like having no censorship. The thing is, must the government continue to have a heavy hand in shutting off opposition views and suing them for defamation for every single word uttered?</p>
              <p>Their actions speak for itself and they shld let the people decide whether or not they are trustworthy. The effects of this "stifling" style is already showing - in this competitive environment where creativity and innovation wins the bread, we find ourselves sorely lacking to compete amongst others - our education and training all along is to execute perfectly not to create. Now, the education minstry is trying to turn the direction but sadly its slow and probably take longer than this generation.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Eh let's be reasonable here. We're a country that's just 43 years old, this "stifling" style was valid in a country of diverse cultures and languages with a rather high illteracy  rate. It did help produce the workforce to sustain Singapore up to this point.</p>
              <p>I work in the creative industry so i'm kinda annoyed when people assume that creativity and innovation can just be conjured out in a system. By its very nature, a system cannot produce creativity and innovation it can only produce a higher average and people to maintain and to slightly improve the system. That's why mavericks like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs drop out of school.</p>
              <p>We like to go on about these rag to riches stories. But let's be realistic, how many unknown failures were there?  How many people failed to produce 1 Bill Gates? By the rules of probability America had a 100 times better chance compared to us. They say Singaporeans aren't creative enough to create successful entrepreneurs, maybe we did had a lot who tried, but simply failed  </p>
              <p>Schools take up 8 hours of our day 5 days of the week (With CCA and such maybe more). The rest of the time is spent with friends and families. Why is it we feel that an education system would play a bigger part in who we are?   </p>
              <p>People say the Japanese are creative and innovative, but it's because they have a culture of striving for perfection and strong personal discipline. Culture is simply not something you can build in even 5 decades, even with the immense access of information from the internet. Because how we interpret and deal with that information is already formed when we were children. The same with our parents and their parents.</p>
              <p> To be fair, LKY has done an incredible job with the educational system thus far. It has create a strong middle class who can make better choices. Given history, there was so much things that could go wrong along the way. So give the old man his due and stop raving about his mistakes.</p>
              <p>Who can truthfully claim he has not done more good than bad?</p>

              <p>True, but consider that Singapore started off with diverse culture, religion and races who are historically hostile or unfriendly with each other. How many things could have gone wrong from the experience of history?</p>
