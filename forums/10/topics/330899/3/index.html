              <p>LKY is like a father who nurtured us, taught us, fend for us and carried us during the early years of independence. but now we have grown up and our wings have developed. we know what we want and we know what is right. we want our voices heard but we complained that no one listens . </p>
              <p>there are many ways to improve the political situations in Singapore. join the PAP and change them from the inside. it may take time but still, you are involved. or next, join an opposition and start the ball rolling.

              <p>think about it..y the SPF didn't clear out the illegal stuffs on geylang or wherever..the more u clear and restrict them..the more these things will come and will be harder to control..now at least geylang is still within their control and everything is concentrated there...have u not comprehend strategies before..?sometimes to gain power is to grant power..ponder upon it..</p>
              <p>i'm a driver..and i drive and speed too..but look on the roads..have u gone on the roads..?don't u know that it's harder to spot a speeding merc than a speeding truck..?a truck's limit is 60km/h..if it's travelling at 90..u will know it straightaway..but a merc travelling at 110..10km/h above the "catchable" speed for TP...i'm a driver for so long and i still can't realli judge it at all...and have u drove a heavy vehicle before..?u know the physics of it..?i drove a fully loaded van before..it doesn't have the computerized braking system..suspension system..nor airbags...a speeding truck is like an unstoppable train..which one will u catch..~?</p>

              <p>One of the great leaders of the 20th century was Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minster of Singapore from 1965 until 1990. Under Mr Lee’s leadership Singapore was transformed from being a sleepy third world island nation with rather dismal prospects of even surviving as a city nation state into a thriving Asian tiger economy.</p>
              <p>How was this accomplished? Can the effort be duplicated by larger more populated nations?</p>
              <p>The answer to the first question is that from the beginning of Lee Kuan Yew’s term in office he insisted that whatever economic activity that Singapore engaged in must make <a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia; position: relative;">economic</span></span></a> sense and rather quickly make profits. He insisted that <a href="http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/news/news/2000/lee_kuan_yew.htm"><span style="color: #3c657b;">Singapore find it’s own way</span></a> and not blindly follow in the footsteps of other nations. Thus while Singapore was in many ways run as a socialist society the state owned enterprises had to quickly prove themselves by being profitable.</p>
              <p>An example of this is Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines was profitable against all odds because even thought state owned it made it’s own rules for operating and frequently did things totally out of the ordinary compared toÂ airline industry norms.</p>
              <p>Singapore replaced it’s aircraft fleet far earlier in the operation cycle compared to other airlines. And people the world over preferred to fly on Singapore Airlines because for one thing it’s fleet was fresh and extremely well maintained.</p>
              <p>The cabin crews were trained longer than at other airlines. They were young, attractive, could speak several <a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia; position: relative;">languages</span></span></a>, and attentive. The “Singapore Girl” with their excellent service became the standard for excellence in the airline industry.</p>
              <p>Another example of Lee Kuan Yew’s enlightened leadership is that while the majority of housing in Singapore was build by state owned enterprises rental of the properties was discouraged. Instead the apartments were sold to Singapore residents and the decline so often seen in the condition of state owned rental properties worldwide was completely avoided. The new home owners took pride in their homes, their communities, and in Singapore.Â </p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew knew that to attract world leaders in business to set up operations in Singapore you needed a well trained disciplined work force, a friendly business regulatory environment, the free exchange and ability to repatriate currencies, English speaking workers, and a viable banking system and good <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia; position: relative;">infrastructure</span></span></a>, especially in transportation and communications. With great foresight andÂ careful planning all of these things were provided by Singapore.</p>
              <p>Can Singapore’s and Lee Kuan Yew’s example be followed by other nations? Of <a id="KonaLink5" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.articlediscovery.com/blog/2007/02/09/leadership-in-singapore-lee-kuan-yew/#"><span style="color: #3c657b;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 8.3pt; font-family: Georgia; position: relative;">course</span></span></a>, it is possible, even on a much larger scale. But first you need excellent enlightened leadership.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the world of today seems to have a critical shortage of qualified leadership along with enough competent bureaucrats to help plan and to oversee the implementation of the necessary efficient government infrastructure.</p>
              <p>In order for economic development to take place that is up to the standard set by Singapore you must not politicize the development process. Ministers and high ranking bureaucrats must be empowered because of their competence, not their political connections. Witness the mess that the US has made out of their occupation of Iraq to see the truth behind that statement.</p>
              <p>Today Dubai, UAE is probably the world’s leading center for new economic development. I feel certain that Dubai’s leaders spent a considerable amount of time researching the progress made by Singapore under the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              <p>good morning, guess we have to go through this debate here
              again...</p>
              <p>all i did was listed out the advantage of us Chinese, Indians,
              Malays, Others living here in Singapore. i did not say it's due to
              our government entirely. i never implied that we have no natural
              disaster because of PAP.</p>
              <p>first issue; crime rate. Johor Bahru itself isn't 20 times
              bigger than Singapore but look at the crime rate. it's reputation
              precedes itself.</p>
              <p>second; you mentioned SPF... guess you must have a bad
              experience with them but still, we are looking at a very safe
              country compared to our neighbouring countries.</p>
              <p>third; i have not used Australia as a main competitor but
              seriously, though some areas are less prone to racism, we know we
              will be treated a little different there by the whites. i've been
              to Brisbane as a tourist and i can assure you, you can really
              feel the difference in treatment.</p>
              <p>fourth; income taxation at 42% and GST at 10%? woah! if you earn
              less than $30,000 in Singapore, no tax. period.</p>
              <p>fifth; "In sg is u can only do something if they allow you to.
              In Oz, u can do anything you want unless they say you can't." - i
              see no difference. if they don't allow you to steal in Singapore,
              are you saying that you can do that in OZ?</p>
              <p>sixth; you mentioned that Singaporeans have no rights? then
              fight for it! if you feel that you have been wronged by the minions
              of the government, seek redress instead of letting them walk over
              you. but get your facts right first and if you feel you've been
              short-changed, go f*ck somebody in that chain of command. you can
              write to newspapers, forums, Stomp, see your MP and make lots of
              noise. i assure that you will be heard.</p>
              <p>i am not saying Australia is not a good country. it's perfect
              for retirement! i am also planning to move there one day but not at
              our prime and not when there is work to be done here on
              Singapore's politics. if you read my posts, you will see that i'm
              calling for the youths of Singapore to get involved in politics and
              try to change our systems if they feel that some policies are not
              beneficial to the growth of Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>well, its an open forum, and a friendly discussion :). What we say here won't improve or change anything.<br><br>I agree with you on the racism part.. in fact, i'm in oz currently. still quite new to how they do things... but its quite obvious, I can feel it sometimes from the way they talk. still, there are certain rights to protect. I can buy a printer, or a vacuum cleaner, and bring it back the next day saying I'm not satisfied with its performance, and they refund the money right on the spot regardless. In SG, don't mention refund. Just to claim warrenty also have to go thru so many procedures, then they give all sorts of excuse.. <br><br>Regarding the "In sg is u can only do something if they allow you to. In Oz, u can do anything you want unless they say you can't.", to quote one example:<br>there was this woman who parked her car in a plot of unmarked land beside the road and got a summon for it. She brought it up to the town council, saying that since there was no sign that says she couldn't park, or that she needed to pay, then she shouldn't need to pay.<br>And her ticket got waivered, with a notice not to park there again. When will such things happen in SG? The last time I appealed for a parking fine, got rejected quite badly. <br><br>Another example is that its okay to U-turn anywhere so long as there's no sign. In sg is the opposite, can only u-turn when a sign says you can.</p>
              <p>Also, its okay eat anywhere you like providing there's no sign that says you can't. In the library, on the trams, etc. No such thing as security guard says.. etc etc. unless there's a clearly written sign. When i saw on stomp, a rude library guard chasing ppl away for bringing bottled water in, i LOLed. These are the small things, but it goes to show the difference.<br><br>I've only been here for short while, so the above are just my observations. Although, i don't really feel a sense of belonging here compared to in sg, cuz i know that here i'm still a foreigner afterall.<br><br>I've no interest in economics nor politics, so i won't comment anything on that.

              <p><br>this i will only point fingers at our heritage and upbringing. it's all in the mindset of the people.</p>
              <p>there are only 2 kinds of people in this world. the leaders and the followers. which one are you? the leaders will explore possibilities and the followers, will as you've said follow examples. the percentage of "leader" mentality men are few but there are still nonetheless.</p>
              <p>Broadtech Systems is founded by 1 simple man who felt the printer manufacturers are earning too much selling original ink. he started to sell "refurnished" ink cartridges suitable for many different brands. he may not make millions but he is not far away... an example of a leader.</p>
              <p>Bread Talk is another example of a brand created by a "leader". High class bread.</p>
              <p>Charles and Keith? Creative Technologies? Dian Xiao Er?<br><a href="http://www.spba.com.sg/spba2007winners.htm">http://www.spba.com.sg/spba2007winners.htm</a></p>
              <p>we are a population of 4.59 million... maybe only 1 entrepreneur out of 100,000 commoner but still, we are progressing slowly. remember, we are only 43 years old. we do not have any corporation that is 100+ years old like Lehman Brothers founded in 1844.</p>

              <p>Exactly. Singapore is being such an expensive country to live in. I'm certainly grateful for the sense of security that this country gives to us, yes, to a large extent, i'm proud to be a Singaporean...
