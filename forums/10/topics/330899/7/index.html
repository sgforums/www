              <p>yes..4-5 bucks from each of us..but that's juz us..we're the taxpayers in citizen status..u forget the companies and firms that exists in singapore..?they too pay tax..and they pay much much more than all of us...does that justify the amount of 4-5bucks..?the companies maybe be paying 400-500 or 4,000-5,000 or 40,000-50,000 or even 400,000-500,000..but it's worth it for that amount...coz this government keeps the investment and environment stable for the company to be here..in a way they are paying for a more stable location for their investment..and the laws here are fair and transparent for these companies..</p>
              <p>in some other countries they have to pay a big majority of their profits to the government and the percentage of this tax varies according to the greed of the officials...if u're a businessman...u'll start thinking how to keep ur money safe...Singapore is proudly one of the better places in the world right now..and our current government has made it that way..people like u and mi have made it that way..no one is left out..do our part as a citizen to uphold the environment that we're in and we're already well on the way to becoming even better every year...</p>
              <p>the reason y u're not paying $50 bucks a year is because GST is to be based on ur spending volume..the more u're able to spend the more the GST amount..this is a fair system in the world..i hope u know y the GST is not standard amount..~</p>

              <p>22.4 mil..so we adding all the businesses in Singapore...let's say because their stakes is higher therefore they contribute more..?banks..restaurants..etc..the bigger the business the more they contribute...?we'll probably overshot the amount that we contribute to our governors by now...and a point to note is that..we're still talking about 4-5 bucks each from people like u and mi...juz that businesses are paying more...i think that's fair...</p>
