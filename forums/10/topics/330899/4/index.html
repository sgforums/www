              <p>I agree with you on the racism part.. in fact, i'm in oz currently. still quite new to how they do things... but its quite obvious, I can feel it sometimes from the way they talk. still, there are certain rights to protect. I can buy a printer, or a vacuum cleaner, and bring it back the next day saying I'm not satisfied with its performance, and they refund the money right on the spot regardless. In SG, don't mention refund. Just to claim warrenty also have to go thru so many procedures, then they give all sorts of excuse..<br><br>Regarding the "In sg is u can only do something if they allow you to. In Oz, u can do anything you want unless they say you can't.", to quote one example:<br>there was this woman who parked her car in a plot of unmarked land beside the road and got a summon for it. She brought it up to the town council, saying that since there was no sign that says she couldn't park, or that she needed to pay, then she shouldn't need to pay.<br>And her ticket got waivered, with a notice not to park there again. When will such things happen in SG? The last time I appealed for a parking fine, got rejected quite badly.<br><br>Another example is that its okay to U-turn anywhere so long as there's no sign. In sg is the opposite, can only u-turn when a sign says you can.</p>
              <p>Also, its okay eat anywhere you like providing there's no sign that says you can't. In the library, on the trams, etc. No such thing as security guard says.. etc etc. unless there's a clearly written sign. When i saw on stomp, a rude library guard chasing ppl away for bringing bottled water in, i LOLed. These are the small things, but it goes to show the difference.<br><br>I've only been here for short while, so the above are just my observations. Although, i don't really feel a sense of belonging here compared to in sg, cuz i know that here i'm still a foreigner afterall.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Somehow I do not really agree with your point of view. Singapore itself is already taking valid complaint as improving itself instead of following blindly. If u talk about refunding of goods and product, depending on the things (no companies refund underwear) u bought they do not ask question. If u got a parking ticket and u have a reason, u can also complaint and they will waive the penalty. Otherwise u can abuse the meet the MP session and ask them to waive for u. If u look at the library, they really have signs and do not allow people to eat inside.</p>

              <p><br> this i will only point fingers at our heritage and upbringing. it's
              all in the mindset of the people.</p>
              <p>there are only 2 kinds of people in this world. the leaders and
              the followers. which one are you? the leaders will explore
              possibilities and the followers, will as you've said follow
              examples. the percentage of "leader" mentality men are few but
              there are still nonetheless.</p>
              <p>Broadtech Systems is founded by 1 simple man who felt the
              printer manufacturers are earning too much selling original ink. he
              started to sell "refurnished" ink cartridges suitable for many
              different brands. he may not make millions but he is not far
              away... an example of a leader.</p>
              <p>Bread Talk is another example of a brand created by a
              "leader". High class bread.</p>
              <p>Charles and Keith? Creative Technologies? Dian Xiao Er?<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.spba.com.sg/spba2007winners.htm">http://www.spba.com.sg/spba2007winners.htm</a></p>
              <p>we are a population of 4.59 million... maybe only 1 entrepreneur
              out of 100,000 commoner but still, we are progressing slowly.
              remember, we are only 43 years old. we do not have any corporation
              that is 100+ years old like Lehman Brothers founded in 1844.</p>

              <p>yes, business leaders we have alot, what about political leaders? Do we have them? Or are they interchangable. Or is it the system that we were brought up with has impeded us on our analytical and judgement skills, so much so that we are producing more followers.</p>

              <p><br>Well, i hv to agree, looking at most dictatorial rulers, like Hitler, Mao, Qin Emperor, carlos, Pot pot etc etc, most are good during their young days, but once hold power and get old, they become dictator of the worst kind. Science had shown that as you get older, your mentality tends to go back to childish and protective, so i believe LKY should retire fully. Siao liao</p>

              <p>Well said.    Look at him, few months back he was telling us that the US economy will not affect Singapore.     WE know this is not true.   As a leader, he has to be responsible for his words.   So this is good enough for people not to trust in him, trust in his leadership any more.    He is revealing more and more senility and is not fit to lead Singapore any longer.    We hope he will step down before he ruins Singapore.</p>

              <p><br>Well, i hv to agree, looking at most dictatorial rulers, like Hitler, Mao, Qin Emperor, carlos, Pot pot etc etc, most are good during their young days, but once hold power and get old, they become dictator of the worst kind.

              Some signatures of great leader:
                  
                  1. Groom Successor/s
                  2. Ensure peaceful and orderly transition of power
                  3. Totally hands off after that
                  
                  
                  Its a shame Mr LKY cannot or fully do the 3 point, perhaps  
                  
                  Perhaps he's hungry for power like some people think? or No confidence of the younger generation?? or Just cannot let it go as a "father" (just like parents will forever worry about their children even if the children are grown adults)
