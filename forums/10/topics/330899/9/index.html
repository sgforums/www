              <p>Hey how true i never thought of that before... Hmmm the end
              result for the current system in future will be a bias for the rich
              to get richer!! and the poor to remain stagnant..  Nice
              observation</p>

              <p>i hope this medium of information acts as an encouragement to push u to research more into things that u don't know..and not take in information as it is from the web...</p>
              <p>a good start would be an economics textbook..or ebook if u love the internet too much..~</p>
              <p>sometimes it's more than what u see here..u don't see people talk about the efforts that the government has put into widening alternative routes that doesn't have ERP...u don't get to read why COE was implemented back many many years ago..u don't get to understand how is a country being measured and what are the factors and limitations to consider about..and in the future..these things are very important when u wan to hold a decent upright conversation in front of important people..or even in front of ur gf..and also bring up ur children with the right values in life..it's not about teaching them to love Singapore...it's about teaching them to see the right values in life...and u too will start appreciating things around u when u learn more and more into the deeper meanings...</p>

              <p>hie eagle..after reading what u have wrote..i understand the
                  different frequencies that we're in and y it's that way..pls don't
                  mislead the readers of this forum...like in a test..we are to look
                  at same variables..the big question here is how is a country's
                  performance measured?let mi ask u..if u have a company..how is ur
                  company's performance measured...?by the pay of the directors..?if
                  the pay of the directors do not increase means the company has not
                  moved upwards..?when do u increase the directors pay then..?when
                  one of the director's pay increase...?or when the company expands
                  and earns more revenue..?</p>
              <p>so how is a country's performance measured..?GDP?GDP per
                  capita?citizens earnings..?the answer is by a measure of GDP...the
                  view that u're looking at is one of the limitations of measuring
                  the country's performance by GDP. GDP is the total of all our
                  expenditures, plus  investments we made, the government
                  spending, our exports and imports...all added together..this is
                  done to give a more accurate gauge of the country's
                  performance..the rise and fall of all citizens pay will affect the
                  GDP and thus the measure of performance in a country..so it's not
                  juz pegging on the high earners or low earners..</p>
              <p>think about it...y is the country's performance not juz
                  calculating the low earners..?let's say u and mi..we go into the
                  workforce and don't care about our job...and it's all the higher
                  earners that's working to move the country...the country has
                  advance..but u and mi have not..has the country's performance
                  improved..?the world does not revolve around mi and u...it's the
                  whole country altogether..despite our laziness to work...the
                  country will still move..so a collective of the whole country's
                  effort is used..plus the people who's leading us does have his
                  salary peg on ours...that's our supervisor and managers..they lead
                  us directly..if we have a lousy supervisor..the minister gets the
                  blame..?or every man for his own actions..?</p>
              <p>so..for ur suggestion..the average earnings of all Singaporeans
                  and all performance indicators of this country has been taken into
                  consideration. Including yours and mine...</p>
              <p>Maybe u can do the math on the GDP and include the information
                  from there too..?</p>

              <p>Has it?</p>
              <p>The govt has said that the earnings of the ministers are pegged to the top earners (I think top 8 earners) in the country, and not the country's performance indicators which include average earnings of all Singaporeans. Pardon me, but I do need to know when they changed it.</p>
