              <p>Well said,its group effort.But the thing now is,Lee Kuan Yew n his son take all the credits and assume that they are the one,or perhaps should put it this way,"They" are the only one who built up this nation.So how now?</p>
              <p>They say opposition party cannot takeover PAP,and must remain minor party in the parliament,or best,totally no opposition party.So how now?</p>

              <p><br>it is not wrong to é£²æ°´æ€�æº� and we must give credit to M.Mentor for his foresight and effort during the early years. this i presumed all do agree. we cannot forget his achievements just because there are many new unpopular policies that his party implemented on us.</p>
              <p>However, it is time for the next generation of Singaporeans, those who want to see changes and is daring enough to fight for change in the most diplomatic and civilised ways and get involved in the politics of this beautiful country.</p>
              <p>LKY is like a father who nurtured us, taught us, fend for us and carried us during the early years of independence. but now we have grown up and our wings have developed. we know what we want and we know what is right. we want our voices heard but we complained that no one listens . </p>
              <p>there are many ways to improve the political situations in Singapore. join the PAP and change them from the inside. it may take time but still, you are involved. or next, join an opposition and start the ball rolling.

              <p>i agree the cost of living over here is high, very high... but we have great advantages too.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>we are considered very safe. no earthquakes, no typhoons and no tsunami.</li>
              <li>low crime rate. let's be frank, not many countries in this world allows you to walk alone at 2 am in the dead of the night and still be safe. you can go down to the 24 hour food courts or convenience shops without the fear of being raped or robbed. yes, crimes do still happen but we are still very safe.</li>
              <li>low income tax. Australia command a 42% income tax and GST is 10%. we are considered very low on our income taxation and our GST is 7%. yes, cost of living is high but our salary is not... however, we always see queues at M1, Starhub and Singtel shop with people changing mobile phones frequently. (the average Singaporeans) how can we justify that we are just above the poverty line?</li>
              <li>Unemployment rate is at 3% compared to Australia's 3.9%. you may think the number is similar but wait, Singapore's population is 4.59 million and Australia's is 21.42 million. so when we calculate, Australia has 835,380 jobless people compared to Singapore's 137,700.</li>
              <li>Our education system is good. yes, we may not produce Bill Gates or David Beckham but our workforce is very well received by international companies. Dubai loves to employ Singaporeans for we are competant in our area of work but of course our character may be questioned at times. but still, we produce excellent workers due to our education systems</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Singapore is not perfect. there are still work to be done but let's not be disheartened for we are still young, very young in the eyes of the world. </p>
