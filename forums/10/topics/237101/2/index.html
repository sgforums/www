And the reason is because amercians are living in a dream, where everything has got to be big, House, Car, Salary, Vacation etc.<br>What we are seeing right now is a system that is not sustainable and thats why the country is running deficit year after year.<br></div>

Technically speaking, the price of cars here ought to be the similar to the US but because the Govt chose to regulate consumption and force people to buy new COE after 10 years, the prices naturally get inflated.<br><br>Otherwise, the car companies make similar profits per car.
