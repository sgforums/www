You could go get a 3K USD =  car if you are really that broke. You could get a brand new car for 20K.<br><br>a) Fine, I underestimated the price, but 6 USD is frankly a fairly good deal considering the ride is nearly an 1hr long. In the case, of New York, Singapore has no fight since the network is far more denser and the so called monthly MRT fare stamp is limited to 2 rides a day.<br><br>c) Er yah. So you want to work for 1/2 less in Malaysia? Don't want to come to Singapore huh...<br><br>d) Yeah yeah, public transport. More cash for the Govt anyhow.</div>

Is that what you are trying to say? Cos, Aside from pushing out all these examples which are utterly meaningless, you haven't told us anything useful.<br><br>And while we "donate" our cash, the Govt pats itself on the back and the ministers get handsome salaries. Heck, cut their pay in half, and you probably save a few million dollars.</div>

Let's see whether you will say the same thing when your job gets taken away.<br><br>And how about addressing the point about declaring the PAP the sole party?
