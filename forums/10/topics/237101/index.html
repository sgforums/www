In some 'western' countries, they have a 'pension' scheme for the elderly, where they get a monthly allowance (and also subsidised medical care/medicine). Before anyone 'slams' their welfare system as 'wasteful', just imagine your parents or grandparents having to wipe foodcourt tables for pittance.

On their childrens end, their childrens' children need all the money they can earn for tertiary education so they can eventually end up competing with foreigners by accepting lower salaries... it goes on in a vicious circle...<br><br>&gt;&gt; some people, their children just don't give a damn - their children probably are trying to be high-flyers, pursuing all the Cs in Singapore, and neglects their parents. Or, they simply couldn't cope and flopped royally in trying to be high-flyers and end up in a huge heap of debts.<br><br>&gt;&gt; some people, their children became Middle Class earners, they have two kids or more, and are bogged down with housing loans, car loans, and in upkeeping a maid. Then there are some who live together with their parents and are floating a household of 4 children, and parent in-laws with either combined salaries or one mighty bread winner - who may or may not eventually lose his job and go down the way some who chose the MRT tracks...or land themselves in IMH.<br><br>&gt;&gt; largely now, most people's children became married but childless. Now, these are the current trend. They will rather toil and save up ever dollar and cent, enjoy life where and whenever possible, take care of both sides parents, and when time comes, they retire abroad taking along whatever they have achieved and saved.<br><br></div>
