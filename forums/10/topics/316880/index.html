              <p>Wednesday, 07 May 2008</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Reuters</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Singapore's
              Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday its biggest sovereign
              fund GIC will not be as open as sister fund Temasek in disclosing
              details about its portfolio despite pressure from Western lawmakers on
              government funds.<br><br>"GIC and Temasek are different," said Mr Lee in an interview with Reuters.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">"We do not want to tell people exactly how much we have, so people can take a run on the Singapore dollar."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>"Knowing
              exactly how many dollars I have and where exactly they are deployed
              doesn't help you understand what I'm doing. It doesn't explain my
              motivation, it doesn't explain my governance. It doesn't show you I am
              able to operate responsibly and commercially," Mr Lee said.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Temasek,
              with more than S$160 billion under management, produces a yearly report
              that states its returns on investments plus its list of major stock
              holdings.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In contrast, GIC states
              that it manages well over $100 billion (S$136 billion) in assets but no
              other details. Some analysts estimate it could manage more than $300
              billion.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">"I'm even prepared to say
              in the long term how generally we have performed. But year-by-year,
              stock-by-stock, trade-by-trade ... We are not confident we are able to
              operate that way," he said.<br><br>"Temasek is a subset of our
              portfolio. What they declare is what they manage... The information is
              available from listed companies anyway."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sovereign
              wealth funds from Asia and the Middle East have become more influential
              in financial markets after pouring billions of dollars into several big
              banks that were reeling from losses related to the distressed US
              mortgage market.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Government of
              Singapore Investment Corp (GIC), of which Lee is deputy chairman, has
              to-date invested $11 billion in Swiss bank UBS and $6.88 billion in
              Citigroup.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Temasek has bought $5 billion worth of Merrill Lynch shares.</p>

              <p>This statement alone will make it even more urgently important for the GIC to be more transparent and accountable to an independent auditors appointed by Parliament.</p>
              <p>If GIC refuse to make itself accountable to anyone, and whatever information it is prepared to divulge do not help in explain or make itself accountable and understood by any Singaporeans - surely it has become a major issue</p>
              <p>A Parliamentary Committee should be formed by representative from all political parties - {even if at present they have no one elected into Parliament} - and also include nominated People's Representative from different sectors of the Economy.</p>
              <p>Such People's Representative must have some viable credentials before sitting on the Parliamentary Committee - such as being a CEO or CFO, or Accountant, or someone who has the experience of managing a multi-million dollar business.</p>

              <p>This is the most irresponsible statement a politican can ever make.  It begs the question.</p>
              <p>What is the reason behind injecting so much money to save Swiss bank and Citigroup, to protect a bigger interest behind?  Personal or national?</p>
              <p>I am sure by now they should have diverted away sizeable amount of money for the special "strategic" investment.  Why are they still not compromising on the main accounts?</p>
              <p>If they continue to choose non-disclosure, then at least separate the people's money i.e. CPF and State Fund.  CPF management must definitely be transparent because it is truly the people's money.  You cannot make losses on the investment and then implement a policy to delay or give excuse not to return that money.  That is criminal offense.</p>

              <p>MM LKY and his personally annointed team has always said that CPF monies are not managed by the GIC - nor even by Temasek.</p>
              <p>It seems that the monies are from annual surplusses gained from the annual budget prepared by the Finance Ministry, and which are supposed to be transferred to the National Reserves.</p>
              <p>With the POWER of ONE manipulating Singapore since 1956 - the Rules of the Games have been constantly changed through a majority control of Parliament that amends legislations ''requested'' by the Cabinet - {in which dissenting votes from Party Members are not tolerated}.</p>
              <p>There was suppose to be a Two-Key system to protect the National Reserves - one held by the Elected President, and the other to be held by Parliament.</p>
              <p>Legislations have been passed without any opposition that state - ''No succeeding government can spent the budget surplus accumulated by the previous government'' - which will effectively impoverish a new government elected by the people being unable to access the people's money in the National Reserves.</p>
              <p>If ever an Alternative Political Party should form the Singapore Government, it should immediately audit the Finance Ministry, the National Reserves, GIC and Temasek - and give a public account of the true picture of the Singapore Reserves.</p>

              <p>Money is Power, too much power corrupts.  Who can act righteous with the temptation of hundreds of billion at his sole disposal?</p>
              <p>CPF is people's hard earn money.  People depend on this money to survive after they are no longer fit to work.  I am not saying enjoying life after retirement, I am saying just enough to survive.  And that money rightfully belongs to them, it's their sweat and blood.  They have toil and suffered hardship most of their lives, why is their right to survive taken away from them?  Why are they throwing out so many weak and old people on the street, collecting cans, plastic bottles and newspapers?</p>
              <p>Singapore is a fresh juicy apple on the outside, but right at the core, it's rotten.  The outside world see Singapore as high achiever, with high efficient and righteous government.  The reality is very clear, especially if you have been staying abroad for sometimes and have family living in Singapore.  You feel the pain in your heart.  People living in Singapore are numb to these injustice, the pain is gradual but increasing at the pace unfelt.  Singaporean is living in a society highly manipulated and engineered by tyrants.</p>
              <p>But i guess they have touched the treshold, three years before the next general election.  It's a pity the person supposed to be named as hero in Singapore history book, will end up as a crook.  At least the true story will be passed down from our generation to the next.</p>
              <p>Back again, budget surplus should be distributed to the citizens in forms of subsidizes.  Because we contributed to the surplus and we have the right to enjoy the collective fruit of labor.  Now we don't even think about the discarded peeled fruit skin, our own fruits are taken a big bite before given to us.</p>

                  manages well over $100 billion (S$136 billion) in assets but no
                  other details. Some analysts estimate it could manage more than
                  $300 billion.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">"I'm even prepared to say in the

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sovereign wealth funds from Asia and
                  the Middle East have become more influential in financial markets
                  after pouring billions of dollars into several big banks that were
                  reeling from losses related to the distressed US mortgage
                  market.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Government of Singapore
                  Investment Corp (GIC), of which Lee is deputy chairman, has to-date
                  invested $11 billion in Swiss bank UBS and $6.88 billion in
                  Citigroup.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Temasek has bought $5 billion worth

              <p>Money is Power, too much power corrupts.  Who can act
              righteous with the temptation of hundreds of billion at his sole
              disposal?</p>
              <p>CPF is people's hard earn money.  People depend on this
              money to survive after they are no longer fit to work.  I am
              not saying enjoying life after retirement, I am saying just enough
              to survive.  And that money rightfully belongs to them, it's
              their sweat and blood.  They have toil and suffered hardship
              most of their lives, why is their right to survive taken away from
              them?  Why are they throwing out so many weak and old people
              on the street, collecting cans, plastic bottles and newspapers?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Singapore is a fresh juicy apple on the outside, but right at
              the core, it's rotten.</strong></span>  The outside world see Singapore as
              high achiever, with high efficient and righteous government. 
              The reality is very clear, especially if you have been staying
              abroad for sometimes and have family living in Singapore.  You
              feel the pain in your heart.  People living in Singapore are
              numb to these injustice, the pain is gradual but increasing at the
              pace unfelt.  Singaporean is living in a society highly
              manipulated and engineered by tyrants.</p>
              <p>But i guess they have touched the treshold, three years before
              the next general election.  It's a pity the person supposed to
              be named as hero in Singapore history book, will end up as a
              crook.  At least the true story will be passed down from our
              generation to the next.</p>
              <p>Back again, budget surplus should be distributed to the citizens
              in forms of subsidizes.  Because we contributed to the surplus
              and we have the right to enjoy the collective fruit of labor. 
              Now we don't even think about the discarded peeled fruit skin, our
              own fruits are taken a big bite before given to us.</p>
