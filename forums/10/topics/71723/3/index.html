            <div class='col-md body'>basically i share with you what people of the earlier generation feel and told me.<br><br>basically during the formative years the PAP was for the people simultaneously cementing their power. After the communists, barisan socialis  were gone, that was when their stranglehold of power came in.<br><br>However in this day and age, i quote the female MP (whatever her name is) that her constituents of that generation, have "betrayed" them, the unemplotment, CPF cut here and that.<br><br>if you understand power, the PAP has two objectives, party survival,  and secondly governance of the nation. whatever policies they have so far implemented, i believe were carefully formulated and delibrated such that like what most people say, resulting in a servile society. my personal feel so far the governing part is not too bad. clean streets low crime, no gang violence. However, like some have mentioned, it reeks of corporatism and dynasty politics.<br><br>if yo really think when singtel and M1 compete, consumers gain, think again. Can anyone just search for this link (i forgot about it). it listed how most of our most commercial assets are actually owned by members of the gobvernment and from the family.<br><br>To answer the question on what i think is the main problem of society, I feel that it is probably that the country we live in is small and artificial plus there is no national pride.<br><br>PAP is able to exert such tremedous pressure on its citizen is because we are only so big. As it is onlyso big, it doesnt really inspire people in terms of the Arts, literature and what have we.and lastly, there is no national pride. Our soccer team sucks. our most global thing is probably Sun Yanzi. in a survey conducted like 3-4yrs back, the Irish were said to be the proudest people in the world in terms of national pride kinda stuff. They have U2, the Corrs Irish Stout as well as james Joyce. the symbol of our misguideness and lack of national pride is probably either Sentosa or the Merlion. How can people lead dignified lives when there is no sense of national pride or when they are slaves to the machinery??</div>
