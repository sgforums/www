            <div class='col-md body'>lotsa problem in our society.<br><br>1. attitude problem of most singaporean.<br>- those who study oversea know that singaporean student or tourist seem to have a bad reputation. i know many aussie friends who say that singaporean up themselves and act as if they are f..... rich.<br><br>2. single party control.<br>- with no opposition party strong enuff to challenge the PAP. how many times we face helpless with the decision make by the PAP minister. often the question ask by ourselves " what to do, nothing we can do" .<br>i dont agree, yes for most part of the 4-5 years period, we cannot anything, the only day we can do something is ' election day' . use your action to do the talking singaporean.<br><br>3. high living expenses(high inflation)<br>- why are we paying $150k for 90msq 4 room flat where barely 10 years ago, it cost $100k for 106msq. it count add up to 70% increase from 10 years ago. are our pay, increase by 70% from 10 years ago? in fact some of us even argue, we go paid less  compare to 10 years ago.<br>- try talk to some uncle in their 40s or 50s.  during 80s , early 90s, very easy to make money in spore, now. dont talk about making money, barely surviving to meet end needs.<br><br>4 education.<br>- how many of you singaporean been force to pay higher fees to study in oversea because you are deprive of a chance of local education.  why? are we not qualify? no because not enuff vacany in local uni. why? before SMU, many opening in NTU and NUS are occupied by Indian from india, chinese from china, Malaysian from malaysia. because they pay high fees and some even FOC because they are talent and we singaporean or second priority.<br><br>some migh argue , minister have helicopter view, super satellite view, but eventually if it come at the expense of singaporean, maybe they should think twice.<br><br>some might even argue wasting time to write because nothing we can do. isnt all decision making process start by discussing and sharing of idea. hopefully one day something will change.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>diversity. And its a problem of the world. But as for Singapore, yeah pretty much what the other guys said. Let me add one more thing about this society, its too stressful, WHY? Because its too competitive, WHY? Because SIngapore has nothing else than people for $, WHY? Because that's the problem, Singapore's lack of resources other than human resources, which it does not have much of anyway, if talent has to be imported, and a few MPs aren't even local but Malaysian.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>education.<br>education has always being reformed. but the stress remains in most students, why some students hate school and hang out to de stress but get into bad company?<br>this is one area PAP has not been able to look into. civil moral classes taught us how to cope with stress, even pastoral classes teach us that. but in my view, a more creative and indusive enviroment should be made for a average student.<br>fast pace life<br>fast paced life has led us to ignore what is happening around us. I seriously feel that because of the fast paced life, we have forget some of the important etiquette. Why do you think "kiasu" and other not so accepted behaviors are seen on the streets.<br>fast paced life has seriously cause us to forget these out on the street when singaporeans are rushing for time.</div>

PAP - absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br><br>But Just face it. Singaporeans deserves the PAP.<br><br>The PAP tells Singaporeans what to do because they think Singaporeans are bloody stupid.

But then, how not to come to the conclusion that Singaporeans are stupid when year in year out they vote for the PAP, no matter what crap they receive from them?<br></div></blockquote>That's all to easy to say, but what alternatives do we really have? Singaporeans do not vote for the PAP because they are stupid, but because all of their strings are effectively tied up to the gar'men who keeps them on a short leash. All the Party needs to do is to pull and we'll have no choice but to obey.<br><br>And please, the democratic process here is a farce, a total sham. With a fictious system, how can you gain what you really want? Just look at the number of Singaporeas who actually get their "right" to vote, and the goalpost shifting that makes it virtually impossible for the opposition to ever grow in strenght, much less compete on a level playing field.<br><br>What can we do? Well, waking up from the Matrix, refusing to buy the force-fed propangada, and thinking for our own and acting accordingly are the best things we can do. If the people are smart, the Party can't afford to play punk with them, which is better for everybody in the end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before you blame the people for being fickle, stupid, uncreative and conformist. Think about why they are like that? Because of the system, and who is the system? The PAP government. So actually its not the people's fault, it is the entire nation's fault, the PAP, the culture and the people's all together...in this mutual cycle of stupidity. But who am I to talk? Every country has its stupid systems, which its people all struggle to overcome, Singapore just has to wait to overcome its problems, either by revolution (France), voting (Wait long time heh) or god knows what.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What will it take? U think? I will tell you what I think. To break the power struggle, you need revolution. THe civilian population outnumbers the agents of the government many times, the secret lies in marshalling this power. Furthermore, the government armed forces are a citizen army, not professional, making it harder to supress revolts. The hired mercenaries in Singapore are again, too few to contend with a people's revolt. What will this revolt do? The revolt stops Singapore, and the people demand what they want, basically, more seats for opposition etc etc whatever (god knows what you want.)<br><br>Anothjer way to solve the power cycle, i am talking about PAP power, would be assasination, i.e Killing Lee and his line, and if necessary the entire cabinet. This should be a last measure because once you do something as bloody as that, the people won't support you, this is not Rome where speeches win the day of a dead Julius.<br><br>Otherwise, as I said.. wait... which is the only thing you can do. WAIT. Be patient, it took England 800 years. Took USA 200. God knows how long it will take Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ironically, it is the PAP that identified the main problem of our society: mindset. We need a radical mindset cahnge in this country.<br><br>i said they "identified" the problem because naturally, the govt is mis-defined it, owing to their own prejudices and mindsets.<br><br>As I mentioned in an earlier post in an earlier thread, the problem with SIngaporeans is their conservative Asian mindset. Despite having the facade of a developed country, the innards are not up to standard. in a way, Singapore is like Isengard: majestic on the surface, but clunking, ugly, steaming factories underground.<br><br>After years of colonialism, Singaproeans have deveoped this hate-the-west attitude (yep, a connection to arrogance). while in economical sense, we are open to the West, but in the cultural sense we still practice isolationism, at least the older Singaproeans do. n of course, this includes govt officials. Western Openness and graciousness are scorned by Asians who attribute this to the ills in Western society, forgetting most of the time that the same ills apply to their countries as well. HR come under the "decadent Western values" heading and are labelled as a feature of "Western individualism that results in social instability", ignoring the fact that HR calls for a universal brotherhood.<br><br>So at teh end of the day, Singapore's main problem is MINDSET.<br><br>the pikamaster<br><br></div>
