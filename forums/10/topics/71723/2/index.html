Ngiam Tong Dow, Goh Keng Swee, LKY, etc. the system of course, cannot be expected to change on its own, but it has so easily controlled the subservient massses and govt officials, subservient to it, that is. And that is sad. like someone else said in another thread, Singapore is being ruled by the MNCs. i would like to add on that the Statutes of Singapore are ruling everyone, even gahmen officials, unquestioningly (with absolute power). ironically, the only pple who can change the system directly have been shunned to one side: LKY's team is retired, JBJ has been defamed through Defamation suits and so on.<br><br>LKY is a historical parody. i remember i once read in one of my story books:" History always has the last laugh. it would be nice to say that heroes die gloriously in the Last Battles, but that is rarely the case in real life. History has the tendency of shaping itself such that whatever benefit the hero might have brought is effectively erased by his own actions subsequently. thus, the fact that heroes survive past their Great Battles is history's joke."<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

Always try to capitalise on each other weakness and improve with better deal to seek the best for us,then the party will improve,system will improve too!<br>What PAP do! Shut down all opposition,introduce GRC and let one party do all the things which he think is best! If the system which he feel is the best for this country fail!

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the consistent walk-overs the PAP has claimed, it is probably due to the sad state of the opposition in our country.<br><br>Firstly, opposition members are usually stero-typified against, as they are believed to be marked members, and are usually targetted against (political attacks), and hence shuns people from joining the opposition, preventing an expected swelling up in the numbers, in direct proportion to the dissatisfaction with the government.<br><br>Also, the continual remarks by certain political figures putting down the opposition as "unnecessary", and "irrelevant", or "are trying to sow discord", have certainly not helped matters. People are wrenched away from the alternative viewpoints, as biased media reports portray the opposition in a bad light, while continually giving the PAP prime news space (perhaps they can help it, perhaps they can't; after all, it now is the main political party in Singapore).<br><br>If we want a robust and free opposition in Singapore, the only way to do so is to get more activists who are truely aware of Singapore's wants and needs to join the opposition, provide a true voice of reason, and more importantly, solutions to the problems facing our country. That is the only way for the opposition to regain it's credibility in utilitarian Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's disturbing is that while we may have a democratic system,  yet our democratically elected government has a monopoly of power which controls every facet of life in Singapore to the point of rooting out any hint of dissent. All this is done in accordance with the law and of course the government makes those laws.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Absolutely true that our over-structured and over-controlled society have produced wooden Singaporeans.  It's not only me saying that, even Hongkies, Taiwanese and Chinamen all think so too.<br><br>Our managers cant make important business decision with overseas clients.  The seige mentality is " MUST REPORT TO BIG BOSS FIRST, let him decide!"  How come we are this way?<br><br>Just take a look at our political system - it is typical of an over controlled society.   Which MP or minister or trade union chief dare seriously challenge or oppose Government policy ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The blame should'nt  fall entirely on Singaporeans at large.  If you need to point fingers do take a closer look at our Government policies, structures and control.<br><br>Have we achieved ourselves a united nation,  a closely knitted-one -voice-nationalistic people?  NO!  We cannot lay  claim to have succeeded  as one people one nation.  Right now, it's the Government prospering while the people can only watch and salivate -because they will never get to taste the enormous wealth of the Government.<br><br>Making billions is NOT considered a national achievement - especially in Singapore's case.<br><br>Taiwanese, Koreans, Japanese  - they all developed  and created their own society and national unity.   If their Government tries funny policies on it's citizens,  the entire population will go on the streets to protest and make themselves heard.   Do we have enough standard to compare our wooden society with theirs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br></div>
