            <div class='col-md body'>No matter how bad they treat the "old" the "old" will vote for them because they stole from the "young" before the young were born and gave it to the "old". <a href="http://www.newsintercom.org/index.php?itemid=442" rel="nofollow">(click here to see how they stole from the young even before they were born!) Property Prices Rise at our expense</a><br><br>Yet what they gave the old was not "tangible" but were only leases that they cannot pass on to the young. Also many smart ones simply took the money and ran for their lives overseas.<br><br>That is why the "old" will always vote for them. That is why they always bring up what the previous regime did for Singapore, last time. They mean what the previous regime did for the old in Singapore. How they stole money from the "yet born" and gave it to the "old".<br><br>These are the mee siam mai hum people (born with a silver spoon in their mouth) that have no idea what is going on and only knows how to take more and more money from the people.<br><br>2010 might be a little too early though.<br><br>You need to at least wait until the old man dies; not because he has some mystical powers but that would signal the passing away of the "old" (that benefited) in Singapore and the rise of the young (that are oppressed with no benefits).<br><br>If they continue to order mee siam mai hum, that would be the beginning of the end for them.<br><br>If you are intend to be an opposition in Singapore, I advise you to do it now (to become well known) but wait until at least after old man dies to expect to win a seat. I repeat, not because the old man has any mystical powers but it would mean the passing of the "old" that benefited and the rise of the oppressed young.
