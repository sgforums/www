            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong><span class="large">Pregnancy can harm job prospects: poll  </span><br><br>Adrian Lim<br>Tue, Aug 07, 2007<br>AsiaOne<br></strong><br><br>Women who become pregnant harbour the fear that they may lose their jobs or have their career prospects dimmed.<br><br>Nearly seven of every 10 people polled recently felt that pregnant workers were disadvantaged this way.<br><br>In the AsiaOne poll of 1,259 people last week, some 30 per cent, or 374 individuals indicated that a pregnant woman faces the risk of losing her job while another 37 per cent, or 466 people, agreed that pregnancy would "affect her promotion prospects."<br><br>Only one-third, or 419 people, felt that there was no cause for worry.<br><br>The survey followed media reports about Medicorp actress Zoe Tay, who said in this month's issue of Chinese women's magazine Citta Bella that her contract had been "suspended", and that she had stopped drawing income because of her pregnancy.<br><br>The 39-year old actress, who is married to pilot Philip Chionh, has a two-year-old son Brayden and is currently seven months pregnant.<br><br>The controversial topic has set online chatrooms and forums in Singapore abuzz. In AsiaOne, the forum thread "Medicorp drops pregnant Zoe Tay" has so far received 46 postings and a massive 10,682 public views to date.<br><br>Mediacorp has since clarified their contractual policies, saying in a statement that "there is no termination or suspension of contracts for artistes who are pregnant".<br><br>It added that "the 12-week full pay (similar to permanent staff on maternity leave) would usually still be paid to pregnant artistes with no obligation or extra commitment" and it "has always adopted a pro-family approach".<br><br>Medicorp, however, said it will not disclose the specifics of individual broadcaster-artiste contracts for reasons of confidentiality.<br><br>Zoe Tay's revelation of her contractual issues with her employer caught the public eye because of her 'A-star' status as a local celebrity, but she is not the only one unhappy about what she sees as the job consequences of being pregnant.<br><br>In the first five months of this year, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) received 36 complaints of pregnancy-related discrimination, compared to the 15 to 28 cases reported annually from 2001 to last year.<br><br>It is of no surprise that 67 per cent of AsiaOne readers feel that a woman's career is in jeopardy when she becomes pregnant.<br><br>"With the government's efforts to promote work-life harmony and family life, I am appalled and disappointed that women still contend with issues such as getting sacked for being pregnant," said Mrs Valerie Chan in an AsiaOne forum posting.<br><br>Mrs Chan, 28, was asked to leave her job as an Operations Executive at a global conference company earlier this year because the company felt that she could not meet the newly-imposed travelling requirements in her downsized department.<br><br>This despite her candid opinions she gave to her then-prospective employer during the interview about starting a family which they assured her was fine as they were "pro-family".<br><br>However, even if a company chooses to retain a pregnant employee, some 37 per cent feel her career prospects will be affected adversely.<br><br>A forum member, Super Gal, said of her experience: "When I was expecting my third child, they didn't sack me but my expatriate bosses gave me so much mental and physical stress such that I had a nervous breakdown and my gynecologist had to induce my labour.<br><br>"When I returned after my maternity break, he had the cheek to ask me 'when am I stopping all my nonsense, in other words, getting pregnant'."<br><br>A few forum members said that some companies, especially the SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) have no choice but to let their pregnant employees go.<br><br>Mr Terry Chang wrote: "We employ somebody to work for the company and pay him or her accordingly for what he or she is supposed to contribute to the company. If the employee is new and without past contribution to the company, I don't see why the company is obliged to continue to employ her if she is not suitable for the job."<br><br>Zoom58sg said that "most SMEs do not have room for staff to be on maternity", and it would be too much of a financial strain to bear.<br><br>Is having a baby a joyous moment parents? To many people, this state of prospective motherhood can turn out to be a tangled web of contractual disputes, mistreatment from the employer, and loss of income and job prospects.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to pity some of these companies really. Pregnancy can really disrupt a worker's job, not just for a while but for many many months. You can't sack the workers cause doing so is clear discrimation, while you still have to pay the worker. I remember reading before on the straits times how one very small travel agency only employ like 3 people, and when 1 of them got pregnant it was like 1/3 of the work force is gone for a third of a year and the whole agency suffered because of that. People wanting to have children and yet still wanting their pregnancy to not affect their job is often asking for too much. Especially those that want to have more than 2 children.<br><br>Of course, the boss that sacked the son-in-law because the daughter had a miscarriage is really being a bastard here, but then again we are not getting the full story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sigh, instead of implementing law to have the PM appoint more people who appoint judges..... They should be looking into law that protects pregnant mothers. E.g like if a pregnant mother is asked to leave a company due to layoffs eg... reasonable compensation to give given etc...</div>

Just what are human rights? It's a tricky question.<br><br>The granddaddy of human rights was a man with the less-than-cuddly name of Cyrus the Great.<br><br>King of a Persian empire in the 6th century BC, dear Cyrus carved down his thoughts on a piece of royal clay, promising religious freedom and abolishing slavery for his people.<br><br>The Cyrus Cylinder, as the edict became known, is recognised by many as the first human rights charter. A replica actually takes pride of place at the steel-and-glass UN headquarters.<br><br>Over the centuries, philosophers took turns to have a crack at the question.<br><br>John Locke's take on human rights was sweetly divine, describing rights as gifts from God.<br><br>John Stuart Mill's thesis was almost mathematical: One always acts to produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.<br><br>Karl Marx, ever the practical man, issued a war cry: Revolution against the bourgeoisie.<br><br>The romantics will say: Human rights is 'the conscience of mankind', 'the highest aspiration of man' and 'the rebellion against tyranny'.<br><br>All well and good. But let's try and be a little bit more specific.<br><br>Before we get to the 'rights', let's try and figure out the 'human'.<br><br>Who's human? Now that's a tough one in itself.<br><br>The US Declaration of Independence famously states that 'all men are created equal'.<br><br>But it was years before America freed its slaves and gave women the right to vote.<br><br>WHAT'S BEEN FIGURED OUT<br><br>Today, we've figured out the women and ethnic minorities.<br><br>We haven't quite made up our minds about the rights of homosexuals and transient workers.<br><br>Not forgetting, of course, the rights of opposition politicians.<br><br>It's the million-dollar question, a tricky one, in fact, for several Asean states.<br><br>So which comes first? Society's good or one human's rights? Is human rights too amorphous a concept to mean anything?<br><br>Taking baby steps before the leap of faith might help.<br><br>Mr Simon Tay, chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, wrote earlier this week that Asean should consider public education first.<br><br>Human rights, he wrote, continue to be seen in this region as an alien, 'Western' concept. Public education can reframe that debate.<br><br>'Asean's peoples need to understand human rights and see them as being part of their own heritage and beliefs, rather than a Western imposition,' wrote Mr Tay.<br><br>Can Asean pull it off?<br><br>The way forward might not be as murky as it looks.<br><br>The UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights already holds the Guinness World Record for being the most translated document - 'more than 300 languages and dialects: from Abkhaz to Zulu.'<br><br>Asean, though, will have to find its own language.<br><br>There's plenty of thinking ahead for Asean to do. Asean's new rule, ironically, must come from some sort of consensus.<br><br>Motherhood will only make it murkier.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nonameguy:</div><div class="quote_body">You have to pity some of these companies really. Pregnancy can really disrupt a worker's job, not just for a while but for many many months. You can't sack the workers cause doing so is clear discrimation, while you still have to pay the worker. I remember reading before on the straits times how one very small travel agency only employ like 3 people, and when 1 of them got pregnant it was like 1/3 of the work force is gone for a third of a year and the whole agency suffered because of that. People wanting to have children and yet still wanting their pregnancy to not affect their job is often asking for too much. Especially those that want to have more than 2 children.<br><br>Of course, the boss that sacked the son-in-law because the daughter had a miscarriage is really being a bastard here, but then again we are not getting the full story.</div></blockquote>I agree.<br>Sometimes we have to look from the company's prospective. It is not cost efficient for them to hire that employee who absent herself or produce a lesser amount of work done for the same amt. of salary she is being paid. It kind of does not justify the wage and, in this case, is a disadvantage to the employers. In this scenario, i am only referring to SMEs as they really need to cut down on their cost in order to maintain their stake in the market.<br>To be honest, it is a disadvantage to be a working woman who wants to start a family. So I suggest that maybe the pregnant employee take 3 months no pay leave prior to her delievery date but still get to maintain her job. In the mean time, her company can get to look for part timers to substitute her job and might in another way, cut down on their cost too.<br>My suggestion might not be feasible, but as i said, was only a suggestion for discussion. What are some other alternatives that can be used to solve or tone down this matter?</div>
