              <p>THE federal government will consider slashing Australia's annual migration intake to help tackle concerns about traffic congestion, housing, hospitals, water and the environment.</p>
              <p>Just months after declaring himself in favour of a ''big Australia'', Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday warned of ''legitimate concerns'' with population growth and appointed Agriculture Minister Tony Burke as Australia's first Population Minister.</p>
              <p>Mr Burke has been given a year to develop the country's first population plan, including a review of immigration levels.</p>
              <p>The announcement came as another boatload of asylum seekers - the 102nd to be intercepted since Mr Rudd took office - was placed in detention at the Christmas Island facility, which has reportedly reached capacity.</p>
              <p>Mr Rudd denied the new strategy was a smokescreen to divert attention from the recent boat arrivals, saying the idea for a population plan had come after ''extensive deliberations of the cabinet over the last month''.</p>
              <p>He said population growth must be monitored: ''Particularly its impact on urban congestion, its impact on the adequacy of infrastructure, its impact on the adequacy of housing supply, its impact on government services, its impact also on water and agriculture and on our regions.''</p>
              <p>Mr Rudd's change of heart followed the release last month of Treasury's Intergenerational Report, which predicted Australia's population would swell from about 22 million to 35.9 million in 2050, with overseas migration by far the biggest contributor.</p>
              <p>Australia's growth rate is now twice the global average, even outstripping that in some developing nations including the Philippines, Malaysia, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Figures from the Bureau of Statistics show that last financial year net overseas migration added a record 298,924 people, while natural increase (births minus deaths) added 157,792.</p>
              <p>Victoria's population, estimated at 5.44 million at June 2009, is growing faster than the national average, with 27 per cent of all immigrants in 2008-09 choosing to set up home here.</p>
              <p>The majority moved to Melbourne, where population growth outstripped all other capital cities for the eighth year in a row, compounding pressure on the city's public transport network, roads and housing market.</p>
              <p>Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison dismissed Mr Rudd's announcement as a diversion to cover his failure to control boat arrivals. ''Effectively what he has announced is a plan for a plan after the next election,'' he said.</p>
              <p>Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said Australia needed a serious debate on population.</p>
              <p>''It's very hard to have a sustainable population strategy if you can't control our boat arrivals. You can't have a population policy without having a border protection policy,'' he said.</p>
              <p><em>The Future Eaters</em> author and former Australian of the Year Tim Flannery welcomed the move, but said the Government should create an independent board to set medium and longer-term targets that would take into account the environment, social issues and the economy.</p>
              <p>Greens leader Bob Brown said the new strategy must be matched with action. ''The major parties' population growth plan is outstripping Australia's infrastructure, environmental capacity and affecting quality of life.''</p>

              <p>i would like to know, how does australians really know for themselves if and when migration intake has really been slashed and if so by exactly how much?</p>
              <p>Or just based on news and reports released for public consumption? or just based on trust?</p>
              <p>This is a technical question only.</p>
              <p>If know hor, maybe can be applied to other countries.</p>

              <p>Simple, when they look around, land see ess and less yellow, black and brown skinned people, then it mean foreigners from their above countries were being slashed.</p>
              <p>Example, in Singapore, now you look around, out of 3, 1 is foreigner, so out of a crowd of 30 peoples, 10 are foreigners, once you notice that out of 30 peoples, only 1 or 2 are foreigners, then the intake is said to be slashed. But unfortunately, for singapore, the 3:1 ration is going to be 3:2 ratio soon.</p>
              <p>In other countries, if the people dun like the foreigner coming here, they make it hard for both the govt and foreigner, examples in my Taiwan, frankly, no racial intended, but taiwanese dun like bangala or anything from indian, rich or poor alike, so whever a group of workers from india or mynamar come in, the people in taiwan makes it very difficult life for them, dun sell them food, refuse them entry into shopping or parks, chase them out of street, complain to our mayor or governor about them, make an issue out of it and go after the employers who bought them in...end up, after a month or 2 month, all foreigners volunteered to get out of taiwan.</p>
              <p>But in Singapore, singaporean tho hate foreigner, but show no action, all still greet them, allow them to go anywhere and buy anything, even allow them to go find prostitues, and more funny is allow them into Casino without even need to pay entry fees. So, in the end, these peoples preferred here, they felt that they are in the same level as the local, can do this and that as they like.</p>
              <p>In Conclusion, Singaporeans can blame themselves too, first for being non cooperative among each other to fight for their right, second being choosing a Govt that embrace immgrants, and third for welcoming foreigners while biting a bullet</p>

              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>The Australian government has announced its plans to reduce Australia’s annual immigration in tack to “help tackle concerns about traffic congestion, housing, hospitals, water and the environment,” the Age reports today.</p>
              <p>A few months after unveiling a plan to increase Australia’s population via immigration, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Ruud now flip-flops and warned of “legitimate concerns” with population growth.</p>
              <p>Agriculture Minister Tony Burke was appointed as a Australia’s first Population Minister to “develop the country’s first population plan, including a review of immigration levels.”</p>
              <p><em>“‘Particularly its impact on urban congestion, its impact on the adequacy of infrastructure, its impact on the adequacy of housing supply, its impact on government services, its impact also on water and agriculture and on our regions,”</em> Mr Burke said.</p>
              <p>Opposition leader Tony Abbott criticized Mr Kevin Ruud’s move without a serious debate on population:</p>
              <p><em>”It’s very hard to have a sustainable population strategy if you can’t control our boat arrivals. You can’t have a population policy without having a border protection policy,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>Even as Australia plans to scale down on immigration, PAP leaders continue to exhort Singaporeans to welcome more immigrants.</p>
              <p>During a speech made at a community event yesterday, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong took pains to emphasize that foreigners are still very much welcomed in Singapore though the PAP has introduced some cosmetic changes to its pro-foreigner policies to appease angry voters.</p>
              <p><em>“Singapore must not create the image that immigrants are not welcome,”</em> he stressed.</p>
              <p>With no opposition in parliament to hold the PAP accountable, it is impossible to have a proper debate on the PAP’s misguided and faulty immigration policies which have caused tremendous hardships to ordinary Singaporeans leading to sky-rocketing public housing prices, traffic congestion  and decreased quality of life.</p>
              <p>The immigrants serve a crucial political purpose in ensuring the PAP’s continued political survival and hegemony as its support based gets eroded with each passing day.</p>
              <p>Grassroots organizations and the PAP itself have been actively recruiting new citizens to fill its ranks including the likes of Sinha Shekhar from India who was given an “outstanding contributor award” by PM Lee lately for his “contributions” to the PAP’s REACH forum.</p>
              <p>There are about 20,000 new citizens for each of the last three years and their increasing number will form an influential voting bloc in future elections.</p>
              <p>It is little wonder that the PAP is sparing no efforts to make the new citizens feel happy in Singapore as it has no qualms splurging taxpayers’ monies to make them feel “respected” including a “Water Festival” for the Thai, Burmese and Cambodian community here.</p>
              <p>While Kevin Ruud has come under increasing fire lately from the opposition, media and Australians for his immigration policies, PM Lee may yet still believe that Singaporeans are “supportive” of his policies.</p>
              <p>After all, there is no opposition to criticize him, the media is muzzled and the citizenry is too apathetic and ignorant to challenge him. PM Lee must be feeling downright fortunate that he is ruling Singapore and not Australia.</p>
