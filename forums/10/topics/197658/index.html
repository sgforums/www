            <div class='col-md body'>Islamic seminary in US to bridge religion-culture gulf<br><br>Jun 28, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br>EVERY seat in the auditorium at the University of Houston was taken. The two American-Muslims onstage spoke in Arabic, with flawless accents.<br><br>Sheikh Hamza Yusuf, 48, and Imam Zaid Shakir, 50, are converts to Islam and had spent years in the Middle East and West Africa.<br><br>The two men are creating the first Islamic seminary in the United States where they hope to train a new generation of imams and scholars who can reconcile Islam and American culture. The California seminary, called the Zaytuna Institute, is in its fledgling stages.<br><br>Sheikh Yusuf believes that if more Muslims were schooled in Islam's diverse intellectual streams and had a holistic understanding of it, they would not be so susceptible to the message that suicide bombers are martyrs.<br><br>Though the two do not denounce any particular school of thought, their students say they are challenging the sometimes intolerant influence of sects such as Wahhabism and Salafism.<br><br>Sheikh Yusuf and Imam Shakir teach that Islam is open to a diversity of interpretations and to beware of 'fanatics' who pluck Islamic scripture out of context and say: We are going to tell you what God says on every issue.<br><br>'That's not Islam,' Sheikh Yusuf says. 'That is psychopathy.'<br><br>Hundreds of Muslims come to Zaytuna for classes on Prophet Muhammad, the Quran and the Arabic language. There is also a female scholar who teaches only women. -- NEW YORK TIMES</div>
