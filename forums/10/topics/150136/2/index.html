How many people there will know about singapore's internal affair to join in a meaningful discussion about our problem with the PAP, the government, NKF...... You will most likely end up hearing a lot of priases about LKY.<br><br>For those who are not proud of or patriotic to singapore, I wonder how do they respond when asked in a foreign land, "where do you come from?" Singapore?? and then say I am not happy with that country and I am migrating? watch the response when you give this kind of answer.<br><br>There is no need to give the ruling party the wrong impression and there is no need to wash dirty linen in front of outsiders. Lets show our patriotism at the right place, the right time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Nelstar. We should not behave like the primates when provoked by them. If the provocation is serious enough let the MFA respond professionally as they have always done.<br><br>Johor is not our equal. So we should smile at their MB's remarks and not respond at all. Nobody is taking him serious. By responding to him, we will be  giving him weight and we should not.<br></div>
