            <div class='col-md body'>I think that Singapore does not do anything if others crticise or say something bad on the country. Like the case in Taiwan which Taiwanese burnt our Singapore flag!!!!!!!! and nobody did or say anything back. I feel that we Singaporeans are not nationalistic enough. Nationalistic to the country not only pledge loyalty to the government/president, sing national anthem or national song and etc. We should somehow defend ourselves when some other countries attack us. We should not have riot lah or else being caught by the police. We should write a letter to the newspaper, government or maybe that country respensitive on complaining of such acts done to Singapore. Like another recent case is that JB MB says that crime rate at there is lower than Singapore which I feel is not so right. But Singaporeans didn't react on this which hulimate our national pride. We can ask like the JB MB to show out the figure to see whether it is really lower than SG then it is ok. We don't want to have dispute with other countries but other countries have their pride, we need to have it also. I think the government should encourage Singaporeans to be more in someway that we are being nationalistic to our country and have pride in it and also defend on it. I hope that Singapore would not have any confilct with other countries and so there would be peace and will not hulimate any countries pride. So we must act and cannot sit there do nothing</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's no reason why we have to argue with Abdul Ghani. The crime statistics speak for themselves. No doubt high crime deters foreign investors, a silent protest like the one at CPF was harmless. The use of the riot squad was overkill. Such an event is not significant enough to cause investors to pull out &amp; shift operations to Malaysia.</div>

We dun respond tit-for-tat style; if not how different are we from them? Are we to degrade ourselves into petty neighbours like the everitt road case? Should we bring Tawian and Malaysia to the international court and sue them for damages LKY style?<br><br>Being patriotic does not = to extreme actions.
