            <div class='col-md body'>The PTC has approved the fare hike by the duopolistic companies.<br><br>Not surprising because PTC headed by that joker Eric Gui is a RUBBER STAMP.  All the CEOs and PAP politicians basically form a fraternity and breed among themselves.  You know, it's like a mass orgy of sorts with one common aim: to squeeze out as much money from the working class as possible.<br><br>I always walk past the Parliament when I go for lunch and sometimes, I'd see those rich bitches and rich spoilt kids who call themselves MPs drive jaguar and BMW and Mercedes into the compound.  Do these people look like they know how to empathise with the working class?  NO! And most of them don't even have to stand for elections!!  They just hang onto the coattails of those "well-known" ministers and enjoy $10,000 stipend a month!!  And that's on top of the money they receive as directors on company boards!!!<br><br>When there's a war, you can know where these people will run.<br><br>The PTC's deliberations are shrouded in secrecy and not transparent at all like:<br>1. Who are on the council?<br>2. Does the Chairman (that joker Eric Gui) have overriding power?<br>3. How many of them own cars and how many take pubilc transport? I'm very very sure Eric Gui that joker does not take public transport.<br>4. What is their median income?<br>5. Does any of them own SBS or SMRT shares?<br>6. THe deliberations are based on ROTA and that joker Eric Gui said that SBS and SMRT's profits are not excessive. What then is excessive????  GIVE US A BENCHMARK!! In the first place, why should the primary aim of a PUBLIC transport company be to make profit???<br><br>The fare hike will increase the coffers of SBS and SMRT by $13-14m but these fvcking assholes are only taking 10% out to help the poor!!!!!!<br><br>Next in the pipeline is the ERP extension and increase along Orchard Road by the eternally perpetually chronically USELESS LTA.<br><br>Is a 50 cent increase going to deter people from driving to or thru' Orchard Road???  No. So basically, this is a revenue raising exercise and I suspect one of the aims is to recover the cost LTA spent repairing Nicoll Highway which they destroyed due to their own incompetency.  And of course, don't forget Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong's salary.<br><br></div>

EZ card is a checking system that make us pay exact fare else more. After its implementation, the transport companies' income rose. Not long, there was a fare increase. This, despite, the public outcry then. Now, when the recession is still in full swing, an increase again.  Why are we comparing to HK and canada? HK is now recovering from the recession. HK, easily, has more than double our population and canada has welfarism. These are not the main point. The point is are these comparisons accurate?</div>
