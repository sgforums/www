              <p> </p>
              <p>Yawn. Try to come out with something new to defend your evil PAP party lah. Always use this same sentense. I read also sian already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for your info, there are alot of Singaporeans migrating already. Goh Chok Tong himself told the press that alot of capable singaporeans are migrating and Singapore must find ways to make them stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go do some research first before asking people to migrate.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I don't get it.. Why whine so much about China when you yourself are the issue? You are not good enough to stand on your own 2 feet and feed your own mouth?</p>
              <p>Your system has brought you up in such a way that you are just plain used to being spoon fed all the time. U just want everything to be spoon fed to you and if you do not get it, you complain. And being the pampered child you are, you will eventually get what you want. That was the previous situation. But now it has changed.. Now the world is more open and you are being impacted by factors outside of your puny little world. And you start complaining and nothing is happening. No nannys to run after you and spood feed you. So you start whining. Great way to go buddy.</p>
              <p>What plastic bag mentioned is true. I am working and so are many others here, so tell me if anything I state here is wrong. I have seen many a times cases where there is an opening and people from India, China and of course Singapore apply for the job. It can be a job for a guy with a diploma and our dear old locals expect to be paid 3k for it and demand all the perks and stuff. But the simple gentlemen from China or India tend to say ok to a 2.5k salary and are more loyal and work much harder too. They show much more sincerity and loyalty towards the job and company. Unlike the Singaporean who MIGHT demand much higher wages and in the end after getting all the training and stuff, resign in just under 1 year. These are facts I am talking which I have personally seen.</p>
              <p>So who is at fault? The simple foreigner or the over-demanding, over-expecting local?</p>
              <p>Go take a look at yourself in the mirror before commenting about others.</p>
              <p>You think foreigners are rude? I have seen more construction workers giving up their seats to pregnant women or old people rather than the locals. I have seen more foreigners giving their way while I cycle on the footpath than the locals. I have seen more foreigners holding the lift for me than the locals. I have seen foreigners helping people by lifting heavy objects like shopping bags than locals.</p>
              <p>In short, TS, you seriously have to take a closer look at yourself before jumping to conclusions.</p>
              <p>And please for the sake of all, stop whining.</p>
              </div>

              <p>To add on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are also lackeys of PAP like coolgeek84 who try to defend the PAP by saying that the fault is with SIngaporeans being more demanding than the foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But these naive lackeys do not realise why we are more deamding. Simply because we ahve more expenses like housing loan, support our wife and children and parents etc so we have to deamnd more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foreigners come work a few eyars save enough money than go back to their country to become rich people. Of course they can afford to demand a lesser salary.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yawn. Try to come out with something new to defend your evil PAP party lah. Always use this same sentense. I read also sian already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for your info, there are alot of Singaporeans migrating already. Goh Chok Tong himself told the press that alot of capable singaporeans are migrating and Singapore must find ways to make them stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go do some research first before asking people to migrate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't know about current affairs still want to come here and make a fool of yourself trying to support your evil PAP party</p>

              <p><br>Seriously, look at your options.  You don't like PAP.  Join opposition.  You're afraid to be made bankrupt or you want you HDB upgrade.  What else can you do?  Migrate of course.  Then they can't touch you and make your life miserable anymore.  Better still, turn in your IC and passport, you can even take you CPF with you.  Go to US or Canada or Australia or NZ.  Buy a big house and big car.  You kids don't have to study under pressure cooker environment and still can go to world class uni.  Perhaps you can get your wantan mee at $2 anymore but that is a small price to pay for what you'll get.  You just have to have the right perspecitve.  PAP will not change.  Singapore will not change.  Those in power will not let it go.  They will fight to the death.  So what options do you have?</p>
