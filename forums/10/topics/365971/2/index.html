              <p>Well said mate.. The thing is, I am very sure that I am neutral and I don't and in fact I can't partake in any political motives. Yet somehow, it was deduced that I am a strong supporter of PAP. How is that for ultimate flawed logic?</p>
              <p>And like you mentioned, there is no point arguing with these gundus.. I have to admit, they really have too much time on their hands to waste..</p>
              <p>I tried to argue with logic and pure facts instead of speculations and all they can do is come up with bullshit such as "lackey/dog" of PAP. These are what I call losers. Because they either lack the understanding to make constructive discussions through positive arguing or are plain stupid and dumb. Somehow I feel they are the later though.</p>
              <p>The best thing is, one of these gundus is gonna quote me again, even for this post, and say I am a supporter of PAP and start saying dog and don't know what not. Thats how stupid they are.</p>

              <p>Well said mate.. The thing is, I am very sure that I am neutral and I don't and in fact I can't partake in any political motives. Yet somehow, it was deduced that I am a strong supporter of PAP. How is that for ultimate flawed logic?</p>
              <p>And like you mentioned, there is no point arguing with these gundus.. I have to admit, they really have too much time on their hands to waste..</p>
              <p>I tried to argue with logic and pure facts instead of speculations and all they can do is come up with bullshit such as "lackey/dog" of PAP. These are what I call losers. Because they either lack the understanding to make constructive discussions through positive arguing or are plain stupid and dumb. Somehow I feel they are the later though.</p>
              <p>The best thing is, one of these gundus is gonna quote me again, even for this post, and say I am a supporter of PAP and start saying dog and don't know what not. Thats how stupid they are.</p>

              <p>they only want to discuss what they want to discuss, ie. selective discussion isnt it. just like selective listening, you only listen to what you want to hear.</p>

              <p>they are just armchair critics lol, if u tell them to join oppposition parties and campaign against the PAP, they are not really that interested lol. could you ask them what did they vote for in the last election in 2005 if they stand by their beliefs?</p>
