              <p>PAP is already disappointing the people. The last election is the
              proof that the people are disappointed. 33% people voted opposition. You can check the past elections records, PAP really is going downward.</p>

              are getting smarter especially due to the existence of internet. The
              government didn't enforce high restriciton on the net. The enforcement
              they did is to get law breakers. Internet is like a library, still, the

              <p><br>anyway, in the election, 100% they are going to wins, so might as well take whatever goodies they can offer and enjoy it now, otherwise, like my stubborn uncle who refuse to take it but in the end also took it, will be a total disgrace.</p>

              <p>failure is the mother of success!</p>
              <p>problem is what they consider failure. fail to win all seats to the parliament? fail to gain more % of votes compared to last election? if they acknowledge failures, setback, even a little one, they will progress. If they don't, even when they are dead, they thought they are in heaven.</p>
              <p>Most important of all, what is good for the people of Singapore? their success or their failure?</p>
