If he uses Singapore as a transit point for his import / export business, re-routes the shipment to another country.<br><br>Buying house, car, living expenses only consumes our resources. Resources that citizens pay the same price for. If they decide to leave one day, they sell their house, they could possibility get an appreciated value for the house. Cars.... only benefits the government, cost more pollution, compete for road space causing more congestion (while paying the same price as citizens). Living expenses only inflates our own living cost.<br><br>Moreover the marginal propensity to save is always higher for high income earners. i.e. if a person makes $1 million, he can spend $0.5 million and save 50% of his income (high propensity to save). Whereas a person making $12,000 will probably spend everything to sustain himself or save 10% of his income (low propensity to save).

They only have a distinction for resident and non-resident, the resident will typically spend more than 183 days in Singapore (irregardless of your citizenship); whereas if you spend less than 183 days in Singapore, you will be regarded as a non-resident (unless you satisfy the criteria for qualitative test, which you might then elect to be a resident).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Abstract from Income Tax Act:</strong></span><br><span style="color: blue;">"resident in Singapore" Â—<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(a) in relation to an individual, means a person who, in the year preceding the year of assessment, resides in Singapore except for such temporary absences therefrom as may be reasonable and not inconsistent with a claim by such person to be resident in Singapore, and includes a person who is physically present or who exercises an employment (other than as a director of a company) in Singapore for 183 days or more during the year preceding the year of assessment; and<br><br>(b) in relation to a company or body of persons, means a company or body of persons the control and management of whose business is exercised in Singapore;</span></span><br><br>The marginal tax rate for the resident is much lower than the non-resident.

Who knows, I could be a PR fighting for equality for citizens.<br><br>Well, the issue isn't about females and males, but permanent resident with citizens. They are two totally different issues. I am merely stating the disparity between permanent residents and citizens. Permanent residents are free riders in the security of our nation, they have no duty in serving Singapore, yet they derived benefits of security accruing to citizens (who serve National Service).<br><br>If you live in the same house, you either do your part in maintaining the house, else pay more money to get maids to do the work. No free loaders!!!<br><br>Permanent residents who ultimately become citizens should serve their time in national service too, like all Singaporeans do till a certain age. Like I said, issue isn't about females serving national service, as Singaporean females don't serve national service. If Singaporean females serve NS, then it's only right that permanent resident females serve NS. But they don't, so no point of contention here. Please argue logically.<br><br>PR receive less benefits than pass holder? Can you please clarify? Like you said, they are receiving less benefits than citizens, which means they are still receiving benefits. If you have no intention of staying on to help build Singapore, just treating it as a circumstance of opportunity. Why should Singapore provide you with benefits? Are permanent resident stakeholders or are they like migratory birds, ready to fly off to their country of origin at the first sign of trouble.<br><br>With the current high unemployment trend for Singaporean citizens. What makes you think that those jobs cannot be taken over by true blue Singaporean? Contributing to the economy for now maybe, but it will create long term ills. The money they save, if they use it for retirement in Singapore, there is no doubt that it will somehow contribute to the economy. If they decide to take the savings and go back China or Malaysia, it will be bad for the economy. The status of their citizenship shows their future intention, doesn't it? If you have your future retirement plans in Singapore, you take up citizenship. Why remain a permanet resident?<br><br>The status of PR only needs, I think 2 years of work in Singapore as P1 or P2 employment pass.<br><br>Permanent resident pay the same taxes as citizens, but citizens have the added disadvantage of having to serve national service 2 + 10 years. A higher tax rate of afew percent needs to recognise this disparity.</div>
