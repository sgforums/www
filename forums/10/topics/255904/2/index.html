Whether they deserve to do NS, it's for the government to decide. Can you see that these 2 topics are distinctly different, the topic is "taxes for permanent residents should be higher than citizens", NOT "should females Singaporeans serve NS".<br><br>What makes you think that they will leave for another country? Didn't we just increase the GST by 2% to 7%? Can you give me the figures of PRs who left Singapore because of the extra 2% GST? Are there Singaporeans leaving because of the 2% increase in GST? Well, if they want to enjoy the benefits, all the better if they convert from PR to citizen. Your scenario seems like a doomsday apocalypse, like as if all the companies will pull out.<br><br>If these companies send their executives over to work, do you think they have a choice of not coming? If I am the CEO of a MNC, I send my middle management over to another country, do you think he has a choice? Firstly you have to determine who is in charge of running the company. Secondly, taxes is the least understood of all subjects, if I am seconded to let's say China to work. Do you think that tomorrow I will be going to the library to find out the tax consequence of my employment in China? Do you think I will call up the Big 4 to find out the taxes? How many will actually do it? The shortfall in manpower can be accomodated by currently unemployed Singaporeans. I won't call people making $4,000 to $5,000 talents. These positions can be readily filled by Singaporeans.<br><br>I think all your arguments stems from watching our Mediacorp news, where the news are flavoured to suit the regime. Fear tactics. If this happens all of our Singaporean women will become maids......yada yada yada.......<br><br>Pay more for house, does not mean that services such as security is provided for. It just means that their housing is not subsidised, nothing more. No provision of loans is because that they are not citizens, does not mean that without the loans, the government would be able to derive income to finance our military or police.<br><br>Those resources that the government purchased and resells to us, have gone through some processes, they are not the same water or crude oil anymore. Whether they pay same rate or not, is not a matter of national policy, it's a commercial decision made by businesses.<br><br>But security is provided by the government, these services are indirect and invisible. Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PR) pay income taxes under the same tax table; Singaporeans serve national service (NS), whereas Permanent Residents (PR) don't, so obviously there has to be some distinction, else, why would anyone want to be a Singapore citizen since being one carries the burden of serving NS.</div>

You mentioned they should be receiving more benefits than employment pass holders. Why should they, can you please explain? Employment pass holders and PRs are almost the same, they have no intention of staying the course (retirement) in Singapore. Their only motive is to extract profits and move back to their home country.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jontst78:</div><div class="quote_body">The fact that they are working here already contributes to GDP. And the high unemployment should be addressed by first and very foremost, dealing with the FTs(emp pass holders). Like it or not, PRs are an essential contributor to the economy, regardless of whether they retire here or not. If you are going to slam them with a 2 year NS liablity, or higher taxes, its going to be very detrimental.<br></div></blockquote>What do you understand from the term GDP (Gross Domestic Product)?<br>GDP: The total income earned domestically, including the income earned by foreign owned factors of production.<br><br>Let's have a scenario analysis. Let's say in a household (Singapore) of 4, their combined income (GDP) is $400,000, they save their income, which becomes their reserves. After 5 years, they have a combined savings of $400,000, but 2 of the family member decides to move to another household. They extract half of the reserves which is $200,000. Which means the othe 2 household members will have only half of the reserves available to maintain house.<br><br>Whether they be FTs or PRs, they share a common characteristic, they have no intention of making Singapore their permanent home. Having them to pay a higher tax for not becoming citizens will only bring about higher employment for Singapore citizens. A small percentage will decide it's not worth their while and decide to move to another country. This small percentage of jobs will be taken up by current unemployed Singapore citizens. I do NOT believe that there will be a mass exodus of PRs just because their income tax has been raised 1% to 3% (based on the marginal structure of the tax schedule). Afterall, indirect taxes has gone from 3% to 5% and will be going to 7% in July, but the influx of FT is still peaking. Doesn't this statistic prove that taxes has little influence over the migration patterns of individuals. People based their migration on environmental factors, tax does not play a major role. If you have a choice of migration to Ethiopia (say no taxes) and Tokyo (30% taxes); which would you choose?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jontst78:</div><div class="quote_body">The rationale for that is to prove your employability, hence not become an economic liability after become a PR.<br></div></blockquote>Can you please clarify what do you mean by economic liability? The last I know the government does not provide any unemployment benefits. So what is your definition of economic liability? The closest I can envisage is a budget air ticket to your country of origin.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jontst78:</div><div class="quote_body">NS-men recieve Tax rebates, everyone else doesn't, for NS.

This accumulation of physical wealth is actually thru the CPF. Charge higher taxes to PRs, and risk a drastic drop in CPF contributions.<br><br>Do consider the fallout of the such a move.<br></div></blockquote>NS-men relief is an appreciation of those who have served National Service (NS), as compared to those who are exempted (medical disability,  religious belief and women) from serving NS. You cannot associate NS-men relief with PRs and employment pass holders, as they do not have a pre-requisite to fulfil NS liabilities (they have NO such obligations). e.g. if A from a country with an education system while B is from a country with no education system. Can you compare B as if he had an educational system. I doubt you can, because it was not even in his choice (if he had one) to pursue an education. If NS-men relief is a distinction between citizens and PRs, then it should be aptly called citizens relief and not NS-men relief.<br><br>Generating wealth, isn't that the premise of any laissez faire economic system?

By having these PRs here, a certain percentage of Singapore citizens will lose their jobs to them. By increasing the income tax by 1% to 3%, some of these PRs will leave, making room for more employed Singapore citizens. The increase in tax revenue can go into social welfare services to increase the living standards of poor citizens (not into the reserves).<br><br>A problem needs to be addressed too, with the increase in PRs our Singapore citizens will lose jobs, find it hard to eke out a living, subsequently migrate to a better country. We are losing citizens here. PRs and employment pass holders have the effect of inching out our Singapore citizens. Let's say the current currently it's 10% PRs and 90% citizens, if PRs keep coming in while the growth of citizens is in decline, it will someday be 50% PRs 50% citizens. Since the government has the intention of increasing the population till 6 million. At 6 million population, there will be alot of strain on all our public services. You need more policemen to patrol the streets. You need more NS men because our population is in decline, else some army units will have to be closed. Where are they going to find the resources to provide for 6 million?<br><br>Since PRs who have no intention of staying permanently in Singapore, only want to extract profits for a certain number of years and return to their homeland. Shouldn't we make them pay afew percentage more taxes, afterall they do not have to succumb to the hardship of NS, while citizens do.<br><br>It's better to encourage more PRs to convert to citizenship, than to let them keep the status quo as PR.<br><br>LKY's wanted independence because he was weary of watching foreigners coming to Singapore, extract their profits and return to England when time is due. Ultimately a PR who hasn't revoke his citizenship and taken a Singapore one will return to his/her homeland, thus bringing along his/her pot of gold.<br><br>If you think 1% to 3% increase in personal income tax will promote a mass exodus. Why hasn't GST (an indirect form of tax) done the same and chased away all our PRs? Perhaps tax on income is inelastic when compared to environmental factors.</div>
