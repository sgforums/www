No bonuses from gahmen like singaporean had... NSmen get higher starting pay after graduate or NS... Singaporean pay lower School fees... PRs need to pay to renew the PRships, pay a one time payment for the driving license.... mMm....<br><br>what else can we take away from those PRs ?</div></blockquote>So if they buy private housing? Medical subsidies and childcare subsidies is distinctly different from national defence. How often does Singaporean get large payouts like the progress package? Once every 5 years? Is it an entitlement or a privilege?<br><br>NS men getting higher pay? The comparison between NS men and not NS men is between citizens and has nothing to do with PRs. There are citizens who don't serve NS too. I also find your comparison hard to fathom, as these days such practice are rare. In fact, it might be a disadvantage if you have to do NS (reservist) during the course your employment. In a previous thread, someone was complaining that a person was asked to leave because his NS stint interfered with his work performance.<br><br>School fees are heavily subsidised by the government. Therefore it's only fair that the PRs pay the market price for it (without subsidies). Moreover, education is also distinctly different from national defence.<br><br>How many hundreds or thousands does a PR have to pay for the PR status?<br><br>Everybody makes payment for their driving license.</div>
