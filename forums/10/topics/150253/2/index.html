            <div class='col-md body'>i do not think that most people regard VS as an elite school, it is just an ordinary goverment boys school with a long history and above-average students, its old location at Kallang Bahru serve it well during that period of time, from the late 80s and the 90s.  Most of its students were ordinary HDB-dwellers, ordinary students who studied hard, not the rich kids you see in schools like ACS.<br><br>In a sense, the new location is rather out of the way for its usual intake of HDB type.   At the same time the richer household are unlikely to send thier chid to VS, they would remain with the Aided schools,RI and the like.<br><br>This could have caused the"brain-drain".<br><br></div>
