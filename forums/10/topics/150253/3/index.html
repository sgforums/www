It is not the complete truth but it definitely is one aspect of it.  you can't be a complete wife ignoring husband or family.  in any case i don't equate what the female alumnus said with what Frances said.  the former is a positive affirmation of the spirit and commaradie she felt from peers while the latter is a belief in a woman's priorities in life.<br><br>3) Had that been the real reason then it would've been even more unacceptable.  girls perform better because they're better with languages.  literature, geography, history ... even biology ... guys are bad with languages ... especially VS guys ... most of us are from chinese speaking families who face difficulties grappling with non-mathematical subjects ... that's why a lot of them bloom only at the 'a' levels or university.</div></blockquote>snow,<br><br>sorry for taking so long to reply.<br><br>1) Well then, I guess I would say the same for my school - tt's RI btw; well actually it's HC now.
