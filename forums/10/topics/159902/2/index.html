But let us all face the facts squarely, at that moment when Iraq was threatening the neighbouring countries again and again as it has done with intentions to use weapons of mass destruction as mentioned in the public media, what choice has USA or President Bush got except to take the initiative or preemptive actions to remove a highly dangerous regime like Iraq.<br><br>What would you suggest if Hamas and Osama continue with their actions in terrorist attacks on the innocent. In wars countries at war did not wait for full disclosures of facts before actions. Look at what Hamas and Osama have done. Do they really care about innocents being killed so why are you not condemning their wanton actions to be more productive in our discussions.<br><br>Do you want to advise Hamas or Osama that they should have full evidences about USA wrongfulness before taking actions to harm innocent people in the world trade centre's bombing. But obviously you want USA or UN to have full possessions of evidence before taking action to contain further terrorist outrage. Why keep talking about USA not being fair or democratic in its preemptive actions when terrorists are at wars with USA and the rest of the world.<br><br>What peace-loving people should see and want to see is more reasonable behaviour on both sides. USA has history on its side that it has acted in good faith in defending weaker nations (e.g Kuwait) and not just out to conquer other nations. In continuing to criticise USA without examining the nature of the dangers posed by Iraq and Iran or for that matter Col Gadaffi, what you are doing might be to encourage more terrorism.<br><br>It is for a peaceful world order that USA has acted. UN is unable to fulfill or perform that role. It is too academic in dealing with aggressions and war-mongering by Iraq with its records of war mongering. If Iran is peaceful and merely trying to defend its border, USA will not be justified in attacking Iran. But if Iran wants to be a big brother to destroy Israel for a religious cause, then the world is at war with Iran and USA or President Bush does not wait until every member of the world or UN concur with every demand to be fully satisfied with every count of evidence.  Nations at war do not wait till all disclosures before taking defensive actions. Hamas or Osamas also do not believe in such craps. They believe in hurting where it is most effective to destroy the world if their survival are at stake. Now with the world trying to make peace for them with Israel despite their past persistent aggressions, do they need to resort to terrorism or bombing of innocent and be defended by some UN laws of nations.<br><br>So let us be objective about who is currently terrorizing the world and who are the innocents that need protection from them as well.<br><br>Is USA going around the world to terrorize the innocent or cause wars? Or it is "luckily for the world" trying its best to act as policeman to protect the weaker nation. I agree that it might have its own agenda but up to this moment its agenda did not cause so many sleepless nights to most of the people in the world except in trying to contain aggressions by Iraq and Iran. If Iraq cannot be stopped one day when it acquires the nuclear weapon and decides to use it on Israel or Kuwait, will you still be here cheering for Iraq or Iran and condemning the peace-keeping actions of USA.<br><br>If we intend to go on criticising USA or President Bush for invasions of Iraq which you called it, we also must come with full facts and perspective about the actions of Saddam Husein which in the middle east appeared to take a major role of aggressions against its neighbours.<br><br>Now if Iran is going to do the same, most probably UN will have to contain Iran now. President Bush might just keep silent and do nothing and the world may have to defend itself. What if Iran is going all out to wage a war on Israel? What will be your solutions since you are so certain that USA has been wrong in its outster of Saddam and should not play the role of world Policeman as it has done in WWII and recently in the Gulf War.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Sgdiehard,<br><br>What you have replied is nothing new. I have already covered all these points about USA not being fully justified on evidences before it went on to invade Iraq to oust Saddam Husein. Right or wrong, evidence or no evidence, it has acted on good faith and it is still playing the role of peacekeeper for the world's weaker nations.<br><br>I have also replied that USA might not be acting fully in the best interests of the world and it has its own agenda. So there is no disagreement on USA's lack of candidness about certain of its actions in the course of trying to be world's policeman<br><br>If USA is to be condemned on all these errors, I would join in the condemnation if it invaded nations and colonised them for its own economic gains. Granted that past performance is no guarantee of future success, the world is currently not terrorized by USA or President Bush. It is not easy to be a peacekeeper. It is subject to rules of all sorts. But USA has no evil design of the kind demonstrated by many aggressive regimes in the past. USA with its military might can easily go around conquering the world if it wants to and not have to account its action to any diehards or UN.<br><br>So why not maintain a proper perpective in your continuous arguments against USA's dismantling of Iraq's aggressive regime or its trying to prevent Iran from playing the role of big brothers to its own sphere of influence. Iraq has been tamed after the Gulf war and Sadam Husein might have turned softer but that does not mean that it was no longer aggressive but refusing to comply with peace conditions imposed by UN with so many wars on neighbours and its genocides of millions of dissidents.<br><br>Let us face the issue squarely. If you demand USA to play the rules of nations, then you must also be prepared to get Hamas, Osama and the like not to break the rules of mutual respects for mankind and peace among nations.<br><br>If you continue to avoid answering to the view that Sadam and Osama should be contained becausea of their persistent aggressions and wrongs you are only trying to justify aggressions by these nations or regimes.<br><br>Who the will be there to contain threats posed by countries like Iraq or Iran and you have not answered by questions.

Try to tell the USA that it was wrong as it has not conducted prior weapon of mass destruction inspection or obtained some international sanctions before dropping the bombs and see what differencce that will make to the world today.</div>

Iraq lost that war and as one of the deals it conceded to occupation forces, it has to destroy its weapons of mass destructions. Iraq failed to keep up with that deal by repeated failures to observe the demands of inspection so it finally resulted in USA having to insist on accountability. US or President Bush was not without mistakes. It failed to gain international consensus which might not be easy to obtain for practical reasons. However in dealing with Iraq or Sadam, there were certain practical concerns that need to be addressed - concealments of weapons. So US acted in good faith and decided to go in to get Sadam to be fully accounted for such non-compliance with peacekeeping deal.<br><br>As part of that accountability, Iraq has to comply with US and UN requirements. UN has no teeth so it continues to be the target of international manipulations by dissenting nations who themselves are not able to bring Iraq to accountability. So US acted in good faith in enforcing a follow-up good-conduct to be observed by Iraq. That is how US moved in to enforce certain international peacekeeping role.<br><br>While one may continue to criticise US for its lack of consensus with other nations in unilateral ouster of Sadam, one must remember that Osama land and Hama too have their behaviour problems. They should learn too how to observe international conduct and  forgive past misdeeds of Isreal  instead of terrorizing the peaceful world to no end. Two wrongs do not make a right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello robertteh,<br><br>Your argument is very American. Since I am not on the side of the American, I must be on the side of the osama and the sadamn. Countries like France, Germany, India and even the Philippines are fighting the war of terrorism on their own fronts. Israel has been fighting Hamas for yrs but we donÂ’t see countries like Spain involved, does it mean that Spain is on HamasÂ’s side?<br><br>Bear in mind, terrorists attacks and suicide bombings have been in existence outside of America for yrs and it was only after 911 did the America start full scale war on terrorism. Before that, ameicanÂ’s closest ally, the saudis was funding the osama network and CIA training osama in Afganistan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> I am sure this is nothing to you. The point is, war against terrorism is not America vs the terrorists, it is the civilized world vs the extremists.<br><br>Can Â“USA with its military might can easily go around conquering the world if it wants to and not have to account its action to any diehards or UNÂ”? If the American hasnÂ’t learnt from Vietnam, by now they should have learnt a lesson in Iraq.<br><br>If we talk about  Â“playing big brothersÂ” in the middle east, we better have a proper perspective of the social and political situation there. Bush obviously does not even know who could be the big brother in Iraq. But is it difficult to find how ignorant the Americans and their diehard supporters can be about the world, its social, political, cultural and religious diversities? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Â“PolicemanÂ” never alone arrest, try and sentence a suspect, and never with his own set of laws! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>If USA Â“does not play the rules of nationsÂ”, because Hamas, Osama and the like Â“break the rules of mutual respects for mankind and peace among nationsÂ”, does it make USA the like of Hamas and Osama?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Have I not answered you about the possible threat from Iran and Iraq?? Read my posts carefully. Firstly, is the threat to be taken seriously? Is it a political propaganda? How and when can a threat from Iran become real? A fabricated threat such as that of the Iraqi WMD cannot be used again for free American military action! Secondly, if it is the threat of nuclear or other WMD, take it out like what the Israelis did to the Iraqi nuclear facilities. I am wondering why the American has yet to take action against the Kims or the threat not real? Thirdly, the gulf war should always be a good reminder that the world can be united, muslims or not, in punishing the evil.<br><br>I am not avoiding the question about containing the terrorists. My position is clear, the American has to work with the world in any military actions, and the presence of terrorism does not give USA a free hand in using its might military power in foreign territories.<br>My question to you is simple, now that the American has acted unilaterally militarily outside of its own territory, where is the check before the worldÂ’s ONE and ONLY SUEPRPOWER and MOST LETHAL MILITARY MACHINE are abused? I have mentioned this many times, donÂ’t avoid!!<br><br>Â” not listening to objective argumentsÂ”? Â“ one-sided argumentÂ”? yes, yr argument is one-sided and mine is objective, understand!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*Bravo to Sgdiehard and RoberTeh on thier views*<br><br>TO answer both your questions n woes , i keep it short n simple.<br><br>Wars waged are not cheap. No doubt USA would rather wage a war where it will later benefit through the war. Strategically thinking , would u want to use ur already stretched military to attack a barren nation like North Korea , having toppled its regime n unable to move due to the peoples resistance and US's lack of resources?Some say US should sit back while the rest of the world gets mutilated, Middle East gaining Nuclear capabilities and thier loud n obvious hatred towards Jews the the Zionist Expansionst 'USA'. Have u guys taken to accoun that Israel , due to its small size is unable to withstand 1 nuclear attack. With Iran developing Nuclear capabilities, Israel has to consider its First Strike priorities, while Iran has obvious hatred towards the Jewish state, may result in a scenario like how Saddam refuses to allow Inspectors in , providing doubts to the US n its ccoalition of the willing n there for provoking them to attack n topple teh regime.<br><br>As for the point where who police the police ? Who keeps the worlds only super power in check ? Should everyone have Nuclear capabilities to deter each other ? What is a rogue regime ? Doesn't world peace where everyone use dialogue instead of arms ? If its not USA as the superpower today.. will u want to be ruled by an Islamic expansionist regime ? a communist  world take over ? If were to let them countires as it is , u have all seen how brutal regimes and military takes over of a country and it moves on to threaten regional stability ? No one can donate relief funds if they dont have funds.I look at both sides of the picture. We have to try to look at the bigger picture n  the effect on the world and the future.</div>
