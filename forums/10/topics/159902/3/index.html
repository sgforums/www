No, they thought terrorists attacks could only happen outside of america, they never thought it could happen right there in the heart of america, new york. My former head office was in Philedelphia when 911 happened. Physical damages was nothing compared to the fear, shock and bewilderment it inflicted on the american. The american never thought that mad and lunatic terrorists could have brains. It was after then did the american started asking, who are these ppl? why are they prepared to give up their lives in order to kill us?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason why these terrorists have the guts to bomb WTC was because Bill Clinton ignored what Al Qaeda have been doing during his presidency.<br>Paul Schiffer, a military aid to Clinton wrote a best seller 'Dereliction of Duty' puts it very well from first hand up close. Those who want to know what really happened should read the book.<br><br>I think the fact that CNN and other liberal media tried to paint Bush as a dummy triggered the timing of the attack as well at the beginning of his presidency. The Arabs took cue from CNN that Bush was dumb and gambled wrongly. They took on a Texan cowboy and lost a piece of real estate in Afghanistan in the process.<br><br></div>
