              <p><strong>Please tell me, where is Israel headed?</strong></p>
              <p>By John J. Mearsheimer</p>
              <p>Benjamin Netanyahu is in the final stages of putting together
                                          Israel’s next government, which will be opposed to a two-state
                                          solution. Most importantly, the new prime minister and his Likud
                                          Party are firmly against a Palestinian state.</p>
              <p>The Labor Party,
                                          which will be part of the governing coalition and which has been
                                          identified with the two-state solution for the past two decades,
                                          did not insist that Likud support that policy as a condition for
                                          joining the government.</p>
              <p>Its leader, Ehud Barak, merely asked for
                                          and got a vague statement saying that Israel was committed to
                                          promoting regional peace. Avigdor Lieberman, who heads Yisrael
                                          Beiteinu, the other major party in the ruling coalition, is not
                                          likely to push to give the Palestinians a viable state of their
                                          own. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>His main concern is “transferring” the Palestinians out of
                                          Israel so that it can be an almost purely Jewish state.</strong></span></p>
              <p>So Israel will continue expanding its settlements in the West
                                          Bank. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In fact, the Israeli press is reporting that Netanyahu and
                                          Lieberman agreed in their negotiations to form a government that
                                          Israel would build 3,000 housing units in an area between Jerusalem
                                          and Maale Adumim (a huge settlement bloc) known as E-1.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Once that
                                          is accomplished, Israel will have effectively cut the West Bank in
                                          half, making it almost impossible to create a viable Palestinian
                                          state. This deal was supposed to be secret, because the United
                                          States is opposed to Israel building in the E-1 area.</p>
              <p>The Palestinians, of course, will remain locked up in Gaza and a
                                          handful of enclaves on the West Bank. In essence, Netanyahu and his
                                          two key ministers - Ehud Barak (Defense) and Avigdor Lieberman (Foreign Affairs) - are committed to creating a Greater
                                          Israel, which will cover all of the territory that was once Mandate
                                          Palestine.</p>
              <p>The Obama administration will surely try to push Netanyahu to
                                          change his thinking about a two-state solution and work to give the
                                          Palestinians a real state of their own. The Israel lobby, however,
                                          will adamantly defend Israel’s right to do whatever it wants in the
                                          Occupied Territories and make it impossible for the president to
                                          put significant pressure on Israel.</p>
              <p>Netanyahu, like all Israeli
                                          leaders, understands this basic fact of life. He knows that he will
                                          just have to say a few nice words about the “peace process” and
                                          blame the whole thing on the Palestinians, who he believes are a
                                          bunch of terrorists anyway, and he will be pretty much free to do
                                          whatever he wants in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
              <p>It seems clear to me and to many smart people I know that this
                                          story does not have a happy ending. Indeed, it looks like a
                                          disastrous ending.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Greater Israel cannot be a democratic state,
                                          because there will soon be - if there aren’t already - <del></del>more Palestinians between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean
                                          Sea than there are Israeli Jews.</strong></span></p>
              <p>So, if you give each person one
                                          vote, Israel becomes Palestine. That is not going to happen anytime
                                          soon, if ever, which leaves two possible outcomes: apartheid and
                                          expelling the Palestinians- and there are more than 5 million of them -<del></del> from Greater Israel. Talk about repulsive options.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is worth remembering that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said
                                          that if there is no two-state solution, Israel will end up in a
                                          South Africa-like situation and that will mean the end of the
                                          Jewish state. In effect, he is saying that Israel is turning itself
                                          into an apartheid state.</strong></span></p>
              <p>My bottom line is that Israel, with the backing of the lobby, is
                                          pursuing a remarkably foolish - Ehud Olmert would say suicidal - policy towards the Palestinians.</p>
              <p>I would appreciate it greatly if Israel’s American backers would
                                          explain what I am missing here. They must think that there is a
                                          happy ending to this story that Olmert and I simply fail to see.
                                          Otherwise they would not be backing the Greater Israel enterprise.</p>
              <p>There is no need for Christian Zionists to respond, because I know
                                          what their happy ending is: the Battle of Armageddon and then the
                                          Second Coming of Christ. Israel’s Jewish backers do not buy this
                                          story, which, in fact, many consider anti-Semitic. But they must
                                          have an alternative explanation for how Greater Israel is good for
                                          the Jews.</p>

              <p>It is naive to think that Israel will withdraw from the land won in previous wars and go back to 1967 borders.  Israel is a developed state and is among top 20 countries in the world.  Its GDP is US$205.6 billion with a population of more than 7 million people.  With the backing of its strongest ally US, Israel is dragging its feet on peace process for the past decades of negotiations.  Other world leaders just look at US for directions where it is going on this longest conflict since 1948.  </p>
              <p>But Israel should come to its senses as more than 23% of its population are Arabs.  Although ongoing racial cleansing has been going on quietly to remove Arabs from its state, Israel has to be realistic that it cannot ignore UN resolutions forever. </p>
              <p>Recently, Saudi had  proposed peace with Israel ( Israel is to withdraw from occupied territories and all Arab countries will recognise Israel) but Israel  has ignored totally Saudi's proposal.</p>
              <p>As both Israelis and Arabs shared the same  prophet Abraham, it is time the new Israel government of Netanyahu look at peace more seriously.</p>
