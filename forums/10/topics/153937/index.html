"The old should be enjoying their time, not working as cleaners."<br><br>Another participant, a 55-year-old consultant, added that Singaporeans are "trained to work, not to retire".<br><br>"It seems that people like me are being forced to work overseas. I'm planning to go to Malaysia through its 'silver-haired scheme'," he said.<br><br>Mr Phua Kok Tee, the 68-year-old CEO of Singapore Action Group for the Elderly, said that more should be done to tap into the service industry to provide jobs for the elderly.<br><br>"For example, in Borders in the United States, 16 per cent of its staff are 50 years old and above, as compared to just 6 per cent in 1999.<br><br>"This only came about after a conscious and concerted effort to provide employment for the elderly," he said.<br><br>This "constant cry for employment", given the participants' ages and relatively successful backgrounds, surprised Tampines GRC MP Sin Boon Ann, who chaired the session.<br><br>The 47-year-old MP asked the participants: "It's interesting how many of you are still thinking about finding or sustaining employment. Why not retire early and enjoy life? If it's a case of finances, what are your expectations?"<br><br>He added: "I suspect in Singapore, our expectations are set by the pace of life. A lot of pleasures don't have to cost the sky. For me, it can be just bringing my family to the beach."<br><br>If it is a question of financial security, many Singaporeans are putting unnecessary stress on themselves, he said.<br><br>But isn't the high cost of living a real issue?<br><br>Speaking to Today, Mr Sin said: "The cost of living could be a concern but I do not think that it is such a worry as to cause the elderly to be pre-occupied with staying employed.<br><br>"With adequate savings, planning and careful budgeting Â… they should have enough to see them through their old age."<br><br>He went on to assure Singapore's greying population that the country would not leave them behind.<br><br>"What they should perhaps realise is that we have a social safety net to look after them. They should take comfort in the fact that, should they run out of savings when they are older, there is always the family to fall back on.<br><br>"If there is no family support, then of course, the society and the community will look after them. And this is what making Singapore as a nation is all about." - TODAY/sh<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is our materialistic society that make us not retire early. I bet Atobe will say that it is the rising costs of living.<br><br>Think again, no one forced us to buy condos, cars and live off credit right? Living within your means is the answer to retiring early.<br><br>I am real estate agent and most of my client landlords are driving entry level Japanese cars, ie Corolla, Sunny etc. They are old and living off the rental income from the properties they own, mind you we are talking about $8k avg a month, which I think is damn good lor.<br><br>They worked their way to pay off the mortgage loan of these properties and live off the "pension" they are getting from them.

I love to enjoy the simple luxuries life has to offer because I only live once and if it's not now, then when?<br><br>There is seriously no point in working our whole lives away. But really, some people cannot afford the luxury of doing so. Because not everyone earns enough to allow them to retire early. You know many people in this "first-world country" are receving third-world salaries, don't you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Add that with a family to support, and it can be really taxing.<br><br>Another problem with our society is some deem "people who can work but dont work" = lazy. That way, people are pressurized to retire later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a matter of fact, everything in Singapore come with a life time tag. Even a freehold real estate property is not really "age-proof", just take reference to the Fook Ji Building that was successfully aquired by the LTA at a "reasonable" market price by "certified" professional valuer.<br><br>Lessons learnt:<br>1) A property, irregardless if it is a 99yrs, 999yrs or even free hold, is still a real estate. It can be aquired by the gov for nation development eg building MRT or road or even car park.<br><br>2) A property is best to sell of at a pre-determined target profit margin, than to hold and wait for better valuation; before any unforeseeable events cock-up.<br><br>3) Never put all your eggs in a single nest. Some of Fook Ji residents actually dependent on rental returns to meet the ends.<br><br>4) "En-bloc" development is always desirable, but have to take risks due to unforeseeable events.<br><br>It would recommend a more reliable gold and forex FD (dual currencies - 1 account in USD and the other in Yen, AUD or GBP) in some reliable big foreign bank to build up your retirement. Use the CPF careful, it would be wise to invest your CPF in property (at least it can last you about 40years - with reference to Fook Ji Building) rather than shares/unit trust, or maybe some gold when the price is right. It is advisable not to overstretch the CPF payment for a real estate, you never know if the contribution celling is coming downwards or you loan interest would sky rocketed (US interest rate is still somewhere near the all time low level).<br><br>Car ownership is good to have, but not really a necessity for many people. Car ownership can drained a big time from your pocket. 1 Honda FIT at SGD60K at a 90% loan at 2.6%, can easily come out to around SGD110K after you finished repaying your loan. This handsome of $$$ can really enable you to get big $$$ in the 10year stock market cycle or put in other more gurantee investment vehicles (bond funds, insurance or forex fixed deposit). Please take note that you would need to do some homework before making your own investment decision. It would be best if you can do some read up on the technical papers. Good Luck!!<br><br></div>
