              <p>Are we going to see another revolution in China just like how CPC kicked KMT out of China? Maybe when the PRC is kicked out of China mainland onto a small island then maybe they would understand why Taiwanese are fighting to be recongized as a country same goes for every other countries' governments, our government too.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I'm not surprised if China collapse...I meant given our Chinese history, our ancestors seen dynasties collaspe and rise for thousands of years so why be surprised today?</p>

              <p>Interesting. What is Human Rights? Can you list them? How do we define them? How do we know that they are Rights and not Previlages? How important are these Rights compared to others not in the list? Interesting questions..... no?</p>

              <p>Howlheje, I'm afraid you might have to update your knowledge on China. Communism is way out of China's concern at the moment. Sure, every now and they, they pay some lip services to communism or socialism, but hey, is Shanghai and Beijing any less capitalistic than any Western countries? Forcing people to have only one child may sound cruel, but can you imagine China to have 50% more of its current population? The one Child policy was a tough call, but without it, China will be in a much deeper shit hole. Falungong guys are indeed unfortunate, but hey, those folks aren't exactly saints either. Their influence was certainly too much for CCP's comfort.</p>
