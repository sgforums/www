              <p>We live on a ball of limited resources, and there is a need for these "scholarly nerds" in order to make sense and properly identify  problems before they occur.</p>
              <p>I don't, of course regard our precious ministers as being capable of doing that. When you reach that level of power, kissing ass is more important than being able to understand hard Maths. The research is done by those below you, and all you need is to approve it.</p>
              <p>I certainly don't see our government's methods of identifying talents as being valid in a rapid changing ( and in my opinion going to radically change) world.</p>
              <p>But i certainly would not dismiss the valuable insights the "scholarly nerds" could give. Passion can sometimes arise from being ignorant of how doing one thing does not neccessarily lead to another. 8 years of George Bush Jr and Dick Cheney should have taught us that.</p>

              <p>You are of course looking at the negative side of "Passion" in political leadership.</p>
              <p>As much as there are negative examples of "Passion" there are also POSITIVE examples in political leadership - one of which we are all familiar in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most passionate leaders stayed too long and become corrupted by their own success and believe that they are infallible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Talent" is "Talent" - in good or bad forms - talent is subjective only in the "quality", "intensity" or "volume" in different persons.</p>
              <p>Skills - trained or naturally gifted - can only help the person in performing a task, it will still require passion to propel oneself to higher levels of human aspirations.</p>
              <p>Whether a scientist or engineer or business person make it as a political leader will depend very much on the character of the person in being able serving the Public.</p>
              <p>Some are cut out better in academia and even when forced into the public spotlight to serve - will fail miserably, as there are some who are simply contented in their present status quo and prefer to insulate themselves from all others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While a hawker may not have the qualification, but will have the street-smart sixth sense of finding the best way to survive, and when backed up by a team of trained advisers whom he can gather and galvanised into a Team, should we stop and prevent such a person from holding public office ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should the Singapore political system make it exclusive for scholarly talent, if the Talent Pool is supposed to be limited as it is ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you refer to US politics as a point in discussion, there were quite a few Presidents who were not academically inclined but have proven themselves far better than the skewed passions of George Bush Jr and Dick Cheney - (which as I had stated in my previous response that each have their own agenda for holding public office).</p>
              <p>Ronald Reagan was a Movie Star who became President and whose passionate positive spirit drove the US into prosperity during his term, and knocked the wind out of Soviet Russia drive to dominate the World with their Communist ideology.</p>
              <p>Passion = Drive = Commitment = Leadership</p>
              <p>For 52 years, Singapore has known only one type of politics - the LKY-PAP type.</p>
              <p>We should not allow our disgust with the skewed PAP political ideology to affect other options that are driven by the Positive Elements of what the PAP has corrupted.</p>

              <p><br>To sort out your muddle with 'passion', do allow me to qoute one forumner's wise words which explains 'passion' best here:-</p>
              <p>"The first article of faith is: human life has value. Once you stop believing in that, then you are capable of any evil." - by Cram 10th Jun 09. Cultural revolution Mao...Chit Chat.</p>
              <p>For any political leader to succeed, is the need for him to understand the qoute above. And from there, will solutions to elevate the lives of those whom he seeks to lead will begin to formulate, take shape and progress seen.</p>
              <p>It does not take a rocket scientist, an engineer, or an artist to comprehend the value of human lives. Even a roadsweeper understands it, which is why he continues to perform his job and did not give up and become a useless member of society by committing suicide.</p>
              <p>But a roadsweeper obviously may not be able to lead even a constituency, let alone a nation, for there are complexities in governance which even present well educated Harvard Grads are not prepared for in our ever changing world.</p>
              <p>The buck ultimately stops with him. Make a wrong choice and his followers will be doomed. It is not the fault of the less well educated for their lack in education. There are many more social reasons than just pure 'laziness' as most presumed.</p>
              <p>Thus, it is the responsibility of the well educated to lead, as a team, to create opportunities for the less well educated to level up in life, instead of just selfishly leading their own ivory tower life. There is a debt of honour to be paid for a civilised society to thrive, grow and mature, to make our country a better place for everyone or at least a significant majority.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the 'skewering' of politics being  presently observed is the belief that the value of human life had been twisted towards along the lines of Utilitarianism - only the best and most useful survive and are courted, the rest to fend for themselves or free to die out.</p>
              <p>The value of human life is total, absolute and for every individual human, not just applicable to the best. No one, not even the down and out, must be left out and must be helped to rise in life. Such is the egalitarian  'Passion'  that is needed in a politcian that seeks to be a leader of our lives.</p>

              <p>Passion and Talent are interdependent and neither is sufficient on its own. </p>
              <p>Citing the example mentioned by Atobe, surely passionate hawkers would be able to lead a nation if he's set out to do it, but is he trustworthy? Will you entrust the entire nation into his hands? (And that is why in your argument you mentioned 'a team of trained advisors', because he alone does not have the garnering power) Btw, I see 'a team of trained advisors' to be the equivalent of 'scholarly nerds'. </p>
              <p>Everyone needs to prove his or her worth in society, and sadly, paper qualifications are the few, if not the only yardstick to measure this 'value' of a person. You may be the most passionate person, but if you don't have the talent, then there's no point. </p>
              <p>There are so many people out there dreaming of becoming President, but how many can make it? Firstly, they may not have the passion and drive to fulfill their dreams, and secondly, their lack of knowledge (as referred to by being a 'scholarly nerd') stands in their way. </p>
              <p>A talented person would not hold out at the job for long if there's no passion. That person would ultimately be ousted by the people if he or she does not do the job well. </p>
              <p>Talent + Passion = Leader</p>
              <p>Talent only Leader = Heartless Leader</p>
              <p>Passion only Leader = Brainless Leader </p>

              <p>Passion and Talent are interdependent and neither is sufficient on its own. </p>
              <p>Citing the example mentioned by Atobe, surely passionate hawkers would be able to lead a nation if he's set out to do it, but is he trustworthy? Will you entrust the entire nation into his hands? (And that is why in your argument you mentioned 'a team of trained advisors', because he alone does not have the garnering power) Btw, I see 'a team of trained advisors' to be the equivalent of 'scholarly nerds'. </p>
              <p>Everyone needs to prove his or her worth in society, and sadly, paper qualifications are the few, if not the only yardstick to measure this 'value' of a person. You may be the most passionate person, but if you don't have the talent, then there's no point. </p>
              <p>There are so many people out there dreaming of becoming President, but how many can make it? Firstly, they may not have the passion and drive to fulfill their dreams, and secondly, their lack of knowledge (as referred to by being a 'scholarly nerd') stands in their way. </p>
              <p>A talented person would not hold out at the job for long if there's no passion. That person would ultimately be ousted by the people if he or she does not do the job well. </p>
              <p>Talent + Passion = Leader</p>
              <p>Talent only Leader = Heartless Leader</p>
              <p>Passion only Leader = Brainless Leader </p>

              <p>Who is an economic 'Talent'?</p>
              <p>Just because one has a N level cert, or O level cert, or A level cert, or Uni degree, or Phd, it does not make him a talent. Some who obtain such certification would wave the paper in the air and declare themselves as 'Talent' but more often than not, are simply passive passengers on the ride of real talents.</p>
              <p>A Talent is just simply someone who can analyze a problem critically, and come up with practical solutions to solve it in the shortest time possible.</p>
              <p>It takes experience for one to became a talent in our ancient past, for only in making mistakes will one know where the errors were made and to be avoided, thus elders were often revered. But with the introduction of education, it was hoped that the elders experience can be passed on to the new generations, to shorten the time frame in experiencing problems.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most youngsters seldom take the advice of their elders, and bang their heads on the wall instead to learn. It is only a few that are matured enough to truly believe in what was taught, and to apply it, that made them became valuable to society. Such people are the true talents, in whatever field they work in, from the cleaning industry to leadership of nations.</p>

              <p>You are of course looking at the negative side of "Passion" in political leadership.</p>
              <p>As much as there are negative examples of "Passion" there are also POSITIVE examples in political leadership - one of which we are all familiar in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most passionate leaders stayed too long and become corrupted by their own success and believe that they are infallible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Talent" is "Talent" - in good or bad forms - talent is subjective only in the "quality", "intensity" or "volume" in different persons.</p>
              <p>Skills - trained or naturally gifted - can only help the person in performing a task, it will still require passion to propel oneself to higher levels of human aspirations.</p>
              <p>Whether a scientist or engineer or business person make it as a political leader will depend very much on the character of the person in being able serving the Public.</p>
              <p>Some are cut out better in academia and even when forced into the public spotlight to serve - will fail miserably, as there are some who are simply contented in their present status quo and prefer to insulate themselves from all others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While a hawker may not have the qualification, but will have the street-smart sixth sense of finding the best way to survive, and when backed up by a team of trained advisers whom he can gather and galvanised into a Team, should we stop and prevent such a person from holding public office ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should the Singapore political system make it exclusive for scholarly talent, if the Talent Pool is supposed to be limited as it is ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you refer to US politics as a point in discussion, there were quite a few Presidents who were not academically inclined but have proven themselves far better than the skewed passions of George Bush Jr and Dick Cheney - (which as I had stated in my previous response that each have their own agenda for holding public office).</p>
              <p>Ronald Reagan was a Movie Star who became President and whose passionate positive spirit drove the US into prosperity during his term, and knocked the wind out of Soviet Russia drive to dominate the World with their Communist ideology.</p>
              <p>Passion = Drive = Commitment = Leadership</p>
              <p>For 52 years, Singapore has known only one type of politics - the LKY-PAP type.</p>
              <p>We should not allow our disgust with the skewed PAP political ideology to affect other options that are driven by the Positive Elements of what the PAP has corrupted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>I could also say you are looking too much at the positive side of "Passion" in political leadership.</p>
              <p>We are both looking at the same thing, but reaching different conclusions to it based on difference of experience, upbringing and knowledge. Both are valid, neither is wrong. If you want your democracy this basis has to be established.</p>
              <p>If the hawker could prove himself then yes your logic is correct. However, Passion to do good for the country is subjective, and there is a difference between what is good for the short term for the country and what is good for the long term.</p>
              <p>While the hawker may not neccessarily make bad decisions, the odds are stacked against him making good short term decisions and bad long term decisions because he is not knowledgeable about history and its precedents.</p>
              <p>I am glad you chose Ronald Reagan as an example because i was reading up on him.</p>
              <p>Yes, during Ronald Reagan's Era taxes were down. But he also ran up the national debt from 700 billion to 3 trillion. Essentially, the prosperity of today is paid by the children of tomorrow.</p>
              <p>That to me is unacceptable. The job of the current generation is to leave something better for the next generation to inherit, not to burden them with debts. I don't care what fancy economic theories the Yales, Harvard and MIT boys think of, that is plain wrong.  </p>
              <p>That's is precisely my distrust of the academically less inclined. The tendancy for quick results and ignoring the long term implications.</p>
              <p>You hail Ronald Reagan for his accomplishments but i find nothing worthy of getting my children to pay for my enjoyments. That's praising the grasshopper and saying the ants are stupid.</p>
              <p>I certainly do not view LKY as a hero or visionary. I accept him as a human, he had some nice ideas and they're twisted and corrupted because the world changed and the ideas did not. That is the way of all things.</p>
              <p>Democracy promises many great possibilities, but it can also promise great acts of stupidity. The wise are often badly outnumbered by the fools and fools have often thought themselves wise.</p>
              <p>Idealism of Democracy implies Faith, and Faith denies evidence.</p>

              <p>Who is an economic 'Talent'?</p>
              <p>Just because one has a N level cert, or O level cert, or A level cert, or Uni degree, or Phd, it does not make him a talent. Some who obtain such certification would wave the paper in the air and declare themselves as 'Talent' but more often than not, are simply passive passengers on the ride of real talents.</p>
              <p>A Talent is just simply someone who can analyze a problem critically, and come up with practical solutions to solve it in the shortest time possible.</p>
              <p>It takes experience for one to became a talent in our ancient past, for only in making mistakes will one know where the errors were made and to be avoided, thus elders were often revered. But with the introduction of education, it was hoped that the elders experience can be passed on to the new generations, to shorten the time frame in experiencing problems.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, most youngsters seldom take the advice of their elders, and bang their heads on the wall instead to learn. It is only a few that are matured enough to truly believe in what was taught, and to apply it, that made them became valuable to society. Such people are the true talents, in whatever field they work in, from the cleaning industry to leadership of nations.</p>

              <p>i agreed with the first half but not necessary the 2nd half.</p>
              <p>If Bill Gate chose to finish college what do u think "Window" looks like today? or do we have "Window" at all?</p>
              <p>If Bill Gate were to finish college he would be busy preparing exam. Rather than pursuing on his interest. of course we all can said well he could do part time.</p>
              <p>i don't think he was particularly worried that he would not please his parent, or not getting a degree when he chose to pursue his passion fulltime.</p>
              <p>i just think that we need to review what we learned and how it was taught.</p>

              <p><strong>Regarding Bill Gates, you do not need a college degree to be able to write software. Therefore whether you need education or not to succeed depends on what it is that you want to do. An entrepreuneur can also employ the people with the right education.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>What is so great about the USA is that even a college drop out like Bill Gates can get the funding to develop Microsoft.</strong></p>

              <p><br>I could also say you are looking too much at the positive side of "Passion" in political leadership.</p>
              <p>We are both looking at the same thing, but reaching different conclusions to it based on difference of experience, upbringing and knowledge. Both are valid, neither is wrong. If you want your democracy this basis has to be established.</p>
              <p>If the hawker could prove himself then yes your logic is correct. However, Passion to do good for the country is subjective, and there is a difference between what is good for the short term for the country and what is good for the long term.</p>
              <p>While the hawker may not neccessarily make bad decisions, the odds are stacked against him making good short term decisions and bad long term decisions because he is not knowledgeable about history and its precedents.</p>
              <p>I am glad you chose Ronald Reagan as an example because i was reading up on him.</p>
              <p>Yes, during Ronald Reagan's Era taxes were down. But he also ran up the national debt from 700 billion to 3 trillion. Essentially, the prosperity of today is paid by the children of tomorrow.</p>
              <p>That to me is unacceptable. The job of the current generation is to leave something better for the next generation to inherit, not to burden them with debts. I don't care what fancy economic theories the Yales, Harvard and MIT boys think of, that is plain wrong.  </p>
              <p>That's is precisely my distrust of the academically less inclined. The tendancy for quick results and ignoring the long term implications.</p>
              <p>You hail Ronald Reagan for his accomplishments but i find nothing worthy of getting my children to pay for my enjoyments. That's praising the grasshopper and saying the ants are stupid.</p>
              <p>I certainly do not view LKY as a hero or visionary. I accept him as a human, he had some nice ideas and they're twisted and corrupted because the world changed and the ideas did not. That is the way of all things.</p>
              <p>Democracy promises many great possibilities, but it can also promise great acts of stupidity. The wise are often badly outnumbered by the fools and fools have often thought themselves wise.</p>
              <p>Idealism of Democracy implies Faith, and Faith denies evidence.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In Life, we have to have faith in the positive side otherwise it will be sheer misery.</p>
              <p>What is the premise of anyone's FAITH in something ?</p>
              <p>FAITH has to have a beginning - can it deny evidence ?</p>
              <p>If one's position cannot be changed by evidence, what does it make a person insisting to depend on his faith ?</p>
              <p>Where will "blind faith" lead an intelligent person, let alone an uneducated one ?</p>
              <p>This is the folly of a closed minded society, in which everyone is expected to have faith in the Great Leader.</p>
              <p>This is the embodiment in your statement - "<em>I certainly do not view LKY as a hero or visionary. I accept him as a human, he had some nice ideas and they're twisted and corrupted because the world changed and the ideas did not</em>."</p>
              <p>He had blind faith in his own ideas, and in his own relevance - where did that kind of faith bring Singapore ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronald Reagan served a purpose in his two terms in the USA, it provided a foundation from which Bill Clinton was subsequently able to bring USA forward.</p>
              <p>It did not take the USA generations to recover from the debt that was a consequence of Ronald Reagan's ideas and policies.</p>
              <p>Times changed, and the US democratic process threw up a Bill Clinton who stayed for two terms and brought the US Treasury into the Black again.</p>
              <p>The USA will recover from the deliquencies of George W Bush and Dick Cheney, as the creativity, productivity, and industrial strength of the USA is from the hardworking energy of immigrants from all over the world seeking a new beginning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore before LKY was a mix of migrant people - mostly without education, and they build Singapore to be the Jewel in the Crown's possession that rival Hongkong with a longer and more established history.</p>
              <p>With the limited talent that Singapore is suppose to have, should we limit ourselves only to the educated to provide leadership ?</p>
              <p>The educated should not be deceived by their own conceit, even as much as they realised their dependence on those lesser than themselves.</p>
              <p>That is the problem with LKY who continue to believe in his own conceited supreme ability - that only himself and those whom he select can lead Singapore forward - even as much as he depend on ordinary Singaporeans to stay in power.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12pt;    " lang="EN">"If I were in authority in Singapore indefinitely without having to ask those who are governed whether they like what is being done, then I would not have the slightest doubt that I could govern much more effectively in their interests."</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the danger that Singaporeans have to face - individuals who outlived their relevance, and who are unaware of their own station in Life.</p>

              <p>I don't see it as likely for China or US to collaspe. Maybe for US a lost era will come and China will catch up. But once US does sth crazy that makes usd$ worthless, no doubt China will take an important hit, but China only holds like 1+ tril of us debt.</p>
              <p>Serious consequences that should keep US rationale with their money supply:</p>
              <p>USD will not be the world reserve -- officially. All countries that deal with US will suffer terribly due to world trade, and considering US's status in the world trade. Countries will rise from the rubble, most probably the BRIC. But then again, it depends on how the survivors maintain the public's confidence in their currency.</p>
