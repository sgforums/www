              <p>Let's do a little history lesson - Singapore gained independence because of good timing... nothing else.</p>
              <p>@US$ … For anyone that’s interested …</p>
              <p>A small essay on the GBP and US$ :</p>
              <p>Reserve currency: Replacing $$ has huge implications</p>

              <p>Surfersvillage Global Surf News, 7 June, 2009 : - - A country who
              holds what is called the reserve currency has what De Gaulle called ‘an
              exorbitant privilege’. Other countries in order to get hard currency
              (usually USD) have to physically make ‘stuff’ and sell it to buy cars
              from Japan, clothes from Asia, machines from Germany etc. In order for
              the U.S. to get more dollars, it only has to run the Federal printing
              presses. Hey Presto – more USD…</p>
              <p>The U.S dollar replaced the Pound Sterling as the worlds reserve
              currency after WW2 after the Bretton-Woods conference which was held to
              design the post war economic order, create the IMF and World Bank etc.
              When the US Govt made a deal with the Arabs to trade oil in Dollars in
              return for protection, that sealed the fate of the Pound. Everyone
              needed oil, therefore everyone needed dollars to buy it. The demand for
              them grew and the need for Sterling collapsed.<br> …<br> …<br> Before WW 1, Britain was a creditor nation, had buckets of cash and
              held the reserve currency (GBP) – the British empire ruled a quarter of
              the worlds surface. WW1 and then WW2 were ruinous and the U.K went to
              being a debtor nation owing massive amounts to foreigners. The balance
              of power shifted after the Bretton Woods conference and British Govt
              policy – knowing that they could no longer afford a huge navy and
              soldiers in outposts in India, Kenya, South Africa, Malaysia,
              Singapore, Burma and all the other outposts of empire was called ‘the
              orderly management of decline’ and they started to wind it all down
              granting independence to each country during the 40’s, 50’s, 60’s etc.</p>

              <p>On the basis of the reasons for Britain's decline as offered by Spade1, it is evident that the USA is in the same position as Britain was after WW-1 and WW-2 - as the USA is caught in a quagmire of two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
              <p>Besides the two wars, the USA has a huge military to maintain its operational readiness, as well as to provide development funds for the development of new systems and new platforms to maintain its military edge over others.</p>
              <p>Will China ever find herself in the same situation as Britain and the USA ?</p>
              <p>The possible scenario that will have China committing heavy expenses that will bankrupt herself is when she has to respond militaristically to prevent a rogue government in Taiwan declaring independence.</p>
              <p>The other possible scenario will be to support a failed North Korean Government from foreign aggressions; or alternatively to embark on a military adventure to discipline the North Koreans for disrupting peace in the region.</p>
              <p>Other then these two hot issues that can affect China's prosperity, she will probably scrape through successfully with the help from her large number of talented and well educated citizens.</p>
              <p>Will the Communist Party allow China collapse ?</p>
              <p>Will China's leaders ever become so ignorant about global issues that will bring them through the same path that bankrupted the USA ?</p>
              <p>In the past few decades, China has been a prolific learner to bring herself to the current state of national well-being; and as China's economy grow - she will surely continue to learn and adapt herself to changing circumstances to maintain her new found status quo.</p>
              <p>China has the trillions in her reserves that will allow her to employ the most talented to help her manage into the future.</p>

                                This RMOFA analyst, Igor Panarin, is an ex-KGB foreign affairs analyst that has been predicting the fall of the USA for over 20 years. (Google his recently released papers).  Anyone predicting the fall of the USA in this manner doesn't understand how political power moves in the USA. It can not break up into 6 pieces since the USA would have to completely disintegrate before the US Constitution would be ineffective in holding the USA together. If that were to happen an internal force would most likely try to move in and take over before allowing outside forces to carve up the States.

                                The USA will not collapse, but it will lose its moral standing in the world by overturning its own "rule of law." The laughing of the Chinese students at Sec of Treasury Geightner is only the beginning of this event. We, in the USA, have only to blame ourselves. We lecture the world, and then do exactly what we say others shouldn't do. It's sad, but it probably take an internal revolution to get the USA back on track if it even still possible.

              <p><br>Surely it's just as dangerous to rely on passion no?</p>
              <p>We live on a ball of limited resources, and there is a need for these "scholarly nerds" in order to make sense and properly identify  problems before they occur.</p>
              <p>I don't, of course regard our precious ministers as being capable of doing that. When you reach that level of power, kissing ass is more important than being able to understand hard Maths. The research is done by those below you, and all you need is to approve it.</p>
              <p>I certainly don't see our government's methods of identifying talents as being valid in a rapid changing ( and in my opinion going to radically change) world.</p>
              <p>But i certainly would not dismiss the valuable insights the "scholarly nerds" could give. Passion can sometimes arise from being ignorant of how doing one thing does not neccessarily lead to another. 8 years of George Bush Jr and Dick Cheney should have taught us that.</p>
