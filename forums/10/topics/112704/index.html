            <div class='col-md body'>Named in 1643 for the day of its discovery by British seafarer Captain Williams Mynors, Christmas island was annexed and settlement begun by the United Kingdom in 1888 after phosphate was discovered in samples collected by the British ship Flying Fish in what is now Flying Fish Cove. Phosphate mining began in the 1890s using indentured workers from Singapore, China, and Malaysia.<br><br>The island was administered jointly by the British Phosphate Commissioners and District Officers from the U.K. Colonial Office through the Straits Colony, and later the Colony of Singapore.<br><br>Japan invaded and occupied the island in 1943 and interned the residents until the end of World War II in 1945. At Australia's request, the United Kingdom transferred sovereignty to Australia in 1958.<br><br>The first Australian Official Representative arrived in June 1958 and was eventually replaced by an Administrator. Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands together became Australia's Indian Ocean Territories in 1995 with a single Administrator resident on Christmas Island.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>good work Dr Who. your background information on Lim Hock yew was indeed valuable but i sure hope it was true. how did you know that?<br><br>in fact few ppl in singaporean know much about him and Christmas island. why? probably the PAP now are trying to cover this chapter of singapore history as the unpretty ones. we should put the christmas island issue as a social education for the young ones. to remind one should never sold it motherland away in any circumstances.<br>we can blame LHY. why didnt the parliament approve it in the first place? can someone elightened me, which party was LHY in?<br><br>This is becoming interesting part of singapore history.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>according to my wife. christmas island havent change alot since singapore sold to australia. and the islander prefer the unchange way of life esp aussie adminstration.<br><br>For those who are interested to see red craps, old singapore 4 storey flats you can fly from perth weekly flight to CI. Or alternatively i think indon also have some weekly flight too.<br><br>There are some house stay in the island. but bring more money coz flight from perth cost more than $1500. return.<br><br></div>
