SIngaporean's fault<br><br>To conclude, u have only yrself to blame for getting yrself in debts<br>Thus, pls review yr financial statement and live below yr means to gather asset so as to be able to retire.<br></div></blockquote>There is a large amount of truth in what this guy is saying. But if you want to look at it from a different angle, its because of the class discrimination system that has happened in our society. If you make it to an elite you can have it all!<br><br>And with the rising number of elites, things become more expensive and jobs becomes more few due to them being taken up by degree holder. Of course there are scholarships for those that can get them. But then again, they are usually given to children from ELITE families who don't really need that kind of money. Work hard and save up to study? Ya possible but most will have to study part time. Did I forget to mention that only children from elite family can afford to study full time in u for 3 years and also get a fully sponsored car? You see now? Its a vicious cycle. ELITES are the majority in Singapore and whatever they say will become rite! Why. The majority is always correct what!<br><br></div>
