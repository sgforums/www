            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black; font-size: 11pt;     '>Personally, it is a bad thing because I am living in a more crowded place. I get frustrated as I see many PRs unable or unwilling to integrate. <br><br>I have come across one PR who went about sneering at the local Chinese. It really made me sat up and asked why this guy is here in Sg. Someone has to tell him the awful truth - shape up or ship out but no one did. <br><br>From the govt point of view, population spike is as good as a revenue collection spike - from increase in GST and other taxes to faster circular flow of business fund.<br><br>The professional PRs are not coming here to serve Singaporeans on hands and feet. Singaporeans need to understand that they are here to work side-by-side. In some cases, the PRs will be boss, lecturer, supervisor etc. <br><br>So my shock when I came across forumites who associate the PRs with servitude, like those of the work permit holders. <a href="/forums/10/topics/354888?page=2">see link</a>  <br><br>The PRs are not here to do the unwanted, unclean, dangerous jobs that Singaporeans don’t want. They may start with these jobs but they will never end up with these job. Why?<br><br>Because the PRs that the govt selected are already the top tier of their birth nations. Many forumites will dispute this. Both views are correct simply because the top tier will also bring their family members - parent, wife, husband, children etc who may not also belong to top tier.<br><br>I know because when I did a post-graduate course, I met huge no. of PRs from Myanmar, India, Philippine and Vietnam. 80% of my classmates were PRs. The Singaporeans in my cohort had Bachelor degrees. The PRs, 60% had Master degrees, the other 40% had MBBS degrees. Imagine my shock when I discovered some even had two Master degrees.<br>  <br>What can Singaporean do in order to keep our job? I really don't know. But I can add this. <br><br>Comparing Singaporeans and PRs. The PRs are hard working and diligent people – but to a point of being straight jack and narrow-minded. The Singaporeans are more flamboyant and creative.  <br><br>To survive this new Singapore order, personally, I think we should beware of these:-<br>1) don’t underestimate the PRs, 2) think out-of-the-box for solution, 3) don’t let fear, frustration or impatience distract we, Singaporeans, from our long term goals. </span></p></div>

              <p>As a human being, i respect the everyone who come to Singapore to earn a living.Because we are afterall human being not animals.I don't blame them for taking our rice bowl because honestly speaking, they are really hardworking.</p>
              <p>But, but... the bad thing is, our government let in cats and dogs.Did not monitor who to take in.Just take in anyone.Cats and dogs meaning those garang kuni also from China<br>???How they manage to get in in the first place?Since they are garang kuni, how come they can get in to work as one?Where is the rule and regulations on who can work here and where they can work?No one bother to make a check?</p>
              <p>Something strange going on here, isit that the government afraid that the economic crisies will hit hard at their election vote that's why they are letting in more and more foreigners and give them red citizens so that they will vote them?Anyone want to comment?</p>

              <p>After all, why aren't the talents (instead of paying other-worldly compensation to a bunch of incompetent despots and their cronies) of the Obamas, Sarkozys, Browns, Merkels, Berlusconis and Asos tapped given the better returns they offer for their services?</p>

              <p><br>Well, for a start, its should be good, talents to help us progress, increase our population and balance our demograhpic disparity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the economy context, the word "talents" is always in the eyes of the beholden, how you define talent, how talented are they, are they a group of stepping stone talents or a passing by talents. Are they really helping our economy or just making up the nos. The govt need to justify that their contribution thru satistics or figure, to Singapore so as to prove that we do progress because of Foreign talents factor. Are these talents fully committed to work and make singapore a better place to live in or are they here as a free raider due to our open economy that embrace foreign talents. Are these talents because of their poor conditioned countries, taking singapore as a temp hidding place, which is peaceful. Lastly, are we attracting the correct talents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the social context, it is a test for singaporeans, how are we going to accept them, how are we going to hold our pledge of regardless of race, language and religion and just base on talents, vice versa, how are these talents going to suit into our society, are they going to accept our culture or critises and laugh on it, are they able to appreciate our older generation effort that make them here today. Is the govt going to look at talents and Singaporeans on a equal basis, equal footing, if so, how about male foreigner talents serving in NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY said to those foreigners, if you got the skills, the talents, the certificate and the experiences, no matter who you are, where you are from, we welcome you. So, we have become a country whereby the govt is doing the marketing for us to attract foreign talents, and of course as you know in marketing, u need nice words and curry flavoring voices, imagine what will happen if LKY said to those foreigners, if you are former convict of your country before, if you a former drug addict, if you buy your certificate which is most available in your own country, if you come from a culture of talking loudly with ill manners, if you dislike a greying society, if you refuse to pay taxes, if you critise alots and if you are a lazy bum, if you refeuse to accept singapore culture, please dun come here. I guess foreigner talents still come because their own countries cannot offer them anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if you ask me if foreign talents here is good or not, u need to compare a 3rd world foreign talent and a 1st world foreign talent, because i believe in attracting the very best talents, the 1st world talents, but the 1st world talents mostly stay in their own  wonderful countries, why should they migrate, so in a nut shell, we hv to ask ourselves, out of 1000 foreigner talents we take in, maybe 999 are rubbish.</p>

              <p>So if you ask me if foreign talents here is good or not, u need to compare a 3rd world foreign talent and a 1st world foreign talent, because i believe in attracting the very best talents, the 1st world talents, but the 1st world talents mostly stay in their own  wonderful countries, why should they migrate, so in a nut shell, we hv to ask ourselves, out of 1000 foreigner talents we take in, maybe 999 are rubbish.</p>

              <p><br>Well, for a start, its should be good, talents to help us progress, increase our population and balance our demograhpic disparity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the economy context, the word "talents" is always in the eyes of the beholden, how you define talent, how talented are they, are they a group of stepping stone talents or a passing by talents. Are they really helping our economy or just making up the nos. The govt need to justify that their contribution thru satistics or figure, to Singapore so as to prove that we do progress because of Foreign talents factor. Are these talents fully committed to work and make singapore a better place to live in or are they here as a free raider due to our open economy that embrace foreign talents. Are these talents because of their poor conditioned countries, taking singapore as a temp hidding place, which is peaceful. Lastly, are we attracting the correct talents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the social context, it is a test for singaporeans, how are we going to accept them, how are we going to hold our pledge of regardless of race, language and religion and just base on talents, vice versa, how are these talents going to suit into our society, are they going to accept our culture or critises and laugh on it, are they able to appreciate our older generation effort that make them here today. Is the govt going to look at talents and Singaporeans on a equal basis, equal footing, if so, how about male foreigner talents serving in NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LKY said to those foreigners, if you got the skills, the talents, the certificate and the experiences, no matter who you are, where you are from, we welcome you. So, we have become a country whereby the govt is doing the marketing for us to attract foreign talents, and of course as you know in marketing, u need nice words and curry flavoring voices, imagine what will happen if LKY said to those foreigners, if you are former convict of your country before, if you a former drug addict, if you buy your certificate which is most available in your own country, if you come from a culture of talking loudly with ill manners, if you dislike a greying society, if you refuse to pay taxes, if you critise alots and if you are a lazy bum, if you refeuse to accept singapore culture, please dun come here. I guess foreigner talents still come because their own countries cannot offer them anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So if you ask me if foreign talents here is good or not, u need to compare a 3rd world foreign talent and a 1st world foreign talent, because i believe in attracting the very best talents, the 1st world talents, but the 1st world talents mostly stay in their own  wonderful countries, why should they migrate, so in a nut shell, we hv to ask ourselves, out of 1000 foreigner talents we take in, maybe 999 are rubbish.</p>

              <p>I agree that comparisions must be made inorder to claim a thing to be bad or good. But not only compares but comparisons must be a good one and made on even grounds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like the principle of my previous school show us a photo of homeless africans. She reminded us how fortunate we are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But what is she hinting at? Since she compares us to poorer country, shall we also compare ourselves to richer countries to remind ourselves how unfortunate or poor we are, not able to enjoy free medications from the govt? So i think its always fair to compare both sides and come to a conclusion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And when one says FT... i would always ask... does he mean FT as in Foreign Talents? Or FT as in Foreign Trash? Its a big difference when u see foreign workers spit, pee and pollutes the air of our transport system.</p>

              <p><br>It is therefore very important for the govt to syncronise the culture shock our fellow singaporeans is at time, suffering from influx of foreign talents. Many a time, i see the less graceful lots of foreign talents than a graceful one, not only to talents from PRC or Indian, even those from Europe and State.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My Dad said the real talented and well groomed ones are not here, we can only attract the 3rd or 4 tiers of the world talents, and these are usually drop out or just make it talents looking for a place to show their power and talents. Once you label a foreigner a talent, psychologically speaking, he stoods proud and look down on us or the old singaporeans, when he forget that these old peoples are the our nation builders. To them, as I spoke to some, it is a hit and run scenarios, they got nothing to loose but more to gain, given a job, a citizenship or PR status, they roamed singapore as tho they are the elite and most wanted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, I do not blame them, afterall they are invited, and as invited guests, they assume to be well and better treated on a higher level.</p>

              <p>Hell to my Hitler!!!</p>
              <p>Operation Geyland had 3 contingents, one is licensed, the other is freelance, and one more is contact pros.</p>
              <p>The freelance needs to pay a certain amount to the SS there so as to hv a strong foothold, most are on a month social pass,  however they can renew their monthly visa by going into malaysia or batam and then back to singapore at approx $350/per person, everything bao all. They can also get contact to do it at ICA at a higher price, most PRC, vietnam come by this way.</p>
              <p>The license ones are 2 year work permit, 2 weeks HIV check, they hold the so call white card. Consist mostly of thai gals but now even PRC gals are licensed. You will be surprise that the owner of these pros shop are CID, anti vice  and high rank police officers joint venture to get a common rep to run it. Well, it is legal afterall.</p>
              <p>The Contract or contact ones are those with no money at all, they came in here by prepaid and protected by the SS, the first 80 times of sex money will be given to the SS, so they do 80 times free just to pay what they own to the SS for their airfare, food, lodging and protection. This is also unlicensed one. Usually you will see a pimp doing the marketing for them.</p>
              <p>Dun listen to those uncles too much, most of the time, they are talking nonsense after alcohol inducement or kenna mei hwa to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope that answer you queries.</p>
