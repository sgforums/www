              <p>Hell to my Hitler!!!</p>
              <p>Operation Geyland had 3 contingents, one is licensed,
              the other is freelance, and one more is contact pros.</p>
              <p>The freelance needs to pay a certain amount to the
              SS there so as to hv a strong foothold, most are
              on a month social pass,  however they can renew
              their monthly visa by going into malaysia or batam and then
              back to singapore at approx $350/per person, everything bao
              all. They can also get contact to do it at ICA at a higher price,
              most PRC, vietnam come by this way.</p>
              <p>The license ones are 2 year work permit, 2 weeks HIV check, they
              hold the so call white card. Consist mostly of thai gals but now
              even PRC gals are licensed. You will be surprise that the owner of
              these pros shop are CID, anti vice  and high rank police
              officers joint venture to get a common rep to run it. Well, it is
              legal afterall.</p>
              <p>The Contract or contact ones are those with no money at
              all, they came in here by prepaid and protected by the
              SS, the first 80 times of sex money will be given to the SS, so
              they do 80 times free just to pay what they own to the SS for their
              airfare, food, lodging and protection. This is also unlicensed one.
              Usually you will see a pimp doing the marketing for them.</p>
              <p>Dun listen to those uncles too much, most of the time, they are
              talking nonsense after alcohol inducement or kenna mei hwa to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope that answer you queries.</p>

              <p>by the way, as I said before, angel7030, I believe you should have the graciousness to apologise for unacceptable comments made about our guys who serve NS, which you made in another thread. Unfortunately, you seemed to just disappear from that thread when you realized your comments were uncalled for.</p>
              <p>True, you may be the owner of pub(s), but, you should also display the maturity of giving others respect, and at the same time, giving yourself respect.</p>

              <p><br>Apologise, oh! NSmen asking me for apology just because I make some comments on that forum, OMG, how are our guys going to war, I feel very unprotected, very insecure and worst, paying Taxes to support a bunch of NS guys who cannot even take a lady comments. So bloody Lame. Come on guys, learn to take thing hard on, swallow it if you have to. Personally, i have never seek apologise from guys even they make so much comments on we gals, cos we know, guys will be guys afterall.</p>

              <p>Respect is in the eyes of beholden, some see u with respect, some see u with no respect and the most dangerous is those who got jealous because you are being highly respected to the extend that they start to plot a plan for your downfall, common in politics, so, u better becareful about being respected ya.</p>
