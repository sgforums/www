              <p>All these so-called foreign talent  are here and eventually will live - cos the only reason is cos its a stepping stone to ..., the govt is oblivious or feigning ignorance to the plight of singaporeans ( which in today's parlance is a non-entity- if u know what i mean)- u know lar, politics n economics go together - so whose arse is saved , i doubt its ours lor.</p>
              <p>At a time like this - dont u think that Singaporeans ought to be allocated first choice and really, genuinely when and there is a need to fill up posts or ....  it is alrite to do so.</p>

              <p>True to a certain extent only. If you're paid $800 to $1000 per month, OT only 1.5 per hr even for Sundays and holidays, have family to take care, bills to pay, how can you make do with that as a Singaporean?</p>

              <p>1) We can't attract the top-tier talents. Singapore is usually 2nd or 3rd choice. Top choice countries include USA, Australia, Canada... in fact, quite a few who come to Singapore also treat it as a stepping stone, ie to get to the country of their top choice.</p>
              <p>2) I dispute your point that Singaporeans are creative. On the contrary, I feel we are devoid of creativity, that's why this country is so boring.</p>

              <p><span>Soul_rage<br> <br> I disagree but no hard feeling, please. This is an old thinking.
                  Since late 1990s till now, we have a steady stream of
                  top talent flowing into Singapore.<br> <br> I’ve met PhDs from US, Europe working, studying etc here. I asked
                  them why here -  they gave all sort of reasons, from wanting
                  to experiencing new culture, to marrying local, to liking certain
                  aspect of Sg that is not found in Europe. (Like Warren Buffet
                  preparing his children strategically for a rising China.)<br> <span> </span><br> We cannot use our Singaporean's preference or judgement to gauge
                  why they come. The world is in a flux state. The old thinking about
                  permanent residency is obsolete. Ask the young on how they see
                  themselves living and working in the future and you will get a
                  shift in thinking that is very diff from a generation ago.<br> <br> Can we agree that not all top talent are Whites from the US and
                  Europe but Asia, with its youthful population, is a growing source
                  of top talent? The reality of walking our streets is that they are
                  flooded with Asians and not Whites.<br> <br> As LKY said, Singapore has something for these Asians – an Asian
                  society, top infrastructure, hour flight from home country etc.
                  Singapore has been attracting these professional and they are
                  taking up PR here, not heading for greener pasture of US or
                  Europe.<br> <br> I agree with your previous posting on our public service being
                  headed by highly paid executives, and as a result, they are afraid
                  of sticking their necks and initiate change when change is
                  needed.<br> <br> But my take on creativity is in the context of the
                  man-on-the-street. By creativity, I was referring to our people
                  vis-a –vis the top talent coming Asia - Philippines, Myanmar,
                  India, Vietnam, not in the context of the bureaucracy, the firm or
                  the govt.</span></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well, I disagree with you, no offence too.</p>
              <p>And if you read my posting, I was referring more to the youth talent programme, that of attempting to lure top youths from countries like India, Indonesia, China to here to study and then bond them to Singapore in the hopes that they would settle down in Singapore. (I wasn't referring to mature talents like the overaged or past-prime expats :p)</p>
              <p>My understanding (and it's not just one or two that I encounter with, my friendship circle is very globalized) is that especially China youths attracted here, are not the top tiers. The top tier youths go direct to USA. The 2nd-tier ones come here, with the hope to apply for a USA university from here. Many of them succeed, henceforth, the term, "Singapore is a stepping stone"</p>
              <p>As for Indonesians, they truly treat Singapore as a good place to come to, so perhaps we indeed attract the top-tier.</p>
              <p>Any my take on creativity, is not because you or I am stupid or lousy. It's our education system and our society. We are trained to think in one direction. Most of us would just think of things in one perspective, and we are well-known good workers (but not well known in creating leaders). I know our govt is selling the propaganda that Singapore is becoming more creative, but I feel we are still miles away.</p>
              <p>So long as they continue to restrict press freedom, political freedom (I am not talking about 110% freedom, but they should really start to LISTEN to opposition views, and not dismiss them as irritating bugs making a lot of noise), societal freedom, etc, we will never open up and become a more creative society.</p>
              <p>After studying in a global environment (I had schoolmates from Singapore, China, Indonesia, India, Mauritius, Vietnam), and working in global environments interacting with people from Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, I realized that our views are too restricted due to the country we are in. Only after interacting with all of them, did my creativity start to improve.</p>
