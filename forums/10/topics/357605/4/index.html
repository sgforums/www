              <p>Eh? I thought you were the one who said you want to communicate your ideas through to people? That's why you use so extreme remarks coz it would make people think?</p>
              <p>So now you are contradicting yourself by saying that there are lots of clones in this forum?</p>
              <p>Whether my posting is antagonizing others, is besides the point. The point is, my intention is NOT to antagonize, if my posting does, it's purely unintentional</p>
              <p>For your case, your postings are meant to antagonize people.</p>
              <p>By the way, I don't necessarily respect old people. A lot of old people are no longer following the times, so their advice are not realistic. Of all people, you, who claim you are a pub owner and seen the ways of the world, bring up the advice of a grandmother.</p>
              <p>Either way, I don't want to get into any fights with you, because I don't see the need to bring myself to your level. You only serve to make others dislike and detest you. For me, I only view you with pity, not dislike nor detest.</p>
              <p>There's something called moral education, which I feel you should go to. Success is not only based on opening a pub and earning $$$. It's about being a person.</p>
              <p>I will stop here and ignore your postings if it doesn't contribute to the thread, because if I continue trying to explain the issue to you, I will be committing what your grandmother said, that I become a person who disrupts discussions, like you.</p>

              <p>this is my take on foreign talent.</p>
              <p>The main crux of the issue is that the government has been too lax in considering what constitutes a foreign talent.</p>
              <p>Foreign talent system itself is not a problem, it's the implementation.</p>
              <p>Instead of setting proper criteria on bringing in talent, the govt is just abusing the word "talent", bringing in all types of people resulting in competition of jobs at all levels.</p>
