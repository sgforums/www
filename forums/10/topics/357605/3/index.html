              <p>One of my friends told me that he considered himself a "nomad", someone who doesn't have a fixed home and just wanders around from place to place.</p>
              <p>I asked him don't he consider Singapore his home?</p>
              <p>He replied that everytime he steps out of his house, the feeling that he gets is that this isn't his country, it doesn't belong to him and he doesn't belong here.</p>

              <p>I can tell you that your way is a form of extremism that will not get any listening ears. No one will want to listen to you, when you stereotype unnecessarily.</p>
              <p>Either way, that's all I am going to say, coz I don't think I can achieve my objective of making you comprehend what I mean, so I will stop here.</p>

              <p>But your way of doing things only serves to antagonize people, which is not your objective according to what you tell me.</p>
              <p>I can tell you that your way is a form of extremism that will not get any listening ears. No one will want to listen to you, when you stereotype unnecessarily.</p>
              <p>Either way, that's all I am going to say, coz I don't think I can achieve my objective of making you comprehend what I mean, so I will stop here.</p>

              <p><br>sure, look at MRT and those food courts, business is so good, and me too, my pub also need to import foreign beers and employ more peoples so as to make them happier, so far as i see it, it created jobs for singaporeans too, and bring more business to SME business like mine. For sustainability, it is a matter of how much our small island can hold, not a matter of economy and politics and jealousy</p>

              <p>pork butchers n frends  might be yer employer but certainly not politicians....why????</p>
              <p>it is the mind training by years of education to see if they can take streesss n punishment when exposed to non-chicken rice and pork chop problems.</p>
              <p>years of maths and science will see if they can reasin logically.</p>
              <p>great emphasis on maths to see if the person is born with the capability to lead and think straight n proper...it describes the logic of a person....eg 2+2=5)if small mistakes are commited and u get killed because of simple basic system...then that person is not trained in the mind...or worse not born with it.</p>
              <p>do u get Rambo and train him or was he born with it?</p>
              <p>ans:he must be born with it......the trainin and education trims and makes him to a rambo.if rambo goes to war with no trainin in weapons then he dies.and if rambo wasnt born like a rambo and just has trainin...he also dies...then there wont be rambo 2 ,rambo 3 and rambo 4.he will just die in episode 1 in some police station.</p>
              <p>so that answers pork n chicken story</p>

              <p>My Dad said the real talented and well groomed ones are not here, we can only attract the 3rd or 4 tiers of the world talents, and these are usually drop out or just make it talents looking for a place to show their power and talents. Once you label a foreigner a talent, psychologically speaking, he stoods proud and look down on us or the old singaporeans, when he forget that these old peoples are the our nation builders. To them, as I spoke to some, it is a hit and run scenarios, they got nothing to loose but more to gain, given a job, a citizenship or PR status, they roamed singapore as tho they are the elite and most wanted.</p>
