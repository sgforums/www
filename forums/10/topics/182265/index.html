I do see them both as Foreigners and Vice-Visa.<br><br>Between the two.. I must say I like PRCs better, they were able to commumicate on the same level and not much air - except some PRC students who think we are too slack and not academically serious.. but we do get better results (due to our grasp of English.) . But all in all, I would say it's a cultural difference. On the Businese end, they are very shrewed associates - Have to watch my back and pockets more often.<br><br>I personally do not like working with Taiwanese, their attitude is really bad, irresponsible and needs supervision.. at least of those I met. I will not take their words for anything and assume nothing they say will came out the same as discussed.<br><br>To sum it up... our cultural mentalities are different but we do share some similar cultural roots. Gambling is one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>On the Japanese, I do not fear nor hate them.. this generation are now a very different people than those of the 1940s. But their current Government are still very much bedded with the mindset of their emperial days. they have the same hawkish administration for the past 50 years... their FM Aso scares me.</div>
