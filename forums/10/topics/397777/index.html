              <p class="art-PostHeader">Temasek Review</p>
              <p>In spite of the prevailing public sentiments, National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan repeated his stance yesterday at Parliament that HDB flats are still “affordable” to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah used a formula called the debt service ratio (DSR) which compares the monthly mortgage installment to the monthly household income to substantiate his claims.</p>
              <p>The DSR ranges between 17 to 25 percent for new flats and around 30 percent for mature flats in central locations.</p>
              <p><em>“These figures are within the international benchmark for housing affordability, which ranges from 30 per cent to 35 per cent,” </em>Mr Mah was quoted as saying in the Straits Times today.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah also admitted that “it is possible that prices of resale flats have risen faster than incomes when indexed against different years.” in response to a question by PAP MP Lim Biow Chuan.</p>
              <p>In an extensive interview with the Straits Times a few weeks ago, Mr Mah used two sets of figures from the years 1999 and 2009 to show that the relative pace of income has “out-paced” that of HDB flat prices.</p>
              <p>The statistics were disputed by Reform Party member Hazel Poa who wrote on her blog that the results would be different if the base year is different, causing much embarrassment to Mr Mah.</p>
              <p>The increasingly unpopular Mr Mah has come under fire of late from Singaporeans for his failure to control runaway HDB flat prices which have hit a record high in the last few months, caused partially by rising demand fueled by mass immigration.</p>
              <p>Though PRs form some twenty percent of the buyers in the resale market, Mr Mah insisted that they have “negligible” impact on the prices.</p>
              <p>He also lashed out at first time home buyers for being “fussy” and having “unrealistic” expectations.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah earns around $2 million dollars a year, or more than 4 times the annual salary of U.S. President Barack Obama.</p>
              <p>PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew castigated Singaporeans for being “daft” should they cast a protest vote against Mr Mah in the next general election over sky-rocketing HDB flat prices.</p>

              <p>actually, whatever the hell index and base years they put out is moot...</p>
              <p>just like my ex-boss who could not see beyond the figures...</p>
              <p>an increase of 1 to 3 is an increase in 200% while the increase of 10000 to 12000 is 20%...</p>
              <p>he told me to put in the bulk of our resources to "tackle the very huge increase"</p>
              <p>back to this... ultimately, a resale flat at most places command a COV of tens of thousands of dollars... i've been trying to get a flat... there was one which was over 30 years old, the interior is "renovated" (actually just patched up with the cheapest material possible)... the owner wanted a $100k COV for it saying that the renovations cost them $48k... this was a 5-room flat...</p>
              <p>there are 4-room flats also commanding the same nett price!</p>
              <p>even when we see flats that are absolute wrecks, the COV is around $30k to $40k</p>
              <p>that is in addition to the insane valuation which seems incomprehensible at best... how the hell does a 4-room HDB (read that as "tenement" because that's what it actually is.. tenement apartments) flats command a price of around $500k??</p>
              <p>a friend of mine once said this:</p>
              <p>buy flat - CPF gone<br>renovate flat - savings gone<br>buy furniture - credits gone</p>

              <p>actually, whatever the hell index and base years they put out is moot...</p>
              <p>just like my ex-boss who could not see beyond the figures...</p>
              <p>an increase of 1 to 3 is an increase in 200% while the increase of 10000 to 12000 is 20%...</p>
              <p>he told me to put in the bulk of our resources to "tackle the very huge increase"</p>
              <p>back to this... ultimately, a resale flat at most places command a COV of tens of thousands of dollars... i've been trying to get a flat... there was one which was over 30 years old, the interior is "renovated" (actually just patched up with the cheapest material possible)... the owner wanted a $100k COV for it saying that the renovations cost them $48k... this was a 5-room flat...</p>
              <p>there are 4-room flats also commanding the same nett price!</p>
              <p>even when we see flats that are absolute wrecks, the COV is around $30k to $40k</p>
              <p>that is in addition to the insane valuation which seems incomprehensible at best... how the hell does a 4-room HDB (read that as "tenement" because that's what it actually is.. tenement apartments) flats command a price of around $500k??</p>
              <p>a friend of mine once said this:</p>
              <p>buy flat - CPF gone<br>renovate flat - savings gone<br>buy furniture - credits gone</p>

              <p><br>so be it, but if u are cash rich, why still be conned under HDB, i go into private property because we dun want to be con by HDB, even we need to loan more, we do it, at least we are out of the HDB ever Conning process, same goes to CPF, try to get out of it, if you are in, you are been conned from both corners, the HDB and CPF, aren't they related??? see the picture??</p>
