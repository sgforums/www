              <p>Actually, all of you miss the point.</p>
              <p>New HDB is still affortable to many Singapore. However, the govern is masking the picture in that it is allowing foreigner to buy resales and private apartments. The truth is Singaporean will aspire to live in better housing and will upgrade. The catch is when you upgrade you hope to sell the HDB for more and upgrade to condo. Than you will end up with huge loan. In today market, I would not be surprise it is in the millions.</p>
              <p>Still dont get the picture?? utimately, the money go back to the government in land sales and foreigner who profit and leave the country.</p>
              <p>The cycle goes and gover will peg HDB to condo price and the bubble goes bigger and bigger.....and.....</p>

              <p>Actually, all of you miss the point.</p>
              <p>New HDB is still affortable to many Singapore. However, the govern is masking the picture in that it is allowing foreigner to buy resales and private apartments. The truth is Singaporean will aspire to live in better housing and will upgrade. The catch is when you upgrade you hope to sell the HDB for more and upgrade to condo. Than you will end up with huge loan. In today market, I would not be surprise it is in the millions.</p>
              <p>Still dont get the picture?? utimately, the money go back to the government in land sales and foreigner who profit and leave the country.</p>
              <p>The cycle goes and gover will peg HDB to condo price and the bubble goes bigger and bigger.....and.....</p>

              <p>I dun think its affordable. Me and my gf calculated, we need at least 3 years to save up in order to pay for the deposit of a 4 room HDB flat lor.</p>
              <p>Then after that pay 30 years. At age of 55 pay finish, CPF empty lor. With 10 more years to earn retirement $$$, Singaporeans have to work until and into their graves....</p>

              <p><br>In the first, place, nobody said you must buy a HDB flat, there are many other option, by renting, you can save your CPF, and also can ditch tents at some cosy parks is also another good ideas, but if you and yr gf are thinking of having baby, dun do it in the tents, cos a lot of peoples will be watching, at least get a hotel, i recommend Angel's hotel for couples and backpackers, just beside Angel's Pub, Joo Chiat.</p>
