It is, in essence, a source of cheap <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">skilled</span></span></strong> labour - just look around and see if any developed countries actually pay their engineers, doctors, lawyers, accountants or other professionals the sort of derisory offer you see being touted around in this regime. Amazingly, thugs writing their own million-dollar paychecks struggle to comprehend why Singapore's ablest and brightest are leaving in the hordes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

When you have an artificially demand-induced economy that serves to function and compete with the external free markets, is it any wonder why Singapore's real wage growth is among the lowest in the free, developed world?<br><br>In fact, it was the very same principles that brought chaos to USSR and PRC in the 80's (although in those cases, it was rather more extreme as they tried to convert a state-managed economy to a free-market one rather too quickly).
