Housing rentals have also been rising in other global cities such as Hong Kong.<br><br>Recruitment consultants that The Straits Times spoke to said some companies are responding to the changes by adjusting the allowances that their expatriate employees get.<br><br>While the allowances vary across industries, estimates indicate that they have risen by about 20 per cent.<br><br>Some figures cited:<br><br>A chief executive officer who previously received between $10,000 and $20,000 in allowance per month would now get as much as $12,000 to $24,000 a month.<br><br>A vice-president or regional head who was entitled to between $8,000 and $15,000 a month would now get a new allowance of between $9,600 and $18,000.<br><br>With an increasing trend for companies to give their employees a lump-sum package that covers housing, it is mainly senior executives who still get a separate housing allowance.<br><br>Mr Charles Moore, managing partner at recruiting company Heidrick and Struggles, said: 'The revisions have been mostly market-led, rising from 15 per cent all the way to 100 per cent, according to the new rentals.'<br><br>But there are still companies which have yet to revise their allowances - although it looks like there is growing pressure on them to respond.<br><br>Feedback from the expatriate community has led the American Chamber of Commerce to consider urging companies to make changes.<br><br></div>
