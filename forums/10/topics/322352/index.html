              <p>Take a larger view of what could be done to reverse the mistakes of past LKY type of taxing and killing the economic competitiveness.</p>
              <p>We could have
                  arrived at being a greater country if we had put our resources built up over the years to work
                  smartly for the past 20 years without his top-down selfish LKY  alienation
                  of the people dividing them into elites and non-elites rich and poor.</p>
              <p>Up
              to now his ministers like MBT are continuing with his selfish taxing and hoarding and
              profiteering way which is the quickest way to run down the ecoonomy or driving off the hardworking and enterptising people to other countries.</p>
              <p>He is still by his taxing hoarding and profieteering way attempting to convert the whole of middle class and lower middle
              class citizens into more useless goons by his type of policies. That is
              the reason now many citizens can no longer start a small business
              ending up as useless goons waiting to drive a taxi or clean the table.<br> <br> By his constant housing tax on low-cost housing and double- and triple-
                  vehicle tax alone without solutions to problems he has been driving up
                  the costs of doing business by taxing and hoarding and profiteering way
                  of running this country that no one or very few can start a small
                  business to keep the economy running or competitive.<br> <br> By pushing up the costs of doing business, we are now a down-grade
                  moribund economy drifting to find a small window of survival and easily
                  driven into recessions in the slightest world downturn.<br> <br> What can we do to make the economy competitive or stay in business?<br> <br> Two solutions: (1) For big businesses like GLCs - increase fees and charges with excuse like "no free lunch <br> <br> (2) Ministers stop all the LKY-style of taxing and hoarding monies in running the country.<br> Ministers are appointed from people with experiences in running the
                  whole business structuring and revamping total business strategies of
                  calibre like Dr. Winsemius Goh Keng Swee or Ooi Hong Leong or Stanley
                  Shih not those who only carry balls or bags or favors to charge higher
                  costs like maboro tan.<br> <br> Find a more capable group of ministers who have the overall knowledge
                  and command and ability and get them to be working furiously on
                  restructuring the economy to a value-adding economy as Goh Keng Swee
                  has done. Targets: created the latest IT inventions to tap into the
                  global super-personal-communications business, mastering the micro-chip
                  or wafer fab new technology applications and converting the entire
                  energy system to solar-based and wind-based system for street lighting
                  and lesser-powered practical technology.<br> <br> He should stop hiking property and selling lands to make profits for
                  HDB or URA at the expense of citizens as such property play finally
                  ends up impoverishing the ordinary people benefiting only a few rich
                  and the powerful elites.<br> <br>So oppositions will have to Get real and start to work the economy based on motivating all citizens and not just the rich and the elites to benefit themselves as LKY has been doing. Without showing the oppositions have such capable strategies and ability to translate them into a collective team of good people, there will be big problems.<br> <br> If the oppositions can understand such problems as posted in the foregoing then they can avoid repeating the same mistakes made by LKY and win over the people eventually. New era needs new solutions.</p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>In reply to your post, I like to say,</p>
              <p>1. Allow much more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">private sector competition in gubby-related businesses</span> in the PRIVATE sector like NTUC fairprice in order to lower down prices of daily neccessities like rice; </p>
              <p>2. allow <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more competition in PUBLIC TRANSPORT</span> to lower  down prices of  public transport like Bus service, MRT service (now 1.5 players only); </p>
              <p>3. allow more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">public utilities competition</span> like Electricity whose price has gone up substantially ;</p>
              <p>4. allow more  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">flexibility in using the HDB</span>;</p>
              <p>5. allow more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">subsidy for University education</span> for all citizens , wherein more should be given to citizens than PR foreigners and non-PR foreigners;</p>
              <p>6. allow the People more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">control over their hardearned money</span>, to use their CPF OA for emergency situations like, child's University expenses (local and overseas uni);</p>
              <p>7. allow the People <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more control over their SA and MA </span>cpf accounts to be used in all forms of medical as well as investment purposes, up to extent of using 95% of them. 5% will be frozen until they retire.</p>
              <p>8. encourage the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">People to run for presidential elections</span> such that the People can vote for their president, who should ideally be someone as great as the late, venerable Mr Ong and ideally non-partisan.</p>
              <p>9. encourage the young to speak in public, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">agree-to-disagree on policies in a legal and lawful manner</span> wherein the message is sent across and not violence. Income tax REBATEs for all good suggestions heard in public and all good debates where people agree to disagree openly but peacefully and high-EQ'ly. In other words, let the people learn of a standard, publicly acknowledged way to do so.</p>
              <p>10. encourage more competition within  parties so that with competition, a better leader emerges. It is known fact that competition produces the best.</p>
              <p>11. encourage more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">leadership renewal</span> wherein the worst of the performers get replaced by new blood which can come from new citizens pool.</p>
              <p>12. encourage <span style="text-decoration: underline;">new immigrants to become politicians</span> to run for seat in parliment by slightly improving current way of granting citizenship. Anyone foreigner qualified enough should be eligible to apply for citizenship to run for MP or Major or Minister. Of course, a high standard selection body should be inplace. This body has to be non-partisan absolutely.</p>
              <p>13. create <span style="text-decoration: underline;">body of auditors to audit the auditors</span> completely. they must non-partisan absolutely.</p>
              <p>14. allow more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">'live' telecast</span> if not delayed telecast of 'live' recordings of court cases that are of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public Interest</span>. Let the people judge also. Real gold no-scared fire burn.</p>
              <p>15. allow the people to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appreciate more how wonderfully our investment funds are performing </span>by publishing annually the B/S and P&amp;L of major if not all investments. At least, a body of elites who are non-partisan , entirely, must exist to audit these financial statements.</p>
              <p>16. encourage more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-partisan elites to sit on the boards of directors</span> of major and local companies, listed and non-listed.</p>
              <p>17. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">investigate</span> into the phenomenon of the situation of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">singapore dream of world cup 2010</span>. What happened to it? Why is it the current status? Was enough paid to players and since their salary hiked, what achievements have they to show ? Should citizenship be granted to more foreign players to replace most of current squad so that maybe got more chance? Also, investigate any kaykaylonglong if any, not that I suspect there is any.</p>
              <p>18. provide more subsidised or even partially <span style="text-decoration: underline;">free legal services to help consumers</span> fight for their rights against errant service providers. access to Legal service should never be a privilege for the filthy rich only, not that the poor have no access. they have less access.</p>
              <p>19. last aint not the least, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">encourage parties to unite</span> with other capable  parties  to form an alliance to compete in the next electoration. The wholesome aim of this is to allow more technically eligible voters the chance to vote. So many never know what is voting like as they nebber done it before. This is to allow the people to participate in nation building process more, to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make them less apathetic</span> which actually affects their lives almost completely. </p>
              <p>wow, so many leh . I no energy say liao. Sian ah. I talk to you folks later.</p>
              <p>The Oppos has their plates full. I still got more to say. Like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">casinos</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crime rates</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">national security</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accountability</span> , <span style="text-decoration: underline;">transparency</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">justice</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equality</span> so as to achieve....</p>

              <p>More carparks. No summons. (Free Carpark) - <span style="color: #ff0000;">Agree</span></p>
              <p>Essential item (Rice,Oil, Salt) remains at a very low price - <span style="color: #ff0000;">Disagree, this is market control but Gov should step in during stagflation.</span></p>
              <p>Study Loan With no interest <span style="color: #ff0000;">- Agree</span></p>
              <p>Withdrawn topping up 3/4 tanks to Malaysia. Free Toll Charges to Malaysia For singapore cars and motor. 3rd causeway to be build via Pulau UBIN<span style="color: #ff0000;"> - Disagree. You can become a Malaysia citizen if you like Malaysia so much and earn a Malaysian salary.</span></p>
              <p>Revive of SMC instead of GRC. Reduction of MPs. Bukit batok, Hong Kah North, Bukit Gomak So
                              small. 1 MP is enough. NO Senior Minister title or Minister Mentor Title for the Prime
                              Minister <span style="color: #ff0000;">- Agree</span></p>
              <p>Reduction of Ministers' Pay- Make it same as USA, Prime Minister pay US 400,000 per annum ( Same with U.S
                              President) <span style="color: #ff0000;">- Disagree. Ministers deserves good salary if the performance is good but not ridiculous salary. Ministers salary should be peg according to mean income of lowest 20% band of Singapore and it should be given a percentage according to their rank (i.e. PM = Base x 500%, Ministers = Base X 400% and NMP = Base) NMP do not need additional salary since they hold their main job and is doing NMP work part-time.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I like to add that Ministers should have proper and relevant experience before given a portfolio. Military officers should just retire instead of given guaranteed position in stat boards. And all GLC/Stats board must hire employees with relevant experience rather than fresh out of college. Our Gov cannot be run by paper pushers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ministers must be held accountable for their position and be subjected to terminiation and even prosecution when they fail.</span></p>
              <p>Hold Prime Minister for only 1 term <span style="color: #ff0000;">- Two terms is okay but law should be written against dynasty. Son/daughters cannot become PM if their father/mother is. Grandchildren maybe but only after two preceeding non-related PM. In addition, when a person hold high office, all his family members should cease to hold any position with the government, GLC or stats boards to prevent conflict of interest and nepotism.<br></span></p>
              <p>General Election to be 4 years 1 time <span style="color: #ff0000;">- Agree. New rules must be set to ensure minimum representation from the citizen during election. No walkovers, No special zoning. If there no competition, party must secure at least 60% of residential votes.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><br></span></span></p>
              <p>Freedom of speech, Accept Deflamation remarks. NO SUEING<span style="color: #ff0000;"> - Control is necessary but press and judiciary must be free from Gov nomination or control. Judiciary body should be a separate balance of power that is not appointed, <span style="color: #ff0000;">influence or control by Gov body.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do away with President.. he's useless</span></p>

              <p><strong>Income Tax and Welfare - </strong>I support higher tax to support a welfare system. All citizen must have a social responsibility; whether voluntarily or mandatory. Higher income tax should be charge and full medical and social benefits befitting a human being must be given to any citizen who has paid at least 25 years of income tax (provided they are not employed or employed with a salary that cannot sustain their livelihood)</p>
              <p>With this, we can essentially do away CPF. CPF system does not provide enough to sustain retirement and pay for medical bills (at a time when you need it the most and when you are least likely to be able to pay for it). Therefore, the reverse is necessary. Pay higher tax when you can and get full medical benefit when you need it.</p>

              <p>I disagree with quite of few items listed in the "wishlist". Yes, there are somethings that I agree with on that list but I also see that alot of people will suffer if everything on that list is implemented. Its the kind of wishlist that a Coalition Provisional Government under the influence of opportunistic Shiites politicians would implement in Iraq.</p>
              <p>It seems to me then that the PAP is still the "devil I know" and where my vote should go. Singaporeans if they accept this so called "Opposition wishlist " are then proven to be a naive bunch of dolts for which the restriction of freedoms is something to be done for their own good. How sad for Singaporeans and too bad for me I suppose. *shakes head*</p>

              <p>I had the same thinking but the rate the ruling party is going changes my mind.   Even if the PAP works hard they are working hard to serve themselves, to serve their bank account, pockets.   So long as PAP runs the country without the heart to serve the public with passion, nothing is going to change even we can have more oppositions seats in the parliament.</p>
