              <p>Hitler is a European history. The problem is european one. Unless if he happen to be Jewish, there is no connection and no relevance to him. In other words, he just make up stories and pretend to be offended, or pretend that there are people in SGForums who would be offended. How many of us here are connected to European WW2 history..?

              <p>Mr Dotaro, I appreciate your post.  I went too far with the threat of ISD.  Actual fact is it was my hot-tempered way of expressing my extreme dislike of his comments.  I completely did not intend to cast a shadow on this forum.  It's a great shame that Reyes brought this into the public forum after I thought it was resolved on a basis of disagreement.</p>
              <p>I have not and never will apologise to Reyes.  I personally find his words repugnant in the context and his indignation has proven the pride in his hating words under the guise of freedom of speech.  I guess the deadlock of his indignation and my corresponding refusal to take back my threat is what led Reyes to take this public.  </p>
              <p>I too feel the fear in speaking my mind here, or elsewhere on the Singapore turf.  My initial message to Reyne should perhaps be read as 'if I don't report you then somebody might'.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day I have inadvertently cast my own fear on the forum, and I'm sorry for that.</p>
              <p>I would love to hear some similar humility from Reyes but sadly I doubt we'll see that.</p>

              thing is he doesn't see things from your point of view, he may never think you're correct. likewise the way you put it i guess you're not a local so its unlikely for you to understand. you actually threatened him with the idea you're capable of doing him in because you have a contact in ISD ? if you want to take things into context isn't it obvious he's using it to provoke a reaction and he does not feel that its racist?

              <p>Mr Dotaro, I appreciate your post.  I went too far with the threat of ISD.  Actual fact is it was my hot-tempered way of expressing my extreme dislike of his comments.  I completely did not intend to cast a shadow on this forum.  It's a great shame that Reyes brought this into the public forum after I thought it was resolved on a basis of disagreement.</p>
              <p>I have not and never will apologise to Reyes.  I personally find his words repugnant in the context and his indignation has proven the pride in his hating words under the guise of freedom of speech.  I guess the deadlock of his indignation and my corresponding refusal to take back my threat is what led Reyes to take this public.  </p>
              <p>I too feel the fear in speaking my mind here, or elsewhere on the Singapore turf.  My initial message to Reyne should perhaps be read as 'if I don't report you then somebody might'.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day I have inadvertently cast my own fear on the forum, and I'm sorry for that.</p>
