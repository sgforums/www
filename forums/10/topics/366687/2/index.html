              <p>I agree with you on this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Needless to say, it goes the same for our white collared workers as well, that are gradually being replaced by cheap foriegn workers.</p>
              <p>How can our PMET's salaries be compared to our resource rich neighbours? Their salaries are pegged to their standard of living in their countries, with huge economy of scale in infrastructure costs as well as a whole multitude of other costs. Their salaries are thus lower than ours and would be greatly attracted by what we offer.</p>
              <p>But our Singapore citizens cannot afford to accept their country's wages, for here we do not have a backyard to rear chickens and live on small vege plots.</p>
              <p>Irresponsible employers as usual would claim they cannot afford wage rises to the govt, whom responded by lifting the qouta for foriegn workers. It would be comprehensible if such companies are dealing in export orientated industries, and have to be competitive in the barbaric uncivilised global market, but how can such rationale be used for local companies competting only in our civilised local markets?</p>
              <p>Those local entreprenuers who cannot compete fairly on local terms should be allowed to fail, so as not to use up valuable resources and time, but instead focus on other products to make profit. The last competing company will survive and will be able to offer more rational wages, for products that are unique in Singapore and need not fear compettition from overseas.</p>
              <p>Thus irresponsible employers should either raise wages or train their existing staff for required roles instead of depending on cheap foriegn labour to compete against one another in our small local market.</p>
              <p>When every local employer hires foriegn staff both legally and illegally, there will be no one to buy their products, for our PMETs will be out of jobs and hungry anyway.</p>
              <p>If only employers would listen....</p>
              <p>Employers are only in hundreds of thousand, but voting citizens are by the millions. And these millions would rather be working on improved and socially responsible govt enterprises ( DBS, please wake up ) than be starved out of jobs by irresponsible local and foreign employers seeking profit here.</p>
              <p>Any politician who can solve this issue will have my vote, even though insignificant as it is only one in the ocean of votes in my society, regardless if they are from the ruling party or opposition ones. There are higher causes than oneself, which one must look beyond one's nose and support. </p>
