              <p>The Dependency Ceiling/Quota is one full-time local worker to seven foreign workers.

              <p>Was talking about jobs during work and my manager told me that the company only wants to employ foreign workers as they are very cheap.. cos i was thinking to introduce a friend into the company but he is a singaporean and he holds quite a number of  prestigious degrees but was turned down cos if he were to come into the company, his pay will be much higher than a foreign worker with another degree from some abc university in their country so he would rather choose the foreign worker instead.. What my manager says is that they only employ singaporeans so that they can get another 7 more foreign workers in for cheaper labour..</p>
              <p>Are all the companies out there trying to out source cheap labour and only employ singaporeans for the sake of employing more cheap foreign labours?? Seriously.. the ratio of 1:7 is alot of jobs for singaporeans.. i suggest the gov should lower the quota so that singaporeans are able to get jobs..</p>

              <p>You have my fullest support.</p>
              <p>Make it even better, perhaps we can use our treasury to employ more citizens to track down on errant employers who abuse our social spending to help them out in these bad times, whom employ foreign workers/talents than paying slightly higher negotiable wages for our own citizens.</p>
              <p>Many bosses had complained of unfair compettition, that other bosses had hire cheap foreigners to bid for contracts, while they themselves are doing the same. The labour situation will never end if errant bosses are not rooted out and even skinned alive.</p>
              <p>If we can employ more police/custom officers to root out smuggling or NEA officers to check on litter, I fail to see why we should not be using our funds for more critical and practical causes such as unfair or cheating practices by unethical employers.</p>
              <p>Most singaporeans are probably by now aware of the need for foreign workers, and majority of them will be packed home after the IR projects, but there need to be a balance for foriegn talents against local dedicated talents. Monetary incentives is not the only way to offer lower wages to locals, but a committed package such as food and lodging expenditure can be tried or experimented.</p>
              <p>Do be aware as well, that the premise of lowered costs brought by cheaper workers will be translated into cheaper products and services, more so in this crisis climate where resources had cheapened,</p>
              <p>BUT had that cup of coffee served by the foriegn worker proved cheaper? Had restaurant food and shopping malls that sold products, helped by the influx of cheap foriegn labour, dropped? Had our transportation costs lowered with foreign drivers and cleaners? I can ask more, but there is only so much bull a citizen can be fed with by our economic leaders - bosses and entreprenuers..</p>
              <p>In the past, I had always respected those driving expensive cars, for they had work hard to drive those cars, but now, when a lambo, ferrari or mercz whizzes by, I wondered which citizen had they abused, turn away or cheated that they can afford such luxuries today.</p>

              <p>The Dependency Ceiling/Quota is one full-time local worker to seven foreign workers. This means that for every full-time Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident employed by a company with regular full month CPF contributions made by the employer; the company can employ seven foreign workers.<br>-- Taken from MOM.</p>
              <p>Was talking about jobs during work and my manager told me that the company only wants to employ foreign workers as they are very cheap.. cos i was thinking to introduce a friend into the company but he is a singaporean and he holds quite a number of  prestigious degrees but was turned down cos if he were to come into the company, his pay will be much higher than a foreign worker with another degree from some abc university in their country so he would rather choose the foreign worker instead.. What my manager says is that they only employ singaporeans so that they can get another 7 more foreign workers in for cheaper labour..</p>
              <p>Are all the companies out there trying to out source cheap labour and only employ singaporeans for the sake of employing more cheap foreign labours?? Seriously.. the ratio of 1:7 is alot of jobs for singaporeans.. i suggest the gov should lower the quota so that singaporeans are able to get jobs..</p>

              <p>Dear haha879</p>
              <p>It is most sad to hear that you cousin's mom, a relative of yours is doing an illegal act which hurt and is hurting our society by using false local workers/ phantom workers to hire 2 more cheap labour instead of offering better wages or benefits to our locals.</p>
              <p>While I will not presume to TELL you what to do,  I hope you know what must be needed to be done. I am sure you are aware of the labour problem with foreign workers presently on our shores. It may seem minimal, only 2, but when you extrapoliate to the entire nation of SMEs, it will run into hundred thousands of illegal acts of foriegn workers, depriving our locals a chance to gain employment.</p>
              <p>Profit is necessary and comprehensible, but it MUST NOT be at the expense of our society, for it will be a vicious cycle that will hurt everyone of us in the end, one way or another by twisting and evading laws to profit oneself.</p>
              <p>It would be comprehensible that certain industries that uses high amounts of labour are necessary for the use of cheap labour such as construction, ship building and export manufacturing vital to our economy and our own needs such as homes, but SMEs' products or services that do not go out beyond our shores needing cheap labour as well??? </p>
              <p>Their only compettitor is another local, and as in a free market, the one who is best should earn the right to survive as a biz entity, not flood the market with entreprenuers using cheap foreign labour while denying our citizens their rightful opportunity for employment.</p>
              <p>We are not a nation of entreprenuers, with natural resources to sell or serve or depend upon, and would be unsustanable if we all become employers. The reality is that our local market is too small and more will only end up bankrupt in a matter of time, driving up even worse social costs not only in monetary terms but on wider social aspects later on with foreign worker dependency even for non critical economy industries !</p>
              <p>(eg: Many citizens had opened chainstores or restaurants on our island. How many can survive with only a population of 3.2 million people? And what happens when these entreprenuers are bankrupt as well as citizens being hungry and denied work on decent wages there? )</p>
              <p>The common complain by employers is that they cannot find local to fill such jobs. However, the truth is that money had always been a critical and necessary factor to motivate one for a job, even if it is a menial job. Do you think if your aunty pays $2,000 a month, locals would not be attracted? I am sure even grads today will do the job.</p>
              <p>We had always decried that it would be ridiculous to pay $2k as wage for menial tasks. We had always insisted that critical jobs be paid higher to attract the best talents. BUT the fact that when one cannot find a worker for a job, doesnt that makes that job critical?</p>
              <p>We may complain about price rises, but had we citizens stopped eating out? $3 for a plate of chicken rice, $5 for a plate of fried rice, even at foodcourts, but had we ALL gave up going for meals?</p>
              <p>As employers complain of not being able to attract local workers, had forced the govt to open up regulations for foriegn workers, had the price of such foods and products gone down instead of going up?</p>
              <p>No, it hadnt. It continued to spiral up and employers gave a variety of bullshit excuses, yet they own landed properties, flashy cars and holidays abroad even in these times, while our locals go hungry.</p>
              <p>I hope you will persuade your relative to stop her illegal labour methods, society detrimental acts, and remind her of her social responsibilities, as you or your parents will be closer to her than me that she will listen to.</p>

              <p><br>I can't comment on GLCs, but I know some private companies get the workers themselves to pay the levy. Actually the workers don't get "anything" for free. They usually pay $65 a month for a bed in the dorm, about $150 a month for food if they aren't doing their own cooking, have to pay for their own transport - all this when their total monthly pay is barely $1200, or even less.</p>

              <p>I agree with you on this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Needless to say, it goes the same for our white collared workers as well, that are gradually being replaced by cheap foriegn workers.</p>
              <p>How can our PMET's salaries be compared to our resource rich neighbours? Their salaries are pegged to their standard of living in their countries, with huge economy of scale in infrastructure costs as well as a whole multitude of other costs. Their salaries are thus lower than ours and would be greatly attracted by what we offer.</p>
              <p>But our Singapore citizens cannot afford to accept their country's wages, for here we do not have a backyard to rear chickens and live on small vege plots.</p>
              <p>Irresponsible employers as usual would claim they cannot afford wage rises to the govt, whom responded by lifting the qouta for foriegn workers. It would be comprehensible if such companies are dealing in export orientated industries, and have to be competitive in the barbaric uncivilised global market, but how can such rationale be used for local companies competting only in our civilised local markets?</p>
              <p>Those local entreprenuers who cannot compete fairly on local terms should be allowed to fail, so as not to use up valuable resources and time, but instead focus on other products to make profit. The last competing company will survive and will be able to offer more rational wages, for products that are unique in Singapore and need not fear compettition from overseas.</p>
              <p>Thus irresponsible employers should either raise wages or train their existing staff for required roles instead of depending on cheap foriegn labour to compete against one another in our small local market.</p>
              <p>When every local employer hires foriegn staff both legally and illegally, there will be no one to buy their products, for our PMETs will be out of jobs and hungry anyway.</p>
              <p>If only employers would listen....</p>
              <p>Employers are only in hundreds of thousand, but voting citizens are by the millions. And these millions would rather be working on improved and socially responsible govt enterprises ( DBS, please wake up ) than be starved out of jobs by irresponsible local and foreign employers seeking profit here.</p>
              <p>Any politician who can solve this issue will have my vote, even though insignificant as it is only one in the ocean of votes in my society, regardless if they are from the ruling party or opposition ones. There are higher causes than oneself, which one must look beyond one's nose and support. </p>
