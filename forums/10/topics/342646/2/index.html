              <p>Yes, control over all the peasants in a feudal system. There is a better system. Technology was supposed to liberate us, but it seems that it has been developed to enslave us even further. If money was abolished, and the resources of the world is geared towards creating a humane society, where human concerns are addressed instead of profits, then we'll be much better off. However, its not in the rulers' interests to give us that lifestyle. After all, when people are too comfortable and start thinking, the purpose of an elite will start to vanish, posing a threat to their monopoly over power.</p>
              <p>I'm not promoting any other -isms, because capitalism, communism etc all function in the same way. Always a pyramidal structure where exploitation and suffering will plague the people while the elites leech off them.</p>

              <p>Ignorance is bliss? Thats just another way to rationalise those hedonistic consumer lifestyles that is being promoted as a thing to strive for. Because it would threaten your so-called "party" and its related pleasures, people like you prefer to maintain the status quo, even if you are aware of the malfeasance taking place everywhere.</p>

              <p>Why can't our ministers' pay be the highest in the world?
              Why must we NOT be the highest? Its not like our ministers suck. They
              might not be the best, but to me, a high salary simply means throwing
              the ministers one whole truck load of responsibility.</p>
              <p>It simply
              means their job costs this much responsibility. I doubt anyone can
              handle such immense responsibility. For instance the recent Mas selamat
              crap. Do u think u can handle the pressure the ones under fire face?
              Not exactly. And with all the opposition chewing down on that matter
              and taking the opportunity to get u out of the competition for the
              major ruling party, i really do think that that amount of
              responsibility can cost that much.</p>
              <p>Its also because that they are being paid so much that we can throw every shit at them. I really mean everything. The responsibility they have is simply immense! Any thing that happens, these ministers will have to take the blame. Not you.</p>

              <p>I don't think it's right to blame the government for this. The reason for the poor growth rate is due to the world wide financial crisis triggered recession. This is something they have no control over. Due to the nature of our economy, we are naturally one of the hardest hit thus ranking us 9th in this report.</p>
              <p>Whether the government has done a good job of running the economy is more apparent when examined over a longer period of time like a decade or two. Frankly, I feel that they've done a good job during the 70s to the early 90s. However, after the early 90s, they seemed to have lost the ability to create anymore solid economic plans for the future and we continue to be stuck between first world and third because of that.</p>

              <p>By most international standards and observers, I would say the SG govt has definitely performed well over the years. But if the SG govt is so arrogant to think they are the world's best government and justifies that claim by paying themselves obscene million dollar salaries, then I think they are pretty mediocre for their claims and boasts. Just look at what happened after they raised their pay, are Singaporeans getting better governance after they raised their pay astronomically?</p>
              <p>Are we still not affected by retrenchments, high inflation, unaffordable homes, top fugitive limping away to freedom, ordinary people losing life savings to investment products that should have been regulated by MAS and the ineffectiveness of the ERP gantry system?</p>
              <p>The extra millions saved from their high salaries could be better spent elsewhere in education, healthcare, helping the poor or builidng up budget surpluses. Do we need ministers to feel more disconnected from the general public because of their increased wealth and unable to emphatize with the very people they are supposed to design policies for?</p>
              <p>Bottomline, if I am paying them such improved salaries, as a taxpayer I want to see genuine improvements and better leadership, not maintainence of the status quo and definitely not a deprovement in general standard of living. If they're the best and truly world class, nobody would doubt their standing and abilities, but I suspect they have more doubters than believers on this aspect.</p>

              obscene pay like what cabinet ministers here command is against the
              grain of servitude (<span style="color: #ff0000;">to</span> the
              nation). you reckon frontline singapore army who defend the
              sovereignty of the country need to be paid a hell lot more as well?
              i think so. why is this not so then?</p>
              <p>why is the president of the united states not demanding more pay
              for himself? pegged it against the top 5% of high earners
              there?</p>
              <p>when the singapore government skew the rationale to
              justify paying themselves silly and can do so; there's nothing
              left to discuss.</p>
              <p>just grin and bear it. after a while, you will be numbed to
              it.</p>
              <p>just like you have......</p>

              <p>By most international standards and observers, I would say the SG govt has definitely performed well over the years. But if the SG govt is so arrogant to think they are the world's best government and justifies that claim by paying themselves obscene million dollar salaries, then I think they are pretty mediocre for their claims and boasts. Just look at what happened after they raised their pay, are Singaporeans getting better governance after they raised their pay astronomically?</p>
              <p>Are we still not affected by retrenchments, high inflation, unaffordable homes, top fugitive limping away to freedom, ordinary people losing life savings to investment products that should have been regulated by MAS and the ineffectiveness of the ERP gantry system?</p>
              <p>The extra millions saved from their high salaries could be better spent elsewhere in education, healthcare, helping the poor or builidng up budget surpluses. Do we need ministers to feel more disconnected from the general public because of their increased wealth and unable to emphatize with the very people they are supposed to design policies for?</p>
              <p>Bottomline, if I am paying them such improved salaries, as a taxpayer I want to see genuine improvements and better leadership, not maintainence of the status quo and definitely not a deprovement in general standard of living. If they're the best and truly world class, nobody would doubt their standing and abilities, but I suspect they have more doubters than believers on this aspect.</p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p>I got a doubt leh.</p>
              <p>If economic depression or recession is due to world economic factors,</p>
              <p>then bad economic figure is attributed to poor economic conditions. so we should move on.</p>
              <p>If economic boom , what attribute to the success?</p>
              <p>Also,</p>
              <p>TW , HK , SG very different political systems but sama sama economic performance as in generally regarded as healthy economy. last time, you remember they called the asian tigers? economic miracles? ah , thats what i mean.</p>
              <p>so , my 2nd doubt is how the come different political still sama sama miracle?</p>
              <p>so, any thing can we  deduce from ?</p>
