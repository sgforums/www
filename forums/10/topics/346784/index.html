              <div class="articleAuthorName"><strong><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Moscow
                  has correctly assessed that the announced Obama troop buildup in
                  Afghanistan has no relevance to the stated aim of combatting the
                  ‘Taliban’, but rather with a new attempt by the Pentagon strategists to
                  encircle both Russia and China on Eurasia in order to retain US global
                  military dominance. It is not waiting for a new policy from Washington.
                  Rather Russia is acting to secure its perimeter in Central Asia through
                  a series of calculated geopolitical moves reminiscent of the famous
                  Great Game of more than a Century ago. The stakes in this geopolitical
                  power game could not be higher—the issue of world war or peace in the
                  coming decade.</span></span></strong></div>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Secretary
                  of Defense Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Admiral Mike
                  Mullen are asking Obama to double US troop presence in Afghanistan.
                  Both Gates and Mullen said that while they're thinking about the war in
                  Afghanistan in terms of a 3-5 year time frame, their immediate goals
                  are ‘unclear.’ That’s highly revealing. It is clear from the deliberate
                  pattern over months, despite vehement protest from Pakistan’s
                  government, of US bombing attacks on villages inside Pakistan,
                  allegedly to hit Taliban targets, that the US intends to widen the
                  conflict to Pakistan as well. What could be the possible aim?<br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Militarily,
                  adding 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan could never secure peace in
                  that wartorn tribal region. It has been documented that many of the
                  groups whom the US Command labels ‘Taliban’ are in fact armed bands
                  controlled by local warlords, and not ideologically close-knit Taliban
                  cadre in any sense. By labelling them Taliban, Washington hopes to
                  convince its NATO allies such as Germany to send their troops to fight
                  in an unwinnable war. Afghanistan presently has an estimated 40%
                  unemployment and some five million living below the poverty line. It
                  has been ravaged by more than four decades of continuous war. <br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Adding
                  a mere 30,000 more for a total of 60,000 US troops in Afghanistan where
                  the current killing rate for US soldiers is running fifteen times above
                  that in Iraq, is ludicrous. According to the official US Marine Corps
                  counterinsurgency guidelines, to run a country-wide counterinsurgency
                  strategy with the absolute minimum force levels required by US Army and
                  Marine Corps doctrine, the US would need almost 655,000 troops, or an
                  escalation roughly 600,000 troops higher than the force levels in the
                  proposed Gates strategy. In fact the US strategy as it now appears
                  seems to be a replay of the gradual escalation strategy the US pursued
                  in Vietnam in the early 1960’s. <br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Secretary
                  of State Hillary Clinton, whose foreign policy guidance, as that of her
                  husband, is virtually indistinguishable from the Bush faction’s, has
                  just convened a dinner discussion of leading policy experts on
                  Afghanistan and South Asia. It included Defense Secretary Gates,
                  CENTCOM commander Gen. David Petraeus, and National Security advisor
                  Gen. James L. Jones. It follows the appointment of former Ambassador
                  and hawk, Richard Holbrooke as the State Department's Special South
                  Asia Envoy. <br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In
                  January 2008, more than a year ago, present National Security adviser
                  to Obama, General James Jones headed a private Afghan Study Group which
                  recommended drastic steps to ‘revitalize’ the war in Afghanistan.
                  Revitalize a war whose goals have not even been clearly formulated? Not
                  surprisingly, Moscow suspects another agenda is at work when Washington
                  puts such heavy concentration strategically on the issue of the
                  forgotten war on terror in Afghanistan, a region with no discernable
                  direct national security implications for the United States or NATO
                  member countries. No conceivable combination in Afghanistan, a failed
                  state if there ever was one, could tnreaten a war of aggression abroad.
                  The tribal warlords around President Karzai seem to be struggling just
                  to maintain their heroin export flows at record levels. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Not surpisingly, the Kremlin has reacted to the US plans for Central Asia..<span>  </span>The president of Kyrgyzstan just flew to Moscow where he received promises of debt relief and billions of dollars in aid. </span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span lang="EN-US">Bakiyev was told he would get a write off Kyrgyzstan's $180 million debt to Russia, <span> </span>a $2 billion discounted loan and $150 million in financial aid from Russia. </span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN">On the occasion, President</span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"> Kurmanbek Bakiyev <span>announced plans to close a US air base crucial to the war in Afghanistan. </span>Kyrgyzstan has been home to the only remaining US base in the strategically crucial region to Afghanistan's north. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">After
                  the Bush Administration declared its War on Terror and announced plans
                  to strike Afghanistan to root out the arch evil Osama bin Laden from
                  the caves of Tora Bora in 2001, Washington secured air force basing
                  rights in both Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">At
                  about that same time, they covertly began preparing to unleash a series
                  of US-financed ‘regime change’ Color Revolutions in Georgia (The Rose
                  Revolution, in November 2003) and Ukraine (Orange Revolution in 2004).
                  It tried and failed in Belarus as well as Uzbekistan. A glance at a map
                  of Eurasia makes clear the pattern of those pro-NATO efforts was to
                  militarily encircle the territory of Russia, especially as at the time
                  Washington believed it had the government of Kazakhstan in its pocket
                  with military training agreements and Chevron’s large oil investment in
                  Tenghiz.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Once
                  Washington announced in January 2007 that it would station strategic
                  missiles and advanced rarad systems in Poland and the Czech Republic to
                  ‘defend against rogue missile attack from Iran,’ as I detail in my
                  soon-to-be-released book, <strong><em>Full Spectrum Dominance: Totalitarian Democracy in the New World Order</em></strong>,
                  then-President Putin told the Munich Wehrkunde conference in February
                  2007 that the true target of the US ‘missile defense’ strategy was not
                  Iran but Russia.<span>  </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Similarly,
                  today the US insistence Afghanistan military buildup is about Taliban,
                  rings equally hollow. That’s clearly why Moscow is acting to secure its
                  borders from a US militarization of the entire Central Asian region.
                  Oil and gas pipeline routes are a major consideration, including US
                  wishes to build a natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to India that
                  would deprive Russia’s Gazprom of a vital component of its current gas
                  supply. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The
                  prime objective of the Afghan escalation however, is to draw a new
                  ‘iron curtain,’ this one between the two formidable Eurasian powers
                  with the only capacity to challenge future US global dominance: Russia
                  and China. Should the two former rivals firm their cooperation not only
                  in raw materials and industrial economic trade, but as well in the
                  military cooperation sphere, as Obama campaign foreign policy adviser
                  Zbigniew Brzezinski has stated, the combination would present a
                  devastating threat to America’s global hegemony.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Now
                  the decision, aided with the help of generous Russian financial
                  concessions, to abruptly cancel US Air Force landing rights at
                  Kyrgyzstan’s Manas Air Base, deals a devastating blow to US Great Game
                  grand strategy to encircle the key powers of Eurasia—China and Russia. <br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">When
                  Washington tried to use its various NGO’s to foment a Color Revolution
                  in Uzbekistan in 2005, the country’s not-so-democratic President, </span></span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Islam
                  Karimov, demanded the US evacuate its air bases, repatriate US Peace
                  Corps volunteers, and most NGOs were shut down and foreign media <span> </span>banned. Karimov moved to firm his frayed ties with Moscow at the time. Today Washington is reported to be feverishly trying to re-establish itself in Uzbekistan, but the sudden cancellation of base rights in Kyrgyzstan deals a new devastating blow to the entire Eurasian encirclement Great Game strategy. <br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">With the major NATO supply routes to Afghanistan going through Pakistan
                  from the Port Karachi, and strikes on those supply lines increasing by
                  the day, the Pentagon is eagerly searching to find alternative supply
                  routes to the North. </span></span><span style="color: black;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Militants just blew up a key bridge in Pakistan's strategic Khyber Pass. <br></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The
                  securing of alternate Afghan supply routes is at least the official
                  explanation. Unofficially, it would also provide the pretext to beef up
                  US military presence in Central Asia. Now, with loss of Manas Air Base, a gaping hole in the Washington Great Game ‘Mach IV’ has been left. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;" lang="EN-GB"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">To further complicate Washington’s strategy, Moscow is moving to firm defense cooperation ties across former Communist states in Central Asia. </span></span></p>

              <h1 style="margin: auto 0cm;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The announcement by Kyrgzystan President<span>  </span>Bakiyev
                  that he was cancelling US basing rights came during his visit to Moscow
                  February 4 for a summit meeting of the formerly moribund Collective
                  Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a security grouping comprising
                  Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Uzbekistan and
                  Tajikistan.<span>  </span>They reportedly agreed to set up a
                  collective rapid reaction force to ‘counter military aggression,
                  international terrorism, extremism, crime, drug-trafficking and deal
                  with emergency situations.’ Clearly the US plans for a major military buildup in Afghanistan were high on the agenda as well.</span></span></h1>
              <h1 style="margin: auto 0cm;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The
                  CSTO was established in 1992 to serve as a basis for maintaining some
                  dialogue between Moscow and her former Soviet republics after their
                  declared independence, Russia’s so-called ‘near abroad.’ </span></span></h1>
              <h1 style="margin: auto 0cm;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Today the level of talks is taking on a quite new seriousness as US
                  encirclement operations clearly are seen as a threat to all the Central
                  Asian republics. The CSTO lists its major security ‘threats’ as Pakistan and Afghanistan.
                  The decision to create a truly collective force with a permanent
                  location and a united command would propel the alliance to a new level.<span>  </span></span></span></h1>
              <h1 style="margin: auto 0cm;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Russian
                  President Medvedev announced the decision to form the collective
                  regional CSTO Rapid Reaction Force: ‘I would like to emphasise the
                  importance of this decision to establish rapid reaction forces. It’s
                  aimed at strengthening the military capacity of our organisation.’ He
                  claimed the new response units would ‘not be less powerful than those
                  of NATO,’ adding that ‘the reason behind the creation of the collective
                  forces of operative functioning is a considerable conflict potential
                  which is accumulating in the CSTO zone.’ Translated from the Russian,
                  that means the US strategic buildup in and around Pakistan and Afghanistan. </span></span></h1>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">At the same time as it hosted the CSTO summit, Russia hosted a meeting of the so-called Eurasian Economic Community in Moscow, EurAsEC. That group consists of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan as full members. EurAsEC, established in 2000, also involves Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine which hold observer status.</span></span></p>
