We will continue to be under one-party-rule for many years to come:<br><br>http://sg.news.yahoo.com/051006/3/3vgt6.html<br>Singapore says no to liberal democracy for next 20 years<br><br>SINGAPORE, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Singapore will not adopt a Western liberal democracy with a multi-party system during the next 20 years, its prime minister said on Thursday.<br>The wealthy island at the southern tip of the Malaysian peninsula has been dominated by the People's Action Party of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong -- the son of founding father Lee Kuan Yew -- since independence in 1965. Only two of the 84 elected politicians in parliament are from the opposition.<br><br>When asked at a Foreign Correspondents Association lunch whether he expected Singapore to turn into a democracy in 20 years where parties compete for votes, Lee said: "I don't think that's likely to happen."<br><br>"I think in 20 years our society will change. I think the politics of it will change. But I do not see a Western model...as the target we want to aim for."<br><br>"We do not see (a Western democracy) as a model which would work well in Singapore. We have worked a system where there is parliamentary democracy, there are free elections and the electorate has given their confidence overwhelmingly to one party."<br><br>Singapore is a parliamentary republic and elections are held at regular, constitutionally mandated intervals, and some expect one in 2005 although it is not due until 2007. In the 2001 poll, Lee's predecessor Goh Chok Tong won 75 percent of the vote.<br><br>Opposition politicians have long complained the system is stacked against them and that frequent defamation suits by PAP officials stifles dissent. Opposition politician Joshua Jeyaretnam was bankrupted by libel suits brought by PAP leaders.<br><br>Lee, 53, took over from Goh last year after 14 years in office. Goh had taken over from Lee Kuan Yew, who founded the PAP and led Singapore as prime minister for 31 years.</div>

The only way when results are not coming would be more gerrymandering against racists in blogs and more controls of dissenting views and opinions. If results are coming, there will be no need to resort to GRC or other gerrymandering controls as people will see the change and support the government.<br><br>Today since 1970s, we have not been doing well and our per capita ranking has dropped. The standard of living of the masses is dropping with lowering of wages and increasing of costs.<br><br>If we have achieved so much as is made to believe, we would not have so many unemployed and so many factories empty and shops idling without business. People are struggling for a living just to get their three meals. Yet leaders are congratulating themselves for their GDPs and so-called superficial success by adopting denial stance in governming. We have been enduring such denial syndrome all too long and it is time to examine whether our current top-down autoracy can involve the masses in knowledge applications and technological development to go forward.<br><br>Without overcoming existing problems created by past major policy errors like over-obssessive anti-welfare and overly zealous meritocracy, and elitism, the prospect of making leaping progress will remain very dim.<br><br>Hence it is about time to open up to mass participation in knowledge applications and getting the whole populations to work together not just to congratulate their own perceived success without a clue about the power of people-centred management - check and balance is the way to empower people to do so in practical way. What has failed to show during the last two recessions is proof enough that top-down autocracy is too slow and outdated and will not end as some wise assumption like "finding of our own solutions" as sold to the citizens for the past 20 years now. This kind of assumption that we will find our own solution somewhere will again hold back our progress for another 20 years. Think about it !!!</div>

At least there will always be some genuine debates among true politicians and not all the craps from insiders nominated to be NMPs like flower vases.  Between First-past-the-post or winners take all system and proportional representation, the latter is clearly more superior as it will serve to counter-balance our asian culture of face. Because of face so many people have to shut up or be sacrificed.

You would then no doubt come across some of the following posted as "20 major past government policy errors" on page 11 of "Definition of True Democracy":-<br><br>(1) Bureaucracy in civil service.<br>(2) High costs of essential government services e.g. medical, utilities, housing, transportation, education, etc, etc<br>(3) Growth Triangles<br>(4) Affective divide due to lack of understanding of people's views and aspirations.<br>(5) Work site safety problems (Hotel New World Collapse's blue paper was not effectively implemented)<br>(6) Deliver a Swiss standard of living<br>(7) Asset enhancement scheme fiasco<br>(8 ) Unit trust investment fiasco<br>(9) Foreign relation fiascos<br>(10) Non-formulation of a value-adding investment strategy<br>(11) Double-charging on lands (paid by taxpayers yet charged back to them at full market prices) and triple charges on vehicles.<br>(12) Meritocratic education policy that backfired - brain drains of thousands<br>(13) Mother tongue - CL1 admission fiasco<br>(14) Reaching World Cup soccer league by 2010 - no sign of getting near.<br>(15) Investment losses by thousands of citizens from CPF funds.<br>(16) Spiraling of government ministers' and civil servants' salaries.<br>(17) Failure to implement accountability and transparency in respect of investments of citizens' monies in overseas investments.<br>(18 ) Loss of economic competitiveness due to high costs.<br>(19) Neglect in promoting entrepreneurship<br>(20) Neglect in nurturing the domestic sector of economy.<br><br>By going through this list objectively, you could easily see that most of the problems were old problems unsolved since the 1970s. So you will see that I have answered your question on date of beginning of Singapore's decline.<br><br>The problem of high cost has besetted the whole population since the 1970s when the government began to push up their own wages on the premise that they needed to attract talents or avoid corruptions. Despite the dropping wages, CPF cuts, growth triangle and asset enhancement fiasco and failures of economic restructuring plans from that time, the government ministers and top civil servants continue to pretend that they were governing the country well. Look again at what the ministers were saying to the people on retrenchments during the last two recessions. There were without solutions and helpless putting all the blames on workers themselves for their presumably high wage costs forgetting to mention their own NKF wages.<br><br>After my postings to the Feedback Unit etc, about these 20 problems there might have been certain changes to education to vocational and broad-based one but the solutions seem late. Dr. Tony Tan has visited Finland and Denmark in 2005 to study their practical research and broad-based education system.<br><br>We are now way way behind other Asian tigers and many of our own talents were forced to migrate because of our economic shambles. But our ministers do not seem to be able to change their own mindset and still try to present themselves as the best even in the face of their persistent failures to upgrade the economy.<br><br>The have failed to upgrade the economy to value-adding type or restructuring to advanced technologies as the South Koreans, Taiwanese and Finnish have been doing.<br><br>From the 1970s, many economic re-structuing strategies have been announced and failed because of lack of action-type ministers like Dr. Goh Keng Swee.<br><br>After Dr. Goh Keng Swee left the scene, none of the other Finance or Indiustry ministers have noticeably created another industrial success like Jurong or succeeded in so-called value-adding industries. It is about time for our first generation leaders to realise their own policy errors and change for the sake of all.<br><br>Why, the newer ministers were mostly untested in industrialisation or economic planning. There were mostly academically qualified but lacking in real strategic economic planning or implementation excellence.<br><br>The past policy errors were mostly caused by egoistic self-centred beliefs that they were the talents and no one was better. It is time they take a look at what the Switzerland, Finland, Denmark, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan have done during these years since the 1970s. Singapore lost out simply because of arrogance about own ability of our academicians. It is time to try some other solutions and not persist in talking like they are t</div>

In the past, British colonial rule was seen as oppressive since it did not give us any room for self-determination. These days, liberal democracy has been adopted by many EU member-states (who were once former colonial powers themselves). By adopting their standards, it is as good as losing our identity, if we go by PAP logic.</div>

If we still have some oppositions left, they are inevitably crushed and reduced to clowns and jokers who will not make much of good opposition or alternative.<br><br>Singaporeans should not pretend that there is no problem. What they are seeing are look-good presentations and justifications of past policies with no desire or intention to change. Nothing really has changed. The bus fare, utility, medical and HDB prices are going to suck out whatever they earn if they are still employed. Singaporeans should change and not be the kiasu and kiasee who only care about their own immediate interests.<br><br>They should understand what is right and wrong and what is objective and wise about political freedom and rights and not be afraid to speak up and cast their votes accordingly. Only in this way can they change and finally regain their rightful place to speak and act freely to decide what they want of their country.<br><br>They now have to wise up as they are the only ones solely responsible and cannot blame anyone else.</div>
