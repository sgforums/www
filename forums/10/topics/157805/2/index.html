Only two of the 84 elected politicians in parliament are from the opposition.<br><br>When asked at a Foreign Correspondents Association lunch whether he expected Singapore to turn into a democracy in 20 years where parties compete for votes, Lee said: "I don't think that's likely to happen."<br><br>"I think in 20 years our society will change. I think the politics of it will change. But I do not see a Western model...as the target we want to aim for."<br><br>"We do not see (a Western democracy) as a model which would work well in Singapore. We have worked a system where there is parliamentary democracy, there are free elections and the electorate has given their confidence overwhelmingly to one party."<br><br>Singapore is a parliamentary republic and elections are held at regular, constitutionally mandated intervals, and some expect one in 2005 although it is not due until 2007. In the 2001 poll, Lee's predecessor Goh Chok Tong won 75 percent of the vote.<br><br>Opposition politicians have long complained the system is stacked against them and that frequent defamation suits by PAP officials stifles dissent. Opposition politician Joshua Jeyaretnam was bankrupted by libel suits brought by PAP leaders.<br><br>Lee, 53, took over from Goh last year after 14 years in office. Goh had taken over from Lee Kuan Yew, who founded the PAP and led Singapore as prime minister for 31 years.</div></blockquote>maybe u can educated more singaporeans into supporting the opposition</div>

As human beings we should think and make our own choices. We should also think critically so that we could see through any untruths, prejudices and indoctrination and wouldn't be misled by others.<br><br>i also believe that we should be open to diverse views in order that we wouldn't become one-dimensional beings.</div>

Hence, many elections often result in walkovers for many areas. Disbanding the GRCs allows stiffer competition for the popular vote. The manpower-strapped opposition parties can spread their resources across more constituencies that way. Notwithstanding it allows multi-cornered fights, meaning the electors are spoiled for choice when it comes to making up their minds who best represents their interests.</div>
