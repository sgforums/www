              Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Law and Human Rights Minister  Patrialis
               Akbar said  former Democrat Party (PD) treasurer M Nazaruddin had often
               traveled to Singapore.<br><br> "Nazaruddin left the country before he was banned to go abroad. But
               he often  goes  to Singapore  so he should not be punished for having 
              seemingly fled to another country," the minister said here on Friday.<br><br> He said the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) had last 
              Tuesday evening  asked for a travel ban on three people, namely Octarina
               Furi, Yulianis and M Nazaruddin. <br><br> However, Nazaruddin  left for Singapore on Monday night (May 23), one day before the ban was issued.<br><br> The reason for KPK to ask for travel bans for the three persons was
               that they  should stay at home to facilitate  its corruption 
              investigation.<br><br> Patrialis said the request for a travel ban could actually be more 
              rapidly  be conveyed by  a telephone call in the first place. "This is 
              because a letter takes some time to reach the addressee," he added.<br><br> Reports were rife  that Nazaruddin had fled to Singapore before the
               KPK was able to summon him over an alleged bribery case at the ministry
               of youth and sports affairs.<br><br> KPK spokesman Johan Budi said the  commission had not yet set a 
              date for the summoning of Nazaruddin as a witness but had planned to do 
              so next week.(*)

              <p style="margin: 20px 0pt;">The Democratic Party plans to send some of its members to Singapore over
               the next couple of days to meet its dismissed treasurer, Muhammad 
              Nazaruddin, a top politician said on Tuesday.<br><br>Jafar Hafsah, the 
              party's House of Representatives faction leader, said that the party was
               currently selecting two or three members that would make up the 
              “communications team” to fly to Singapore to deal with Nazaruddin.<br><br>“They will meet either today or tomorrow in Singapore,” Jafar said.<br><br>“The party's head of economic department Sutan Bhatoegana is one of them.”<br><br>Jafar said that the communication teams would be sent to conduct preliminary talks with Nazaruddin.<br><br>He
               said that the Corruption Eradication Commission were welcomed to step 
              in and extradite Nazaruddin if it decided to officially summon him. <br><br>Nazaruddin flew to Singapore in the middle of a scandal linking him to a massive graft case tied to the SEA Games.<br><br>He left for the city-state on May 23, just one day before a travel ban on him was requested by the KPK and subsequently issued</p>
