But when I was in London, I recall watching this programme on Channel 5 (which is quite a trashy channel that the Brits like to watch), that was basically a documentary about SPGs in Singapore. It was the only time I saw Singapore being featured in UK television. Basically, the programme followed this British ang moh expat around Singapore, and showed how A LOT of Singapore women (all of them were Chinese) kept throwing themselves at him...whenever he wanted to pick up a S'pore woman, he always succeeded, and they did things like dance with him in clubs while flashing their private parts at the camera, or pull up his shirt and lick his chest in front of everyone. Sometimes he would try to pick up an ang moh woman, but he always got rejected. Then the narrator would say, "having run out of luck with the blonde Czech women, [the guy's name] then turns to a sure-fire bet...Miss Singapore"...then the camera would show a S'pore woman throwing herself at him again.<br><br>There was also this Chinese girl who did all his cooking and cleaning and other housework for him, and he made her do it naked...so the camera showed her cleaning his apartment for him while wearing nothing at all. And he just sat in front of the camera and told the viewers about how easy it was for him to pick up any S'pore woman he wanted.<br><br>I just thought I'd share this with you guys, since obviously you can't watch UK Channel 5 programmes here. Again, I'm not trying to start a flame war, especially not with Gedanken who is my fellow ex-Commando, I'm just trying to show you the image of Singapore that is being shown overseas in the ang moh countries. I was a bit disturbed that even all the way in London, Singapore women were being advertised as easy meat for ang moh men.<br><br>That programme disturbed me quite a lot, especially now that I see that a lot of British ang moh men are coming to Singapore.<br><br>Like I said, I know that not all S'pore women with ang mohs are SPGs. But for those who are, why do they do it??</div></blockquote>i understand how u feel my fren..<br>watever is show on British TV abt local ladies..those who make the show only degrade themselve...n the ladies who throw themself onto the guy...might just be the minority..or maybe she have recieve some payment from the producer of the TV show..<br>if they want a ang moh..let them have the ang moh..its their life..we cant stop them...we lead our own life..they lead their own..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome aboard, Marco!  Always a pleasure to meet another one of the boys here! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I don't have a problem with your example at all - it's a clear and concrete example of the vicious exploitation of racial stereotypes, and that IS disturbing.  I suppose you could say that it's sensationalistic programming to get ratings, what with Channel 5's reputation, but that is still a somewhat dissatisfying answer.<br><br>For whatever reasons that program was made, I agree it was wrong on two levels.  First, it is incredibly disrespectful to all women to capitalise on something so base and to present them as cheap sex objects.  Second, it was also disgustingly disrespectful to Asian culture.<br><br>There are two things I can see driving the production of shows like this.  First, the SPG issue has been going on in Singapore for more than ten years, and it was something attention-grabbing for BBC to capitalise on.  Second, perhaps this was the Brits' chance at taking a poke at Singapore's whistle-clean image.<br><br>Beyond that, I'd really have to see the show to form any opinions about it.<br><br>Sarkaudar, I'm glad you see what I mean now - I'm living under no illusions of virtue, unlike some other people.<br><br>Heng, thanks but there really is no need to prove anything to our little man.  He's satisfied with his little house of cards, so any reality you present to him will be rejected because it's too threatening to his fragile ego.<br><br>In the meantime, I'll be at Caveman's at Basement 1 of Ming Court, 8 pm on Saturday.  If you want, subudei, I'll have enough time to give you a thorough dose of reality before my beer gets warm.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body">Sheesh subudei, no doubt there are real SPGs around who would crave nothing but white men at the expense of all others. But your assertions are a a tad sweeping aren't they?<br><br>as for using their spouses as a ticket to leave Singapore, I'm of the opinion that in this case, the ends justifies the means. If it floats their boat, who are we to complain? Or maybe you are sore you were rebuffed in your attempts to find a caucasian lady to sponsor you into Oz, forcing you to take other, more expensive methods?<br><br>PS. I'm what would be defined as a quitter as well.</div></blockquote>Yeah what exactly is the big deal about locals using expats as a ticket outta here? That is happening now and also happening in America, it will inevitably probably be on a larger scale if Singapore encourages more PR people here. Even though the foreigners are PR, they are still citizens of their own country and can bugger off whenever they want, bringing their family with them. And what will the PAP do? Invade?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually, idealists would be more likely to leave Singapore.<br><br>Those happy to be staying are those who are happy to let the gah'ment plan and micromanage every aspect of their life in return for a simple yet overpriced pigeon hole and if lucky, a equally overpriced set of wheels while miring their entire working life in debt.</div></blockquote>Some people only stay here out of necessity. For example my family, i guess you could say we are "losers" in our own country. So I get my education and mandarin up, and return to my country as a winner later on. I may be so moved to stay on...if i am shown a little respect from my peers and friends here, because i like the idea of an island full of friendly races and stuff. I could be a minister or something, since like there are a few MPs here who aren't even Singaporean, but Malasysians.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by subudei:</div><div class="quote_body">Viper, my dear old boy,<br><br>Haha...very droll re: courting Caucasian women from Australia. While I appreciate your concern for my social life, I would have to say that I haven't ever been tempted by Australian women (not even Kylie!), and even if I were to migrate to Perth I would want to marry a Singaporean woman (well, a nice, sensible one at least) and bring her with me. My girlfriend would probably suggest to you that she fits my requirements in that regard.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Australian woman? Yuck... their so freaking LARGE, like white URUK hai or something ha! Singaporean women have better bodies ofcourse, but as for mind/character/stuff Aussie may be a better choice, if they are not bigots ofcourse.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body">My beef with you, like Gedanken's and others, is your assumption that ALL Asian women who stick to Caucasian men are simply SPGs with an eye on a ticket out of here or because they're for some reason, disinclined towards men of their own race. </div></blockquote>This is why WE NEED ONE RACE, to avoid all this bull-s-h-i-t hatred and arguements. You people who favour diversity cannot see that if we have 1 race, of all our possible reasons for conflict, e.g. X reasons, we would have (X-1) reasons, 1 less, imagine how much net-conflict would be absent then?<br><br>Also why is it people, that you all keep talking about foreigners as just caucasian men? WHy is it just caucasians? WHy someone tell me why. Come on?</div>
