            <div class='col-md body'>The point he's trying to make is ridiculous; he doesnÂ’t know enough politics to lead two sheep.<br><br>As myopic as their plans may be, it is apparent that itÂ’s hardly the garÂ’men plan to encourage Â“interbreedingÂ”, or whatsoever that joker may like to call it. I donÂ’t even think they include Â“interbreedingÂ” as part of their plans, much less care about it.<br><br>Why? Because like he correctly pointed out, encouraging a hodge pock collection of children trapped in-between two nations is hardly a good plan for population increase. WhatÂ’s the point of creating a population which is fickle and serves little good when it come to crunch time? Given their habit of crunching the people, the garÂ’men will certainly know that given the choice, these Â“interbredÂ” would flee for greener pastures.<br><br>This opening to foreigners to boost population is more of an attempt by the garÂ’men to artificially inflate SingaporeÂ’s figures to make up for the falling birth rates rather then to increase the birth rate itself. And of course, there is also a thing about undercutting local workers to force them to submit themselves to be milked even more. That I believe is the real reason, not an Interbreeding exchange conspiracy.<br><br>But interbreeding? Sorry, only he could think of an idea as daft as that, but given his lack of ability to view things objectively, coupled with a serious inferiority complex has caused him to view this issue through a distorted lens.<br><br>Given the fact that I am Chinese Singaporean, and have a cousin who is Eurasian, and half-Canadian, I know much of the things the joker says in here to be rubbish.<br><br>Come on man, I mean look at you, pull it together man.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey look, ST. At no point did I say there was an interbreeding conspiracy - I inferred that interbreeding would be the -result-, but I said that the -intention- of the government's policy was, as you correctly pointed out, to increase Singapore's population.<br><br>Please read my amended post above, wherein I promised to kick Ged's arse. If you guys can be objective, I think you'd be able to see that some regulars on these boards do appear to have developed so possessive an instinct over said boards that things escalate out of control and beyond productiveness very easily and quickly. Sure, I fully admit that I have my personal prejudices, and so do people like SmallPanda, et al. Nevertheless, in stating these prejudices, we seldom ever initiated the process of making it a personal matter. I believe that the possessiveness that some regulars have attached to these fori have prompted them to attack both the post and the poster rather indiscriminately. I mean, look at Ged's comments about SmallPanda, who I don't think started hostilities with him...SmallPanda was having fun stating some admittedly eccentric opinions, which reasonable posters knew were eccentric, but we let him get on with his harmless fun, and the next thing we knew, Ged took it as his personal mission to throw mud at SP.<br><br>I have no personal quarrel with most of you, like Heng@ (who I hadn't even spoken to before but who decided to throw in a personal attack anyway), but like I said, Ged dragged my girlfriend into this; she's an incredibly sweet girl who hasn't done a thing to him, yet he very readily and gladly insulted her, in an attempt to score a cheap point. That is unforgivable.</div>
