            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I just wonder where in Singapore did they get this consensus from?<br><br><strong>Singaporeans open to more foreigners coming to boost population numbers </strong><br>By Hwee Goh, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : Singaporeans seem open to having more foreigners here to boost population numbers.<br><br>But they do expect these people to sink roots and commit to becoming Singaporean.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Our reporter speaks to Singaporeans about a point raised in Friday's Budget that Permanent Residents will be encouraged to become citizens.<br><br>It is all to do with a falling birth rate that is now one of the lowest in the world.<br><br>Not enough of babies are born here each year, so it is likely the shortfall will have to be replaced through immigration.<br><br>So the government said it needs to give PRs an incentive to become citizens.<br><br>How that is done is not clear but observers say currently PRs have enough perks to keep them as PRs, so it may mean revoking some of these perks to make it more attractive for them to become citizens.<br><br>BG George Yeo, Trade and Industry Minister, said: "I think we should continue to welcome PRs into Singapore really we need them in the economy. What we want is to make sure that citizens get a leg up over PRs, they are special, they are part of the Singapore core."<br><br>Right now, citizens have the right to vote, enjoy housing and upgrading subsidies, and government CPF top-ups.<br><br>They also have to do national service.<br><br>First generation PRs do not have to do NS, but their children, who are also PRs, do.<br><br>They also pay higher school fees.<br><br>Locals did not seem concerned about these differences.<br><br>"No matter any country you come is OK as long as you stay in Singapore and have babies and become Singapore citizen is OK," said one Singaporean.<br><br>"Whether these people are transient or not I suppose now the society is so globalised that it does not really make a difference whether or not they are true Singaporeans so long as they blend in," said another.<br><br>Analysts tell Channel NewsAsia that this issue is a new spin to the foreign talent debate - the government is saying not only do they need their skills, now they need their babies as well!<br><br>Dr Ng Eng Hen, Acting Manpower Minister, said: "We are wanting babies for babies sake!"<br><br>BG Yeo said: "We welcome girls marrying foreign men and their husbands becoming citizens. we welcome Singaporean men marrying foreign ladies and these ladies becoming citizens and hope their children will take up citizenship and do their national service."<br><br>Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Acting Education Minister, said: "It's not just augmenting the population, it's about the quality of the city, you need a certain diversity, different perspectives, different backgrounds rubbing against each other, testing each other and motivating each other."<br><br>More details are expected by August as a high-level committee deliberates just what incentives are needed for PRs to become citizens. - CNA<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, migration is always beneficial to countries...it doesn't even have to be properly controlled, let's just throw open our gates to anyone who wants to come in! Never mind if some of them are no-talent layabouts who can't contribute to our already strained economy (but who will still draw upon that economy's resources), I'm sure it'll be okay.<br><br>No, I'm sure that when we ask foreigners to breed with us, we won't be sending out signals about how Singaporeans are just receptacles for foreigners' bodily discharges. I'm sure that won't exacerbate the existing situation, where a large sector of our population is already perceived as a pool of readily gotten sexual conquests for foreign white men.<br><br>I'm sure that won't reinforce the rampant racial stereotyping of Asians that has already been commented on in David Henry Hwang's 'M Butterfly', just to name one example.<br><br>All we need is for them (aiyah, never mind if they're socially responsible or not) to impregnate a few local women in shotgun marriages or, at the very most, just leave behind a litter of illegitimate children. After all, it's a numbers game, people! That's all that counts - the long term stability of our family units is really less important than it's often made out to be.<br><br>I, for one, will be proud to don my army uniform and lay down my life for these new fellow citizens of mine, these European / American society rejects, these hormonally crazed people who I am sure respect all races and do not in any way express the belief that they are superior in any way to the non-caucasians in Singapore, these gentle folk who never engage in hooligan-ish behaviour, who never harass Singaporean women by throwing bread at them in Italian restaurants. These great, noble people who I shall have the great privilege of sacrificing my life for, even though they haven't had to do NS.<br><br>Of course, this new policy means that there won't be any more Chinese, Malay or Indian people left in Singapore...since we're all supposed to interbreed with foreigners (and yeah, I'm sure only Caucasian foreigners are included in this plan), Singapore will be a country of nothing but Eurasians eventually. Never mind, no sacrifice is too great in the name of commercial sustainability!<br><br>Sometimes I have really naughty, unworthy thoughts...like maybe how declining birth rates in Singapore are due to a whole range of different factors, and how maybe the problem could be solved with radical reforms, like making our employment sectors more family friendly (through for example legislating for maternity and paternity leave, restructuring and really changing mindsets to allow more part time or contract work).<br><br>Sometimes I even think that big problems could be solved if Singapore allowed for more personal and political liberty, thus stopping the steady outflow of large numbers of our best and brightest that migrate to liberal countries like the U.S. and Canada every year due to their disgust with the state of affairs in their own home country.<br><br>I am ashamed to admit that sometimes I think these are better solutions to the problem, rather than some really blunt and primitive strategy of just marrying off our sons and daughters to foreigners in order to gain a practical advantage, just like they used to do in tribal societies and tribal politics, before we became more civilised. But no, I'm sure I'm wrong here.<br><br>On a completely unrelated topic, the weather in Perth is really nice this time of the year, wouldn't you agree?</div>
