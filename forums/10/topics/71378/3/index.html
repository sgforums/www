At no point did I say there was an interbreeding conspiracy - I inferred that interbreeding would be the -result-, but I said that the -intention- of the government's policy was, as you correctly pointed out, to increase Singapore's population.<br><br>Please read my amended post above, wherein I promised to kick Ged's arse. If you guys can be objective, I think you'd be able to see that some regulars on these boards do appear to have developed so possessive an instinct over said boards that things escalate out of control and beyond productiveness very easily and quickly. Sure, I fully admit that I have my personal prejudices, and so do people like SmallPanda, et al. Nevertheless, in stating these prejudices, we seldom ever initiated the process of making it a personal matter. I believe that the possessiveness that some regulars have attached to these fori have prompted them to attack both the post and the poster rather indiscriminately. I mean, look at Ged's comments about SmallPanda, who I don't think started hostilities with him...SmallPanda was having fun stating some admittedly eccentric opinions, which reasonable posters knew were eccentric, but we let him get on with his harmless fun, and the next thing we knew, Ged took it as his personal mission to throw mud at SP.<br><br>I have no personal quarrel with most of you, like Heng@ (who I hadn't even spoken to before but who decided to throw in a personal attack anyway), but like I said, Ged dragged my girlfriend into this; she's an incredibly sweet girl who hasn't done a thing to him, yet he very readily and gladly insulted her, in an attempt to score a cheap point. That is unforgivable.</div></blockquote>yes i agreed with u on the getting personal thing.. but i dun agreed with alot of your point b4 that.. haha..<br><br>anyway.. i think ppl here should not take things said here too personally.. just voice your view and carry on with your life once u are off it... no point always ganging up.... stick to the topic pls...sometimes things said here are meant to be jokes.. but sometimes ppl dun find it funny and get personnal....pls come here with an open heart.. if not just stay away and be a lawyer or gangster or MP....ok .. that all i have to say..... my 2 cents worth of comment. haha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

To him, these may just be words on a screen, but at the end of the day there are real people with real feelings facing these screens.<br><br>I made a deliberate effort to drag subudei down to ground zero to give him the view from there, and he now obviously feels the pinch of the injustice he has been dishing out.  Whether or not he chooses to develop any insight into the consequences of his behaviour is entirely up to him.<br><br>For those who ask what right I have to be judge, jury and executioner, I have none, over and above that of a person who saw something seriously wrong and decided to take the initiative to stop it.

            <div class='col-md body'>ai yo yo.Indeed Ged,you are right abt hiring a shark as a life guard.I can't imagine I wanted to start a petition to get you nominated as moderator.<br><br>But never mind.<br><br>The fact is that Singapore does have a low birth rate.The rumour is that it is only the Chinese community that is producing few children,while the other communities as happily churning away future Singaporeans.I have never known of an Indian/Malay/others family with less than 2 children.<br><br>Anyway,migration is a necessary thing.Without migration,we would not be where we are today.As it is,the only way I see change happening is when SM Lee dies.I am just hoping that he does.He has done much good for the country but needs to be put out to pasture.with a sniper bullet.or a heart attack.or fatal injury.<br><br>The matter is that we would not be where we are today without immigrants,and all of us are descended from immigrants.from China/India/all over the bloody place.We need them to survive economically.As for them sinking roots,I doubt most of them will.They come here simply to make more money and then in the end return to their home country.And our locals marrying foreigners,either men or women,well,there are some that marry out of love,there are some that marry for less romantic reasons and there are some that marry for economic reasons.How do you think the Viets feel abt their women marrying Singaporean men to come over here,or Chinese peasant girls marrying our boys to come over?<br><br>Our country is not the only one with this problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow...has anyone seen Gedanken's brain? It appears to have gone missing.<br><br>There he goes again, trying to claim the moral high ground, trying to portray himself as a righteous crusader for the greater good. It's fairly obvious that this is no more than a hackneyed and hypocritical attempt by him to publicly excuse his own love of public mudslinging and personal insults. As I've pointed out before, look at the trend in his posts - he has virtually ALWAYS been responsible for starting and escalating acrimonious exchanges with other members of these boards. People come here to air their views, and along comes this sad wanker who takes up a no-holds-barred 'moral crusade' against anyone and everyone. This bugger is a petty, malicious sod who gets his rocks off by throwing mud at people at every opportunity. He has no life, so he uses these boards as a proxy, and gains self esteem through making cheap shots at other people. How hopelessly pathetic.<br><br>He and his brainless cronies love the trip they get here...they gang up and think that shouting everyone down with cheap insults means that they rule these boards, that they've stamped their seal of authority here. Then they get to go to bed at night, clutching their pillows and whispering to themselves, "Oooohh yes...I am the big man on sgforums.com...".

It appears to have gone missing.<br><br>There he goes again, trying to claim the moral high ground, trying to portray himself as a righteous crusader for the greater good. It's fairly obvious that this is no more than a hackneyed and hypocritical attempt by him to publicly excuse his own love of public mudslinging and personal insults. As I've pointed out before, look at the trend in his posts - he has virtually ALWAYS been responsible for starting and escalating acrimonious exchanges with other members of these boards. People come here to air their views, and along comes this sad wanker who takes up a no-holds-barred 'moral crusade' against anyone and everyone. This bugger is a petty, malicious sod who gets his rocks off by throwing mud at people at every opportunity. He has no life, so he uses these boards as a proxy, and gains self esteem through making cheap shots at other people. How hopelessly pathetic.<br><br>He and his brainless cronies love the trip they get here...they gang up and think that shouting everyone down with cheap insults means that they rule these boards, that they've stamped their seal of authority here. Then they get to go to bed at night, clutching their pillows and whispering to themselves, "Oooohh yes...I am the big man on sgforums.com...".

At no point did I say there was an interbreeding conspiracy - I inferred that interbreeding would be the -result-, but I said that the -intention- of the government's policy was, as you correctly pointed out, to increase Singapore's population.<br><br>Please read my amended post above, wherein I promised to kick Ged's arse. If you guys can be objective, I think you'd be able to see that some regulars on these boards do appear to have developed so possessive an instinct over said boards that things escalate out of control and beyond productiveness very easily and quickly. Sure, I fully admit that I have my personal prejudices, and so do people like SmallPanda, et al. Nevertheless, in stating these prejudices, we seldom ever initiated the process of making it a personal matter. I believe that the possessiveness that some regulars have attached to these fori have prompted them to attack both the post and the poster rather indiscriminately. I mean, look at Ged's comments about SmallPanda, who I don't think started hostilities with him...SmallPanda was having fun stating some admittedly eccentric opinions, which reasonable posters knew were eccentric, but we let him get on with his harmless fun, and the next thing we knew, Ged took it as his personal mission to throw mud at SP.<br><br>I have no personal quarrel with most of you, like Heng@ (who I hadn't even spoken to before but who decided to throw in a personal attack anyway), but like I said, Ged dragged my girlfriend into this; she's an incredibly sweet girl who hasn't done a thing to him, yet he very readily and gladly insulted her, in an attempt to score a cheap point. That is unforgivable.</div></blockquote>i've personally attacked u? oh no u dunno what an attack is like. all im asking is, since u said u wanna kick gen's butt, ARE u gonna do so? or is it an empty threat ONLY? curious yah?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
