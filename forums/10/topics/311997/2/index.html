              <p>Sorry, can't find the statement you quote. China in history were made up of different kingdoms at different times. Wikipedia refers the RPC or ROC as a state, a country.</p>

              <p><br>Well, I won't say china handling of the issue is ideal that all. In my opinion, the chinese government isn't going a good job in controlling the whole issue currently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I'm attacking is people who are pro-tibet as in those that think that tibet is not a fault AT ALL. And those that thinks that the tibetians have a right to be peaceful...when they are responsible for turning the sistuation into a violent one.</p>
              <p>I don't remember protest in the past involves SOO much violence.</p>
              <p>This is a case where both tibet AND china are at fault. That is what people needs to recongize. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The whole sistuation now is basically the same as the riots in singapore(minus singaporean police activiely killing so many protestors . Tibetians destroying han chinese shops, accidently or 'indirectly' ( well at times) responsible for the deaths of a few han chinese.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But  bear in mind that tibetians are a minority now, han chinese are a majority. So the tibetians who seek indepedence or more automony NEEDS to consider the interest of the han chinese living there as well, unless the majority of the han chinese wants to leave tibet...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This isn't a black and white sistuation.</p>

              <p>Tibetans have been protesting all the time but because their protest is peaceful so the Chinese army easily put them down- and thats why no body pays attention to them - After a while China believe their own lie and as if  nothing has happened -</p>
              <p>This time the Tibetan obviously fed up with the futile peacefull approach and explored in violence- What happen? People started to pay attention- Why? Why do people have to use violence inorder to be noticed?</p>
              <p>So sad- China deserved to be embarrased! China cannot just pretend they don't exist - I as a Chinese prefer honesty than blind pride - be honest be truthfull- Don't defend China blindly!!!</p>

              <p>You imply that only violent protest get attention. That is very dangerous.</p>
              <p>There is no proof that <span style="color: #0000ff;">Tibetans have been protesting all the time, </span><span style="color: #000000;">definitely not the tibetans living in Tibet. There is also no </span><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chinese army easily put them down, there was no need. There has been influx of tourist into Lhasa, especially after the railway link was completed. Many of my friends have taken that trip.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The PRC government definitely did not handle the recent incidents well. But to gain independence for Tibet, which is an autonomous region of China, it will take a lot more effort and publicity. Rioting is a set back, rather than contribution, the Dalai Lama in exile knows that very well.<br></span></p>

              <p>Well, I won't say china handling of the issue is ideal that all. In
              my opinion, the chinese government isn't going a good job in
              controlling the whole issue currently.</p>
              <p>What I'm attacking is people who are pro-tibet as in those that
              think that tibet is not a fault AT ALL. And those that thinks that
              the tibetians have a right to be peaceful...when they are
              responsible for turning the sistuation into a violent one.</p>
              <p>I don't remember protest in the past involves SOO much
              violence.</p>
              <p>This is a case where both tibet AND china are at fault. That is
              what people needs to recongize.</p>
              <p>The whole sistuation now is basically the same as the riots in
              singapore(minus singaporean police activiely killing so many
              protestors . Tibetians destroying han chinese shops, accidently or
              'indirectly' ( well at times) responsible for the deaths of a few
              han chinese.</p>
              <p>But  bear in mind that tibetians are a minority now, han
              chinese are a majority. So the tibetians who seek indepedence or
              more automony NEEDS to consider the interest of the han chinese
              living there as well, unless the majority of the han chinese wants
              to leave tibet...</p>
              <p>This isn't a black and white sistuation.</p>

              <p>Let's hope the rioters will listen to Dalai Lama and China government and stop the violence soon, it has caused a lot of damage to the innocents. I have personally talked to some tibetans, most are them have positive impression on china government.</p>

              <p>It is dangerous to have this thinking that "only violence protest get attention". A lot of terrorists have this kind of mindset, they killed the innocents just because the government don't agree to them.<br>So you are talking about the history during the Mao Ze Dong's time. There are much more ethnic Han being killed at a greater cruelty extends. Mao is gone already, wakeup. Are you going to support every province to get independence just because there is tyrant in their history?</p>

              <p>@<a href="/users/230489"><span style="color: #0000ff;">kirkisweird</span></a> :How sure are you of Tibet being a peaceful place? Have you ever been there? If China pulls out of Tibet, will all calamity be avoided and will Tibetans be living happily ever after?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">How many problems have been reported from Tibet before the Chinese invasion?</span></p>
              <p>Right, get India to claim Tibet and you'll have calamity alright.</p>
              <p>US? Hmm, I think they got one country screwed up already. I certainly don't wanna know how Tibet ends up.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Well indians lack the spine so lets forget them.As of US is screwed?You are really in a delusional world with ur brothers who balantly yelp but has no idea what's happening.</span></p>

              <p>Many states in the US also did not belong to them. Texas and California were annexed from Mexico, Hawaii was an independent kingdom that was "overthrown". So, do you think that USA would "free" these states?                       </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Well Texas decided to join USA and tey have the right to keep their flags at same level as US flag.And I dnt hear any one from these mentioned states crying for independence or being killed off.</span></p>
              <p>==========================================</p>
              <p>@SGdiehard:There is no proof that <span style="color: #0000ff;">Tibetans have been protesting all the time,</span> <span style="color: #000000;">definitely not the tibetans living in Tibet. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes because they were killed off if they protested.Tibetians escaped to other countries and who didnt have to fear for their life has been protesting.Or perhaps you forgot to read the Dalai lama's demands for many years?????????????????????????or isnt tht counted as protest?????????????????????????????????There has been protest by Tiebeteans all over including Tibet.Just tht u didnt hear of it doesnt mean there was no protest.</span></span></p>
