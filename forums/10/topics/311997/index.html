              <p>Well, if like what those western countries were to tell us that China got no right to rule Tibet because Tibet is not their land, ok... then please free Australia from the whites because the land of Australia doesn't belong to the whites.Ireland doesn't belong to British too or else why are there so many Ireland independent fighters fighting for Ireland independent from Great Britian?Then, the white people should also return Canada to the real master of Canada because Canada too doesnt belong to the White people.So is New Zealand!!!</p>

              <p>How sure are you of Tibet being a peaceful place? Have you ever been there? If China pulls out of Tibet, will all calamity be avoided and will Tibetans be living happily ever after?</p>
              <p>I think China did Tibet a great favour by claiming them as their own. Without China, Tibetans wouldn't have the money to survive. Their economy certainly wouldn't be progressing. Neither will they have the standard of living they are having at this point in time.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, Tibet is part of China and by choice of the Tibetians. During the Chinese Civil War, the Tibetians explicitly went to the then ruling KMT government for instructions. KMT wasn't too concerned with Tibet but the Tibetian administration saw themselves as part of China and had proclaimed so. When KMT was retreating to TW, Tibet again seek KMT's instruction as a Federal govt would from a central govt. When the Communists first went into Tibet, they were actually welcomed. It was only a while later when the communists tried to take lands away from the landlords and distribute them to the average Tibetians that things start to turn sour. To be fair, the Communists were not doing things in the nicest way too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Current CCP's problem was not with the Dalai Lama per se as he had in many occassion said that Tibet is part of China and has no wish for independence. CCP's problem is with the people who went along with Dalai during his exile. While Dalai is the leader, he is having trouble keeping the extremist faction in check. Hence when the extremist instigated the recent violent riot, he was not only taken aback but is also having trouble keeping things down. Hence the threat to step down as leader if the violence continues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CCP's strategy is to keep Dalai as the extremely high profile leader of the exile govt. It balance against the extremist faction and prevent anybody from that faction in taking over the leadership. Dalai is aging and if his profile remains high, his next successor will face considerable challenges to live up to the reputation of his predecessor. CCP's hope is that with the natural passing of Dalai and without a strong successor, the entire Dalai faction will collapse from within, bringing the extremist along with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The recent violent protest took both Dalai and CCP by surprise as both had thought that the extremists were checked. But the extremists' move was nevertheless a shot in the foot as it exposes their planted agents within Tibet without acquiring a significant result. Not only has the international community been understanding to CCP over the issue, but Dalai himself had spoke against the uprising. CCP's reaction is also a lot more restrain than expected and the entire uprising is unlikely to create the effect of Tiananmen or force CCP into making any concession.</p>

              <p>Why there is this perception that Tibet must be claimed by other country? Is it because it is small and lack of resources? But Singapore also is small and lack of resource? </p>
              <p>I think the mountain kingdom of Bhutan is doing well and experimenting with democracy-</p>
              <p>Why the assumption that without China invasion there wll not be any development? Why impose the type of development onto the Tibetan? Can't the Tibetan themselves develop their own contry?</p>
              <p>Do you think Tibetans are primitive simpletons that require the more cultured Han to "culturalized"??</p>
              <p> I agreed with another poster that there is some kind of culture chauvanism exposed here - "You primitive babarians, I give you food, I give you development what else do you want???"<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>you sound like the Singapore government- always compare to the past and assume other won't change and open up-</p>
              <p>In fact, China invade tibet when it is about to open out to the outside world -and Dalai Lama also start to study western democracy and was  quite open minded to introduce change to the country-</p>

Even Dalai Lama is not asking for independence. He even said that Tibet get many advantage under the china rule. I strongly agree with him.<br>The issue now is those mobster are provoked by the western power to carry out riots. Why only it happen now? because China is going to host the Olympi 2008 soon, and they just want to take this advantage to create problem.

              <p>oh yes its a peaceful place =) I never doubt it. Yes US and UK had wars ALL the time, and they are not to be spared from this kind of things either. With so many countries fighting, where is peace? The thing now is not to say who is bad or who is good. But i cant bear to see china bullying tibetans and tibetans killing chinese. Why cant we have peace? I mean peaceful means.</p>
              <p>And China is not only the country that can claim soveignity. Any country could have done so. Why china? Cant it be india or something?</p>

              <p>to those who think Tibet has never been part of China till 1950, here are the facts:</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Go back to history, Tibet was ruled by emperors for many decades but was invaded by Dzungars, the mongols in 1717. Emperor Kangxi sent two military expeditions to drive the mongols out in 1718 and 1720, and installed the 7th Dalai Lama with administrative power in 1751.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Again 1788 and 1791, Tibet was invaded twice by the Nepalese who were repelled by the Qing Government. During this period of time, Tibet was already part of China, otherwise why do you think the Qing Dynasty would send soldiers to defend them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1904, with the decline of the Qing dynasty, the British invaded Tibet forcing a treaty to allow free passes for British and Indians into Tibet. "Despite the mutual agreement, the British expedition did take the lives of a few thousand unprepared Tibetan soldiers and civilians. The biggest massacre took place on March 31, 1904 at a mountain pass halfway to Gyantse near a village called Guru…" But even the Brits, they recognized Tibet as part of China.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">In the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, drafted by the British, Britain recognized the “suzerainty of China over Thibet" and, in conformity with such admitted principle, engaged "not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p>How can country like India claim sovereignty on Tibet?</p>
              <p>When you get your historical fact right, you can discuss hypothetical situation, who can rule tibet better? the monks? the upclass of their society? india? or the overseas tibetans?</p>

              i think whether Tibet belongs to China is not for anyone of us to decide. It should be decided by the principle of self determination. Though in practice it is impossible to be done.
                  
                  And for those who think China is all wrong and stuff and that USA is great, think again. 
                  
                  Many states in the US also did not belong to them. Texas and California were annexed from Mexico, Hawaii was an independent kingdom that was "overthrown". So, do you think that USA would "free" these states?

              <p>That's one reason I dislike alot of singaporean liberals. Liberal does not mean they know more stuff than what the pro-PAP people knows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At times, they know even less stuff. Alot of them keep looking at the world in black and white, and for crying out loud, US isn't that liberal at all you know.</p>
              <p>Fox news is EVEN more conservative than singapore. And DON'T even get me started on their creationism and evolution debate. Or americans still arguing if global warming is a myth, man made or natural. Liberity isn't the magic to solve all the problems for the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many people and liberals in singapore even know about the harmful side of free speech and etc? It means it gives a chance for people to be as dumb as they want, because they have the right of free speech.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A liberal country does not mean that country is better, and as far as humanity is concerned, we can say this.</p>

              <p>A person can be clever, but PEOPLE are dumb.</p>
