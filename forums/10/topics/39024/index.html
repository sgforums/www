The U.S. command announced on Saturday the capture of the city. However, it turned out that the information was premature.<br><br>On Sunday, American troops ran, all of a sudden, into a fierce resistance of the Iraqi army, shelling American positions in the Nasiriyah suburbia.<br><br>European sources report from the combat zone in Nasiriyah that the movement of the U.S. division was blocked, and the U.S Air Force was summoned to help. In the meantime, military analysts report that the tactics of the Iraqi command in that area becomes clear on the whole.<br><br>Nasiriyah is situated 320 kilometers south of Baghdad. There are two bridges across the Euphrates within the city, which are of great strategic importance, since they can be used for shifting military hardware across the country's biggest river.<br><br><a href="http://www.itar-tass.ru/different/oper_lenta/english/iraq/242630.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.itar-tass.ru/different/oper_lenta/english/iraq/242630.html</a></div>

War is harmful," Mohammad Baqir Hakim of the<br>Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI) told<br>al-Jazeera TV news network.<br><br>Therefore "we cannot ... be part of the US action since we do not<br>believe in this action," Hakim said.<br><br>SAIRI's armed wing, the Al-Badr Brigade, is believed to number between<br>10,000 and 15,000 fighters. Many are said to have crossed into<br>Kurdish-held northern Iraq in anticipation of the US-led war aimed at<br>toppling Saddam Hussein.<br><br>Hakim told the Qatari television station that because the war defied<br>international public opinion as well as UN Security Council<br>resolutions, "we can consider it an aggressive war."<br><br>He also said that his group along with the rest of the Iraqi opposition<br>opposed any Turkish intervention in the north of Iraq, saying that this<br>would "make the situation of the Iraqi issue very serious."<br><br>Both SAIRI and one of the main Kurdish opposition groups said earlier<br>Saturday that the Iraqi opposition would be allowed to rule the country<br>immediately after Saddam is ousted from power.<br><br>They said the United States had had a change of heart and abandoned<br>plans to install a temporary US military administration.<br><br>SAIRI number two Abdelaziz Hakim told AFP on Saturday that "until now,<br>the al-Badr Brigade has not received orders from their superiors to get<br>fully involved (in the conflict) and we do not know when they will."<br><br>Shiite soldiers would, he hoped, play a part in ousting Saddam "in due<br>time", but it would neither be with, nor under the command, of US<br>forces, he said.<br><br>Western diplomatic sources in Tehran say that the United States, which<br>sees SAIRI as too close to the Iranian regime for its liking, has told<br>the Shiite opposition that its armed forces were not authorised to<br>enter Iraq after the start of war.<br><br>The SAIRI leader was named at a meeting in late February as part of a<br>six-member collective leadership which is set to decide on a<br>post-Saddam interim government.<br><br></div>

Nor did pictures of angry Arabs protesting in the Middle Eastern, screaming "Death to America," or images U.S. troops briefly raising the American flag over a seized Iraqi city.<br><br>The administration says Iraqis will be better off once Saddam is removed and insists that its cause is just. Convincing the rest of the world that the U.S. and British-led war is both just and lawful is a hard sell.<br><br>"Without corresponding resolutions of the U.N. Security Council, this occupation will be illegal," Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told Russian lawmakers last week as U.S. and British troops crossed into Iraq.<br><br>Diane Orentlicher, professor of international law at American University, said that "most of the world believes that the war does violate international law."<br><br>Even so, the dynamics changed dramatically once bombs began falling, Orentlicher said. "It's not in anybody's interest to challenge a decision that's already been made, when there's no possibility for changing it," she said. "At this point, I think most countries see their common interest is in not having a long, bloody war."<br><br>The war can win belated international legitimacy, particularly if Iraq is found to have weapons of mass destruction as the administration contends, some analysts say.<br><br>That could turn public opinion in Washington's favor if accompanied by a military campaign "that goes relatively quickly and with low numbers of casualties," said Kurt Campbell of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.<br><br>The United States argues that U.N. resolution 1441, passed unanimously in November, provided sufficient authority for the U.S.-led war. That resolution threatened Baghdad with "serious consequences" if it failed to show it had handed over or destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>Facing threatened vetoes by permanent Security Council members France and Russia, the United States and allies Britain and Spain withdrew a second resolution that would have given U.N. approval for the use of military force.<br><br>President Bush signaled that he did not want to waste time in debating the nuances of international law. "It is not a question of authority, it is a question of will," he told the nation.<br><br>The U.N. charter authorizes the Security Council to permit force "to maintain or restore international peace and security." It also allows nations to use force individually in cases of self-defense against an armed attack or against an imminent attack.<br><br>Critics of the war and some legal scholars argue Iraq did not pose such a threat to the United States.<br><br>Bush threatened war-crimes prosecution for Iraqi soldiers who followed illegal orders, but failed to grasp that the war itself violates international law, said Philip Alston, a law professor at New York University and former U.N. human rights official.<br><br>"It opens the door for every country to take the law into its own hands and launch pre-emptive military strikes without any universally binding restraints," Alston said.<br><br>The administration rejects such notions and says its position will be validated by both law and history.<br><br>"You're going to find the historians, legal scholars will have differing conclusions about these matters," said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. He also said Bush decided to use force after concluding that "Iraq's failure to disarm presented a threat to the people of the United States."<br><br>EDITOR'S NOTE Tom Raum has covered Washington for The Associated Press since 1973, including five presidencies.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>USWAR/View of an Indian defense expert<br><br>New Delhi, March 23, IRNA -- An Indian defense expert rules out the<br>possibility of Saddam Hussein surrendering to the American military<br>machine.<br>Lt. Col. (Retd.) Anil Bhat talking to IRNA on the latest<br>development of clash between the American and Iraqi forces said today<br>that Saddam will fight till the end especially around Baghdad.<br>It will become more tough for the American and British forces<br>when the war will be fought deep inside Iraq, he added.<br>Referring to some reports that Saddam has been killed, Bhat said<br>that these reports are coming from the sources of countries supporting<br>the war and therefore could not be trusted.<br>Even if Saddam Hussain is killed, the leaders of the Ba'th party<br>will resist against America, he added.<br>He said, it is possible that some of the high ranking officials<br>of Iraqi regime and leaders of the Ba'th party may defect, but<br>imagining that the whole establishment of the regime and the Ba'th<br>party will be dismantled does not seem to be the reality.<br>Referring to the reports about fight between the forces of two<br>sides around Basra and claims of besieging this city, Bhat said that<br>American forces are evading capturing this city because of the fear of<br>stiff resistance and coming face to face with the Iraqi forces and<br>perhaps ordinary people.<br>This war is totally different from that of war in Afghanistan and<br>the 1991 Persian Gulf war because there were some reasons for American<br>military action, he said.<br>But this time around American President George Bush is under<br>tremendous pressure from the International opinion and even from<br>inside America, he said, adding that if the war prolonged and<br>casualties of American forces go high then not only this will have<br>negative impact on the morale of American forces but also cause more<br>resistance from Saddam's loyal forces.<br>Bhat, who also served as the spokesman of India's Ministry of<br>Defense before, criticized the role of western media for war<br>coverage, saying that they are disseminating only those news they are<br>being given or those for which they are being requested.<br>The western media under military protection have put the number<br>of casualties at very low but on the other hand they are giving<br>reports of heavy bombardments and missile attacks on Baghdad and other<br>parts of Iraq. He said that considering the scale of war the<br>casualties might be well beyond the three digit numbers.<br>The Indian defense expert said that with the view of military<br>superiority of America and Britain this classical war will end<br>eventually with the defeat of Iraqi forces but the question remains<br>that will the American forces succeed in defeating the people of Iraq<br>who will fight for protecting their own nation and not for Saddam<br>Hussein.<br>/AA/AR<br>End<br><br><a href="http://www.irna.com/en/head/030323192329.ehe.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.irna.com/en/head/030323192329.ehe.shtml</a></div>

U.S. officials confirmed that 12 soldiers were missing after an ambush near the southern city of An Nasiriyah.<br><br>_ The U.S. Central Command said Marines defeated Iraqi forces near An Nasiriyah in the sharpest engagement of the war so far. It said up to nine Marines were killed in the battle.<br><br>_ U.S. troops found a suspected chemical factory near the city of Najaf, about 85 miles south of Baghdad, and were trying to determine whether it was involved in making chemical weapons, U.S. officials said.<br><br>_ In Washington, President Bush (news - web sites) demanded that American troops held captive in Iraq (news - web sites) be treated humanely and said he was pleased with the progress of the war. "Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) is losing control of his country," Bush said.<br><br>_ Explosions shook Baghdad early Monday as the Iraqi capital came under another heavy air attack.<br><br>_ A U.S. Patriot missile battery mistakenly shot down a British Royal Air Force fighter aircraft near the Iraqi border with Kuwait, killing both fliers on board.<br><br>_ A U.S. soldier was detained on suspicion of throwing grenades into three tents at a 101st Airborne command center in Kuwait, killing one fellow serviceman and wounding 15. The motive in the attack "most likely was resentment," a U.S. Army spokesman said.<br><br>_ A British television news reporter who disappeared in southern Iraq was believed dead. ITN television news said its reporter Terry Lloyd and two colleagues apparently were caught in a barrage of "friendly fire" on Saturday.<br><br>_ Hundreds of police and security agents in Baghdad searched for a possibly downed coalition pilot, shooting into the reeds and shallow water alongside the capital's Tigris River. The U.S. military said there were no reports of coalition aircraft being shot down or a missing pilot.<br><br>_ The U.S. military's northern front against Iraq appears to be building, with American planes landing in the Kurdish north and more airstrikes pounding positions of a militant Islamic group with alleged al-Qaida and Baghdad ties.<br><br>_ U.S. military leaders said they expect fighting in Iraq to intensify as coalition forces advance toward Baghdad, facing increased resistance from Saddam's troops and their possible use of chemical or biological weapons.<br><br></div>

The hope that all garrisons and Iraqi field units will lay down arms after the encirclement of Baghdad is illusory," Sazhin said.<br><br>As for the promise of the opening Northern front to consolidate the British-American positions, he said "it is only forming, and it is impossible to speak of its role".<br><br>"Besides, the attitude of the Kurdish population to the foreign troops and the problems of relations with Turkey are still open to question.

            <div class='col-md body'>Iraqis Use Guerrilla Tactics To Slow US<br>US Troops Not Being Welcomed As 'Liberators'<br>By Douglas Hamilton<br><br>rense.com<br>3-23-3<br><br>DOHA (Reuters) - Washington's hopes that U.S.-led forces would be welcomed into Iraq as liberators bled into the sand on Sunday, the fourth day of war, as Iraqi troops fought back with determination and guerrilla tactics.<br><br>There was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction being used by Iraq in battle. Instead, Iraqi troops were fighting with machinegun-mounted Japanese pickup trucks against squadrons of the world's most formidable battle tank, the U.S. Abrams.<br><br>There were reports of between 10 and 15 U.S. troops killed in fighting to secure bridgeheads across the River Euphrates at Nassiriyah, with perhaps up to 50 more wounded.<br><br>U.S. General John Abizaid acknowledged it was the "toughest day of resistance" so far. He said Iraqi forces near Nassiriya inflicted several casualties in "the sharpest engagement of the war." There were 12 American troops missing, he added.<br><br>"Everybody was predicting they'd be welcomed as liberators but it's working out differently," said one senior Arab official in the Gulf. "The Americans had a hard day today."<br><br>Evoking Vietnam and Mogadishu, Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf warned U.S. forces they were driving into "a quagmire from which they can never emerge, except dead."<br><br>Iraqi forces evidently switched from their disastrous static defense of the 1991 Gulf War to classic guerrilla tactics, using loyalist militias to bolster regular forces.<br><br>"There are a number of incidents occurring to the rear of the main combat forces," Abizaid said at the Central Command briefing, indicating guerrilla-style attacks. He said Iraqis had pretended to surrender, then ambushed U.S. forces.<br><br>FEARFUL CAPTIVES<br><br>Despite at least 2,000 Iraqi surrenders, the picture was of a far more spirited fight by Iraq's troops than some analysts had predicted, slowing the invading forces' sweep from Kuwait through southern Iraq toward Baghdad.<br><br>Iraqis operating in small pockets or hit-and-run raids held up the U.S.-led advance in at least four places and captured their first U.S. prisoners, whom they displayed on television.<br><br>In grim pictures, Iraq showed four bodies of what it said were U.S. soldiers and five captives taken near Nassiriya, who said they were from a U.S. Army logistics support unit.<br><br>Abizaid called the pictures "disgusting."<br><br>The capture suggested that Iraqi forces, perhaps in small raiding groups, attacked the exposed flank of a U.S. armored advance which has plunged some 200 km (120 miles) north into Iraq in just 72 hours, stretching its lines of support.<br><br>Reports and television images of battling Iraqi units in the south came from reporters traveling with those American and British units. There was no hard information on the progress of other units who were not accompanied by journalists.<br><br>A U.S. military spokesman told the Central Command briefing there were movements deep in to Iraq "that we're not showing." Iraqis also paid with their lives for their attack on the U.S. tanks near Najaf, leaving bodies strewn across the desert. But Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had to acknowledge that U.S. soldiers were dead and others captured and Britain said a Tornado ground attack plane with a crew of two had been downed by mistake by a U.S. Patriot missile.<br><br>Britain has already lost 16 men in non-combat incidents, with two helicopter crashes and the downing of the Tornado.<br><br>British Harrier ground-attack jets were brought in to pound an Iraqi redoubt near the Gulf port of Umm Qasr only after several hours of fighting, shown live on television, in which U.S. tanks apparently failed to break Iraqi resistance.<br><br>After night fell, some Iraqis were still holding out.<br><br>There was continuing Iraqi resistance at Basra, Iraq's second city in the far south, and, at Najaf, U.S. officers expressed amazement at pickup truck attacks, a tactic dating from the 1980's Chad civil war in the Sahara desert.<br><br>The Iraqis, while massively outgunned, were also using rocket propelled grenades, machine guns and small arms to good effect to pin down U.S. forces reluctant to risk casualties.<br><br>If the tactic worked well at Umm Qasr in the relatively open territory of a port-side industrial zone, its effectiveness could be multiplied on the outskirts of Baghdad where U.S. concern to avoid civilian casualties would be far greater.<br><br>Iraq's toughest troops are arrayed south of the capital.<br><br>In Kuwait, former oil minister Ali al-Baghli said the time taken to capture Umm Qasr might undermine any faith ordinary Iraqis had that the Americans could topple Saddam Hussein.<br><br>"We are astonished that there is still resistance in Umm Qasr after all this time. It is a very small place.<br><br>"If it takes them this long to capture Umm Qasr, how long will it take to capture Tikrit or Baghdad?"<br><br></div>

"We don't want to be misunderstood and therefore we are discussing the issue with our ally."<br><br>U.S. officials said Turkey has proven uncooperative in efforts to send American troops through that country and toward Iraq.

Perhaps the time has come to redeem the unfulfilled dream of Turkey's founder, Kemal Ataturk, who salvaged the republic from the ashes of the Ottoman empire in 1923.<br><br>In 1919, when Ataturk and his comrades had begun organizing a war of resistance for Turkey's independence, then under the heels of World War I victors led by Great Britain, their map of a sacred new nation included, apart from the present-day boundaries of Turkey, the Kurdish province of Mosul (with Kirkuk), now in Iraq. Much of this area had been occupied by the British forces after the ceasefire in 1918 and was later joined with the former Ottoman Arab vilayets (provinces) of Baghdad and Basra to create Iraq. But this divided the Kurdish homelands. From Iraq too, the sub-province of Kuwait under the Kayakayam of Basra was detached to create a new emirate. Oil was then, as it is now, the main driving force; not the freedom or welfare of the people. The British colonial policy of encouraging and then creating dissension and divisions can be seen elsewhere, too, in the world - the Indian sub-continent, Palestine, Cyprus and Ireland.<br><br>In a fast-evolving strategic situation in the region, there might be an opportunity to take back oil-rich Mosul and Kirkuk, many Turks feel. Almost all political leaders, including those from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), media writers and others have reiterated the country's claims on Kirkuk. One of the reasons for going into north Iraq is to protect their kinsmen the Turkomans and their rights over the reserves of oil around Kirkuk. This area is now under the control of Saddam Hussein's Sunni Arabs, but it has been traditionally claimed by the Kurds, who are in the majority in the region. The other major reason cited, of course, is Turkish fears of Kurds declaring an independent state after the collapse of the Saddam regime.<br><br>Turkey has paid dearly during the past two decades because of almost autonomous Kurdish enclaves in north Iraq, which have inspired and assisted a fierce rebellion for independence among its own Kurds, who form 25 percent of its population. During the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s and after the 1991 Gulf War, the rebellion reached its heights. Since the beginning of the Marxist PKK (Kurdish Workers Party)-inspired rebellion in 1984, over 35,000 Turkish citizens have been killed, including 5,000 soldiers. The struggle has also shattered the social and economic fabric in the south and east of Turkey. The problem is now under control after a 1999 ceasefire was declared and the capture of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment last year and the ban on the use of the Kurdish language for education etc was eased.<br><br>Therefore, ignoring protests from foes and friends alike, the Turkish armed forces have regularly moved in and out of north Iraq to punish Turkey's residual Kurdish rebels who shelter there. It has regularly maintained some presence in Kurdish north Iraq, which was stepped up even before Turkey's parliament on March 21 authorized its troops to enter Iraq, along with granting permission to the US to use its air space to transport troops and hardware for a possible second front in Kurdish north Iraq. Turkish troops are now reported to be in north Iraq, estimated to be between 2,000 to 5,000 strong. Ever since the US administration took a decision to attack Iraq to bring about a regime change in Baghdad, even without UN sanction, serious differences and strains have emerged, not only with the US's NATO allies in Europe, but also with Turkey.<br><br>In order to conduct a successful and short war to minimize world opprobrium, as well as casualties and costs, the US asked for permission for the use of Turkish bases in southeast Turkey to station 62,000 US troops in order to open a second front against Iraq. The request was made in the US's usual insensitive fashion of public "bribing" and arm-twisting. It was irritating to hear daily broadcasts or claims that in spite of a package of nearly US$30 billion in grants and loans, Turkey was not taking the bait. Turkey has lost tens of billions of dollars following the sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990. It is one of the major reasons for the current economic malaise in Turkey.<br><br>The new and inexperienced government of the AKP, especially its leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was agreeable to provide bases to the US, but a massive majority of Turks (now 94 percent) have remained opposed to a war on Muslim Iraq. Iraq has been the friendliest of Turkey's mostly inimical neighbors until very recently. Many AKP deputies belong to southeast Turkey with Kurdish and Arab blood relations across the borders with Iraq and Syria.<br><br>Turkish president Ahmet Sezer, a former head of the Constitutional Court, has always insisted on international legitimacy before waging a war on Iraq. Before the March 1 vote that rejected the US request, he had impressed his view on the speaker of parliament. It was a somewhat confused situation. With tens of thousands of Turkish citizens protesting passionately in front of parliament and elsewhere, it further pressurized the newly- elected and divided deputies. The AKP government had come into almost absolute power unexpectedly after last November's elections, but its leader Erdogan had still to be elected in a by-election to become prime minister. This led to more confusion, with diffused decision-making centers. A day before the parliamentary vote, Turkey's military-dominated, highest policymaking body, the National Security Council, had dared not take a decision to recommend a vote for the motion in the face of overwhelming public opposition. After five hours of discussion, it left the decision to the government and parliament.<br><br>While Erdogan was enthusiastic, many in the party were opposed to giving approval. The government-supported motion, with the ruling party boasting two-thirds of the deputies in a 550-member parliament, was lost on March 1 when nearly 100 ruling party members voted against it, along with the opposition. The vote was lost by only 4 votes. This stunned the US, stumping its war plans. It certainly slowed down the preparations for the northern front. But the US still hoped that once Erdogan was elected to parliament and became prime minister, a second vote would be held.<br><br>In an unusual move, the Turkish armed forces' Chief of General Staff, General Hilmi Ozkok, issued a statement on March 5 extending its support to the government in "its option to open a second front against Iraq in the event of war [which] would shorten the conflict and minimize casualties". He said, "Turkey's support of the US would also reduce the harm to its economy." At the same time, Ozkok clarified that it was the right of parliament to reject the proposal to station US forces in Turkey, but "the Turkish armed forces' view is the same as the government's". He explained that the military had not made public its views earlier to avoid the impression of trying to influence the vote. "If we had expressed our views, it would have amounted to pressurizing the parliament for the approval of the resolution," he said. "It wouldn't have been democratic."<br><br>Ozkok pointed out that the Iraqi problem was a vital and multilateral issue having political, social and legal dimensions. Agreeing that 94 percent of the people said "no" to war, he added. "We, as soldiers, know the violence and dimensions of war and oppose the war most. It is obvious that we will suffer major damage whatever Turkey's move if a war starts. Turkey can face political, economic, social damage and also damage to its security." Ozkok went on to say, "It is a reality in the current stage that Turkey does not have the possibility and capability to prevent a war on its own. I wish the war could be prevented. Unfortunately, our choice is between the bad and worse, not between the good and bad." He noted that Turkey would suffer losses in any case, but if it joined the US, it would be compensated. He believed that it would also eliminate unexpected political developments in the north of Iraq.<br><br>Being a member of NATO since the early 1950s, Turkey's armed forces have a very close relationship with the US military brass. Turkey is heavily reliant on the International Monetary Fund, controlled by the US, to bail it out of its current acute economic problems and ease the weight of massive external debt payments. This was a failsafe position for Turkey. If the US carried out a short and quick war successfully, Turkey would play a major role in the reshaping of Iraq. If in the unlikely event of a peaceful solution of the problem, Turkey would have won enough brownie points with the US.<br><br>But after taking over as prime minister, Erdogan had a better appreciation of all the pros and cons, including in his party. It might even split. Sensing the mood of the country and in his party, he continued to stall the second vote while the US continued with its arm-twisting tactics, which further annoyed the Turkish leadership, media and the public. The US then said that it would change its war plans and fly its troops and arms from Romanian and Bulgarian bases and elsewhere to north Iraq. It said that it would do without Turkish bases and withdrew its financial package.<br><br>On the whole it was an unappetizing show, as it has been between the US and the UK on the one side and France and Germany on the other. Some US ships were diverted to the Red Sea, but many still wait at Turkish ports to unload military hardware for transfer to the war front in southeast Turkey.<br><br>Statements and counter statements, bullying tactics, threats and defiance between the US and Turkey have left no less deep a chasm than between the Atlantic alliance's Western members. There is a lot of confusion, acrimony and misunderstanding aired publicly, even after an agreement was passed in parliament for the US to use its air space. Reportedly, the Turkish government had even refused the US its permission for 24 hours unless Washington agreed to let Ankara send its troops to northern Iraq.<br><br>Secretary of State Colin Powell had three phone conversations in 48 hours with Erdogan to bring him round. The confusion continued when US officials said that the US had not agreed to Turkish demands, but senior Turkish officials said that they had reached an agreement with Powell that allowed them to add to the troops they already had in north Iraq. The confusion, which even included reports of Turkish troop movements into north Iraq, came amid high tension between the two NATO allies and clenched teeth comments by US officials (Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld did show commendable restraint, though). Later on, it turned out that fresh Turkish troops had not entered north Iraq after all. But the ill will, rancor and suspicions remain.<br><br>For the moment it appears that the US will not be utilizing much of the airspace facility as its plans have already been completely upset in north Iraq. Incidentally, a few days before the terms were agreed to, a US Special Forces team in north Iraq ran into trouble with Iraqi forces and requested air support. Turkey rejected the request. While the US forces escaped unharmed, Turkey's refusal stunned Pentagon and State Department officials. Verily, US-Turkish relations have hit a nadir after years of close cooperation.<br><br>Compare this to the 1950s, when the Soviet Union, one of the victors of World War II, had staked claims over two northeastern provinces of Turkey and some control over the Bosphorus Straits. A nervous Turkey, which had rightly kept out of the war, as it did not want to be first devastated by the Nazis and then liberated by the Soviets, went begging to the US for protection. It sent a brigade to the Korean War to fight until the last man. Since then, through thick and thin, the allies have stayed together. Now, only a bitter taste in the mouth.<br><br>There is a lesson for all. A bully who can browbeat or thrash smaller kids, sooner or later arouses hostility and resistance in the whole community. Something like that coalesced between the last week of February and the first week of March. Turkey's democratic institutions, the region's largest democratic republic, rejected a US troop presence on Turkish soil as American ships waited off the Turkish coast.<br><br>After five days, it appears that the war is not turning out to be the cake walk that it was made out to be to the US public. Iraqis are not welcoming and hugging the US as "liberators". US soldiers have been taken prisoner, and there have been battle fatalities, apart from casualties of "friendly fire".<br><br>What will happen in north Iraq? Without wider agreement and more support from Turkey, with the second largest armed forces in NATO, the war which the US and the UK have embarked on could end up disastrously in north Iraq. Even if all goes well, the US will still need Turkey as a strategic partner in the now inflamed region. But the US will have to pay a price. Otherwise, the "gray wolf" will await and seize its opportunity.<br><br>Note.The ancestors of the Turks are said to have been brought up among wolves. Hence, the young, the brave and the bold call themselves gray wolves - also a term favored by extreme nationalists.<br><br>K Gajendra Singh, Indian ambassador (retired), served as ambassador to Turkey from August 1992 to April 1996. Prior to that, he served terms as ambassador to Jordan, Romania and Senegal. He is currently chairman of the Foundation for Indo-Turkic Studies.<br><br>(Â©2003 Asia Times Online Co, Ltd.

Gen. John Abizaid said Sunday at the U.S. Central Command's Gulf post. In two episodes Sunday near An Nasiriyah, Iraqi forces deceived Americans into believing they were surrendering or otherwise welcoming them.<br><br>U.S. officials said one Iraqi unit indicated it was giving up but as the Marines approached, the Iraqis opened fire, killing about 10 Americans. U.S. military sources said about 40 were wounded.<br><br>In another ambush, a maintenance company was attacked near An Nasiriyah, after apparently making a wrong turn. Twelve U.S. soldiers were listed as missing. U.S. officials said the ambush may have involved a "surrender situation."<br><br>"The coalition encountered pockets of determined resistance by irregular Iraqi forces who in some cases fought in civilian clothes or in modified commercial vehicles," said U.S. Brig. Gen. Vince Brooks. "These encounters were most intense in the area north of An Nasiriyah, where coalition forces did sustain casualties."<br><br>At a secret desert base, pilots of the 3rd Marine Helicopter Wing and intelligence officials reported that "surrendering" Iraqis would put down their arms when Marines passed by, then pick them up again and attack the helicopters. The small-arms fire has not downed any helicopters or wounded any crew members so far.<br><br>There have also been reports of Iraqi troops using civilians as shields, knowing that coalition forces will refrain from firing, Abizaid said.<br><br>"There are indications that some of the irregular forces are purposely fighting in positions that are occupied by civilians. There's no doubt about that," he said.<br><br>Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam are also believed to be laying explosives at key bridges in Baghdad to detonate if coalition forces arrive, he added.<br><br>"We've also received reports of explosives being placed up against certain buildings in inhabited areas in Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad. And we regard this as a very bad sign and a typical move by Saddam," he said.<br><br>Saddam is a Sunni Muslim and has long persecuted the majority Shiite Muslims in Iraq.<br><br>Saddam has also sent Special Security Organization forces and members of his Fedayeen, the Baath Party paramilitary organization, to cities as far south as Umm Qasr to create pockets of resistance that have harassed coalition forces.<br><br>"The majority of the resistance we have faced so far comes from Saddam's Special Security Organization and the Saddam Fedayeen," said British Maj. Gen. Peter Wall, chief of staff of the British contingent. "These are men who know that they will have no role in the building of a new Iraq and they have no future."<br><br>In addition, Abizaid said elite Republican Guard units may have been in An Nasiriyah.<br><br>The Fedayeen are elite inner-circle soldiers totaling about 15,000 who report directly to one of Saddam's sons, Odai, and are derided by some in the West as thugs. They are specially trained in guerrilla warfare and paramilitary tactics and in years past have been used by Saddam's regime to oppress internal foes.<br><br>U.S. intelligence officials believe the Fedayeen were dispatched from their strongholds in the Baghdad area to outlying areas over the last few weeks to embolden regular Iraqi troops. They, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity.<br><br>Intelligence indicates "they are there to enforce loyalty and to make troops more effective and keep them from defecting," one senior U.S. official said.<br><br>An Iraqi military communique hailed the work of the Fedayeen. "Groups of Saddam Fedayeen surprised the enemy behind its lines," the communique said.<br><br>Earlier this month, U.S. officials claimed Fedayeen were acquiring military uniforms "identical down to the last detail" to those worn by American and British forces and planned to use them to shift blame for atrocities.<br><br>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said various ploys used by the Iraqis will not work, such as writing messages on the roofs of some buildings saying that civilian human shields are inside.<br><br>"We are not going to be deterred at all," Rumsfeld said.<br><br></div>

Williscroft<br><br>The Chaplain Corps within the U.S. military performs a vital function. Young men and women preparing themselves for battle face something that most young people never think twice about: death, imminent death.<br><br>A majority of Americans are religious Â– men and women of faith. Consequently, a majority of our fighting men and women also are people of faith. The Chaplain assigned to a unit serves as the focal point for the faith needs of the men and women in that unit. Most believing Americans are Christian in one form or another; but America has a significant Jewish subculture, a small, but growing, Muslim population, and members of several other faiths, including Buddhist, BÂ’hai, Hindu, and Sikh, among others.<br><br>Currently, the largest Muslim segment is black, rising out of the Black Muslim movement of the 1960s; but we also have a significant Bosnian element and a growing Muslim population originating in the Arab world, which in general terms includes all of the Middle East (except Israel), and North Africa.<br><br>From a logistics perspective within the Chaplain Corps, it is not possible for the services to place a Chaplain of each faith group in every unit. Instead, Chaplains learn to minister to every faith, at least in the sense that they can meet the immediate needs of men and women preparing for battle.<br><br>When a young military man or woman faces another kind of problem outside of the immediate military situation, then the local Chaplain can call in one of his colleagues from the appropriate faith to deal with the specific situation. In this sense, Chaplains work closely together to serve their combined flocks.<br><br>All Chaplains have at least a four-year college degree, some type of formal training within their specific faiths, and some level of experience ministering to congregations. Within the military community, each service determines how the available Chaplain billets are allocated among the different faiths. Normally, the allocation is between Christian (including all the various denominations), Jewish, Buddhist, and Muslim, according to some formula.<br><br>Within the individual religious faiths, and their denominations, each determines its own qualifications for a chaplaincy. Depending on the structure and nature of a specific faith, an appointment may be formalized through a certification board, or as informal as through an individual application by a practicing minister.<br><br>Because the people coordinating Chaplain admissions in all the services typically have a Christian background, with a growing Jewish representation, they tend not to be very knowledgeable about the other faiths. It is natural, therefore, that they should turn to organizations that are knowledgeable to qualify Chaplains from these faiths.<br><br>In early July 2002, the U.S. Air Force asked the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) for assistance in recruiting Muslim Chaplains. On July 20, 2002, the ISNA announced that it Â“is recognized by the Department of Defense as an endorser of Chaplains.Â” As of July 22, 2002, ISNA had vetted all 13 of the Muslim clerics serving in the U.S. military. Since then, it has endorsed four more.<br><br>Since 13 Muslim Chaplains were active before the involvement of ISNA, it is reasonable to assume that their endorsement by ISNA was pro forma. This cannot be assumed about the following four, however.<br><br>Why should this matter?<br><br>The ISNA has been in the forefront of American Islam. It has represented itself as the voice of moderation in the war of words surrounding Islamic terrorism. This is probably why the Air Force considered the ISNA an appropriate source for vetting information. My research has uncovered the additional fact that the ISNA relies upon the Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences (GSISS) for its actual vetting information. The GSISS also had developed a reputation for moderation, so even this further connection appears on the surface to be reasonable.<br><br>A major player in all these interactions is Dr. Jamal Barzinji, the Director of GSISS, and board member of GSISS and a related moderate organization, the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). He is a well-known, articulate spokesman for moderate Islamic interests in America. Not so well known is than in 1980 he was a representative of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth (WAMY), which was deeply involved in providing cover for Wahhabi Muslim extremists (the Wahhabi branch of Sunni Islam is the radical branch which is home to Osama bin Laden). In 2002 the president of the WAMY office in Annandale, Va., was Abdula bin Laden Â– Osama bin LadenÂ’s younger brother.<br><br>Just one year ago, on March 20, 2002, a U.S. Treasury Task Force called Operation Green Quest raided an interrelated group of Islamic Wahhabi interests in northern Virginia Among these were the Herndon, Va., offices of Dr. Barzinji, and the Saar Foundation, created by wealthy Saudi Suleiman Abdul Al-Aziz al-Rajhi.<br><br>The Saar Foundation is connected to a former Swiss shell company, Al-Taqwa, whose leading figures included a notorious neo-Nazi and Islamist, Ahmed Huber (the term Islamist refers to Wahhabi-inspired international Islam that is both fundamentalist and terrorist oriented). Al-Taqwa had transferred operations to the United States, but was shut down after 9/11 when its assets were frozen by U.S. presidential order. But operations continued, as the Wahhabi lobby shifted to its backup institutions in northern Virginia.<br><br>Operation Green Quest linked Saar to Khalid bin Mahfouz, the former head of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and lead financial adviser to the Saudi royal family. Mahfouz was named by French intelligence as a backer of Osama bin Laden, in that he endowed the Muwafaq Foundation, which U.S. authorities have confirmed as part of al Qaeda. Furthermore, Muwafaq's former chief, Yassin al-Qadi, oversaw the financial penetration of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania by Wahhabi  Muslim extremists in the late 1990s.<br><br>To put things into perspective, in 1998 Saar received $1.7 billion in donations.<br><br>Dr. Barzinji is a trustee and officer of Amana Mutual Funds Trust in Bellingham, Wash. Yaqub Mirza is a fellow board member. He is a Pakistani physicist and financial guru who shares Dr. Barzinji's Herndon, Va., office. Samir Salah is another Amana board member and Herndon associate. He ran the Caribbean branch of Al-Taqwa. He also heads a financial firm linked to Saar, and directs the Falls Church, Va., Mosque, Dar al-Hijra, which is a Wahhabi hotbed. Salah is also deeply involved with the Virginia charity, Taibah International Aid Association, which has a Bosnian branch that is under investigation by Sarajevo authorities.<br><br>All of these interrelated individuals and groups matter within the context of this article, because they show up behind the benign faÃ§ade of the two organizations that are responsible for credentialing any Muslim cleric who becomes a U.S. military Chaplain.<br><br>LetÂ’s pass that by once again: Evidence underthed in the past year strongly suggests that Wahhabi  Muslim extremists indirectly control the vetting procedure for all Muslim Chaplains in the U.S. military.<br><br>The implications for this are staggering. On March 22, 2003, an American Muslim soldier rolled grenades into the tents of the entire command structure of the 101st Airborne DivisionÂ’s 1st Brigade command group at Camp Pennsylvania in Kuwait. One man was killed, and 11 were seriously injured. At this time it is not known whether or not he was under orders from an Islamist cleric.<br><br>What we have in place however, is a mechanism that practically guarantees that this will happen with increasing frequency. We already know that a properly motivated Muslim terrorist will willingly kill himself in order to take out an important target.<br><br>Military Chaplains have the ability to influence personnel assignments. With proper manipulation, several Â“sleeperÂ” Chaplains can arrange for a significant number of undercover terrorists to be prepositioned so that they can cause maximum damage to our command structure.<br><br>Centcom commander Gen. Tommy Franks is a regular guy who openly moves among his troops when he is in theater. How difficult would it be for a determined undercover terrorist functioning as a soldier or Marine nearby to assassinate him in a suicide attack?<br><br>I have no evidence that any of the 17 Muslim Chaplains currently serving in the U.S. military are anything but honorable clerics serving their country during time of war. Nevertheless, the potential problem is very real and immanent.<br><br>This is a wake-up call. We must address this potential problem forthwith to ensure that no terrorists have slipped into the ranks of our brave men and women in harms way in Iraq, or anywhere else in our military.<br><br>To do any less would be criminally negligent.<br><br>Robert G.

Even prior to September 11, 2001, the amount of publicly available information concerning aircraft types and specific units had diminished to the point that it was no longer possible to provide a high fidelity profile of current deployments. There are evidently significant gaps in unit identifications, as well as non-trivial uncertainties as to numbers of specific types of aircraft. The presence of significant numbers of civilian contractor personnel at various facilities in the region further complicates accounting for total personnel numbers.<br><br>Excluding forces deployed in direct support of Operation Enduring Freedom, there are probably about 222,000 military personnel in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, including about 1,100 aircraft of all types. Based on the number of Brigade Sets that were prepositioned in the region it is believed that there are roughly 850 M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks and 406 M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The number of troops deployed in the area fluctuates on a daily basis, and has averaged between 20,000 and 25,000 in recent years, with typically about 200 aircraft in the region. Forces in the region include a mix of special operations forces deployed in support of US Central Command operations. To enhance force protection throughout the region, additional military security personnel are also deployed.<br><br>Ground forces include a variety of units that are normally deployed in the region, which total about 3,700 troops. Forces in the region include a Patriot missile task force with two batteries deployed in Saudi Arabia and two in Kuwait. Virtually all of 3rd Infantry Division has been deployed to Kuwait, though it is possible that some battalions are still in the process of deploying. It is believed that the total Army presence in the region is nearly 64,000 soldiers. Army equipment figures are based on standard Tables of Organization and Equipment for the units deployed. The number of Army mechanized equipment actually on the ground (rather than on ship) is thought to be roughly 638 M1 Abrams and 406 M2 Bradleys. This figure is based on the available prepositioned Brigade sets that were in the region including equipment at Diego Garcia. It is not clear how much additional equipment has been shipped to the region from the United States though it there is enough kit for 2 mechanized divisions minus the equipment for the 4th Infantry Division. This means that the United States could have more tanks than people to man them. There are 144 AH-64 Apache helicopters in the region.<br><br>The US Air Force's Expeditionary Air and Space Force (EAF) concept and organization sets a guideline for Air Force deployments to operational locations. The EAF is comprised of 10 Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEF) each with lead combat and support wings including on-call wings that could be deployed if required. Deployments for active duty units lasts roughly 90-days while Reserve and Guard units deploy typically for 30 - 60 days. Generally one AEF is assigned to Operation Southern Watch and one is assigned to Northern Watch. AEF 7 and AEF 8 units deployed beginning in late November and will remain until the end of February 2003.<br><br>The EUCOM Area of Responsibility includes approximately 1,700 Air Force personnel at Incrilik AB Turkey, flying Operation Northern Watch patrols (Though there are roughly 4,000 people at Incirlik in general). Prior to Operation Enduring Freedom, approximately 6,200 Air Force personnel were normally stationed in the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility. As many as 23,000 Air Force personnel may be currently stationed in the CENTCOM and EUCOM areas responsible for operations against Iraq, operating a total of about 500 aircraft of all types. It should be noted that tracking personnel numbers for the Air Force is extremely difficult as the actual number of pilots is small compared to support elements. These numbers could be drastically incorrect.<br><br>Naval units include a headquarters and shore-based units comprised of about 1,200 people at Manama in Bahrain. Nearly a thousand civilian mariners are associated with Military Sealift Command ships at Diego Garcia. During the 1990s overall Naval force personnel levels in the CENTCOM AOR typically varied between 8,000 and 15,000. Each Carrier Battle Group, with its associated Carrier Air Wing, has approximately 11,000 sailors embarked. Each Amphibious Group has about 1,700 sailors, 1,500 Marines, and 700 Marine aviators embarked. As of 25 February 2003 there were five carrier battle groups in the area, two amphibious task forces, and two amphibious groups, for a total of around 136,000 naval personnel. These units included about 504 helicopters and aircraft. A total of about 2,142 Vertical Launch System cells are available for Tomahawk cruise missiles, which is roughly three times the average number typically deployed in recent years. Based on estimates of prior deployments, perhaps as many as 1,000 Tomahawks are actually deployed. The cruise missile force can be augmented significantly within days.<br><br>Note: While this listing is dated, one should keep in mind that the page is often edited numerous times during a particular edition, sometimes daily.

For the Iraqis, this means a couple of daysÂ’ respite; for the American and British, a scramble to shroud their tanks and equipment in canvas and tarp sheeting to protect them from the creeping grains. Not only are the tanks out of action until the end of the week, but grounded too, as DEBKAfileÂ’s military source report, are the heavy bombers, the fighter bombers and the helicopters which fought their first skirmishes with the Special Republic Guards Al Madina Division near al Kut on the road to Baghdad Â– and lost an Apache. Its two pilots were captured and shown on Iraqi television Monday night.<br><br>In the mountains of Kurdistan in the north, snow blizzards instead of sandstorms will hamper the movements of British and American special forces for the next couple of days. Since Monday, March 24, these forces have been coming down in five northern Iraqi airfields: Barmeni, Harir, Bakarjo and Ankwa and H-3 in the west, forming up for the assault to secure the oil fields of Mosul and Kirkuk. Their next mission will be to head south for the offensive against Saddam HusseinÂ’s tribal home of Tikrit, north of Baghdad.<br><br>The Iraqis, accustomed to these extremes of climate, will use the breather for reorganization, re-supplying the units with fresh stores of ammunition, fuel and provisions and urgent repairs of combat vehicles. They will also use the time to carry out snipe at and harry American convoys, stray vehicles and small campsites.<br><br>DEBKAfileÂ’s military sources report that the Iraqi high command has diagnosed the weak point of the US columns driving to Baghdad as being their long supply lines, often trailing several hundred kilometers behind and easily vulnerable to guerrilla attack. The Iraqis have begun using small fighting squads, often in civilian dress, armed with hand grenades, mines and RPGs, to blow up bridges and vehicles. This was the tactic employed at Nasiriya and Basra.<br><br>Based on the first four days of combat, war commander General Tommy Franks has reached a number of conclusions and effected some revisions in his plan of operation.<br><br>1. Contrary to expectation, there are no signs of cracks in the Iraqi high command - from the chief of staff down to division, brigade and battalion officer level.<br><br>Franks had one last stab at undermining the Iraqi command Monday, March 24. At a news briefing called without prior notice, he said the Iraqi command is no longer Â“robustÂ”, hoping perhaps to influence the morale of the lower ranks of Iraqi officers and troops.<br><br>2. In view of this and other emerging facts, the coalition is short of ground strength for the assault on Baghdad. FranksÂ’ officers at Doha are saying that the Iraqi capital cannot be taken by two US armies. While there is no intention of postponing the assault on Baghdad, putting in a request to the White House for reinforcements is under consideration. The 4th Armored Division passed through the Suez Canal Monday on its way to the Gulf. To shorten its journey, the divisionÂ’s troops will probably disembark at Saudi Red Sea ports and cut through east into Iraq. The 173th Airborne Brigade based in Italy, counterpart of the 82nd Airborne Division, has received orders to move out to northern Iraq.<br><br>3. All these forces, as well as IraqÂ’s elite divisions, are making ready to fight the main battle for Baghdad. According to our military sources, that campaign is most likely to get started on Saturday, March 29. Only then, will the two sides bring out their biggest guns and apply firepower to a degree never seen since World War II. If the battle goes against him, Saddam may well disclose the chemical and biological weaponry he has kept hidden, or even resort to some sort of nuclear device. That will also be the moment of greatest peril for Israel and IraqÂ’s other neighbors.<br><br>Away from the main arena, a small yet illuminating scene played out just across the Iraqi border Monday morning. Syria complained that a stray American missile had struck a bus killing five civilians and injuring ten.<br><br>According to DEBKAfileÂ’s military sources, the only true fact in this terse account was that the bus was Syrian. The missile was no stray. It was deliberately fired from an F-15 fighter-bomber at a bus carrying armed Palestinian volunteers to join up with Iraqi forces, in order to make sure this was the last such Palestinian group of volunteers for Iraq. That F-15 made a piece of history; it carried out the first American air attack on a combatant Palestinian group. More will certainly be heard of this episode.<br><br>March 24, 2003<br><br>US Troops in First Encounter with Iraqi Republic Guards<br><br>After a tough day of facing Iraqi resistance and setbacks - the first American troops were taken captive and 12 were killed Â– AmericaÂ’s Iraq War took an important military turn late on Sunday, March 23, as reported exclusively by DEBKAfileÂ’s military sources: The first frontal engagements between US troops advancing on Baghdad and Saddam HusseinÂ’s elite Special Republican Guards. They began near Al Amarah, a small town on the Tigris River, and at al Kut, some 100 km upriver to the northwest.<br><br>Al Amarah is geographically the southern gateway to Baghdad.<br><br>The US-led column driving towards Baghdad along the easternmost route up the Tigris River is led by the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions. Sunday, they bypassed Basra, leaving behind the 7th British division to assert control over IraqÂ’s second largest city, and dashed north towards Al Amarah. Waiting for them were three Iraqi divisions, the 10th, the 11th and the 4th Corps, which is the Special Republic Guards Nida armored division.<br><br>By the end of the day, the Marines and the Nida tank force had entered into their first of clash of arms of the series to come.<br><br>Three additional US columns are pushing towards Baghdad.<br><br>The 3rd Armored Division with elements of the 82nd Airborne drove out of Nasiriya towards al Kut, after opening up the Euphrates bridges in a fierce battle that cost 10 American lives. Posted there is the Special Republican GuardsÂ’ Al Medina Division, 2nd Armored Brigade, the only Iraqi force known for certain by US intelligence to deploy weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>During the night, hundreds of US Apache and Black Hawks pummeled the unitÂ’s advanced T-72 tanks, taking heavy ground fire and losing at least one Apache, which was displayed Monday, March 24, on Baghdad television.<br><br>This helicopter-tank duel was not the end of the confrontation, but the beginning. It was intended to convey to SaddamÂ’s troop formations that their only option is to surrender or be battered to extinction. The warning, issued as the second Gulf War approached its first 100 hours, the point at which the first Gulf Was discontinued, was meant to drive home a message to SaddamÂ’s defenders that this campaign would go on to the end.<br><br>The third American column, led by the US 7th mechanized Division augmented by additional units headed north from Nasiriya toward the two Shiite holy towns, Najef and Karbala, bypassing both, skirting the Bahr al Milh Lake and turning east toward the Euphrates River.<br><br>Standing guard over Baghdad at this point is the Hamourabi division of the Special Republican Guards, the final major obstacle on this route to the Iraqi capital. If this division is overcome, the advancing US force can make its way with tanks across the Euphrates River and quickly reach BaghdadÂ’s Saddam International Airport.<br><br>The fourth column is the most secret one. Its name has not been released and little is known about its mission beyond the fact that it is the fastest moving of the four, zipping across the vast desert spaces between western Iraq and the Saudi frontier towards al Fallujah, 20 kilometers north of Baghdad. Its objective is to strike at the line of contact between the Iraqi Hamourabi and al Medina Divisions.<br><br>DEBKAfileÂ’s military sources report that two more spearheads will beef up the four columns when full-scale battle is joined between them and SaddamÂ’s crack units: The northern formation, which is being assembled from US forces drawn in from Kurdistan and other parts of the northern front - since Saturday, March 22, they are being dropped by air over four Iraqi airfields; and the western formation, which is coming in from Jordan and western Iraq, and will start pushing towards Ar Rubta and SaddamÂ’s home town of Tikrit on Tuesday, March 25.<br><br>The first four American columnsÂ’ overall objective is to bring the Special Republican Guards divisions and the Iraqi capital within range of American artillery and tank guns by the end of this week. The next stage will be to subject Baghdad to a lethal artillery-aerial strike cocktail.<br><br>Until then, DEBKAfileÂ’s military experts stress that the crushing bombing-missile air raids inflicted daily on Baghdad since last Friday Â– with fearful effect on television screens Â– are not targeting the city per se. After hitting some of SaddamÂ’s symbols of government, the brunt of the blitz is directed at cutting off the Special Republic Guards ringing Baghdad from access to the city. It is meant to demonstrate to their commanders that come what may they will not be allowed to withdraw into Baghdad and embark on an urban war of attrition against US forces trapped in city streets. Any Iraqi troops attempting to fall back will be eliminated before they set foot in the capital.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>British manufacturer's weapons linked to hidden cache of missiles<br><br>GETHIN CHAMBERLAIN ON THE ROAD TO BASRA AND DAN MCDOUGALL<br><br>BRITISH troops mopping up Iraqi opposition outside Basra have discovered a large cache of weapons, including Russian-made cruise missiles and warheads, hidden inside fortified bunkers at a massive arsenal abandoned by Saddam HusseinÂ’s disintegrating southern army.<br><br>It also emerged last night that a number of cargo crates amid the lethal arms depot bore the stamp and address of one of BritainÂ’s most respected arms firms, Wallop Defence Systems, which supplies guided missiles technology to the British and United States army. Wallop, a subsidiary of Cobham plc, a British aviation conglomerate, is based in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, and specialises in high-reliability Missile Tracking Flares for tail-tracked guided missiles and electrically-initiated Rocket Motor Igniters.<br><br>The weapons cache was discovered as forward units from the Black Watch regiment came across the abandoned Az Zubayr heliport base on the outskirts of Basra and penetrated a network of bunkers beneath the complex.<br><br>As the Black Watch unit explored the bunkers, they were given an alarming insight into IraqÂ’s weapons capability as they discovered cases of rockets, giant anti-shipping mines and other ammunition piled from floor to ceiling in dozens of individual storage bunkers.<br><br>The vast military complex, to the south-west of Basra, is defended by a network of earth works, with tanks and other armoured vehicles dug in to the surrounding area .<br><br>Outside the complex, Black Watch units searched around 40 bunkers packed with a mixture of RPGs and other ammunition. Inside the perimeter, 22 larger fortified bunkers containing larger weaponry, including the al-Harith missiles, were discovered.<br><br>The missiles, with al-Harith 2002 stencilled in red paint on the side and covered with Cyrillic writing, were housed in 60ft long concrete bunkers, 25ft high, buried under earth and protected by sliding steel double doors one foot thick.<br><br>Painted grey, they had two wings, each about 2ft in span, and three tail fins on a similar size. There was no indication of the nature of the warheads fitted and experts have been called in to examine the find.<br><br>Also housed inside the reinforced bunkers were what appeared to be large anti-shipping mines, 3ft in diameter, and a host of other munitions. On one box, written in English, were the words: "Contract AS Navy. 5/1980 Iran".<br><br>According to one senior Black Watch officer, a number of the boxes were clearly marked with the names of British manufacturers and one pile of crates in a store housing rocket-propelled grenades bore the name of Wallop .<br><br>It is not known how the weapons were sourced or indeed how they ended up in Iraqi hands but sources from the Ministry of Defence claimed that the find highlighted the threat from the burgeoning black market arms trade across the Middle East.<br><br>In a related development, the US said it had protested to Moscow about reports Russian firms have sold Iraq anti-tank missiles, night vision goggles and jamming gear. A spokeswoman for the State Department said MoscowÂ’s response had not been satisfactory.<br><br>In 1991, Wallop industries denied links to Iraq after secret documents found by Kurdish protesters in the Iraqi embassy showed Iraqi diplomats in London were at the hub of a widespread arms and ammunition procurement network going back at least ten years.<br><br>The documents seized by the Kurds allegedly showed that during the Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqis tried to buy British rocket launchers to deflect missiles from armoured cars and helicopters. One document showed that Lt-Col S M Salman, an Iraqi military attachÃ©, had approached Wallop Industry Ltd in April 1984, for samples of 57mm rocket launchers which "could be installed on armoured cars and helicopters". The Iraqis wanted infra-red and chaff rockets to deflect heat-seeking missiles and fool radar systems.<br><br>The approach was rejected, according to Clive Rushton, the companyÂ’s finance director, who said at the time: "We made no supplies to Iraq at all. We receive many such inquiries, including from unfriendly countries, but our records show that we never supplied such goods to that country."<br><br>After the find, 28 Kurds were found guilty of conspiring to cause criminal damage following their illegal occupation of the embassy.<br><br>Several Black Watch units yesterday were involved in skirmishes with pockets of Iraqi troops and with civilians close to the heliport who had seized abandoned weaponry.<br><br>One unit came under attack from rocket-propelled grenades four times, but each attack failed to find its target and there were no casualties.<br><br><a href="http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=353552003" rel="nofollow">http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=353552003</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Iraqi Tribes - Saddam's Secret Weapon</strong><br>By Ouerdya Ait-Abdulmalik<br>3-24-3<br>DUBAI (AFP) - In the war against the United States and Britain, President Saddam Hussein can count not only on his elite Republican Guard but also on a more secret weapon -- tribal chiefs who control hundreds of thousands of armed men.<br><br>The backing of the regime by ancient clans is a relatively recent development, stemming from the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, a time in which Saddam was weakened at home.<br><br>The Iraqi leader turned to the tribes to help reinforce his slackened grip on power, according to Iraqi opposition members in exile.<br><br>The tribes were highly influential under the monarchy that ruled the country until 1958 but were brushed aside by the Baath party which succeeded it and considered their customs backwards and primitive.<br><br>But the first Gulf conflict changed everything by loosening the state command structure, leaving Saddam scrambling to shore up his domestic support.<br><br>Paradoxically, the international embargo slapped on the country after Iraq invaded Kuwait, aimed at undermining Saddam, ended up offering him a golden opportunity to re-establish his control over an increasingly impoverished society.<br><br>Faleh Jabber, a researcher at the School of Politics and Sociology at the University of London-Birkbeck, noted in a recent article that the food supply increasingly depended on Saddam's good will, and on the tribes.<br><br>One of the consequences of the sanctions was also to make the tribes more dependent on government support.<br><br>To foster a reconciliation and establish himself as chief of the chiefs, Saddam invited tribal leaders to one of his palaces in 1992. He apologized for new land reforms that stripped them of resources and called for a rapprochement.<br><br>In effect, he bought their allegiance by offering food, vital materials, money and in particular, the opportunity for them to exercise new influence.<br><br>The tribes were able to run their areas like fiefdoms, all the while working as cogs of the state.<br><br>They were given authority over security, police forces, the justice system and tax collection and the scope to operate beyond their traditional areas of control into major cities including Baghdad.<br><br>Exempted from military service, the men of the tribes received light arms and means of transportation and communication to allow them to help Saddam Hussein crush any domestic unrest.<br><br>The government saw the utility of their support in 1991 when they assisted him in stamping out a rebellion in south of the country, which has a Shiite Muslim majority.<br><br>The ties binding the tribes to Saddam Hussein and their willingness to protect the status quo that operates in their favor are among the factors leading the tribes to oppose the current US-British invasion.<br><br>Aware that they could represent a secret weapon against the Americans, Saddam on Monday called on all Iraqis and the tribes in particular to continue to resist the enemy and congratulated them on their success in slowing the coalition advance.<br><br>"Even in the open desert, American and British soldiers are exposing themselves to civilians' weapons," he said.<br><br>Iraqi television showed images of a US Apache helicopter that had been shot down over Karbala, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Baghdad.<br><br>Ali Obeid, an old peasant with a white beard and brandishing an elderly bolt-action rifle, proudly told the cameras that he had downed a second aircraft of the same type.<br><br>rense.com<br></div>

Asked if Rumsfeld made a mistake by not sending more troops to start the offensive, McCaffrey replied: "Yes, sure. I think everybody told him that."<br><br>"I think he thought these were U.S. generals with their feet planted in World War II that didn't understand the new way of warfare," he added.<br><br>U.S. forces have advanced more than 200 miles into Iraqi territory since the start of the war and are beginning to confront an elite division of the Republican Guards deployed to defend the capital.<br><br>"So it ought to be a very dicey two to three day battle out there." McCaffrey said of the confrontation with the Republican Guards.<br><br>He said his personal view was that the invading troops would "take them (the Iraqis) apart."<br><br>"But we've never done something like this with this modest a force at such a distance from its bases," he warned.<br><br>McCaffrey, a former Commander in Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces in Latin America, served overseas for 13 years and took part in four combat tours.<br><br>He twice received the Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest medal for valor in the United States.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>US insists Russians helping Iraq<br><br>* Bush conveys concern to Putin<br>* France says force canÂ’t bring peace<br><br>WASHINGTON: The United States believes Russian company technicians are in Baghdad helping the Iraqis operate electronic jamming systems that could impair the US-led war against Iraq, a US official said on Monday.<br><br>US President George W Bush telephoned Russian President Vladimir Putin to protest against alleged Russian sales of night-vision goggles, antitank missiles and global positioning system (GPS) jamming systems to Iraq, the White House said. US officials said such sales would violate UN sanctions. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov denied Russia had supplied Iraq with any military equipment in breach of UN sanctions.<br><br>In the telephone call, Â“The two discussed US concerns involving prohibited hardware that has been transferred from Russian companies to Iraq,Â” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said.<br><br>Asked if Washington had evidence the items were being used by Iraq, he said: Â“They were not provided for the purpose of sitting on shelves.Â”<br><br>US officials believe the alleged sales have been carried out by private Russian firms and they want greater oversight by Russian authorities to stop them. Analysts and officials in Moscow said Iraq could have acquired the equipment via a third country, like Syria or Ukraine.<br><br>Mr Putin, meanwhile, urged Mr Bush to avoid a Â“humanitarian catastropheÂ” in the war in Iraq during the telephone conversation, the Kremlin said.<br><br>Â“In their exchange of views, the Russian side focussed on the humanitarian consequences of the military actions,Â” a Kremlin statement said. Â“Putin repeated his existing position on resolving Iraq,Â” it added. The Russian president also asked Iraq to respect international law on prisoners of war as Moscow said it would call on the UN to rule on the legality of the US-led war.<br><br>Â‘Force cannot bring peaceÂ’: French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said on Monday that force alone could not bring peace to the world and powerful countries should use their strength to unite the international community.<br><br>Mr Villepin, speaking to the UN Commission on Human Rights, declared that international law could not be advanced by violating its provisions.
