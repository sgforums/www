So you men better do. There is no answer to "why me?"<br><br>nobody willing so have to be forced, nobody is volunteer so have to make it compulsory. any more question?<br>[/quote]</strong><br><br>so its simple, my issue at point is, people are more willing to take initiative and really achieve what they pledge themselves to do, IF they took up the pledge willingly.<br>"No man gets left behind" The majority of US troops are regulars and they subscribe to this notion, so we know that the majority of the troops will perform as pledged come D-Day.<br><br>For Singapore, its different. <strong>Making it mandatory and then saying that we have an army willing to die for the country, because they pledged to do so, is very much different</strong>.<br><br>Our army is good to be a deterrent force, but come real battles, whether that pledge would be carried out is still a big question mark.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>I will not volunteer to serve NS if it is voluntary, and if you focus only on the negative aspect of your life, your life is going to be miserable. In life not a lot of things are choice one, be positive and even raining days can be happy.<br></blockquote></div></blockquote>its again not about whether you focus on negative or positive parts of your life. I am just stating an observation, that NS is perceived as 'forced' to almost everyone.<br><br>If they had been given a choice, most of them would not serve.<br><br>However, if the govt had made NS more attractive thru motivational strategies, such as better recognition of those who served NS, better pay, better benefits, better work prospects, etc, then it may be a different story. People might willingly serve coz it gives them a better edge in life.<br><br>If you watched The Apprentice, there was one season where the guy won the position because he had the added edge of serving in the army, and Donald Trump saw it as good relevant experience. In Singapore? No one ever values what you do in there.<br><br>So you see, to me, its always stick stick stick, so far, our govt does not have that ability to motivate the Singaporean, instead always using punishment as a threat.<br><br><strong>[quote]<br>If your wife stays in one country, you settle in another country, your children with your parents in another country, I agree, family not = country. Do you think you still have a family?<br></strong>I have to comment that your posting above is a little narrowly put. I have friends from Thailand, who work here for many years, and have wife and kids back in Thailand, and they are just as happy.<br>I think your definition of family may be a bit too narrow, how say you?</div>

I think your thoughts are "think not what the nation can do for you, but what you can do for the nation". Its a selfless thought, but if exploited by people with ulterior motives, is used to control the people on the streets so that the pigs get to enjoy their booze and food while the people suffer<br><br>2) The fact is, there is no war. I think its not a fair comparison to put Israel into the picture, because the situation is very different here. I will only say its fair, if the leaders of the nation suffer together with the people. And in Israel, that's true. The nation is suffering as a whole, thus no one complains. Ours? Very big difference<br><br>3) Civilian military is fair? Bear in mind that we are not only supposed to protect the country, but also to support the economy, support the family...<br>And then in comes devious foreigners (not those whom really contribute to Singapore) whom your leaders open the doors and windows to, and they come in to rob and steal and plunder and your leaders happily say "come rob us!", while the local Singaporean has to play 3 roles in the country, and the govt isn't grateful of all that...<br>Fair? Hardly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me Sillypore is not worth fighting and dying for. I do not regret serving national slavery as I found out my own limitations and also I had no choice as my family was poor..so there was no way out of this piece of rock...<br><br>Now that I am quite comfortable, I have chosen not to allow my son to serve national slavery as it is simply a waste of time....and that is why we have moved out of this little rock and cashed out everything...including cpf....I'd rather my children learn about the ways of the world in a real business environment...rather than run around, doing silly things...to all those who have served ns...you all know what I mean...<br><br>To all those who can, willing and who have no emotional hang ups about leaving....I urge you to work hard and find your way out of here.....this place may or may not last but I certainly won't take that risk..rather put my eggs in a safer basket elsewhere... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

PAP got say sorry? if got, i'll be so surprised. if not, they're heartless. and for NS, IMO, as said few pages ago (anyone wants to know go and find), but its not good for Singapore as they're like "making use" of us, call the commander to command the citizens of Singapore, that is us, then the command must order us do this do that. i really think that in maybe 10 years later, there will be approximately 1.4 million people only (most rich foreigners and rich singaporeans) will live here. and since they're RICH, all things increase, and singapore's proposed transports, will be all gone to drain, for example MRT, NSL, EWL, then NEL, then CCL, then DTL. and more to come in the future years to come.</div>
