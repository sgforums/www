              <p>Dear Mr. Commoner, my fellow citizen, and my equal.</p>
              <p>The only difference between you and me in our republic you helped built is the level of responsibilities we each hold. YOu, to your family, relatives and friends, and me, the entire nation's hope and aspirations rest squarely upon my shoulders which I intend to fulfil to the best of my abilities.</p>
              <p>LIfe is never easy, and you should be rightly commended for your sacrifice and hardwork, just as me and my team too, working ceaselessly to ensure we all survive in this fast paced globalized and cruel world, and that none gets left behind.</p>
              <p>It is with utmost regret that I cannot stop evolution and progress of our society just for you or our elders. The needs of our next generations must be equally met. I am glad you are trying your best to keep up with the pace, a pace not set by me, but by the world, or we may not survive and many left on the wayside by the jugganaut of progress.</p>
              <p>However, what I can do and will do is to ensure that we will always have a listening ear for heroes such as you which contributed to the wealth and progress of our society. We have several outreach organisations which speaks in your lingo and will help you with your needs, so long as it is within our society's capability to help.</p>
              <p>We must never break our reserves, but to always maintain it at sustenable levels for the sake of our future generations, as you had saved for your children whom I must commend you for assisting in giving him/her a good and responsible education.</p>
              <p>Our national investments arm had lost some money, to the tune of billions in the current financial crisis, but so did everyone else in a crisis that was not of our doing. Nothing is ever risk free in the investment arena. However, we had been fortunate, as our investments had always been for the safe long term returns, and will eventually see profits as it had been over the past years, when the markets stablilises as it will, for trade had and will always be the lifeblood of humanity .</p>
              <p>If you have any good ideas or solutions beyond what I and my team can do, that can help our heroic elders without causing a strain on yours and our young, without stopping progress and evolution, that which will elevate the lives for all within our nation, please come forward and let us know, that we may discuss and work out a better deal for all so that none gets left behind.</p>
              <p>Whatever that becomes policy, must ensures that the majority need not suffer for the sake of a few selfish but loud empty vesseled vocal minority that offers no solutions but only blind hate filled twisted criticisms.</p>
              <p>At your service, always</p>
              <p>PM ( fictitious, but written in the style based upon his presentations and convictions in the international media)</p>
