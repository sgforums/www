The Native Americans who have not assimilated into mainstream American society, have established reservations which are recognized as sovereign territories by the US government. And these reservations are <span style="font-style: italic;">fully</span> accessible by 'conventional' methods, especially the ones that have casinos that draw in tens of thousands of gamblers from outside the reservations.<br><br>We have a number of such reservations here in Minnesota and over in Wisconsin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the balkanization of the US is unlikely but not totally improbably. As I've mentioned before, there are already secessionist movements in the US. There's a sentiment I've heard before on other forums saying that the states will move out of the Union when they find that the country is too big for one Federal government to handle. Besides, individual states already have their own state legislatures and governors. In event of a split, thats a premade government. No fighting for power and the sort. So I think thats one point clearly veering in favour of a secession situation.</div>
