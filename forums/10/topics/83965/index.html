It has been a whole generation already, should the children of japan nowadays pay for the crimes of their ancestors?  If you boycott their stuff now, u are just perjudice against them. It's not like the teens in japan now have a choice to be born a japanese.  By now most of the stuff would be from people who are not that involved in the war.  Anyway not that they have a choice, government want war, u think the soldier can say no meh, u try in army now lor and they will charge u for desertation and shoot u also.<br><br>I believe we shouldn't always dig up those old feuds, else there will never be true peace in the world.<br><br>A lot of innocent jap also died in the war, all those civilian in japan who died in the bombing.<br></div></blockquote>so? my ancestors were innocent too, they still got the crap bombed out of them by the japs</div>

But the least Japan should do is to make formal apologies to its victims and come clean with its past right? What have they done? Absolutely NOTHING. If one look at Japanese history textbooks, they don't even use the word 'invade' when relating WW2 events. In recent years, Japanese officials are visiting Yasukuni shrine where the most notorious japanese war criminals are honored. Tell me is that repentance? The sickening thing is that even until TODAY there are many Japanese who still think that Rape of Nanjing, Bataan Death March and Unit 731 are lies cooked up by the Allies to make them look bad. Why is it so hard for Japan to say sorry? Distorting the truth and so unapologetic....this is not how a civilised nation should behave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, if it takes the Japanese so long and with so much persuasion by koreans, chinese, taiwanese....... to apologize when Germans could do it decades ago. they do not deserve forgiveness for lack of sincerity, but perhaps they can be spared from death by slow torture. their conduct in war were needlessly brutal to civilian women and children. eg. bayoneting babies for sport, higher authority encouraging soldiers to rape and physically abuse as many civilian women as possible, conducting experiments on civilians for biochemical warfare when animals will suffice, killing red-cross personnel because they harbor injured soldiers ........ my point being, i'm all for killing an enemy soldier in war or cutting off resources or brutal interrogation of POWs to acquire strategic information so on and so forth, as long as you do it to <a href="http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=military&amp;v=56">military</a> personnel because they pose an immediate and significant threat. but when japs resorted to brutalizing civilians for whatever reasons, they are all war criminals. and of course their determination in denying every deed forces everyone to wonder when's their next move. and their senior ministers will not fail to pay annual tributes to their war dead unless neighboring countries strongly protest again and again. and jap civilians are almost equally guilty of not protesting against their govt's refusal to own up. as can be seen by the fact that the same faction of unrepentent <a href="http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=people&amp;v=56">people</a> always stay in political power. of course competency in improving national economy matters, but what about international diplomacy or even primary moral values like courage and honesty to confess? can we conclude they don't matter to the japs? or they don't matter enough to compel them to act necessarily and constructively? anyway, feeling sleepy now. everyone please keep up the jap-bashing. we are only starting to warm up very nicely. thanks and keep up the good work......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
