On longer term, with combination of external economic factors, there might be something like what happened in 97, economic crisis.<br>When you don't spend much, most people would have then followed or did the same, as in a major shift in spending, would bring prices crashing from a height of what they was, or it would climb up from more than it is really worth if people contimue spending. More or less reach a saturation point, where there will be economical breakdown.<br>Then, everyone will be in danger, even those who got a few hundred bucks as GST package.<br>Those who got their GST package and said they enjoyed what the 'big parents' gave them would be regretting saying that in a few months time.<br>My family's GST package we split among all of us, even kids got it and we go spend them all before 30th June, knowing its totally useless.<br>When people call me for survey, I ask them for what, if for money/legal related matters, or for the 'big parents', I turn them down immediately.

British hospitals in the 80s were horrible. Because healthcare was free people had to queue for one day to see the doc in the hospital since everyone also want to see doc. (cant imagine what will happen to kiasu singaporeans if hospitals were to be free) see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state</a></div>
