I do not even fully agree with point 4, 9 and 10. Sigh... this is what makes me afraid of democracy - when people choose base on not who can do the job better, but rather who is more "likeable".</div>

Or at the very least, take up the "Alternative rally reporting" system that I have started back in 1997 and 2001?<br><br>Back in 1997, unhappy about how the local mass media reported political rallies, I took the initiative to run around rallies and provide first hand, on the spot report on opposition political rallies. I have given my fair share of independent rally reports  on opposition parties, both praising as well as punching them when they erred.<br><br>In 2001, I have a few helpers from soc.culture.singapore to help me run more opposition rally reports, on their own free will. They have provided fairly good independent reports on opposition rallies.<br><br>I think for the coming General Election, I will have to relinquish my initiatives as my reporting would not be considered as unbias and unpartisan. I hope to find somebody from the middle ground to take up such task. Many reporters are unwilling to show their faces or put up their names.

Many people are also doing points 2, 5 and 6 (i tried to log on to youngpap forum but can never get in, I suppose some sizing up is done there).  Point 3 is just stating a fact of life and supporting the majority usually do not get much attention. Too early to make judgement on pts 7 and 8. It will be his actions on pts 4, 9 and 10 that will bring him into the light, and it is what he has done, or said so far that differentiate him from others who talked only theories and those who cannot identify with people on the ground. His postings is worthy of our attention and his efforts will get our continuing supports, here and on the ground.<br></div>
