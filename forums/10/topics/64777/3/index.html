            <div class='col-md body'>hi people,<br><br>we should all be sad. W ehave have just lost another man in the opposition camp. Steve Chia was suppose to be up &amp; coming.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I am NOT interested in his family and his own personal interest. I am interested in him helping Singaporeans to have a better life. The only way to do that is through oppositional politics against the PAP.<br><br>Recent events such as the Pilots union affairs, Singaporeans becoming 2nd class citizens as well as our military management shows that without a strong oppositional force we will be under the wishes of the PAP government. Look at the unfavorable policies the PAP introduced since they won a landslide victory as well as the undisputed ascendance of LKY's son to be the next PM of Singapore. All these are signs of Singapore's impending downfall.<br><br>Losing Steve Chia is losing a battle to be won. He was one of the more promising leaders and now he is gone.<br><br>What he did was no crime. He did not imflict any harm to anyone. It is his personal interest. Like it or not if we have a higher learning and ability to see things from a wider perspective, what he did was just Art. Should we not condem all artist involved in nude bodies??<br><br>So much so for all the arguements that he should be of higher morals. What morality degradation has he brought us? We should balme the media for sensationalising all the details.<br><br>Steve - if I am you I will divorce your stupid wife. Otherwise you should tell straight - if she is in or out of oppositional politics. Her act has disappointed many supporters like me.<br><br>Stay on and fight - don't leave!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i certainly believes he deserves what he is getting. If you do no wrong, no one can accuse you of anything. Trying to frame yourself as a victim of some conspiracy sounds all too familiar (a tactic shared by a number of opposition party members when found guilty of misconduct?). Of course, the 'victim' will always have sympathizers isn't it? It sure beats being cast plainly as the perpetrator of semi-nude photos of the family maid.<br><br>Singapore is quite a conservative society but we do have nude paintings/sculptures around. If you engage it as a form of art, i guess it's pretty okay with most people. But being <strong>married</strong>, with an <strong>expectant wife</strong>, and doing it as a <strong>secret hobby</strong>, with <strong>your maid</strong>, simply hints at a perverse mind. What morals will he inculcate in our future generation?<br><br>As for the wife, what is done is done, no point saying what she should or should not have done. But i think discovering your husband engaging in such actvities with your maid is the ultimate insult, much like discovering an extramarital affair. And I wouldn't want a father like that.</div>

Please read my post carefully.<br><br>So what if he took pics of himself at other places? Does it mean ALL his pics were taken outside Singapore? I suppose the contents matter more than the location. Hmm... maybe he was trying to lead people off-track by showing an 'artistic' and 'taken out of Singapore' pic. How would you know what the rest of his collections contain?<br><br>Yes, a politician is no less human. But being a politician, he has to set a good example. Given that the maid incident is quite recent (about a month ago), he sure did not gain much sense since becoming a representative of the people. Something that is not illegal does not mean it is not immoral. I certainly would not put my trust in someone who had betrayed his wife, abused his position as an employer and had hoped to get away with it by quoting the bible and pointing to some conspiracy by the MIW, until he does some tangible good for the country instead of mere talk.<br><br>I'm not thirsting for his blood. Actually he had been non-existant to me until this incident came up. Pardon my ignorance, but I sincerely do not know how much 'hard work' he had put in for the people.</div>

Willing parties you may say. But too bad his wife doesn't like the idea. And women can get really MAD and SPITEFUL when feeling resented or jilted. So here comes the long arm of the law and the kaypoh reporters.......... AAArrrrhhh....(has anybody counted how many pages of Straits / Sunday Times have been devoted to this issue???) So everything is exposed, literally. True his personal life should not affect his political life one may argue. Hear on.....<br><br>Having said all that, I think Steve will not make a very good politician for one very important reason ---- he does not know how to cover his track after what he has had done. Especially in Singapore, to survive as a politician, you must know how to present yourself (or pretend if you like). Do and say everything you want but at the end of the day.....you must put up your best front while sweeping your trash clean (and remember to empty the trash bin).<br>Remember, we are a "clean" city.

Some fled, some silenced and some devastated to the point of no return.<br><br>Steve had better leave the country and go to a place where no one knows him. He is finished as far as his political life is concerned, perhaps even his social life. Finally, I wonder how the wife feels now. Triumph or tragedy? Conquest or condemned ?
