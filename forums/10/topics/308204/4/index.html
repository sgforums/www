              <p>You still missed out the first point of: it is your achievements
              before entering uni that matters to them, and not after. The same
              goes for any other scholarships in any country, be it a public or
              private company scholarship.</p>
              <p><br>
              Regarding your point:<br>
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wouldn't the money spent
              on these scholars be better spent on other subsidizing local
              students instead of giving a free cushioned ride for a growing
              number of "foreign talents"</span><br>
              Let's just say... if you had not had "great achievements" before
              entering uni, what bargaining chips do you have in an application?
              These foreign scholars had the bargaining chip; it is just whether
              they treasure it by contributing hard enough.</p>
              <p>Let's say you are a late bloomer, doing well only in uni...
              There are still many other scholarships around to apply; it is just
              whether you are aware of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That said, I still have to agree that not all foreign scholars
              are as good as they are made out to be. I'm confident of thrashing
              a great deal with ease, be it on the exam papers, at work, in the
              society or in life.</p>

              let's grant that they had very good results much better than the singaporeans (i doubt this too but for the sake of argument). Now, given so many that come in are actually worse than average. shouldn't there be moves to tighten the requirements? and for that matter if they are doing badly kick them out; put a condition of getting at least first class results.
              
              as for the foundation courses, it really depends. truth is they don't really need it for maths; just a matter of translation, a foundation course for maths won't help unless it's specially catered to chinese to english conversion.

              <p>If they get between 3.5 to 4.0 for their score, it is extremely hard for them to find a job back in China, where there are a great number of people with better scores from better university. Most likely have to stay in Singapore to work for a long long time.</p>
              <p>Also, if a foreign language is learned purely by translation, there's a limit you can enrich yourself in that area. Languages are to be used... so if foundation maths is taught to get them more used to using such terms during exams, it will definitely be more effective than merely teaching them the translations.</p>
              <p>And at least in NUS engineering, most of these chaps are doing very well. No, most of the best results still come from Singaporeans for electrical engineering, but these chaps are not falling too far behind. I wouldn't want the requirements to be tightened too much too, if not they are forced to study even harder, and then competition for the top spot will be even higher. I rather they score 3.5 to 4.0, and let the Singaporeans take the 4.0 to 5.0 spots.</p>

              <p>Hmmmm, interesting topic. We can go on here forever without coming to a conclusion. Here's my two cents.</p>
              <p>1. I heard from my PRC non-scholar friend that the PRC scholars who do come here are actually the "second grade" ones, who couldn't make it to the Big Chinese Unis like Beijing.</p>
              <p>2. Those who do come already see sg as a stepping stone to the west from day one, so no surprise they leave.</p>
              <p>3. From our limited perspective here, everything is going to hell.</p>
              <p>4. The government knows what the hell is going on, when you get an opportunity, ask them, you'll be surprised. In reality there is a really big and complex plan in place, which even individual ministers don't have all the minute details to. However, when you do grill them they can come up with very convenient, but not widely known facts about policies and statistics to shut you up. I've heard "did you know the government spends 4 times more on a disabled kid in a special school than on the average kid?" when one of them was asked if the government was doing enough for the disabled.</p>
              <p>5. You can never really know the true extent of what the government is doing. It's a huge bureaucracy.</p>
              <p>6. Although you don't know the details of what they are doing, you can try to understand the spirit of what they do and sort of trust them to figure out the mess.</p>
              <p>7. On Foreign talent and brain drain, one of them said: between making Singapore a free country and keeping talent, I would definitely go for making Singapore a free country. When these people leave, we won't stop them I hope they remember to say thank you, because it is precisely because they come from Singapore that they are in demand overseas. In the meantime, we must continue to nurture local talent, attract FT and keep the door open to Singaporeans who have left for overseas.</p>
              <p>8. I respect the minister who said this, though i'm sure there are bad seeds in the government, at the very least i trust this fellow to make a difference.</p>

              hard for them to find a job back in China, where there are a great
              number of people with better scores from better university. Most
              likely have to stay in Singapore to work for a long long time.</p>
              <p>Also, if a foreign language is learned purely by translation,
              there's a limit you can enrich yourself in that area. Languages are
              to be used... so if foundation maths is taught to get them more
              used to using such terms during exams, it will definitely be more
              effective than merely teaching them the translations.</p>
              <p>And at least in NUS engineering, most of these chaps are doing
              very well. No, most of the best results still come from
              Singaporeans for electrical engineering, but these chaps are not
              falling too far behind. I wouldn't want the requirements to be
              tightened too much too, if not they are forced to study even
              harder, and then competition for the top spot will be even higher.
              I rather they score 3.5 to 4.0, and let the Singaporeans take the
              4.0 to 5.0 spots.</p>

              No it will be more useful for them to just use the translations rather than do the foundation maths most of which is waste of time for them. But since we both aren't doing that let's just leave it as agree to disagree.
              
              The point of getting them in is because they are good. Otherwise why fund them at all. we do not need to fund average or lousy pple from other countries to come here and study so that they work here. We can use the fund to fund our our average and lousier singaporeans. 
              
              If you need them in the labour force then just import them at the working stage or might even be better if we employ singaporeans in their place and replace the same singaporeans that were in the lower tier jobs with them. 
              
              the whole idea of scholarships is about superior talent.

              <p><strong>1. I heard from my PRC non-scholar friend that the PRC scholars who do come here are actually the "second grade" ones, who couldn't make it to the Big Chinese Unis like Beijing.</strong></p>

              <p>Precisely... c wat i told u. they cannot make it in their country, so come here n make a nuisance of themselves. how to b considered a talent when u cant even make it in ur own country, where ur own culture n language n watever crap factors r in place, where in ur own country u r given equal opportunities . example, i believe all chinese in china r equal from start, its jus how u create ur pwn path n future. so those who screw up, heng heng parents a bit rich, come s'pore! cos here in s'pore, foreigners r always given advantage when it comes to uni/sch admission, work etc. its really depressing that our ministers (PUI!) treat people who cant make it in their own country, who cant contribute to our country, as gold while 100% locals like u n me have to slog n slog, day in day out like nobody business so that we can compete wif those foreigners like crap. i really dont c how much they can contribute. cos their primary aim is simple from day 1 they landed here. earn as much as i can, save up n move back home 2 b king or move to another country. anything but stay here. heck they even dont hav 2 serve NS! wake up la! no foreigner will defend u in times of war.</p>

              <p>Singapore produces many graduates (including PRC scholars) who later aim to emigrate to Australia and USA.  This shows how high the quality of Singapore's educational system.  Yes, i prefer that Singapore is a gateway, an opportunity for PRC Chinese to have a chance to uplift themselves and then join the world.  Go, Chinese, Go!  Better to have many more PRC Chinese scholars to go to Australia and then climb up to be bosses there.  The rest report to them.</p>
