              I've been griping about this for quite awhile already. A lot of these "scholars" are as mentioned really not good not even to say better than poor locals like us. thing is I think they don't even need to get a  minimum grade as long as they don't get kicked out of uni.....
              
              Which brings me to another point of scholars in general. From what i know truth is the govt. scholars are only reequired to get a 3.5 in CAP for NUS and a similar standard oversea which is only a second lower. Thats incredible low achieving considering they are choosen on academic achievements.......

              this gahmen obsession with FTs in the name of the nation's survival are warped policies at best. 
              
              it is now festering disgruntlement in the educated SGPrean lot, and guess what, in times to come, when LKY indeed calls time on Earth, the MIW will have a torrid time `defending' such policies.
              
              this is completely wrong. if singaporeans felt short changed, there must be some truth in the face of reality tt these `well-intended' policies is not sound, or balancely executed. like the `2 is enuf' policy by the Founding Father of Modern Singapore is flawed, only this time, these encompassing FT policies will boomerang and hit those MIWs in the face, hard. By then, there may be no backpedaling this time. For all you know, the mighty LKY may have a direct hand in causing PAP's downfall.

I'm just a young man who went to uni via the poly route ... a non-elite in other words ... and there's the most disheartening thing of all ... if I leave, would I even be counted as a numerical loss for the nation ? Since I am not among the "top 1000 talents" who leave yearly ? ...</p>
              <p>I have met my share of Singaporean Scholars overseas ... quitters all ... doctors, researchers, investment bankers, elites ... but what really troubled me the most was running into heartland uncles and aunties overseas, for the elites of any society have always been mobile, they will always be moving to greener pastures regardless .... but when you run into an uncle formerly from bedok selling mee pok tah in BC, then I think something has gone seriously wrong with our society .... </p>

              <p>if that is the case, then I'd say the goverment should make
              clear how they discern these "scholars" to be as such ... it gives
              me no great confidence that they have to be sponsored for
              foundation courses in Maths (maths !?!?! ... have you ever met a
              chinese who's bad at maths ? ), I'll bite for the English course
              perhaps, but Maths ? ... something is wrong with these "scholars"
              here ....</p>
              <p>I am sure that not all 3 or 4 As at A levels students in
              Singapore are eligible for, or got, scholarships ... and the
              benchmark for these overseas "scholars" is not widely known ... are
              these really the "exceptional" students they are made out to be ?
              ... my point is ... wouldn't the money spent on these scholars be
              better spent on other subsidizing local students instead of giving
              a free cushioned ride for a growing number of "foreign talents" ?
              ...</p>
              <p>you do bring in very compelling point about free rides being
              given out by US universities, but then again, most of these
              universities are private institutions with their own huge endowment
              funds, not publicly funded universities, like NTU ... these private
              universities do not use tax-payer's money for the free rides ...
              Harvard and stanford and cornell and MIT have their own respective
              pool of endownment funds, what they do with that money is up to
              them, but our universities are not just publicly funded
              institutions, for a small country like ours, they are also National
              Institutions, they do have an obligation to address their primary
              mission of nurturing OUR native talents before casting their nets
              further ... that's why I still find it entirely unacceptable that
              we have honours students like fudgie here giving tuition to earn
              his keep and bus fare while foreign students get a free ride
              through school ....</p>
              <p>Singapore's circumstances are unique, we cannot play this
              talents game the way the west is playing it, as I see it, rather
              than addressing the hemorrhage of our own people overseas, we are
              in effect acclerating it, replacing those who left with transients
              who treat Singapore like a small, cramped hotel .... we are not
              building the foundations of the future here, we are eroding our
              national identity ! ........</p>

              <p>I believe I answered that with my first two paragraphs ... I repeat, it gives me no great confidence about the abilities of these "scholars" when they need to go foundation courses in Maths ! .... and our famously calculative goverment seems to be hedging on long odds here on students who need foundation courses while not all A'level students with great results get a free ride via a fully paid scholarship ... I am sure the average 3 or 4 A's JC student need not go for any foundation courses in English and Math .... Are these local students not good enough to merit a free ride too, based on their prior performance ? ... from a book making point of view, these local students would make lower risk "investments", don't you agree ? ... or is it really about the bell curve alone ? ... a smart foreigner is worth more than a dumber Singaporean ? ...</p>
              <p>It is true enough that in almost any place in life, it's former performance that gets you in ... but then, this is not really about giving scholars a free ride in our universities, but about whether Singaporeans are getting the right priorities in our system. It may difficult to refute the economic logic of my last sentence in the previous paragraph, but I am deeply disturbed by this elitist attitude ... the powers-that-be has always been fascinated by elitism and eugenics and what not, but can our society really be stratified into the elites and the peasants and still be coherent as a nation ? ... and now we are competing against the "elites" of the world ... ... if we are not even able to compete on equal terms against the world on our home ground (worse, probably, with reservist duties, annuities to fund, etc) ... what the point of this whole excercise then ? .... </p>

              <p>And this brings us to the point... if they did well, they need foundation courses for what? If I'm not mistaken, whether polytechnic or uni, you have to pass your English and Maths to enter any of our courses here.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere, the same logic applies. You won't be able to apply to an Australian uni with your Maths failing. Sure you maybe able to enter, but they ask you to go to a community college, get your Maths up to par then they let in to the uni.</p>
              <p>I don't see why some foreign talents are given this exception, when Singaporeans students who fail the above 2 subjects will not be given any chance.</p>

              <p>And this brings us to the point... if they did well, they need
              foundation courses for what? If I'm not mistaken, whether
              polytechnic or uni, you have to pass your English and Maths to
              enter any of our courses here.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere, the same logic applies. You won't be able to apply to
              an Australian uni with your Maths failing. Sure you maybe able to
              enter, but they ask you to go to a community college, get your
              Maths up to par then they let in to the uni.</p>
              <p>I don't see why some foreign talents are given this exception,
              when Singaporeans students who fail the above 2 subjects will not
              be given any chance.</p>

              <p>Have you ever tried studying any of your subjects in any other language other than English? Say for example, in Chinese? Most likely no right? And do you know all the basic technical maths terms in chinese?</p>

              <p>I believe I answered that with my first two paragraphs ... I
              repeat, it gives me no great confidence about the abilities of
              these "scholars" when they need to go foundation courses in Maths !
              .... and our famously calculative goverment seems to be hedging on
              long odds here on students who need foundation courses while not
              all A'level students with great results get a free ride via a fully
              paid scholarship ... I am sure the average 3 or 4 A's JC student
              need not go for any foundation courses in English and Math .... Are
              these local students not good enough to merit a free ride too,
              based on their prior performance ? ... from a book making point of
              view, these local students would make lower risk "investments",
              don't you agree ? ... or is it really about the bell curve alone ?
              ... a smart foreigner is worth more than a dumber Singaporean ?
              ...</p>
              <p>It is true enough that in almost any place in life, it's former
              performance that gets you in ... but then, this is not really about
              giving scholars a free ride in our universities, but about whether
              Singaporeans are getting the right priorities in our system. It may
              difficult to refute the economic logic of my last sentence in the
              previous paragraph, but I am deeply disturbed by this elitist
              attitude ... the powers-that-be has always been fascinated by
              elitism and eugenics and what not, but can our society really be
              stratified into the elites and the peasants and still be coherent
              as a nation ? ... and now we are competing against the "elites" of
              the world ... ... if we are not even able to compete on equal terms
              against the world on our home ground (worse, probably, with
              reservist duties, annuities to fund, etc) ... what the point of
              this whole excercise then ? .... </p>

              <p>As mentioned above, try doing a student exchange in China or any other foreign language countries while in NUS, and you will see how hard it is to pick up technical terms in foreign languages.</p>
              <p>With regards to 3As and 4As students, there are many whom I know got great scholarships. There are also 3As and 4As students who falter and fall out of university. Yet there are Bs students who excel, or as in the case of my friend, quitted NUS in the first sem, went out wrote a software that sells and is now a millionaire, albeit residing in Australia. Hence, it is never possible to judge based on A level results.</p>
              <p>The point here is, former results do count. Whose problem is it if the student is not himself actively looking for sponsorship? Do know how how many interviews I have failed before landing one scholarship?</p>
              <p>Regarding local students, I'm sure you also understand that local students receive tuition grants without any bond from the government, whereas PRs will have to serve a 3 year bond. In addition, international students pay the full price. Where else in the world can you have uni sch fees of 6k a year?</p>
              <p>And have you speaked with the PRC scholars on how they feel about the bond? There are stories on how when they go back to China, everything feels different, they look and sound different from the locals there after their many years here, and it is hard for them to get a foothold in China after their bond is finished. Also, being away for a long time from your homeland is never easy.</p>
              <p>Sure, Singapore is too elitist. Although I believe I can compete with these foreign students easily, I don't foresee myself doing that in the future, but rather, managing and controlling these "talents".</p>
