              <p>Well, I can only say that you got to know wad is really happening behinds the scenes to know what sort of foreign talents we are letting into SG.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am currently studying in a local uni and I have a fair share of interactions with the PRC students and got to know some intimate, seldom known facts about them. Nope, I am not degenerating this into a PRC bashing thread, but I feel that it is time to really let SGreans know what is really happening in our local uni............</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, my forummers have already pointed out that these FTs are not from their first line unis. I will elaborate more. I have talked to this PRC guy before and he says that he comes to SG bcos he wants to "escape from reality". I was surprised and I quized him abt why he said so. He said back in PRC, even second tier unis are very competitive and students have to study day and night just to barely survive there. So being just an average student, he knows he cannot fight for better hons with the rest, so he decided to SG scholarship. Bcos, the branding of being an overseases scholar is gd enough to land u in any respectable white collared job. He told me that back in China, he was a third yr student and he came to SG to STUDY THE SAME COURSE BUT STARTING FROM YR1 AGAIN!!!! No prize for guessing why he did so well when u just left NS and is struggling to cope with civie live, this guy is coming here to study something he has done b4, while enjoying free education, food, lodging from our tax money. So I asked him what was his GPA back in PRC and what was the entry test to come here as a scholar. He said most coming here are 2nd lower to 2nd upper and the entry test here is just seeing your transcript and doing some basic IQ test, we oral English test. Then I asked him, where did the 1st class go, he said those that could not afford, stayed on, while those that are rich, left for western countries. He told me also that the SG govt has also a recent scheme that allows scholars to do PHD in SG unis as a form of paying back the 6yr bonds.</p>

              <p>If what you said is true, I'm surprised by the number of "smart" PRCs here. Most aren't as smart as you think, especially when you factor in the amount of time they took to prepare for a module as compared to most Singaporeans. The main thing I can see is, they are extremely hardworking, more hardworking than the average Singaporean.</p>
              <p>And for everyone's info, EU countries do hate PRCs coming into their country too. They are just all over the world nowadays.</p>

              <p>They no need to spend into the economy? Let's say $500 allowance for 8 years, that's $48k (excludes sch fees and plane fares). Most of this $48k will be spent in the Sg economy and the economy gets stronger due to the multiplier effect, Eventually, the money still lands in the government coffers through GST, income tax, petrol tax,  ERP and COE if they buy a car, Airport tax when they fly back... So many ways to get back. Not to mention that a large portion of their salary also goes to renting or buying flats in Sg, food, transport, utilities... A lot of money are still kept within the Singapore economy, even though they might be working for MNCs within Singapore. And if they do well, the Sg economy gets even more money!</p>
              <p>A economy functions best when people spend, not when people save. Bringing in large numbers of foreigners thus do help the economy, But this basically sums up what the government is thinking. The poor and old are still largely ignored...</p>
              <p>As my teacher said, "It is the nature of the capitalist beast to exploit the poor for profits". How true...</p>

              <p>True, if by helping the economy, you mean GPD growth. Unfornately, even though GDP has been rising, our per capita GDP has been falling every year since 1997. This can be mostly attributed to the government's policy of importing cheap FT to undercut Singaporean wages - and subsidizing them to do so!!</p>

              <p>Is it fair to use Singaporeans' taxes to lower our living standard, while providing freebies to encourage immigration? Besides, it takes 4 years for these students to graduate. By that time, we could be in another recession and more graduates won't be able to find jobs.</p>
              <p>Basically, the government is treating Singaporeans like expendable employees instead of the shareholders that we really are...</p>
