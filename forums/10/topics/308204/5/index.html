              <p>needless to say, the government is treating the scholars very very well..</p>
              <p>full tuition fees, monthly allowance, hostel fees etc.</p>
              <p>but the scholars are the elites which the government dig from china or India.</p>
              <p>a lot of them are from middle-class, good background, capable families like professors, governors, businessman and etc. </p>
              <p>they are capable in paying the fees.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but there are here in singapore, to pursue a higher standard of education than china or india.</p>
              <p>not here for the money...</p>
              <p>in addition, they are staying here for six years or probably the rest of their life in singapore to contribute to the economy...</p>
              <p>isn't that good to singapore?</p>
              <p>anyway, the government is subsidizing local university students through various ways, such as growth package and edusave and etc..</p>

              <p>still studying. aiming to emigrate to other countries if there's a chance. who wouldn't?</p>
              <p>all we should do is to squeeze the most out of this flawed system, and zao after that. take advanatage of the low uni tuition fee, and after graduation, since you can no longer apply for such subsidy again, you emigrate permanently to other countries more deserving of you, and never to come back again.</p>
              <p>Well, i'm sure that those recipient countries will be grateful to the gahment for spending so much to groom free ready-made talents for them.</p>
              <p>getting stuck in this hellhole, if screwed-up policies. annuities at 80 years old, blah blah blah. why not simply spend the money and live a more fulfiling life?</p>
              <p>ha. one day, singapore will be eventually transformed into a special adminstrated region of china, like hong kong. there, the FAP can happily rule over their flock of "FTs"...</p>

              <p>so long china is growing and demand minerals, ores and coals from australia, the economy here will still keep on rolling.</p>
              <p>read from the news that china is planning to build 4.0.0. NEW CITIES!! oz has more than 1000 years supply of coals and minerals to dig. so long china economy is booming, australia will enjoy economic success.</p>
              <p>the downside is the rate of inflation here, increasing rapidly. property and rental prices are shooting up and alot of house owners and tenants are facing the stress. coupled with global warming, the fresh water supply is running out soon as well.</p>
              <p>given the above circumstances, i strongly advise u NOT to migrate to australia which u so eagerly pm to me about previously. :-)</p>

              <p>there are but not as many as today. back then, getting a degree was a big deal. the govt then also practise elitism to allow only the best of the best to have access to tertiary education. which resulted in a lower population of graduates vs the non-technically trained.</p>
              <p>when the economy changed in the mid 90s, all were caught off-guard, technology demands surge at astronomical rate and i remembered that time around 97, there are very few indians nationals here and we seemed to oooh-and-aaah at their presence.</p>
              <p><br>There were two polys and NUS wasnt even offering degree in information system yet. the whole past of elitism and population segregation by IQ and school results, backfired. so near the 2000 millenium bugs, the SCS and NCS import huge number of FTs to support the industry demands.</p>
              <p>i was wondering why, if my peer and i are given the equivalent opportunity to study at the local uni, we could support the industry well. but for someone at the top's mistakes, the whole population paid the price.</p>
              <p>if your parents have access to tetiary education, i strongly absolutely believe they will have no problem in becoming highly qualified consultant or management by now. that is what really piss me off.</p>
