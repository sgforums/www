              <p>So why do you think they have to take foundation mathematics (obviously in English) even though they are picked from among the best of their cohort?

              <p>As mentioned above, try doing a student exchange in China or any
              other foreign language countries while in NUS, and you will see how
              hard it is to pick up technical terms in foreign languages.</p>
              <p>With regards to 3As and 4As students, there are many whom I know
              got great scholarships. There are also 3As and 4As students who
              falter and fall out of university. Yet there are Bs students who
              excel, or as in the case of my friend, quitted NUS in the first
              sem, went out wrote a software that sells and is now a millionaire,
              albeit residing in Australia. Hence, it is never possible to judge
              based on A level results.</p>
              <p>The point here is, former results do count. Whose problem is it
              if the student is not himself actively looking for sponsorship? Do
              know how how many interviews I have failed before landing one
              scholarship?</p>
              <p>Regarding local students, I'm sure you also understand that
              local students receive tuition grants without any bond from the
              government, whereas PRs will have to serve a 3 year bond. In
              addition, international students pay the full price. Where else in
              the world can you have uni sch fees of 6k a year?</p>
              <p>And have you speaked with the PRC scholars on how they feel
              about the bond? There are stories on how when they go back to
              China, everything feels different, they look and sound different
              from the locals there after their many years here, and it is hard
              for them to get a foothold in China after their bond is finished.
              Also, being away for a long time from your homeland is never
              easy.</p>
              <p>Sure, Singapore is too elitist. Although I believe I can compete
              with these foreign students easily, I don't foresee myself doing
              that in the future, but rather, managing and controlling these
              "talents".</p>

              <p>I am not definitely sure about this (enquiries from friends and cousins at Cornell, Columbia and U Penn turned up negative) ... but why is it that ivy league universities can judge their student intakes (and consequently scholarship students) on all round competence in English (and math too) ... but we'd grant foreign "scholars" the leeway of English and Math deficiencies ? .... a uniquely Singaporean situation ? ... Do the ivy league universities grant full scholarships to students with undemonstrated competence in english and math (in english, no less)? I feel that we  are bending over backwards and spreading our ass cheeks to accomodate these foreign scholars, and that locals with great credentials, based on pre-entry results, or undergraduate performance are getting short changed ...... it's not about who is more qualified for these scholarships, or who'd do well in the universities, .... but rather, who deserves it more ....</p>
              <p>You are on a local scholarship ? ... Good for you, that makes you an ... elite ? ... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> ... me ? ... I am a "farmer" ... maybe that's why I am understandably more troubled about this than you are ... I never quite made it up to the top rungs after each rounds of stratification in the Singapore educational system. The likes of us progress along a different track, without the "Scholar" appendage on our parchment,( and maybe, a fast tracked career path too ? ) we compete out there in society with master graduates from Burma and Bangladesh willing to work for half our pay, with no CPF, no two weeks of enforced abscence yearly, no annuities to fund, no families to support on local cost structures  .... yadda yadda ....</p>
              <p>you know, once upon a time, I could understand, even support the elitist darwanism of our educational system, that we must nurture and protect our best and brightest, and recruit the best and brightest from around the world to our shores .... but I realized that the one mark of an advanced and gracious society, one that you would be glad to sink your roots into, for generations to come, is not  how successful the elites are, but how well the lower rungs of society, the less fortunate ones, the ones that are less endowed cerebrally, are doing ... I think we are falling way behind on this score .... my father, an ITE lecturer, once came home very much depressed because one of this new students couldn't perform fraction sums, (1/4 + 1/4 confounded him) ... this chap is a residue of our streaming system, isn't it sad that he was able to slip through the cracks all the way till he was 18 ? .... maybe each foreign elite we bring in would be able to up our GDP by a billion or two a year, but to me, each cases like the above chap makes us poorer as a nation, this chap was written off by the system ... regardless of how well the chaps in the stratosphere are doing, I think we have not arrived at all ....</p>
              <p>so you see, our society, and this issue, looks very different to us through our lenses, than yours .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Wait wait. If you just learn the language, of course you will still need to learn Maths in German. That would makes sense since Maths isn't in the equation. But if it's already part of your curriculum, I don't see a need to. After translating it back from one language to another, the logic flow is about the same.</p>

              <p>Don't you see many PRCs scholars getting As for GP? How deficient is their English in that sense? From what I know, Cornell do not interview you face to face to see how well your spoken English is, but rather, from what you have written to them.</p>
              <p>Scholarship? I applied while in uni; I did not get before entering. As for my application, I will have to tell you that I planned for one year before my application to ensure higher chances of success. I did a statistical analysis of previous recipients before deciding I should apply in my 2nd year, and I even mentioned this during my interview when they questioned me on why I didn't apply a year earlier. Similarly, many government scholars recipients from JC have planned a long time ago, with some even during sec sch. I failed to plan at that time, and I made sure I planned well this time round. Planning includes taking parts in other enrichment activities other than doing well in sch work; results are still not everything. There are walking examples of NUS students with CAP around 4.0 (some maybe less) who received local scholarships too. No, they are not perfect As students.</p>
              <p>So before questioning about students who scored rather well and not receiving any help, think whether these students have planned  beforehand, have researched on the necessary data and information before making their applications.</p>
              <p>On the basis of elitism in education, please list out which country in which people who have no talent and do not do well in studies are not written off by the system. The world is cruel, it is a merit based global village. Unless you want to change the system to one of Communist or Marxist, there's no way such people will not be written off.</p>

              <p>Wait wait. If you just learn the language, of course you will
              still need to learn Maths in German. That would makes sense since
              Maths isn't in the equation. But if it's already part of your
              curriculum, I don't see a need to. After translating it back from
              one language to another, the logic flow is about the same.</p>

              <p>No, there are just too many things to learn in a language. Just like for us, do you think we learned how to say differentiation in Mandarin even though there are Mandarin lessons? Or how would you say the inverse of a function? Or expand the Binomial term?</p>
              <p>In most languages, we use almost the same few words everytime to convey our intentions when speaking. Technical terms are seldom used. Thus, in that sense, the first thing when people learn foreign languages is that they will learn these common words. I learned both German and Japanese in NUS as a foreign language, and I know this because these are courses preparing the students for student exchange in German or Japan. There's little emphasis on technical terms until the 4th course, of which the number of terms learned are still grossly insufficient. Only by taking a module on basic economics over in Germany do I know the technical terms of the subject. These terms, however, are extremely normal to people whose first language is German.</p>

              <p>I don't know which country or which university you are referring to, but from what I know about NUS and NTU, even PRs need to serve a 3 year bond to work only in Singapore and no other countries if they take up the tuition grant. Only local students do not need to serve the 3 year bond.</p>

              <p>Don't you see many PRCs scholars getting As for GP? How
              deficient is their English in that sense? From what I know, Cornell
              do not interview you face to face to see how well your spoken
              English is, but rather, from what you have written to them.</p>
              <p>Scholarship? I applied while in uni; I did not get before
              entering. As for my application, I will have to tell you that I
              planned for one year before my application to ensure higher chances
              of success. I did a statistical analysis of previous recipients
              before deciding I should apply in my 2nd year, and I even mentioned
              this during my interview when they questioned me on why I didn't
              apply a year earlier. Similarly, many government scholars
              recipients from JC have planned a long time ago, with some even
              during sec sch. I failed to plan at that time, and I made sure I
              planned well this time round. Planning includes taking parts in
              other enrichment activities other than doing well in sch work;
              results are still not everything. There are walking examples of NUS
              students with CAP around 4.0 (some maybe less) who received local
              scholarships too. No, they are not perfect As students.</p>
              <p>So before questioning about students who scored rather well and
              not receiving any help, think whether these students have
              planned  beforehand, have researched on the necessary data and
              information before making their applications.</p>
              <p>On the basis of elitism in education, please list out which
              country in which people who have no talent and do not do well in
              studies are not written off by the system. The world is cruel, it
              is a merit based global village. Unless you want to change the
              system to one of Communist or Marxist, there's no way such people
              will not be written off.</p>

              <p>I don't know which country or which university you are referring to, but from what I know about NUS and NTU, even PRs need to serve a 3 year bond to work only in Singapore and no other countries if they take up the tuition grant. Only local students do not need to serve the 3 year bond.</p>

              <p>The balance is not there. The government seems too extreme in gathering foreign talents to sg. But however, it also will be seems too extreme for citizens to vote out the government because of these issue only.</p>

              <p>i am not entirely sure how the system for FT work, but to me i always think if they r so talented as they n old Lee claim they r, den stay in ur own bloody country n make ur mark there! y come to this country u like to call "small red dot"? show ur worth in ur own country! the way i c it, they r not as gd as the elites in their country, thats y they come here n make a nuisance of themselves. talents my foot!</p>
              <p>everywhere i go, they r everywhere. my office, the bus stop, shopping malls, my void deck, on trains n buses, on the roads, hell even the auntie taking ur order at coffee shops is a foreigner! n i expect to c them in my school as well. the more i interact wif them, the more i feel they aint the FT they claim to b. only old Lee c them as talent. the "importing" is jus happening too fast. year ago how many foreigners can u find on the streets except construction sites? i believe we r competing as well with other countries if not better during that time.</p>
              <p>we served our nation wif our sweat n blood, we wasted 2 weeks every year to defend the foreigners. we gave taxes aft taxes so that these FTs can get subsidies. wat have they contributed to the country that made them deserve the reliefs? oh ya! they gave more taxes so that the governement can have 20% increase in pay every yr n say help needy. bravo.</p>
              <p>i jus love the FOREIGNERS. dont u?</p>

              <p>I guess there is some discrepancies here. If you take the Linear Algebra I module in NUS, you will see more PRCs than locals and usually they are the one who scores A+ for that module. That is the reason why I have to avoid taking math module at all cost because of the competition.</p>
              <p>I heard there is a rumour in one of the math module in NUS last semester. After the mid-term test and the results of mid term were released, many people scored above 80%. So the rumour: There was a group of PRC students complaining to the lecturer that the mid-term was too easy. So the lecturer set killer questions (60% of the final year exams were not doable if you simply understood the topics; you had to think deeper) and if you did not attempt these questions, the higher you can get was probably B. Guess what? many PRC scholars get A and A+ for that module. How can we conclude that PRC scholars need training in maths. they have been trained enough in their home countries. what they need is that how to present the answer in English and to understand the questions properly.</p>

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">Australia adds visas for skilled workers! Will the brain drain get even worse for Singapore?</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Singapore state owned and controlled
              newspaper, the Straits Times, just as all the other news media being
              equally owned and controlled by the state has a story on Feb 18, 2008
              headed "Australia adds visas for skilled workers".<br><br>Is this not
              going to exasperate the already dire skilled manpower situation in
              Singapore when Singapore is presently losing its qualified people
              permanently emigrating to the west at intolerably high levels?<br><br>According
              to this report, Australia is going to add another 6,000 skilled worker
              visas every year increasing the total to 108,500. With Australia
              already being the main destination for several thousands of Singaporean
              migrants, this additional increase in work visas can only mean even
              more Singaporeans leaving.<br><br>And the people leaving would be the
              very ones that Singapore needs most; aircraft technicians from
              Singapore airlines, cargo handlers, aircraft checkers, air traffic
              marshals and other aviation staff; which means a heavy loss to
              Singapore Airlines, a leader in the skies.<br><br>And these workers
              being lost are the very type that Singapore needs the most, highly
              skilled and experienced staff often irreplaceable at any price, with
              their training and vast experience.<br><br>The same with the merchant
              marine and the marine industry. Container men, container traffic
              specialists, crane operators of all sorts, skilled welders and
              mechanics, diesel mechanics, all sorts of highly skilled people are
              being lost every day from Singapore heading to Australia; badly
              affecting the Singapore shipping trade.<br><br>Not just in aviation and
              shipping. All the other trades, skilled air-conditioning technicians,
              motor mechanics, diesel mechanics, and skilled workers in every
              possible trade you can think of, all making a bee line to the
              Australian High Commission filling out papers and standing in line for
              the first Singapore Airlines or Qantas flight to Sydney?<br><br>The
              brain drain from Singapore has reached such incredibly high levels that
              an Australian in Brisbane was reported to have asked someone inquiring
              whether there was a revolution or some other catastrophe in Singapore
              that is causing such high levels of flight from the country!<br><br>And
              mind you, all this emigration at such high levels is from a small
              country, Singapore, 16 miles north to south and 26 miles east to west
              with a population no more than 3 million and shrinking. What is more,
              Singaporeans are at the same time, refusing to have any babies to such
              an extent that the population is unable to replace itself. The
              situation had become so grave and if no action was taken, there will
              only be the trishaw riders and hawkers left in Singapore.<br><br>So in
              order to remedy this intolerable situation in labor shortage, the
              government finds itself helpless other than to bring in hundreds of
              thousands of people from Communist China, some from India and the
              Philippines and Burma to somehow replace the loss. But the question is
              whether such immigrants from these countries are qualified and skilled
              as those Singaporeans who have left and as we speak leaving? The answer
              has to be a resounding "no".<br><br>No matter what one says of
              Singaporeans, one cannot deny that they are one of the most skilled
              qualified and disciplined workers anywhere in the world. And what is
              more, they have an excellent knowledge of English making them the most
              sought after among immigrants in any part of the world. Singaporeans
              themselves have shown how good they are succeeding in their careers and
              businesses anywhere and capable of competing with anyone.<br><br>I am
              myself a living example. Educated in Singapore and in England, I not
              only passed the English Bar Exams, the Singapore Bar and the California
              Bar which is reputed to be the most difficult among the Bar
              Examinations throughout the United States. Not only that I practice law
              in the local courts and compete with Americans and people from anywhere
              in the world who happens to be here. Why, because I have had an
              excellent education in Singapore and that makes me able to compete and
              survive in any part of this planet. California benefits from my
              education which I received in Singapore just as the thousands of
              Singaporeans benefit Australia from the education they received in
              Singapore. The net loser in this equation is Singapore.<br><br>Has the Singapore government ever asked why Singaporeans are so eager to escape from Singapore?<br><br>I
              have no in depth knowledge of Australia but I understand the general
              conditions there. In Australia human beings are treated as humans. If
              you unemployed, the government permits you to survive with human
              dignity, with reasonable assistance for you and your children until you
              find something else. Not like in Singapore where thy throw $200.00 at
              you and some rice and cooking oil expecting you to somehow fend for
              yourself. In such undignified inhumane circumstances, the children of
              poor people in Singapore lose their self respect, their hopes and
              aspirations and eventually turn out no better than their destitute
              parents. In Singapore being poor is a sin and and shameful; in
              Australia being poor is just a temporary setback from which everyone
              expects you to come back, full steam ahead and kicking.<br><br>In
              Australia, children are allowed to be children, which means they can
              play, something which children are expected to do. In Singapore,
              children, the moment they are born are turned into adults, with time
              tables, appointments, school assignments, tuition classes, music
              classes, language classes so much so that they are constantly looking
              at their calendars for their next appointment!<br>This sort of life
              creates a robot with only one motivation and drive, the drive to do
              better, to make more money, to say the right things, to speak correct
              political speech, to please the master and to survive as best you can;
              preferably not being seen or heard; because in Singapore if you stand
              out like a nail, you will be hammered in to conform to society. In
              Australia on the other hand, you are welcome to be anyone you want; and
              you can think you are the Pope and no will care two hoots.<br><br>In
              Australia there are retirement pensions, state funded medical care and
              other social programs where people can live everyday as human beings
              knowing that there is the rule of law, and their rights will be
              protected. In Singapore you have a Lee Kuan Yew who thinks he knows
              everything and will send anyone to jail who thinks otherwise.<br><br>Even
              though I grew up in Singapore I was lucky to have a father who was way
              ahead of the Singapore government in thinking. As a boy I was told I
              could achieve anything I wanted. And being a 6 year old boy, I really
              believed it. All that was required was the desire to want it, my father
              said. The achievement itself will automatically follow. And this
              philosophy stayed with me throughout my life. I always believed that I
              could achieve anything that I want. My father used to say that fear
              only holds one back. That there was no need to fear and if it is the
              oceans you want to cross, then cross it without hesitation.<br><br>And
              it is this kind of courage that was instilled in me, that every
              Australian or New Zealand father instills in their boys. That is why
              Edmund Hilary, the bee keeper and mountaineer, champion of Mount
              Everest, is a New Zealander; that is why Peter Snell, the 800 meters
              Olympic champion is a New Zealander; that is why hundreds of Tour de
              France cyclists are New Zealanders; that is why New Zealand won the
              yacht race America cup; that is why New Zealanders are the best world
              yachtsmen. And the All Blacks the best rugby team in the world are New
              Zealanders.<br><br>Why, because in New Zealand, boys grow up as boys,
              they fight, they play and they enjoy an adventure. And mind you, New
              Zealand has a population of 3 million too, just like Singapore. Not
              like the Singapore 10 year old boy who has to look at his calendar for
              the next tuition class; who will fall swoon and die bending over
              backwards if you just gave him a slap!<br><br>Singapore parents are
              aware of how Australia and New Zealand is, just as I am. So they prefer
              their children to grow up as children in Australia and New Zealand and
              they leave Singapore, where Lee Kuan Yew struts around like a prize
              rooster, beating up on anyone who even utters a whimper of complaint.<br><br>So
              I don’t expect the manpower problems in Singapore to get any better. It
              will only get progressively worse. Worse because the new entrants to
              fill the jobs left by Singaporeans, the immigrants from Communist
              China, India and the Philippines have neither the English, nor the
              skills or the experience of Singaporeans who left.<br><br>And as long
              as Lee Kuan Yew thinks he knows best and continues to run the country
              in the present tyrannically hopeless manner, Singapore can only
              continue to decline even further meaning even more Singaporeans will
              begin packing and leaving.<br><br>This unfortunately is the bitter truth.</p>
