              <p> </p>
              <p>I still recall that I was stopped at a road block with my motorcycle several years ago. The police accused me of speeding in excess of 20km/h and demanded me to pay my fine on the spot. I was just about a km away from the Malaysia checkpoint and wasn't intending to buy anything on the way thus spent every single RM I had before coming to the road block.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Paying the fine on the spot?! I am not born yesterday. I told him honestly I had no money left and would rather he give me a ticket for speeding. He insistantly refused to give me a ticket while I insisted that I really had no more money left as I was already so close to the customs check point.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After discussions with her colleagues, he told me to go with a 'final warning'. Blatantly asking for a bribe on the streets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have many more stories regarding bribery in Malaysia and some are extremely fury inducing but too many to list.</p>

              <p>if you know you did not commit any wrong doing, or speeding; stay cool &amp; just stand your ground. `final warning', `ok, i check again', whatever are just excuses for them to let you go. no need to be agitated or angry. the objective is to get out of the situation unscathed. if one readily give them money regardless of whether got offence or not, we are the `dumb' one and encouraging their `behaviour'.</p>
              <p>why must one succumb to their fancies and pay them for `nothing'?</p>
