              <p>It's funny how some would praise the Malaysian government when even its own PM acknowledges that there is corruption within its' ranks.</p>
              <p>No matter what cuts they make, the kickbacks probably more than offsets it.</p>
              <p>I remember on an assignment in the neighbouring state. One night after a session with associates, as i could not find any taxi, I walked all the way back to my company's apartment, a short distance away.</p>
              <p>There was a road block, and was stopped by the MP3 submachine gun welding policemen. I check my wallet and realized i left my passport and IC in my office.</p>
              <p>I was push before their in-charge there, an inspector who flashed his ID. Pulling me over to one quiet side, he informed me he could put me in jail, and brazenly told me if i could make a contribution to him, he will forget the matter.</p>
              <p>There was only RM100 in my wallet. I gave it to him as i wanted no trouble, but then he didn't believe me i had so little. He immediately made a check on my body and found RM2000 i left in my pockets.</p>
              <p>He not only grab the whole lot, but scolded me for lying to him. Didn't even leave me RM20 to take a cab home. Daylight robbery at its best, but what to do when their salaries are so miserably low?</p>

              <p>i dun think anyone here is endorsing `kickbacks' here in malaysia. i for one walk the talk. i get stopped 100% of the time in the NS highway by their TP roadblocks becos they viewed mine a `luxury car', regardless of whether i am speeding or not. i will ask them to issue me the summon instead of `negotiating to settle'. 9 of 10 times, they let me go, saying that they will `double check'. i will politely say `terima kasih, tuan' instead of getting confrontational.</p>
              <p>yours make for a nice story. you can go togo with no money and oblivous to it. and even in walking back on the pavement, there's policeman wielding machinegun manning the walk pavements. even if it is true, i am shocked that you did not know your rights and malaysia too respect the rule of law. did you forget your mobile too to get help?</p>

              <p>bro, y would u left rm2000 in ur pocket??? i always kana "summon" by msian police so many times, there's a market rate out there man. RM100 for ur offence is more than enuf liao actually.... <br>maybe u sway or wat lah but i've nv come across any officers who openly demand bribe money. the usual norm is whether u want to offer a bribe or just get summoned. there's a code of conduct among mata and citizens when it comes to kopi negotiation ok...</p>

              <p>It's funny how some would praise the Malaysian government when even its own PM acknowledges that there is corruption within its' ranks.</p>
              <p>No matter what cuts they make, the kickbacks probably more than offsets it.</p>
              <p>I remember on an assignment in the neighbouring state. One night after a session with associates, as i could not find any taxi, I walked all the way back to my company's apartment, a short distance away.</p>
              <p>There was a road block, and was stopped by the MP3 submachine gun welding policemen. I check my wallet and realized i left my passport and IC in my office.</p>
              <p>I was push before their in-charge there, an inspector who flashed his ID. Pulling me over to one quiet side, he informed me he could put me in jail, and brazenly told me if i could make a contribution to him, he will forget the matter.</p>
              <p>There was only RM100 in my wallet. I gave it to him as i wanted no trouble, but then he didn't believe me i had so little. He immediately made a check on my body and found RM2000 i left in my pockets.</p>
              <p>He not only grab the whole lot, but scolded me for lying to him. Didn't even leave me RM20 to take a cab home. Daylight robbery at its best, but what to do when their salaries are so miserably low?</p>
              <p>I doubt if you can find such encounters in Singapore.</p>

              <p>even if u can list the corruption of the ministers, so what? the fact is, singaporean ministers are not willing take an allowance cut.. a 10% cut from a 3million paycheck will become 2.7million.. can u find me a lifestyle which 2.7million per annum cannot support?</p>
              <p> EDITED: will the 300k that is reduced from the pay be so disastrous and so hard on their current lifestyle such that it will amount to corruption? if today a person earns 3k per month and his pay is reduced by 10% to 2.7k, maybe the pinch will be felt, and corruption will set in.. in times of such troubles, where the people are suffering from the inflation of commodities, how many people's rice can be bought with 300k/annum? how many more people can one minister's 10% feed?</p>

              <p>No, I don't think so. There are only after some 'kopi-money'. I'm sure they don't want blood splattered on their clean and neat police uniform. But if i struggle, i'm sure they will shoot my legs and charge me for resisting arrest, more so when i have no IC on myself.</p>
              <p>And no point reporting it. Even though corruption is rampant and known to all there, who would believe me when i have no irrefutable evidences such as witnesses? The inspector certainly didn't issue me a receipt for my kind donation of RM2,100.</p>
