Taiwan said they wanted to take back mainland China since1949 and China wants to take back Taiwan since ah bian wants to declare independence. Is taking back Taiwan a war of expansion as a result of the growth in China?? It is the contrary in reality. The growth of China have so far brought about the economic growth in the region, it has narrow the gaps between the lives of people on both sides of the straits, making peaceful reconciliation more achievable.
