The Koreans also protested againt the japanese for whitewashing their history textbooks. Some korean protestors even cut off their fingers as a sign of protest!Go and read yesterday's LianHe WanBao... Some people in Johor also launched a protest against the japs.  So what do u mean by you don't see any protests going on in other countries?<br><br>China and Korea should put herself in Japan's shoes? The fact is in the first place China and Korea have never invaded Japan.  Nor did they massacre the japanese.

Historically, Taiwan has been part of China. Even US has recognized this historical fact. USA is not in favor of Taiwan declaring independence.<br><br>So your opinion is not in accord with the historical fact. China is therefore not threatening Taiwan but is merely trying to establish its one-China policy in their own legislative process. Nothing has been done which is not in accordance with international recognization and acceptance of its same one-china stand.<br><br>I don't see anyone in the international community can say that China is the aggressor in regard to its formalizing its one-china stand in their parliament. One should be objective even if one has his own opinion. It does not matter if the opinion is right or wrong as that is quite another matter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main problem is the US, the country that defeated Japan, failed to make Japan apologise for the war. Without a formal apology, Japan won't admit that she had done any wrong. She thus contiues to whitewash history. There are also signs that she is re- militarizing.</div>
