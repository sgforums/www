            <div class='col-md body'>oh pls dun u know wat's happening in the world! japan refuses to even admit they started ww2 that's why the chinese are so angry! in the new textbooks they practically rewrote history and justified their actions by saying they "came to liberate asia" (quoted from straits times' article on this issue).<br>They don't even admit the existance of comfort women! (women who were forced to be sex slaves to the jap soldiers)<br><br>These are just a few examples of the changes they have made in the history text books... The chinese shouldn't have all these violent demonstations but you must understand how insulted they feel !! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
