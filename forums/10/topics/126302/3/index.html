The scale of the protests in China is nothing, compared to the 500,000 protestors in HK and Taiwan, and compared to the size of the population in China. When emotion truely runs wild in china as in the 70s then normal life would be disrupted but in many countries like Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, just to name a few, and even in indonesia, people can protest to voice their frustration but life goes on. Singaporeans are conditioned to shut up and leave things to the government. any small gathering is likely to bring down the whole economy. Singaporean will never have the freedom to protest and will never appreciate, but lets not ridicule what we don't have.<br><br>What is down right derogatory is your assumption that "when they're angry they just want to kill jap men ,rape jap women, dig up their graves, loot their money, all because everyone else around them is also angry". What gives you that kind of idea??<br><br>Japan's war with China lasted over 8 years and millions killed. Japan's occupied Korea for 35 years and millions perished. The impact of the wars on the people of these two countries are far greater than the 2 and a half years occupation of singapore with only slightly more than 50,000 killed. What Japan has consistantly done were to justify their actions in WW2. Respecting the ww2 war criminals as war heros, changing history in text book....... Imagine Germany putting up a figure of Hitler for remembrance in Berlin and teaching their children that ww2 was an attempt to unite europe to become the EU today to resist the influence of America......what do you think the europeans will do? if their emotions do not run wild, they are not european.<br><br>don't  go on China bashing just because of a few jobs in singapore were taken away by the chinese nationals. That is the government's policy, don't like it can protest or not???<br></div>

The virus would have been confined to China. That was the Chinese screw up.

Japan, to a large measure, own it's current status to the necessity of communism containment policy of the US right after the war. else, more war crimials will be tried and lots of the major conglomerates contributing to the war efforts would have been dismantled. (correct me if i'm wrong)<br><br>how would you feel if a guy comes to your place, pick a fight, slaughter you family, was later to be made a riches kid on the block, told the world and his kids a different spin of the story and blame you for starting the whole thing? i'm a singaporean and i do not have the Chinese psyche, or a sense of history, but i won't feel good about it. i suggest you stop thinking as an outsider and start thinking in a Chinese perspective.</div>
