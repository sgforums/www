Money making opportunities is a key reason which drives foreign migration to China. But there are many foreigners who chose to migrate there bcos they are fascinated with China and they think that China is a better place to live. One good example is this american lady who chose to live in China despite the fact she could be making more money elsewhere:<br><br>http://www.speakingofchina.com/journal/archives/000112.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think most of those demonstrations you see, have nothing to do with the past but the present and future. These demonstrations are unlike those staged by victims to demand compensations.<br><br>these anti-Jap demonstrations on TV only reaffirms China's position as the next super power to the world...the fact that its ordinary citizens are becoming nationalistic and assertive means that besides being aware that they will be the biggest market and rising economy soon, they could even one day be more powerful than the US (look at its deficits). then, they will have a greater say on theworld stage. its like a triad society meeting. Say, if the boss wants to invade a country now claiming they have WMD. Other smaller countries will bow and follow suit like lackeys even if they are strongly against it and no other external organizations can interfere...etc. If China becomes the taipan one day and says no to invasion, other countries will more likely go to her side and treat the less powerful country like pariah. That's why, the government is not using any strong arms tactics to quell the crowds. It's good PR display and especially if the chinese reject japanese goods (country of origin), they either turn to SKorea and set up Joint ventures to reverse engineer that vcd or state of the art cameras and be more self reliant. IF it was an internal demonstration like the Tiananmen, maybe different gloves will be used? When China becomes the dragon lord one day, teens will no longer go for J-pop/Kpop or americano culture but Shang-dong or Sze Chuan -pop music with their malan noodles and chinese tea. Many will try to emulate the Chinese's every dressings, behaviour, business ethics like the latest trends. Powderful huh?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by schrecklichkeit:</div><div class="quote_body">who think china's demonstration and all that anti-jap thing is wrong?<br><br>i for one don't support these actions. its not about the rowdyness.. even the china government is angry with japan and i think they shud just stfu.<br>i can tell you, china is so furious over the atrocities commited by japan in the war right? this is my answer to them:<br><br>atrocities or not, they were brought upon you simply because you are weak. weak. weak. the world is survival of the fittest and you cannot simply live by moral standards and kp when you have been wronged.<br>and if the roles were reversed. if during world war 2 the chinese people were to invade japan and conquer them. i can bet both of balls that almost the same atrocities will be commited against the japanese people.<br><br>rape? confirm. the chinese soldiers would also rape the womenfolk. so don't go around being so bloody self-righteous when you are no different a beast.<br><br>simply put, they are sore</div></blockquote></div>
