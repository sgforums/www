It is now more than 18 per cent down on its record high of $78.65, touched just over a month ago.<br><br>Falling crude prices sparked sharp declines in other commodity markets. Gold traded below the key $600-an-ounce threshold for the first time since late June, while copper fell 4.5 per cent to $7,460.50 a tonne.<br><br>Edward Morse, chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers, said oil prices were unlikely to carry on falling. Â“We have had the perfect lull, but it is not a turning point when prices will continue to decline,Â” he said.<br><br>Mr Morse said the fall reflected the easing of tension between the west and Iran over its nuclear ambitions, the end of the Israel-Lebanon conflict, lack of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico region and an end to the US summer driving season.<br><br>Ali Naimi, Saudi ArabiaÂ’s energy minister, shrugged off the fall in prices, calling it Â“a blipÂ”.<br><br>Opec ministers agreed to keep the cartelÂ’s official production at 28m barrels a day, even though the 10 members that abide by quotas are producing 500,000 b/d less. With the cartel producing below official limits, analysts said Opec may cut at its next meeting in Nigeria in December.<br><br>Â“The process is starting now. ItÂ’s been several years since theyÂ’ve had to cut back,Â” said Carl Calabro, analyst at PFC energy, the Washington based consulting firm. Mr Calabro said there was already a surplus of fuel oil in the market, in particular in Singapore, but also in the US, where inventories are 25 per cent higher than normal.<br><br>Mr Morse said the focus on inventories was overdone, as global inventories in absolute terms will have to continue to grow in order to maintain the Â“comfort levelÂ” of between 50 and 55 days of forward demand cover.<br><br>He said oil demand had risen by about 10m b/d in the past six years, which translates to another 500m barrels of oil needed in storage.<br><br>Oil traders expect prices to rise by the end of the year.<br><br>The US benchmark oil price, the West Texas Intermediate, is quoted at more than $67 a barrel for December, compared with the current spot price of $65.50.<br><br>Oil traders said concern about the fall in oil prices may be overdone, given that US benchmark oil prices are 7 per cent lower than the record peak of $70.85 reached in August last year in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.<br></div>

Do they know how long ppl have to wait for buses only to find that it is super crowded?  or do they ever find out why the stupid bus comes in single decker during morning peak hours when a double decker should be more efficient ?

            <div class='col-md body'>i wonder how to PTC reach the conclusion of approving fare hikes. they should publish the reasons which propel them to give the green lights for fare hikes. their decisons affected every1 of us and i think they should b accountable to each and every1 of the bus users. everytime the jus say bus hikes due to blah blah but there is no reports gives to support their reasoning. i would suggest PTC to publish their report whenever bus fares are reviewed whether bus fare increase or not.</div>
