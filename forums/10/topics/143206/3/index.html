            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there are places where you can emigrate without much more costs. Planning is also a must but the costs are much lower. The countries where you can emigrate to for work reasons are Thailand, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Africa, and Vietnam.<br><br>They are close to home- except for South Africa- and all of them(including South Africa) have a cheaper standard of living. Of course, most of these places are still developing countries for a reason- but let's put it in this way: you should look at these countries from a glass that is half-full rather than a half-empty one.<br><br>These countries have room for more development and more growth. Their working culture can also improve. These countries need people from well developed economies to help them transit from a closed economy to an open, market-orientated one. In addition, socially they are also a bit backward. So you can help in that aspect too.<br><br>So if Singaporeans can go there and take up the challenge, by leaving for these countries for work or living, then it would be better. Besides, as I said before, these countries have a lower standard of living, so you won't necessary have to pay more if you want to maintain your current standard of living that you have now in Singapore. In fact, each SGD will have more stretching power in these countries than back home.<br><br>On an additional note, if you are still considering moving to an angmoh country, then instead of just considering the likes of Britain, US and Australia, maybe you can consider Nordic countries or Ireland. East European countries like Estonia are also booming in terms of their economies so both citizens and foreigners can absorb the benefits of such expansion of a booming economy in these respective countries.</div>

It is safer at night here.<br><br>However, I feel safety is more of your own individual control than of that of government. If you stay in Australia and you go home late and risk robbery, it is really your own fault. Just like in Singapore, late at night, don't enter a lift with someone you don't know. Get your brother or dad to come down to fetch you. </div></blockquote>how about wat i said earlier?<br><br>go read again... that can hppen in braod daylight... n police are scared of them... wat makes u think it is very safe in the day?</div>
