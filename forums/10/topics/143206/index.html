            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan has announced changes to policies concerning Singapore's property market in three major areas.<br><br>These are: easing the cap on bank financing for residential properties, limits on the use of the CPF for property purchases, and restrictions on foreign ownership of land and properties.<br><br>On mortgage and financing policies, the financing limit for housing loans will be raised from 80 percent to 90 percent of the property value.<br><br>Mr Mah said the remaining 10 percent, which the buyer has to pay, would deter over-borrowing and minimise potential losses by banks as a result of borrower default.<br><br>HDB will also raise the loan limit for its flat buyers from 80 to 90 percent.<br><br>This takes immediate effect and will apply to all properties bought from Tuesday.<br><br>Also with immediate effect, the cash payment for private residential properties will be lowered from 10 percent to five percent.<br><br><strong>From January next year, the cash requirement for HDB flats financed with bank loans will also be adjusted to five percent, down from ten percent</strong>.<br><br>Mr Mah said these changes would give consumers a wider choice of financing options when buying a property.<br><br>In a ministerial statement in Parliament on Tuesday, he stressed that the purpose of the measures was neither to boost nor depress the property market.<br><br>Rather, the review was aimed at improving structural rules to improve the functioning of the market and to better achieve broader economic and social objectives.<br><br>Mr Mah, however, cautioned that some of the measures introduced would have a positive effect on the market, while others might have a dampening effect.<br><br>And the net effect would depend on many factors beyond the measures announced.<br><br>On the use of money from the Central Provident Fund, Mr Mah said buyers could use their CPF to buy residential properties with shorter leases of between 30 and 60 years.<br><br>Restrictions on foreigners buying property are also being eased.<br><br>Mr Mah said the government would remove the restriction on foreigners owning property in apartment blocks of six floors and below, but will still require foreigners to seek approval for purchases of landed properties. - CNA/de/al<br></div>

Public housing policies and schemes are formulated not only to meet changing needs and aspirations, but also in support of national objectives such as racial harmony, stronger family ties, and focus as well on sectors of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">population in need of specific attention such as the elderly and those who may be in financial difficulty.

            <div class='col-md body'>The thing is that since the cap of bank loans has been rised to 90%, instead of the current 80% means people will have to pay interest and the loan back to tha banks.<br><br>Singaporeans are already one of the highest in the world in terms of unpaid debt. If this scheme goes ahead, housing monthly payments will get more expensive, instead of getting cheaper.<br><br>Lets put it point by point:<br><br>1) HDB flat prices are already overinflated by the govt.<br><br>2) So people, especially baby boomers, have to use CPF and bank loans to put down the deposit for the HDB flat.<br><br>3) Baby boomers already will have less CPF savings because of above said point.<br><br>4) They will be in great debt in the current scheme already as the economy isn't doing well and because of that they are getting paid less.<br><br>Now...with the new scheme:<br><br>1) People can borrow more money from the banks and also use CPF money- instead of just cash.<br><br>2) Catch? More bank loans means more interest to be paid. Banks will also want you to repay the loans itself. If the monthly payments aren't paid up regularly, they will impound your new house. They might even make you bankrupt.<br><br>3) 2nd catch? CPF funds for each buyer will be depleted even more. This CPF money is for your retirement. If you use it more just to pay the deposit for your HDB flat, it means you will have less retirement money in the future.<br><br>So the end result for most ordinary pple is this: you will not benefit because this policy is more for the rich and foreigners. The banks and property agents will be happy because they have more money from guillable property investors- all of them small timers and have bigger risks in getting screwed if they are not financially stable now.<br><br>In the end, if you struggle to pay off your debt now, this new scheme will make it worse. It won't ease your financial strain because it will only increase your amount of debt- not just now but in the future when you grow older.<br><br>Foreigners also don't go through the stringent measures that the govt imposes on locals. Just see the other part regarding foreigners.<br><br>In short, this scheme will not spark a real recovery of the property market here and will only put more ordinary singaporeans into more debt. The country will suffer more for this as the middle class and poor income families are the foundation of Singapore. if this groups fail, then any economical recovery is at best marginal and artifical.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The PAP has fouled things up in the property market with their actions, especially since the 90s when things started to change- and when they couldn't because they were so deep-rooted in their old thinking.<br><br>So although this policy may look nice at the first impression, the details don't look good- especially, as I said, for the middle class and the lower income ones. The ST said that people will have 'more cash' to purchase their dream houses and flats- but the 'cash' doesn't belong to the people. It belongs to the bank. CPF is also their retirement fund for the future.<br><br>So eventually bank loans has to be repaid, CPF savings will be reduced. CPF rates have already been reduced from 20% to 16% while basic pay and bonuses have also been reduced. HDB flats resale value for certain flats are also dropping. In addition, the economy is stop-starting while the economicies of other countries in the region are also being marked down due to high oil prices etc.<br><br>So as income per capita is reduced across the board and as the world economy remains sluggish, expenses, interest rates and taxes are increasing across the board for the middle class and lower income ones. So this scheme, as I said, will only worsen the increasing problems of the said groups I'd mentioned.<br><br>So will people owe more houses in this scheme? The answer is yes- but at a huge expense. It will put families deeper in the red, rather than in the black. It will put them in a bigger risk of defaulting on their bank loans- thus increasing their chances of getting bankrupt in the future. It also endangers their retirement plans in the future(when things will get even more expensive as compared to now).<br><br>In the end, at best the economy will recover- but it will be marginal and artifical. At its worst, huge public debt will weigh heavily on the economy itself and with oil prices going up everyday, the economy will remain sluggish in the near and possibly long-term future.<br><br>It isn't looking rosy at all.<br><br><span style="color: red;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
