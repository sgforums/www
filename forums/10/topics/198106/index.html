            <div class='col-md body'>Need to know more details.<br><br>The fact is, she could have been a very unproductive employee and the company has been rooting for an excuse to axe her. Admittedly, this is a rather LAME excuse though...<br><br>If however, it's the 12 weeks that the employee is irked over and the sole, underlying factor for her dismissal, then she can actually contact MOM and have them take action on her behalf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Women asking for more maternity leave are daft...they are just pricing themselves out of the market. As Shutterbug says, employers have a problem when faced with an employee away for 12 weeks. If you can afford to have an employee away for so long, then you probably should not have employed her in the first place. If you need such an employee, then you have to employ a temp for 12 weeks. After you have done all the hard work training the temp and if she can do the job just as well, are you going to sack her and re-orientate the previous worker when she returns from maternity leave?<br><br>If the law allows for maternity leave, employers will just sack them on the grounds of poor performance or refuse to employ newly married women of childbearing age.<br><br>And it is not just the employers...if you do not hire a temp and make the others work harder for 12 weeks, they will kpkb even if you pay them overtime.<br><br></div>
