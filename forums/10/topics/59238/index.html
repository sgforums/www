There is no way all the Arab countries combined can defeat Israel militarily with the IDF's power and American support.<br><br>By waging a low-level, high attrition (especially civilians) conflict, it will most likely ensure that the conflict is "brought home" to the Israeli public and eventually they will tire of the body-bags and try to search for peace.<br><br>If the Islamic Groups would renounce attacks in Israel itself, and restrict attacks to soldiers and civilians in the Occupied Territories, it will be the single most decisive move to swing the battle and world (and more importantly Israeli) opinion in their favour.</div>

The problem was he miscalculated on 2 counts<br><br>1) Believing Israel will give a lot more than they were prepared to give<br><br>2) Believing the pressure from the suicide bombers will result in Point 1. He looked the other way, and allowed the Islamic Groups to take over at grassroot level and improve their standing among the populace and carry out their activities, believing the "soft" Israeli public will demand more concessions to be given to Arafat when the toll got high enough. Unfortunately the reverse came true after he overplayed his hand, and hardened the Israeli public's stance and bringing upon hardliners like Bibi Netyanyahu and Sharon.<br><br>In a large way, Arafat brought this upon himself, but Sharon's actions are not blameless either</div>
