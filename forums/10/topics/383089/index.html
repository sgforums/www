              <p>I have been reading the TOC article and comments on the projection that born and bred Singaporeans may become the minority in our own land and this slogan "Vote For Change" keeps repeating on the various comments.<br><br>This slogan is repeated because many of the readers of TOC feels that the PAP's FT policy that opens the floodgate indiscriminately for foreigners to come into Singapore to work and suppress our wages are causing harm to the place. We have one of the most liberal emigration policy in the world. No other countries in the world open up their doors as wide open as ours.<br><br>One may argue that these are just emotional outbursts that only happen in the cyber world. However my recent experience on the ground indicate otherwise. Singaporeans from all walks of life, regardless of race and religion, have come up to me and complain about "foreigners" taking away their jobs. Even the coffeeshop auntie whisper to me how angry she is that some cheap foreign labor have been taking away jobs from Singaporeans like her. The underlying emotional pressures cannot be underestimated.<br><br>However, what is the thing exactly that we want to change? Prior to GE 2006, just before the Workers' Party published their manifesto, some of us were thinking of a catchy slogan for the manifesto which will become the theme of our main campaign during the elections. My wife and I have dealt with the theme of "CHANGE". After much discussion and deliberation, the theme "Change" though looks attractive and sound catchy, we decided that Singaporeans are not ready to stomach such "drastic" movement.<br><br>On hindsight, although the Workers' Party manifesto did bring up good policy views, but it just falls short of providing much revolutionary ideas that could be termed as "fundamental change" to the present socio-political-economic system. Most of the ideas were about tweaking the present system, though some of the ideas would mean a total revamp of policy directions. Thus in the end, I would have to agree to the slogan "You have the Choice" instead.<br><br>There are many dimensions to the concept of Change. As I have stated in my earlier postings, the fundamental pillars of a nation consist of Social, Economics, Culture and Politics. If anyone wants to call out for fundamental change to Singapore's development path, he will have to provide a central idea or ideology or Core Values as the fundamental guiding principles to deal with all the four pillars of this nation.<br><br>My personal political belief is Democratic Socialism and it has been the guiding principle for me in molding my policy views over a wide spectrum of issues. Although some would argue PAP is also founded on the ideology of Democratic Socialism but I would say that they have discarded such idealism long time ago. From my perspective, they are moving towards Ultra-capitalism instead. Thus, if I am going to use the concept of "Change", I would urge voters to Vote for Change, from the ultra-capitalism to the ideology of Democratic Socialism. However, in modern context, I was told that people no longer care about political ideologies any more.<br><br>Thus, I was quite puzzled about the "Change" that some Singaporeans are yearning for. Exactly what kind of changes are they talking about? From the TOC article and comments, it seems that the people there are hoping to change the FT policy so to eradicate the social-economic problems that comes with it. Or to change the ways that the whole government works? Changing the power structure within the parliament so that the ruling party would become more responsive, responsible and accountable to the people's wish?<br><br>If that is the case, we will be seeking bigger change than just voting more opposition members into parliament. The whole political system has to be revamped. I would champaign for a proportionate representation system for Singapore so that minority voices would not be ignored altogether in the process of policy and legislative parliamentary debates.<br><br>Changes that would bring more accountability and transparency within the government is a big theme that needs great courage from the voters to vote towards such transformation. Such changes are indeed necessary but to me, insufficient in terms of a total review of our national policy directions. But maybe our concerns back in 2005 is still valid, Singaporeans may accept certain pace of change but not a drastic one.<br><br>Interesting enough, this call for "Vote for Change" is initiated by somebody that would most probably call themselves "The Lost Generation". It is a simple term but invokes great depth of thinking.<br><br>Why "Lost"? The fear of being the minority in our own homeland may constitute to such label. We are lost because we have been overwhelmed by foreigners in our land. We are lost because we are helpless when job advertisement in our very own land actually discriminated against us, all of us Singaporeans, when they state categorically that only foreigners need to apply. Best of all, there is no law or rules that our elected government could apply and do something about it. We are lost in bewilderment when the minister in charge of labour would make the wild call for "Cheap, faster, better" workers while the ministers themselves would constantly justify why they need to be paid the MOST EXPENSIVE salaries in the world as ministers.<br><br>We are lost when the problems that foreign labour brought upon us as in cheap labour substitution and inflated HDB prices are not dealt with properly but on the other hand the government is more concern about Singaporeans not welcoming and integrating well with these foreigners in our homeland. It is strange when some of these foreign labour could not speak our "common language" Singlish/English while serving us in hawker centres and coffeeshops but instead, the burden of integration actually lies with us. We are lost when the government takes more care to the businesses instead of its people. GST increased just to reduce corporate taxes. Opening the floodgate for foreigners so that businesses could have cheaper labour substitutes.<br><br>Personally I am not all that anti-foreigners. But the situation becomes so absurd when the ruling party allows indiscriminately foreigners to flood our land with disregard to the fact that our infrastructure, public transport, healthcare, housing and public space could hardly cope with such influx. The problem does not lie with the foreigners but the government of the day. It is the ruling party who have open the floodgates and they should be made accountable for all the problems that are generated by this policy decision.<br><br>I guess the most important factor that created the Lost generation is the feeling of betrayal by the government with the series of policies that do not take care of them.<br><br>Vote for Change....and Accountability.</p>

              <p>xtreyier, why are you engaging in personal attacks against forum members? I always believe personal attacks are used when the user has no reason/logic/arguments left.</p>
              <p>I have to agree that jobs and foreigners are crucial to our survival in this world. However, I do not believe that the floodgates to FT/FW are regulated. I've not seen any clear-cut statistics and "criteria" on how they are being regulated. Do point me to your source of information.</p>
              <p>For example, just recently, a reporter from the Asian Sentinel was denied a visa extension without given any reason at all.</p>
              <p><strong>What we want to know is the "criteria" on the regulation</strong>. I read somewhere on the mainstream media that Singapore requires FT to survive. The article then proceed to mention that these FT have post-secondary education. I was confused. Post-secondary education = FT? I'm sure there are countless post-secondary Local Talent (LT) in Singapore then. Why are they here?</p>
              <p>FT/FW is important in that they fill roles that the locals are unable or unwilling to fill. <strong>Resentment would definitely be present if FT/FW start filling in roles that could have been filled by locals</strong>. I'm sure by now you would have know about various job advertisements that discriminate locals.</p>
              <p>As you have mentioned, we citizens are still in the majority. <strong>Yes, but for how long? How long before we will be overrun?</strong> I have no wish to see that happenning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mentioned that we are a small nation and we canot affor to make mistakes. <strong>Does this mean that the PAP government has not made any up to now?</strong></p>

              <p>xtreyier, why are you engaging in personal attacks against forum members? I always believe personal attacks are used when the user has no reason/logic/arguments left.</p>
              <p>I have to agree that jobs and foreigners are crucial to our survival in this world. However, I do not believe that the floodgates to FT/FW are regulated. I've not seen any clear-cut statistics and "criteria" on how they are being regulated. Do point me to your source of information.</p>
              <p>For example, just recently, a reporter from the Asian Sentinel was denied a visa extension without given any reason at all.</p>
              <p><strong>What we want to know is the "criteria" on the regulation</strong>. I read somewhere on the mainstream media that Singapore requires FT to survive. The article then proceed to mention that these FT have post-secondary education. I was confused. Post-secondary education = FT? I'm sure there are countless post-secondary Local Talent (LT) in Singapore then. Why are they here?</p>
              <p>FT/FW is important in that they fill roles that the locals are unable or unwilling to fill. <strong>Resentment would definitely be present if FT/FW start filling in roles that could have been filled by locals</strong>. I'm sure by now you would have know about various job advertisements that discriminate locals.</p>
              <p>As you have mentioned, we citizens are still in the majority. <strong>Yes, but for how long? How long before we will be overrun?</strong> I have no wish to see that happenning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mentioned that we are a small nation and we canot affor to make mistakes. <strong>Does this mean that the PAP government has not made any up to now?</strong></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Personal attacks? For calling a person what that person personally acknowledged and crown herself? LOL!</p>
              <p>Check out MOM website and do your own homework if you want sources. It's all readily avaliable.</p>
              <p>A member here once said, FTs' employment are dependent on their employer's choice. As long as they meet the criteria, they are hired.</p>
              <p>Discriminatory advertisements? How many are there? Enough to fill the classified ads or not? Do stop your generalizations based on the few to paint a bleak landscape to support your political agendas please. Singaporeans are not fools. Furthermore, since you are strongly against it, what have you done about it? Had you complained to the webmasters, the reciever of ads, MOM or your MP?</p>
              <p>Overrun by foreigners? Or are you just so elitist that you have no wish to share space with them who provide benefits for us? We are a tourist destination and there will ALWAYS be foreigners amongst us. 10 million of them per year. Before you complain, better check with our local SMEs, their families, their workers and their kids if these tourists are welcomed.</p>
              <p>Who dont make mistakes? No one is perfect. But do you prefer someone who made mistakes before, corrected it to steer the ship or do you want someone absolutely new, who is 'lost' and bewildered' to steer it?</p>
              <p>Hey, as I've said, its your choice, not mine, no need to get so uptight. will ya?</p>

              <p>Why will the dishonest X-rated Fraud conceal the only Singapore outlaw that live with a big lie - as the outlaw was a Japanese translator in the Japanese Occupation Force, and after WW2 had served those whom the X-rated Fraud brand as the - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/382285?page=2">‘"thieving british overloards” simply to get an education’ (*1) </a>?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Obviously, the vote of the X-rated Fraud is precious as it can hardly afford the toilet rolls for the turd that it produces each time it put its pseudo-intellect to work and result in its defecation.</p>
              <p>Can a X-rated Fraud even know who it is with its split personality led by its pseudo-intellect ?</p>
              <p>It is not a wonder that it will see the world around itself as being lost and bewildered.</p>

              <p>Obviously, the pseudo-intellect will indulge in its expertise to obfuscate itself and the debate by comparing the foreigners whom Singaporeans complained to be the 10 million tourists arriving per year.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the brilliance of the X-rated Fraud will want to limit its bankrupt arguments to the foreigners arriving as tourists, but will deliberately and disingeniously avoid to engage itself on those foreigners that arrive on our shores to compete for our jobs and depressed the wages to their levels.</p>
              <p>Somehow, in the characteristic imbecillic ways - the X-rated Fraud has again achieved the distinction of acheiving its X-rated Fraudulent intelligence bring its arguments on a wide circuituous route that ends with no further conclusions but only more controversies.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Who dont make mistakes? No one is perfect. But do you prefer someone who made mistakes before, corrected it to steer the ship or do you want someone absolutely new, who is 'lost' and bewildered' to steer it?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hypocrisy of the X-rated Fraud must have slipped up with its earlier post,  when it had loudly propounded that -</p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"We are a small nation and cannot afford to make mistakes."</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>This must be quite a remarkable transition from a X-rated Fraud known for its consistency in Double-XX itself.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does the X-rated Fraud provide any choice with its hollow statements ?</p>
              <p>If at all, the X-rated Fraud has no better abilities then to mislead the thread with its deceit and dishonesty.</p>
              <p>All that it can retort is with its childish and petulant display of verbiage, or with its better act of abandoning the thread with its deafening silence.</p>

              <p>Was everyone called an Outlaw ?</p>
              <p>Or has the X-rated pseudo-intellect have yet again proven itself to be poor in its reading abilities - that only ONE had been said loudly to have worked as a Japanese Translator during the Japanese Occupation, had also worked with those whom the X-rated pseudo-intellect had labelled as "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">thieving british overlords</span></em>" so as to get its education during the period before Singapore's independence ?</p>
              <p><br>It is rare that the resident X-rated Fraud will admit that there is only one famous, dangerous and devious Outlaw in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Can CSJ be an outlaw that can outclass THE Outlaw that the X-rated Fraud is besotted with - when The Outlaw had desperately trapped CSJ with all the devious means at its disposal ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, the X-rated Fraud must be truly an imbecile to Double-XX itself again to believe that CSJ can be standing equal to The Outlaw on the International Stage ?</p>
              <p>Can CSJ be more dangerous than The Outlaw - who is a survivor and know how to manipulate its own circumstances to survive as a Japanese Translator working for the Japanese Occupation Force, and after WW-2 - to work for those whom the X-rated Fraud will label as "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">thieving british overlords</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>The X-rated Fraud's sense of value and judgment seem to be misplaced again.</p>
              <p>Perhaps one shall leave it some room to claim that its words had been twisted to suit one's arguments that will debunk its X-rated Fraudulent positions ?</p>

              <p>You think LHL is not worry about is Ang Mo Kio ar?? Last time nearly lost ok. That's is why he is saying that he is retiring soon, and someone will take over, be it Vivan, or Rear Admiral Teo, these are people who citizen like them, Teo initiated reduction of army to 2 years, and Vivan is well liken by the youngs as he created alots of young activities. So as a voter, even if you dun like that sissy guy, you would think he will not be long there, so you voted the PAP. Actually it is all part of the PAP plan ya.</p>
              <p>As Foreign policy revamping, there is no way out, PAP knows that the ground sentiement on foreign is very low, if they dun do anything about it, opposition is going hit them so hard that they loose 1/2 of the seats in the parliament. It is also part of the plan ya. I bet, once they won by more 66.6%, foreign policey will open again. So, dun get tricked ya.</p>

              <p>You think LHL is not worry about is Ang Mo Kio ar?? Last time nearly lost ok. That's is why he is saying that he is retiring soon, and someone will take over, be it Vivan, or Rear Admiral Teo, these are people who citizen like them, Teo initiated reduction of army to 2 years, and Vivan is well liken by the youngs as he created alots of young activities. So as a voter, even if you dun like that sissy guy, you would think he will not be long there, so you voted the PAP. Actually it is all part of the PAP plan ya.</p>
              <p>As Foreign policy revamping, there is no way out, PAP knows that the ground sentiement on foreign is very low, if they dun do anything about it, opposition is going hit them so hard that they loose 1/2 of the seats in the parliament. It is also part of the plan ya. I bet, once they won by more 66.6%, foreign policey will open again. So, dun get tricked ya.</p>

              <p>The insufferable babbling of local politics of a Taiwanese "hum" reflects the verbiage of the street walker attempting to make an impression to satisfy its "attention seeking whorish" addiction.</p>

              <p><br>Unlike you that need your daily dose of attention and respect to your existence in this Speaker's Corner - do I need to seek the respect or attention from anyone here and in the same intensity as your Taiwanese "hum" ?</p>
              <p>Only a Taiwanese "hum" will know what is deep inside the women that you buy and sell in the flesh trade that you offer at your Bar.</p>
              <p>Does anyone need you to educate anyone about the lives and history of those whom you offer in your flesh trade ?</p>
              <p>As was mentioned so many times, it is better that you show off your expertise with irrelevance in the Bar forum, instead of being a prick with your clitoris stuck out of your "hum" to draw attention to yourself as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>
