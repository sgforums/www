              <p><br>Unlike you that need your daily dose of attention and respect to your existence in this Speaker's Corner - do I need to seek the respect or attention from anyone here and in the same intensity as your Taiwanese "hum" ?</p>
              <p>Only a Taiwanese "hum" will know what is deep inside the women that you buy and sell in the flesh trade that you offer at your Bar.</p>
              <p>Does anyone need you to educate anyone about the lives and history of those whom you offer in your flesh trade ?</p>
              <p>As was mentioned so many times, it is better that you show off your expertise with irrelevance in the Bar forum, instead of being a prick with your clitoris stuck out of your "hum" to draw attention to yourself as an "Attention Seeking Whore".</p>

                  fill the classified ads or not? Do stop your generalizations based
                  on the few to paint a bleak landscape to support your political
                  agendas please. Singaporeans are not fools. Furthermore, since you
                  are strongly against it, what have you done about it? Had you
                  complained to the webmasters, the reciever of ads, MOM or your
                  MP?</p>
              <p>Overrun by foreigners? Or are you just so elitist that you
                  have no wish to share space with them who provide benefits for us?
                  We are a tourist destination and there will ALWAYS be foreigners
                  amongst us. 10 million of them per year. Before you complain,
                  better check with our local SMEs, their families, their workers and
                  their kids if these tourists are welcomed.</p>
              <p>Who dont make mistakes? No one is perfect. But do you prefer
                  someone who made mistakes before, corrected it to steer the ship or
                  do you want someone absolutely new, who is 'lost' and bewildered'
                  to steer it?</p>
              <p>Hey, as I've said, its your choice, not mine, no need to get so

              <p>Let me draw you an analogy, the massacre of the Jews did not take place over a single day. It started one small step at a time. They were first required to display the Star of David. Then they were denied exit from the country. Then...</p>

              <p>Example 1: A couple visited a MP after their elder son died in the Navy. They wanted to defer NS for their second child. "After 2 months you guys should have got over it already." That very MP said something like this.</p>

              <p>There are also cases of MPs being burnt, threathened or scolded. Why?</p>
              <p>You claimed that I'm an elitist when I have already acknowledged the fact that Singapore needs FW/FT. As I've said earlier, which you have failed to read, they are needed to fill in positions that the locals are unable or unwilling to do.</p>
              <p>Is this the case now? They are taking every single job, from the lowest to the highest ranks. My issue is this, not with the tourist, why bring them in?</p>
              <p>Yes everyone make mistakes, but do they pay for it?</p>
              <p>Back during the Mas Selamat incident, Mr Wong said "I'm sorry" and it was settled. He will probably have a pay rise this year.</p>
              <p>No doubt they have "corrected it to steer the ship" but after how long? How long did it take for MM Lee to say that 2 languages was a mistake? How long did it take for them to realize that "stop at 2" is going to have a deterimental effects on Singapore.</p>
              <p>Now, how long would it take them to realize that importing massive number of FW/FT is going to demoralize the locals and dilute the culture?</p>
              <p>You mentioned that someone absolutely new would be "lost and bewildered'
                                          to steer the ship". Back when the PAP was the opposition did anyone said this. How woud Singapore know until they are given a chance. As far as I'm concern, the current adminstration is not steering the ship well either.</p>

              <p> At least, the pseudo-intellectual had tried to be honest by Double-XX itself to claim that if it had continued with its reply - it will have to resort to statements that will be "churlish" for your mind.</p>
              <p>In other simpler words, its statements will be vulgar, boorish as so befitting of a loser in the X-rated Fraud who will certainly act in the most churlish ways when it is exposed for its imbecilic ways.</p>
              <p>Ironically, despite being hammered across several threads, its "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">mind is already cast in stone, its belief system totally locked to blaming someone or some party, instead of opening up to see the bigger and longer term view</span></em>".</p>
              <p>Do not be surprised with the irony that what it had stated will fit itself like a condom fits so neatly and tightly on its head that is no bigger then its little dickie.</p>

              <p>As usual, the pseudo-intellect will be hypocritical to claim that "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">you are entitled to your own opinions, and so too are others in our free society</span></em>" - so long as it does not contradict its position taken by its Master's Tail that wags its doggone X-rated body.</p>
              <p>It is quite pointless to be serious with a "self-admitted" insignificant and unimportant pseudo-intellect, and it is doubtful if anyone will even be bothered to pass judgment on a X-rated Fraud suffering from its <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span></span>ttention <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></span>eeking <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></span>yndrome</strong> - to be an <strong>ASS</strong> in every department that it undertakes.</p>
