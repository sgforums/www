              <p>It's still an excuse. I participated in 4 CCAs in JC, so I'm very sure if you participate in less than 4, you will definitely have more time. I know lots of pple who still do well even though they travel far.</p>
              <p>If JC's travelling time is too long and you live in the east, you will die when you go local uni. It is hard to survive anywhere with a self-defeating mentality; declaring defeat before even completing.</p>

              <p>I have two questions.</p>
              <p>Imagine we have a pair of twins, both with exactly equal intelligence. One enters JC while the other enters poly. Assuming both of them works equally hard, do both of them have equal chance of entering a university?</p>
              <p>Second question. Will poly students be more inclined to slack due to peer pressure? I ask this because people who enter JC has already got a single focused goal of wanting to qualify for university, while not everyone who enters a poly has got such goal. Besides, in JC, we have one ultra-super-duper-major exam in which everyone will be very motivated to chiong towards (A'level), while in poly, there is no such major exam.</p>

              <p>It is just how you train your brain; doesn't mean twins will do equally well, and how motivated you are to do so. Too many factors are involved.</p>
              <p>Btw, I have a friend. After O levels he went ITE, then he worked very hard and qualified for poly. During poly, he worked hard, and is now in NUS, graduating same time as me. This story just further strengthened my belief that one should never adopt a self-defeatist attitude.</p>

              <p><br>Good for them then. Somehow, I will end up falling sick rather often while I was studying in JC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Out of a week, I will have 2-3 days of MC due to fever. And being sick so often, I started to lag behind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some people can easily understand what the teachers are teaching about, not for me though. My learning ability in not as strong as other people though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps MI would be a better choice for me in the first place...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've travelled to places like NUS and etc before, and my travelling time to the uni is not as bad as me travelling to my JC...and doesn't people coming from JC background ususally find uni to be much slacker compared to JC?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh well, anyway, I think we should make the poly standard much higher though. Most of the time our government is saying that our only resources is human talent...so we might as well raise the poly standard to be comparable to foreign universities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unlike last time, there has been more and more people who can enter JC choosing to go to poly instead. So perhaps it's time to make poly harder?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, I thought germany diploma standard is bascially singapore's Master degree standard right? If that's the case, we should ensure that singapore diploma can considered as a degree standard in our neighbouring countries.</p>

              <p>For me, i took the jc route instead of poly route. I choose jc route becos i wanna cont to study the maths and physics subjects as i have interest in maths. then i got into nus mechanical engineering. i nvr regret choosing the jc route and the mechanical eng route. i am now working as an engineer in some company.</p>
              <p>actually there's not much difference choosing which route to go. if u choose jc route, u have to work hard to make sure u get into a local uni, or else ur efforts are watsed as A lvl cert is useless.</p>
              <p>if u choose poly route, u must be sure which course u really like and work hard and from there go into uni to cont the same course, like that u r more valuable than a A lvl student who gets into uni.</p>
              <p>if i were to choose the poly route back then, i would definitely choose mechanical engineering and cont this in nus. impt thing is to be clear of what u want in life and have a aim and work towards achieving that aim.</p>

              <p>The thinking skills students incalcated are different in the 2 different institution.</p>
              <p>Poly students are taught trade necessities in their respective fields with some modules available for them to learn peripheral skills that are outside their major requirements. Most importantly, subjects taught in poly were aimed for the students to gain immediate employment after graduating with the trade skills.</p>
              <p>JC students are taught the basic for an academic pursue in the university. Thats the reason why they place importance on subjects like GP and KI which focuses on academic reasoning together with core subjects which gives them basic footing in University when they choose to go into the depth of that subject.</p>
              <p>The reason why there is such a difference is because both institutions were created for different purposes. One is to create workers with technical or trade skills to meet the market's and industries' demand and the other is to create students that are capable of pursueing academic further studies and with their future university degree, they meet another kind of demand.</p>
              <p>Since poly graduates were not meant for the university route here, it is in my opinion the reason why is it harder for a poly student to enter a local university. But definitely poly students with excellent grades wont be left out of the chance of entering a local university and have the same education as their JC counterparts.</p>

              <p>both insituition has it own advantage.. They only different is a good A level get you a more secured place in the uni whilst ploy student has to get GPA above 3.5 to secured a place.. A level is single examination while ploy is based to GPA accumunlated in 3 years( if you flung during a particular semester you GPA will suffer) . So what stand a better chance in getting into uni ?</p>
              <p>Another point is most subject and modules are very similar to secondary school while ploy student has to adapt into a totally never course eg, for business student to study accounting , laws</p>

              <p>If we are to look at examples like Bill Gates who went to University and dropped out in the 2nd year and later became a highly successful businessman you will get the answer to this question - is the university path the best for yourself.</p>
              <p>Many a time, when a student asks this question he is unsure of himself what kind of education should he pursue and what kind of life shall he lead even as he is reaching 18 of age.</p>
              <p>That lack of clarity of his educational or career direction itself shows that many students were not able to determine his own education or career path due probably to lack of passion or objective.</p>
              <p>So the answer is does a person possess enough of passion or objective as to what he or she wants for his own life.</p>
              <p>The passion or objective a person has holds the key to his own future.</p>
              <p>If by 18 when he is still unable to decide on this goal, he will most likely to end up just receiving an education whether at university or poly or ITE level for education or academic reason to improve himself and his knowledge or literacy. That is all.</p>
              <p>In Bill Gates, we find a person who upon reaching adulthood has already somewhere somehow found a passion or objective as to what he wants to do with his career or life.</p>
              <p>He has already carved out an interest in wanting to develop a software for computer which will become the universal software platform for every computer. Before that softwares were too anarchic or random each offering its own uniqueness unable to offer a common platform to be used on every computer. Ever come across older operating systems like the original apple plus. They were not easy at all to boot up and get around. A window with a row of button to click and sub-button to navigate until one reach the right choice of what one wants to do is the solution.</p>
              <p>There were so many computer operating softwares as they were management systems and given such individualistic trend of thought in inventing of system to serve men, the world is divided and anarchic.</p>
              <p>Political leadership or system is another good example of individualism with each one claiming its own advantages keeping silent on its own faults so the world or students are confused and unable to decide what is best suited to his own life or career.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A universal process management called Objective-Steps Processing Management System has been tested to be working to serve all management platform. Will people ever care to learn how to think independently to treat education as a means to the development of passion or personal objective without which education at best is only a piece of paper qualification or passport to get around without necessarily making the person a creative individual which he has to be in whatever field he wants to be successful in.</p>
              <p>He is asked to answer this question instead: is he persistent and passionate in something. If he is when he goes to Poly he may be just as good or better than going to university. Only society makes us go for university because society works on external image more than intrinsic values.</p>

              <p>Much of it is just following the trend, I believe.</p>
              <p>It's come to the point where it's "cool" to go to a poly rather than a JC. I believe that initially it was an honest intention by someone to do what was right for them, but as usual the world thinks that daring to be different alone makes them cool, and they follow suit.</p>
              <p>Personally, between JC and poly I would still rather opt for JC.</p>
              <p>However in reality... I'm going to neither!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The better students may want to take 4 H2 subjects or even H3 subjects which are sometimes not offered in college and they have to went all the way down to NUS to study.</p>

              <p>Correct me if I am wrong...but there HAS been an increasing trend whereby people are going in to poly with the intention of going to UNI.</p>

              <p>In fact, there are TONs of people who can make it to very good JC choosing to go to poly instead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why do you think that it is more or less a requirement for a person to score 20 points at the most for their L1B4 just to get into poly?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Getting a degree is starting to be seen as a basic educational level requirement before you proceed to work.</p>
