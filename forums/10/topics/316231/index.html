              <p><br>He's right. Its all propaganda campaign by the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Below is just my opinion:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The government will keep posting news on how more and more pple are choosing poly over jc and soon more will go poly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only those who are still unsure of what courses to take or those who are incredibly strong in their science or arts subjects will continue in a jc. Here's what the government wants:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Those who are academically strong and have strong passion in science and arts will get to continue their rigorous training in the subjects in a jc. Others get to do more practical courses in poly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Government/private organisations can earn more money if students go the poly route to uni.</p>

The thing though is, is it all government propaganda? i mean some students and to put it truthfully even i myself had a mindset that polytechnic was going to be easier than junior college and all these crazy ideas were from friends even some adults. Maybe it could be that there really are some important benefits which polytechnics have over junior colleges that make them attractive? If you guys have any ideas of any please do type it out here.

              <p>In poly you will have more control over your time, in fact you will have complete control. Me being a poly graduate, can tell you the poly life is happiest period of my life, you actually have lots of time to pursue you own hobbies.</p>
              <p>But bear in mind if you ever wanted a degree, it'll be hard for us poly grad, in  my time abt top 10% pass through local uni, I dunno abt now... Also the top students are made up of quite a number of foreigners, so becareful. If you are willing to work hard, and not succumb to the idly student life, then I tink u can consider the poly path.</p>
              <p>If your goal is to get a degree in NUS, I suggest the JC route.</p>
              <p>Anyway I never regretted taking the poly route, I got alot more than 10yrseries answers...</p>

              <p>In poly you will have more control over your time, in fact you
              will have complete control. Me being a poly graduate, can tell you
              the poly life is happiest period of my life, you actually have lots
              of time to pursue you own hobbies.</p>

              <p>at least for engineering, those who did the JC path will have more time in Uni to complete their coursework as compared to those who did the poly path.</p>
              <p>Compare 2 years of lack of time in jc vs 3 years of lack of time for your final degree (poly to uni path into uni)</p>

              <p>here's my opinion on the subject matter, background info i'm a student in Business Management NYP who was able to enter a mid-tier JC ( eg Anderson JC )  .</p>
              <p>In regards to why i chose the poly path, this was due to factors such as my aunt  teaching in the school of business at NYP,</p>
              <p>the fact that the course was modelled to expose students to a much more colourful business world ( think 4 months of in-house attachment in the 2nd year and another long attachment in year 3, as far as I know it gives me an edge over JC students coming in the form of larger work experience gathered from my 3 years in Polytechnic and knowing that a GPA of  3.5 would be a sure-fire way at a business course in Uni ) ,</p>
              <p>me wanting to pursue a business course as i felt that it is the most practical (business can get u anywhere) in today's society,</p>
              <p>the close proximity of NYP from my house,</p>
              <p>grants me the freedom to manage my time efficiently since i had the time to balance tutorials,cca's and most importantly , friends. This was a stone's throw away from the curriculum in JC as subjects are far more rigorous in comparison to Polytechnic modules. Imagine i didn't had the MOOD to complete my JC tutorials during my first 3 months in JC and completing the tutorials didn't granted me the satisfaction i crave for since I knew it isn't PRACTICAL at all ( maths anyone ? )</p>
              <p>being in a polytechnic, it's like lost in a colouful world i get to meet sporty people from Sports and Wellness, turn around and i get to interact wif  aspiring nurses from the nursing course, walk into Koufu and i bump into technocrats from the engineering and IT courses. This sums up colourful student population I witnessed in NYP</p>
              <p>and last of all , yes i get to wear my collar tees and bermudas in poly </p>

              <p>I think they teach too much worthless subjects in JC.</p>

              <p>Best three years of my life so far.</p>
              <p>I was politicised during my poly years.</p>
              <p>If I was in a JC, I would probably be too busy studying worthless subjects to be politicised.</p>
              <p>That would mean I would still be hoodwinked by PAP propaganda and vote for them.</p>
