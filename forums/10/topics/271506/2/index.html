They did not even shot a bullet or laser. They used Decepticons to destroy earth from the inside out. First, alliens offered lots of 'dog biscuits' to a high position Decepticon (appear like AutoBot but actually a Decepticon 'robot in disguise'. Some others were put under duress to become agents for the aliens and in return, they get tons of 'dog biscuits'.<br><br>To preserve their lives, decepticons betrayed their own decepticons and even sabo and sacrificed the lives of Autobots.<br><br>When it comes to 'dog biscuits' , some decepticons will kill even their own kinds in order to preserve their lives. Thus, to destroy Earth was relatively easy. Just offer the highest number of dog biscuits to Decepticons Mercenaries and they will start killing their own kind and of course the kind and righteous AutoBots.<br><br>When I woke up from this nightmare, I realised how wars can be won and nations destroyed using no bullets nor nuclear but 'dog biscuits'.<br><br>Sorry, for my rumblings.

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets recap what I posted earlier:<br><br>========================<br><strong>Aged: Penniless in a land of plenty<br>(The Star) </strong><br><br>23 July 2007 by Seah Chiang Nee<br>For many elderly folk, Singapore is a tough place to live in. Many senior citizens just do not have the skills for the modern economy.<br>WITH better living, Singaporeans are enjoying one of AsiaÂ’s longest life expectations, averaging 82 years Â– but itÂ’s not everyoneÂ’s cause for celebration.<br>In fact, for half the retirees with insufficient Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings, it could be a terrible burden. Singapore is also one of the regionÂ’s most expensive cities to retire in.<br><br>The government obviously sees the downside of a citizen who retires at 62 and lives for two decades without any income.<br><br>Last week, it served notice of its intention to push the retirement age by three years to 65. In fact, where possible, it prefers citizens to carry on working until 70.<br><br>However, there is some contention over the prospect of a delay in the withdrawal of the minimum CPF savings from 62 to 65. .<br><br>CPF is the republicÂ’s mandatory retirement fund in which a member can withdraw a portion at 55, but has to leave behind a minimum sum. From this, he or she receives a monthly payout from age 62.<br><br>This sum now stands at S$96,000 (RM220,800) and must be gradually topped up to S$120,000 (RM276,000) by 2013.<br><br>Â“I think it is quite reasonable to raise it to 65 if our objective is to raise the employment rate of this group of people,Â” said the minister overseeing issues on ageing, Lim Boon Heng.<br><br>He is apparently preparing the people for the inevitable.<br><br>Twenty-five years ago when retirement and the CPF withdrawal age was 55, it was a different world. At that time life expectation was 70 years, 12 years less, so a change comes as no surprise.<br><br>Public reaction has been strong. CPF is one of the most cherished things in a SingaporeanÂ’s life, and any talk of delaying withdrawal is bound to bring out strong emotions.<br><br>(In the 1984 general elections, the governmentÂ’s vote fell by a hefty 12.4% just because of a rumour that repayment would be delayed beyond 55.)<br><br>It is understandable. For many elderly folk, Singapore is a tough place to live in. In the first place, many do not have the skills for the modern economy.<br><br>After a lifetime of work, they want to take charge of their savings and spend it as they wish. The trouble is that while the majority is financially conservative, others make a mess of it and get into trouble.<br><br>Many are simply not capable of managing such a large fund on their own. Either they become fair game for cheats or they gamble or spend lavishly on wine or women.<br><br>Â“When the money is gone, they become homeless or penniless, cursing the government for not looking after them,Â” said a small businessman.<br><br>A year ago I met a weeping gentleman in a hospital room being consoled by two nurses. A China woman whom he had befriended had cheated him of S$60,000 (RM138,000) of his CPF savings, he told the nurses.<br><br>In a fast-paced city very much preoccupied with the bottom line, the elderly get less respect and care than they deserve. In failing health and overwhelmed by SingaporeÂ’s new technologies, many are still toiling in menial work.<br><br>Liberal-minded Singaporeans decry two perceived wrongs. First, senior citizens are given only the minimum level of government financial help considering the stateÂ’s enormous wealth.<br><br>Second, they resent the governmentÂ’s control on peopleÂ’s retirement money.<br><br>Â“Something must be fundamentally wrong with society if one cannot retire after working for 30 to 40 years,Â” exclaimed a young professional.<br><br>Unlike in many western countries, Singapore has little or no social security or welfare. These factors partly explain the cityÂ’s low birth rates.<br><br>Living in a highly competitive nation has helped to turn Singaporeans into some of the most pessimistic people in the region when it comes to retirement savings.<br><br>The Thais have the most sanguine feelings about retirement, according to a survey by American International Assurance (AIA).<br><br>Some 61% of Thais believe they will have sufficient funds to retire, based on current savings patterns.<br><br>This contrasts with just 24% of those surveyed in Hong Kong, 47% in Malaysia and 27% in Singapore.<br><br>While the government wants people to work longer, until 70, many Singaporeans actually want to quit earlier.<br><br>A study by a financial protection player, AXA Group, showed that Singaporeans, on average, consider the ideal retirement age as 54, the earliest among the 15 countries surveyed.<br><br>Those in Hong Kong, Canada and Australia would opt to retire at 55, while the Japanese want to wait till they are 61.<br><br>The ruling PeopleÂ’s Action Party constitution still declares it as a Â“democratic socialistÂ” party, but in the past 40 years, the Â“socialistÂ” part of it has been in decline.<br><br>For their part, Singaporeans are learning to depend less on the government for their needs, including jobs and cheap public services<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>"You go down New York, Broadway. You will see the beggars, people of the streets...Where are the beggars in Singapore? Show me."<br>Lee Kuan Yew</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>The Tuth About Poverty</strong><br><br>THERE IS THIS MYTH THAT Singapore is a rich country and its citizens are well-taken care of. Nothing could be further from the truth. The 1998 United Nations Human Development Index showed that Singapore ranked 28 on the list behind countries like Barbados and Malta.<br><br>In fact many households earn so little that they cannot afford to give their children pocket-money for school, resulting in the students going hungry for the day. The following is a snapshot of some of the more recent cases uncovered:<br><br>In 1999, nearly 2,000 children did not attend school because their parents could not afford it. Mohammad Hirwan is one such child. His parents earn about US $600 a month, hardly sufficient for a family in Singapore. As a result the boy\'s parents had to take him out of school when he was nine. His siblings did not fare any better. All of them dropped out of school because of poverty.<br><br>A technician lost his job and had no income for about half a year had to watch his two young children live on biscuits for days. A social worker said that the man had no money even to take the bus to find a job. The family was literally penniless.<br><br>A man with a wife who suffered from manic depression, asthma and diabetes had to stay home to look after her. Whenever he found some contract work, his children took turns to skip school to watch over her. The family had to survive on US$200 a month they received from welfare organizations.<br><br>A young divorcee cannot find enough money to but schoolbooks and food for her children. Most days, by 10pm, her sons ask if there is any more food. They cannot afford to eat and live mainly on fried rice.<br><br>The elderly poor in Singapore lead just as tragic lives. Many have to, literally, work until they die:<br><br>An elderly woman in her seventies was fatally run over by a hit-and-run driver as she was returning home at 6:40 am, working as a night-shift toilet cleaner. Not only did the elderly lady have to toil in the night shift, her pay was so meagre that she could not even afford to eat lunch. To top it off she had to save to help take care of her 50-year old mentally retarded daughter.<br><br>Another septuagenarian woman worked as cleaner for a measly US$200 a month which she had to share with her 70-year-old sister. The sisters are so hard-up that even vegetables during meal-times are a luxury.<br><br>A 77-year-old toilet cleaner was on his way home around midnight after work. He couldn't afford the fare for a bus ride and had to walk home. He was hit and killed by a car.<br><br>A 96-year-old woman has to go to the garbage dump to pick out odds and ends to sell to support herself.<br><br>A 76-year-old man ran a little business selling household provisions. His paltry income had to support middle-aged daughters who are wheelchair bound and suffering from polio since birth, and a wife who is senile and incapable of looking after herself. His problems took a dramatic turn for the worse when the Government upped the rental of his shop from US$150 to US$450 a month.<br><br>Below are some statistical indicators of the poor in Singapore:<br><br>In 1999 monthly <strong>wages for low-skilled workers decreased by as much as 34 percent. </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Nearly 30 percent of households were not earning enough to afford the minimum standard of living.</span> The Government estimates that the subsistence level in Singapore is US$600 for a household of four peopleÂ—a conservative figure for a country that is <span style="color: red;">consistently ranked among the most expensive cities in the world to live in. </span><br><br>Between 1998 and 1999, the average household monthly income of <span style="color: red;">the poorest 10 percent of the population decreased by nearly 50 percent</span>. The following year, the figure nose-dived by <span style="color: red;">another 54 percent. </span><br><br>In 1990, the richest 10 percent of households earned <span style="color: red;">15.6 times </span>more than the poorest 10 percent. (Households with no income-earners are excluded from this category.) By 2000, the <span style="color: red;">gap widened</span>: <strong>the richest 10 percent earned 36 times more than the poorest 10 percent. </strong><br><br>The number of households with <strong>monthly incomes of less than $3,000 </strong>was <span style="color: red;">40 percent in 1998 but increased to 42 percent in 1999. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">According to the 2000 Census, 12.6 per cent of households earned less than $1,000 per month. A monthly gross total household income of $1,500 and below is considered Â“poorÂ” in Singapore. </span><br><br>A more recent survey found that 16 per cent of the respondents had family members who often went hungry.<br><br><span style="color: red;">In 2004 37,823 households </span>could <span style="color: red;">not afford to buy their own flats or rent homes in the open market. </span><br>Because of the system, an increasing number of Singaporeans are driven to seek the help of mental professionals:<br><br>In 1990 there were 88,000 such cases. <span style="color: red;">This figure escalated to 147,000 in 1998. </span><br>In 1990 only <span style="color: red;">8.4 percent of Singaporeans suffered from neurotic disorders such as anxiety and depression</span>. <strong>In 1998 16.6 percent succumbed to these disorders</strong>. (<strong>This problem continues into the present with a newspaper report highlighting that more people are being diagnosed with mental disorders due to financial woes</strong>.)<br><br>In 1997, psychiatrists noted a sharp increase in the number of teenagers attempting suicide and attributed the phenomenon to the youths being alienated from their parents. <span style="color: red;">The main reason cited is the stressful lifestyle and high cost of living. </span><br><br>In 1999, a consumer health survey found that among the various Asian societies, Singaporeans are most likely to have suffered depression, stress, and fatigue. In addition, <span style="color: red;">job-related stresses continue to be the biggest problems for working Singaporeans</span>.<br><br>In 2003, a study found that Singaporeans aged between <span style="color: red;">20 and 49 years made up 70 percent of suicide cases from 1997 to 2001</span>. They also constitute the main bulk of cases of attempted suicides.<br><br>Between 1994 and 1998 the number of divorces shot up from <strong>3,772 to 5,651 cases. </strong><br><br><strong>Social workers attribute this occurrence to intense stress experienced by workers who have households, children and aging parents to take care.</strong> National figures compiled by the Registry of Births and Deaths show that on average, <span style="color: red;">1 person takes his/her own life in Singapore every day</span>.<br><br>Visitors often remark about the tidiness and orderliness of Singapore. It is because of such an impression that makes the cases of poverty described in the earlier paragraphs so hard to believe.<br><br>The reason why the poor in Singapore are not more visible is that the Ministry of Community Development and Sports conduct <strong>frequent raids through its Destitute Persons Service</strong>, <span style="color: red;">looking for and picking up vagrants</span>. <strong>If Singapore seems to have less destitute,</strong> <span style="color: red;">it is not because the numbers are not present</span>. The real reason is that the <strong><span style="color: red;">PAP Government is just much more efficient in clearing the streets of homeless people.[/</span>b]<br><br>For all the hype claiming that Singapore is a near-paradise, <span style="color: red;">20 percent </span>of its citizens indicated that they want to <span style="color: red;">leave the country</span>, predominantly because of the [b]<span style="color: red;">stressful lifestyle and high cost of living</span></strong>. <strong>These would-be Ã©migrÃ©s are mainly from the strata of younger, higher-income professionals</strong>.<br><br><strong>With the costs of living rising, or at least not decreasing, and wages continuing to be depressed, Singaporeans are going to facing increasingly dire economic times. Without any rights, their problems will persist. </strong><br></div>
