In their search for food that does not disturb the yin-yang balance, many stop or reduce consumption of certain foods or avoid an entire food group."<br><br>While it is important for the elderly to be comfortable with their food choices, they should also be provided with nutritious options in a form that they will consume, she said.<br><br>According to Dr Stephanie Chee, a geriatrician and healthcare management consultant with Geylang and Toa Payoh Senior Citizen's Health Care Centres, it is relatively easy to spot a malnourished elderly individual.<br><br>"You can determine whether an elderly is malnourished by doing some blood tests, but usually you'll know by looking at the person," she said. An example would be Mr Lee, who, by a twist of fate, was referred to Geylang Senior Citizen's Health Care Centre by a social worker after being diagnosed with cancer of the stomach.<br><br>"When he (Mr Lee) first came to us, it was obvious that he was undernourished. He looked very frail and his movements were very slow due to lethargy, one of the symptoms of malnutrition," said Dr Chee. To prepare him, the centre's staff increased his nutritional and caloric intake by putting him on a structured meal and nutrition program.<br><br>He was also given additional nutritional and vitamin supplements.<br><br>One and a half years later, Mr Lee is nothing like his frail former self. Despite his illness, the sprightly old man has put on some weight, is able to take leisurely walks using his walking frame and is always in high spirits.<br><br>Ultimately, Dr Chee feels that combating malnutrition amongst the elderly should not be a one-off approach. Besides supplying the elderly with a healthy and balanced diet, caregivers should also ensure that they are kept mentally and physically healthy.<br><br>"Malnutrition is only one of the growing problems amongst the elderly in Singapore.<br><br>"Care for elderly should be holistic. Generally, if they're happy people, then such problems would not exist anymore," she said.<br><br>A nutritious, inexpensive diet for the elderly consists of:<br><br>Normal diet<br><br>Breakfast 1 cup coffee/tea prepared with milk or 1 cup nutritional supplement 1 whole meal bread sandwich with peanut butter Snack 1 small raisin bun Lunch 1 bowl noodle soup with fish slices and green leafy vegetable 1 wedge watermelon Snack 1 bowl red bean soup Dinner 1 bowl meat and vegetable soup 1 bowl cooked rice 1 palm-sized portion chicken 3/4 cup cooked vegetables 1 apple<br><br>Soft diet<br><br>Breakfast 1 glass soy milk 1 bowl oatmeal porridge prepared with milk Snack 1small bowl tau huay Lunch 1 bowl mee sua with minced fish and chopped spinach 1 wedge papaya Snack 1 cup nutritional supplement Dinner 1 bowl meat and vegetable soup 1 bowl rice porridge 1 palm-sized portion finely minced chicken/meat 3/4 cup minced vegetables, 1 banana - TODAY<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/health/view/152643/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/health/view/152643/1/.html</a>[/b]</blockquote>So has the Swiss standard of living which this regime shamelessly professed to aspire to fallen to such abject standards that actually command a daily wage of just SGD25?<br><br>Or are some despots simply disconnected from reality and unable to comprehend how far daily wages averaging SGD25 is lightyears away from the average USD19.50 hourly wage in Geneva?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
