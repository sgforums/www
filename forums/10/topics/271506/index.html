Educate people I know that we as democratic citizens have the responsibility for our own future and should contribute  our own effort in<br>realising this.  If we fail to achieve this, if we kpkb again, we must admit that we are also partly responsible for the situation.<br><br>2.

What you want is what you can expect to get. If you fail to expect, you simply will not get what you want. As simple as that.<br><br>3. Admit that no matter how tough is the situation, how mission impossible the situation appears to be, everything is actually ultimately in the hands of<br>the PEOPLE. The people should be encouraged to believe in themselves and what they can do.  If our country is not a democracy, what I said will not make sense. But it is.

Indeed sir, in fact, statistically speaking, the fact that 66% of the people who voted, voted for the PAP is telling. It is indeed a large enough sample size for us to gauge the general feel of the population and indeed a lot of people support the government one way or another.<br><br>2.

I think the reality is quite bleak no matter how we look at it. The PAP is well entrenched with the heads of the civil service supporting it near completely, it is hard to find some way to break the Govt's hold on the truth.

You need me on that wall. We use words like honor, code, loyalty...we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline.
