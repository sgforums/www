So that the govt that will be form, gathered the most votes, as well as knowing their stand in parts of singapore so that they can do more things for the citizens.

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think it a good idea because firstly you are not living in that district and that made you don't have the right to determine who should be in charge of that district. (Example: What will the people in Queensland state in Aust think if the people from Victoria state get involve with their voting? Doesn't make sense rite?).<br><br>Secondly, it will be sabotaging the other district residents and current MP as in you are putting the fault of your district MP on another MP which is not justified. Also if that district resident prefer certain MP but due to the interference from ppl in other districts and ended up losing their "belove" MP do you think it fair to them?<br><br>Lastly, isn't it better to pester (or whatever you call it) your district MP if you think that he/she is not doing their job or not caring for you all. Also if we are able to vote for MP in other district, why not group all the districts into one and all of us can vote for which person shouold be the MP to lead the "unified" district then there won't be hot or cold district anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My bad and sincere apology to you. Well if that the case maybe you should suggest to your constitution on having quaterly, halfly or yearly feedback from residents so as to know what is their thought. This maybe a better choice since if let say a district that was not contested but their MP got voted out then who gonna take charge of it and ended up more confusion isn't it?<br><br>I think overall it depend on how pro-active the residents and MP are willing to go. If not many ppl willing to give constructive suggestions, i think no matter which MP is leading that district it will be the same. And afterall it take two hand to clap.</div>
