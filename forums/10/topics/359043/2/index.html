              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the military level in Western Civilization in
                  the twentieth century the chief development has been <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a steady increase
                  in the complexity and the cost of weapons.</strong></span></p>
              <p>When weapons are cheap to
                  get and so easy to use that almost anyone can use them after a short
                  period of training, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>armies are generally made up of large masses of
                  amateur soldiers.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Such weapons we call "amateur weapons," and such
                  armies we might call <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"mass armies of citizen-soldiers."</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Age of
                  Pericles in Classical Greece and the nineteenth century in Western
                  Civilization were periods of amateur weapons and citizen-soldiers.</p>
              <p>But
                  the nineteenth century was preceded (as was the Age of Pericles also)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> by a period in which weapons were expensive and required long training
                  in their use.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Such weapons we call "specialist" weapons. Periods of
                  specialist weapons are generally<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> periods of small armies of
                  professional soldiers (usually mercenaries).</strong></span></p>
              <p>In a period of specialist
                  weapons the minority who have such weapons can usually force the
                  majority who lack them to obey; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>thus a period of specialist weapons
                  tends to give rise to a period of minority rule and authoritarian
                  government.</strong></span></p>
              <p>But a period of amateur weapons is a period in<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> which all
                  men are roughly equal in military power</strong></span>, a majority can compel a
                  minority to yield, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and majority rule or even democratic government
                  tends to rise.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The medieval period in which the best weapon was usually
                  a mounted knight on horseback (clearly a specialist weapon) was a
                  period of minority rule and authoritarian government.</p>
              <p>Even when the
                  medieval knight was made obsolete (along with his stone castle) by the
                  invention of gunpowder and the appearance of firearms, these new
                  weapons were so expensive and so difficult to use (until 1800) that
                  minority rule and authoritarian government continued even though that
                  government sought to enforce its rule by shifting from mounted knights
                  to professional pike-men and musketeers.</p>
              <p>But after 1800, guns became
                  cheaper to obtain and easier to use. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>By 1840 a Colt revolver sold for
                  $27 and a Springfield musket for not much more, and these were about as
                  good weapons as anyone could get at that time.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Thus, mass armies of
                  citizens, equipped with these cheap and easily used weapons, began to
                  replace armies of professional soldiers, beginning about 1800 in Europe
                  and even earlier in America.</p>
              <p>At the same time, democratic government
                  began to replace authoritarian governments (but chiefly in those areas
                  where the cheap new weapons were available and local standards of
                  living were high enough to allow people to obtain them).</p>
              <p>The arrival of the mass army of citizen-soldiers
                  in the nineteenth century created a difficult problem of control,
                  because techniques of transportation and of communications had not
                  reached a high-enough level to allow any flexibility of control in a
                  mass army...</p>
              <p><a href="http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/02.html#4">http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/02.html#4</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The political conditions of the latter half of the
                  twentieth century will continue to be dominated by the weapons
                  situation, for, while politics consists of much more than weapons, the
                  nature, organization, and control of weapons is the most significant of
                  the numerous factors that determine what happens in political life.
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Surely weapons will continue to be expensive and complex.</strong></span></p>
              <p>This means
                  that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they will increasingly be the tools of professionalized, if not
                  mercenary, forces.</strong></span></p>
              <p>All of past history shows that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the shift from a mass
                  army of citizen-soldiers to a smaller army of professional fighters
                  leads, in the long run, to a decline of democracy.</strong></span></p>
              <p>When weapons are
                  cheap and easy to obtain and to use, almost any man may obtain them,
                  and the organized structure of the society, such as the state, can
                  obtain no better weapons than the ordinary, industrious, private
                  citizen.</p>
              <p>This very rare historical condition existed about 1880, but is
                  now only a dim memory, since the weapons obtainable by the state today
                  are far beyond the pocketbook, understanding, or competence of the
                  ordinary citizen.</p>
              <p>When weapons are of the "amateur" type of 1880, as
                  they were in Greece in the fifth century B.C., they are widely
                  possessed hy citizens, power is similarly dispersed, and no minority
                  can compel the majority to yield to its will.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With such an "amateur
                  weapons system" (if other conditions are not totally unfavorable), we
                  are likely to find majority rule and a relatively democratic political
                  system.</strong> </span></p>
              <p>But, on the contrary, when a period can be dominated by complex
                  and expensive weapons that only a few persons can afford to possess or
                  can learn to use, we have a situation where the minority who control
                  such "specialist" weapons can dominate the majority who lack them.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In
                  such a society, sooner or later, an authoritarian political system that
                  reflects the inequality in control of weapons will he established.</strong></span></p>
              <p>At the present time, there seems to be little
                  reason to doubt that the specialist weapons of today will continue to
                  dominate the military picture into the foreseeable future.</p>
              <p>If so, there
                  is little reason to doubt that authoritarian rather than democratic
                  political regimes will dominate the world into the same foreseeable
                  future. To be sure, traditions and other factors may keep democratic
                  systems, or at least democratic forms, in many areas, such as the
                  United States or England.</p>
              <p>To us, brought up as we were on a democratic
                  ideology, this may seem very tragic, but a number of perhaps redeeming
                  features in this situation may well be considered...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...There is still another element in this complex picture. This is
                  also related to weapons.</p>
              <p>The past history of weapons over thousands of
                  years shows that the reason political units have grown larger in
                  certain periods has been because of the increased power of the
                  offensive in the dominant weapons systems, and that periods in which
                  defensive weapons became dominant have been those in which political
                  units remained small in area or even became smaller.</p>
              <p>The growing power
                  of castles in the period about 1100 B.C. or about A.D. 900 made
                  political power so decentralized and made power units so small that all
                  power became private power, and the state disappeared as a common form
                  of political organization. Thus arose the so-called "Dark Ages" about
                  1000 B.C. or A.D. 1000...</p>
              <p><a href="http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/20.html#74">http://real-world-news.org/bk-quigley/20.html#74</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...Also related to the problem of internalised controls is the shift of
                  weapons in our society. This is a profound problem. I have spent ten
                  years working on it throughout all of history, and I hope eventually to
                  produce a book if I can find a publisher. There will be endless
                  analyses of Chinese history, Byzantine history and Russian history and
                  everything else, and the book is about nine-tenths written.</p>
              <p>I'd say in
                  the last ten years the shift of weapons in any civilization and, above
                  all, in our civilization, from shock weapons to missile weapons has a
                  dominant influence on the ability to control individuals: individuals
                  cannot be controlled by missile weapons.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Notice that if you go back
                  several hundred years to the Middle Ages, all weapons were shock, that
                  is, you came at the enemy with a spear or a sword.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Even as late as
                  1916, in the First World War, you came at the Germans with bayonets
                  after a preliminary barrage with artillery. But we have now shifted
                  almost completely to missile weapons. Missile weapons are weapons that
                  you hurl. You may shoot, you may have bombs dropped from an airplane,
                  you may throw a hand grenade: these are missile weapons.</p>
              <p>The essential
                  difference between a shock weapon and a missile weapon is this: a
                  missile weapon is either fired or it isn't fired. It cannot be
                  half-fired. Once you let it go, it's out of your control. It is a
                  killing weapon.</p>
              <p>But a shock weapon--a billy club or a bayonet-- can be
                  used to any degree you wish. If you say to someone, "Get up and get out
                  of my room," and you pull out a machines gun, or you call in a B-52
                  bomber, or you pull the pin in a hand grenade....But with a bayonet you
                  can persuade him.</p>
              <p>In our society, individual behaviour can no longer be controlled by
                  any system of weaponry we have. In fact, we do not have enough people,
                  even if we equip them with shock weapons, to control the behaviour of
                  that part of the population which does not have internalised controls.</p>
              <p>One reason for that, of course, is that the twenty percent who do have
                  internalised controls are concentrated in certain areas. I won't go
                  into the subject of controls. It opens up the whole field of guerrilla
                  resistance, terrorism, and everything else; these cannot be controlled
                  by any system or organized structure or force that exists, at least on
                  the basis of missile weaponry.</p>
              <p>And, as I said, it would take too many
                  people on the basis of shock weaponry.</p>

              <p>One of the most significant differences between the old army system was that Caracalla in AD 212 had bestowed Roman citizenship on all the provinces.

              <p>So provincial inhabitants might have become Romans, but this didn't mean the end to non-Romans being part of the Roman army.</p>
