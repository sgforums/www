              <p>No doubtÂ . Today's NDP has changed alot since the 1st one in 1965 where it consist 100% military personnels and hardwares.</p>

The PAP will not allow it. They will hijack the whole celebration and make it a propaganda for the party, RC and NTUC as well. In any case, they prefer the present arrangement, as it can be dragged on for a whole month for maximum effect.<br><br>Military strength is not about hardware alone. Most generals get too confident when they feel they have the best, as in the US invasion of Iraq. Winning the war is easy, but not the peace. The recent durian diplomacy bet Malaysia and Singapore is a good example of waging peace.<br></div>

Get a hold of yourself and quit being defensive. IF the spin doctors want to make us look like a bunch of war mongers they can do it very easily. Already in Indonesia some morons already launched a spin campaign at SingTel to drive SingTel out of Indonesia although it has appeared to have failed thus far. Just looking at Thailand and at how we became a friend of Thailand to Public Enemy No. 2 or something just shows how easy it is for people to twist the truth.<br><br>Do you think our neighbours don't watch us wearily? You must be hopelessly naive to expect them to think that people will always share your damn perspective. What matters is not your damn opinion but others because at the end of the day it is the diplomats that have to do cleaning up because some idiot decided showing his manhood is fun. Why do you think the Centurion tanks to this day has remained a "secret" despite the fact that we have been having the tanks for decades?<br><br></div></blockquote>Delusion. Our SAF is primarily meant for Indonesia and Malaysia in times of war. Thailand does not come into the equation. Nvm, since you have such a strong opinion on this matter.<br><br>And centurion tanks are not a secret. Our neighbours already knew it before it was even mentioned in Tim Huxley's book.<br><br>If you are so tired debating, it's fine with me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More thoughts on this matter: damn if you do, damn if you don't.<br><br>Malaysia and Indonesia have always branded us arrogant but still work with us as we are a strategic economic partner. Singapore did not choose to be arrogant.<br><br>For example, an inferior man with small muscles may say that a muscled man wearing a singlet is showing off. But is he really doing so? Is the muscled man going to reduce his muscles just because of the little man's reaction?<br><br>Anyway, we have been doing it for 30 years. Even Malaysia and Indonesia have full force military parades. If we stop our military parade, it just shows:<br><br>1) we are guilty of provovation<br>2) we cannot stand on our feet and have to bow to our neighbour's pressure<br><br>Even if we do stop our parades, will the other two stop theirs? No.<br><br>I just checked with my peers minutes ago. These are people who read up about international affairs and are concerned with local politics. "NDP provocation??" was their reaction and just laughed. Check with the other educated forumites here and they should tell you the same.<br><br>Only you are that imaginative to think so. These parades are a norm in this region. Malaysia and Indonesia show us their might and we do the same. It's a big difference from provocation.<br><br></div>
