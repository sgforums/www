In this case it is the O-levels.<br><br>2) From the reactions of the students, yes her advice was misplaced. It is pretty obvious as well.<br><br>3)The parents are upset that someone is hindering the progress of their children. Their children are looking forward to studying hard, attention will be accorded to them during their course of study to prepare them for O-levels. Haven't you heard of the term "if you need help, all you have to do is ask"? They are asking for help by asking to take the O levels. They are not asking for "help" to be shoved into their gut. Recognise the difference. Do not attempt to think that running one's life for them is something one should view as a moral deed, no matter how good the outcome one may picture. And you shouldn't speculate about the mentality of other people's parents this way, because if you do, I will be forced to speculate about yours.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">Teaching is one of the noble professions because the nurturing and development of a child's potential is in their hands.  A principal sets the targets, strategies, and overall direction for the school, and the teachers in that school has to then conform to his/her goals.  Thus a principal's actions can have far-reaching consequences.<br><br>I shudder to think of the damage this principal has done.  lotus999's comment about this principal being more suited to a QC job in a factory has me laughing because that is certainly a good suggestion!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The principal has to remember that she's dealing with influential young people.  Whilst it's true that not everyone has got what it takes to succeed in a certain area, it doesn't mean that they won't be absolute star performers in other areas!  It's the teaching profession's onus to help draw out the best in the students under their care, to encourage, to motivate, and to point them in the correct direction, and even to provide career guidance.  The whole point of the teaching profession is to nurture and educate, not to segregate and condemn!!<br><br>To step into a classroom and basically condemn the entire class is wrong.  It sounds like a bourgeoisie telling the pleibians to not even bother trying cause they will forever be cast in the role of pleibians!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I detest how this principal seems to degrade the value ITE's contribute to society and the economy.  Basically, no matter which field you are in, you can be outstanding and you can make a really useful contribution.  In my younger years, I was a tad snobbish, but now, I find myself realising that some of the best and most exemplary people I've known, are the blue collar workers like our taxi drivers, the mechanics, the technicians, and the humble and diligent people who do maintenance and cleaning chores, the shopkeepers, etc.  I find it an absolute delight to be in their company because they are humble, frank, and they make a decent living through sheer diligence.<br><br>Whoever dares to snub graduates of Singapore's ITE ought to re-evaluate their own mercenary, utilitarian, and didactic views towards life!  The Singapore govt has invested money into making our ITE's world-class and if someone as high-ranking as a Principal has the sheer audacity to imply that ITE's are "dumping grounds" for students who cannot do well academically, the MOE should really call that Principal in for a good, long talk on what a career in teaching is all about!<br><br>It is alright to provide career counselling to a student who's obviously struggling academically, and evaluate where her strengths and aptitude lie, and then help her get into the ITE.  We should always help find the job that's the best fit for a person, no matter what job it is.  However, what we should never do, is to storm into a classroom, apply Board Room tactics to scare the bejesus out of the students, completely shatter their self-esteem, and then leave them with the thought that they are not good enough for anywhere else but the ITE because the ITE is the only place that will accept people like them!  Please... we're dealing with people, with youths, and the impact on those poor students' future and perhaps even, their lives, will be great!<br><br>The MOE should show that it doesn't tolerate such treatment of our Singapore youths.  A country cannot survive on white collar workers alone.  It's time to give due recognition to our hardworking blue-collar workers as well.  </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Chin Eng,<br><br>If she had consulted the parents first, your argument would bear some weight. If the students had approached her for her recommendation, it may even be the right thing to do. If there were a directive from the ministry to identify and council such students she could be excused the manner in which it was done.<br><br>However that was not the case. At best, she doesn't know how to do her job properly.<br><br>In America, schools are graduating students who can barely read and write because remuneration is tied to the passing rate. It has already created a legacy of illiteracy which is worrying legislators. I think there have been charges brought against responsible parties.<br><br>We are experimenting here in Singapore with the same remuneration method, let's at least learn from their mistakes and make new ones and not just repeat the same old ones.</div>

Some parents and students think so.<br><br>Sarah (not her real name), 17, scored five points in the N levels last year.<br><br>Going by the Ministry of Education regulations, she should have been able to continue with her O levels this year.<br><br>Yet, Sarah found herself turned away because she was deemed a discipline case.<br><br>Sarah is now studying in an Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and requested that her identity not be revealed so she can have a fresh start.<br><br>GOOD GRADES NOT ENOUGH<br><br>The New Paper learnt last week that at Pasir Ris Sec, students from the Normal Academic (NA) stream are given Forms A to D upon completing their N levels.<br><br>The forms are given out by their home teachers, who base it on the students' disciplinary conduct.<br><br>Students who receive Form A are allowed to continue with their studies in Sec 5. Those who are given Forms B to D have to write letters to appeal to their subject teachers.<br><br>If they wish to continue their Olevels in the school, they have to get signatures of endorsement from not one but all their subject teachers.<br><br>The school confirmed the system exists.<br><br>This means that as long as one subject teacher does not sign the form, the student cannot be promoted to Sec 5, although the school said it was open to negotiations.<br><br>It's not clear, on average, how many students from each cohort receive Form A.<br><br>Sarah, who was given Form B, said: 'I obtained a Grade 1 for Art. Yet, this very first teacher I turned to for help turned me down.'<br><br>Sarah's mother, Mrs H, 50, said: 'My daughter came home discouraged. There was nothing I could do to help her.'<br><br>When asked about her disciplinary conduct, Sarah claimed she was never late for school, although she conceded that she had sported double earrings and coloured hair at some point in time.<br><br>The latest report card she showed to The New Paper stated that she had 'fair' conduct, and the comments were positive.<br><br>Sarah claimed that the students were not informed that such a system was in place until the beginning of Sec 4. The school has confirmed this.<br><br>That's why Sarah is upset.<br><br>She said it was unfair to those who had disciplinary problems recorded in their lower secondary days.<br><br>Mrs H said: 'If my husband and I had known about the system from the start, we would not have enrolled our children in the school.<br><br>'Now, I am worried that my second daughter, who is also in the school, will face similar problems in the future.'<br><br>Although Sarah was eventually offered a position in the school due to her excellent academic performance, some of Sarah's friends did not receive similar offers despite doing well for the N levels.<br><br>They had scored six or seven points each.<br><br>Sarah's classmate, Paul (not his real name), had obtained six points.<br><br>However, he and a few other classmates were not given any forms at all as they had not completed the school's Bridging Programme.<br><br>It is a requirement set by the school if they wish to be promoted to Sec 5.<br><br>'I was sick for several days during the programme,' explained Paul, adding that the school had not accepted his reasons for being absent.<br><br>On top of having to appeal their cases, students with Forms B to D and are successful in their appeal also have to spend time with the Discipline Master, they claimed.<br><br>Because of the system, some of these top scorers still end up going to the ITE despite doing well for their Nlevels.<br><br>For both Sarah and Paul, taking the Olevels in Sec 5 had always been their first choice, until the complications of the system made them choose ITE.<br><br>Sarah said: 'Even though the school is now open to negotiations, I will not reconsider or turn back. I don't think I can be happy in that school.'<br><br>She is now taking events management at ITE while Paul is taking business studies.<br><br>By Teo Chin Ghee, newsroom intern<br></div>

The story also drew more than 20 other responses, with parents saying their children had also been told this by their principals and teachers.<br><br>Speaking to reporters after a teachers' investiture at the National Institute of Education, Rear-Admiral (NS) Lui said it was important to separate the 'tone' from the 'substance' of the message.<br><br>'We can calibrate the tone. We can soften it, improve on the presentation, but there is a lot of work to be done between Secondary 4 and Secondary 5.'<br><br>He said principals needed to do their job of conveying this message to the students, and to teachers to do their part to challenge them, set high goals and to help them achieve these goals.<br><br>Rear-Admiral (NS) Lui said the educators meant well and had wanted to make sure the students were 'on a firm footing' for the path ahead.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>The greater danger would have been indifference.<br><br>He said it would be a great injustice to principals to insinuate that they wanted good school results only because their own performance appraisal - and performance bonus - was linked to the results. </strong></span><br><br>He added: 'I have interacted with enough educators... they are by far more ambitious for their students than they are for their career advancement.'<br><br>On concerns raised that episodes like last Saturday's would shatter students' confidence, he said that if that were the case, he would be worried about just how fragile young people were.<br><br>'We can take the approach where you cringe, your confidence is affected and it impacts you negatively, and it's an excuse. Or you can stand up tall, with resolve and say that I am a better person than you think I am and I will do better and I will show you I have what it takes to achieve the results.'<br><br>He added that it was necessary to build that resilience in students, because when they go into the real world, they are going to have to face circumstances well beyond their control.<br><br>A parent, whose daughter is in the school involved, said he was upset with not just the tone of the principal, but the timing of the the message.<br><br>'The students could have been told earlier, even before their N levels, not when school has started and they were elated about getting to do their O levels,' he said.<br><br>Rear-Admiral (NS) Lui said the Ministry of Education preferred not to prescribe to principals what they can or cannot say, or what their tone should be, since they knew their students better.<br><br>'There are students who need to be told that if you don't work hard, you won't make it. So you must not take away some of these tools from our educators,' he said.<br><br>janeng@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2008, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>
