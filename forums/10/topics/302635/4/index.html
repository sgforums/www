            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rhonda:</div><div class="quote_body">Teaching is one of the noble professions because the nurturing and development of a child's potential is in their hands.  A principal sets the targets, strategies, and overall direction for the school, and the teachers in that school has to then conform to his/her goals.  Thus a principal's actions can have far-reaching consequences.<br><br>I shudder to think of the damage this principal has done.  lotus999's comment about this principal being more suited to a QC job in a factory has me laughing because that is certainly a good suggestion!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The principal has to remember that she's dealing with influential young people.  Whilst it's true that not everyone has got what it takes to succeed in a certain area, it doesn't mean that they won't be absolute star performers in other areas!  It's the teaching profession's onus to help draw out the best in the students under their care, to encourage, to motivate, and to point them in the correct direction, and even to provide career guidance.  The whole point of the teaching profession is to nurture and educate, not to segregate and condemn!!<br><br>To step into a classroom and basically condemn the entire class is wrong.  It sounds like a bourgeoisie telling the pleibians to not even bother trying cause they will forever be cast in the role of pleibians!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I detest how this principal seems to degrade the value ITE's contribute to society and the economy.  Basically, no matter which field you are in, you can be outstanding and you can make a really useful contribution.  In my younger years, I was a tad snobbish, but now, I find myself realising that some of the best and most exemplary people I've known, are the blue collar workers like our taxi drivers, the mechanics, the technicians, and the humble and diligent people who do maintenance and cleaning chores, the shopkeepers, etc.  I find it an absolute delight to be in their company because they are humble, frank, and they make a decent living through sheer diligence.<br><br>Whoever dares to snub graduates of Singapore's ITE ought to re-evaluate their own mercenary, utilitarian, and didactic views towards life!  The Singapore govt has invested money into making our ITE's world-class and if someone as high-ranking as a Principal has the sheer audacity to imply that ITE's are "dumping grounds" for students who cannot do well academically, the MOE should really call that Principal in for a good, long talk on what a career in teaching is all about!<br><br>It is alright to provide career counselling to a student who's obviously struggling academically, and evaluate where her strengths and aptitude lie, and then help her get into the ITE.  We should always help find the job that's the best fit for a person, no matter what job it is.  However, what we should never do, is to storm into a classroom, apply Board Room tactics to scare the bejesus out of the students, completely shatter their self-esteem, and then leave them with the thought that they are not good enough for anywhere else but the ITE because the ITE is the only place that will accept people like them!  Please... we're dealing with people, with youths, and the impact on those poor students' future and perhaps even, their lives, will be great!<br><br>The MOE should show that it doesn't tolerate such treatment of our Singapore youths.  A country cannot survive on white collar workers alone.  It's time to give due recognition to our hardworking blue-collar workers as well.  </div></blockquote>I agree with Rhonda.<br><br>I'd like to add that education is not as simple as we'd like to believe. There's a combination of the maturity of the student, whether there are other problems on his mind, his perception of the world, his perception of the curriculum and lots of other factors to consider.<br><br>While I'd like to believe that the principal was looking for a best fit for the students in our educational system, I'm not persuaded this was the case.<br><br>Just from a superficial examination of the matter. It looks more like he/she was cheating and trying to manipulate her school ranking by using psychological warfare on students she felt were in the way.<br><br>I think the principal should be sacked. Otherwise the wrong message would be sent out... that it is okay to disguise school ranking manipulation by "removing" students who don't contribute to it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not think the Principal did anything wrong. She was being practical to the students. Choose the path which you think is best for u. She did not say she will penalise them if they choose to persist with going to Poly or JC.<br><br>This is what we did with my sister. I did ok in my o levels, went to Poly, then to Uni and graduated with a degree. On the other hand, my sister, was not very keen on her studies, but however we knew the importance of at least having some qualifications in Singapore and we urged to choose the best path for herself. When in Primary school, she already are failing alot of subjects. After PSLE results are released, she barely made it to the then newly set up Normal Technical, SUPPOSEDLY, for those whose results cannot make it in PSLE. We urged her to go for it regardless of what the perceptions were.<br><br>In Secondary school, her results improved! Not excellent but she was passing more then what we expected and we were glad. When it comes to the Sec 4 time when she needs to make a choice between going to ITE or take O LEVELS, after discussing, we asked her, why not choose ITE because if she thinks that she is not the academic kind, no point putting so much stress on her to go to O LEVELS, this may just be counter productive. And to us, though I was a Uni Grad, I never tot ITE was lousy because I simply saw many ITE grads making it in life. So in the end, she also agreed to go to ITE.<br><br>No, this story does not have a damn superb fairytale ending. My sister did not become someone great. She is not working in some big MNCs as a manager. She has worked in retail and is now a bank teller at a bank. But I am proud of her, because she got her ITE cert and she is now working in a decent job, earning a living for herself. She is married and striving honestly for a living with her husband. She may not have a degree but right now she is happy. I knew going to ITE was the right choice for her, because it gave her time and space to express herself and to learn. She may not be what she is today if we had forced her to go for O LEVELS. And I thank God for who she is today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, you should be proud of your sister Gasband.<br><br>But there's a difference between encouraging the student to find his or her own path and arbitrarily dismissing a bunch of N level students as ITE bound because of some statistic and the need to keep the school's passing rate at a certain degree to make all look pretty.<br><br>Not to say that ITE is bad, many students from ITE have contributed a whole lot to society. If there is a student who does not make the grade for poly or JC and is looking for an alternative, I think ITE is a good place to further one's education. However, when one, above all an educator choose to give into societal sterotypes and label his or her student as ITE bound by the virtue of them being N Level students, I find that totally unexceptable! One can argue that she is being realistic, but how can one even project the results even before the exams itself have been written. I think the esteemed principal will do better to devote her time and resources to aid his or her students to do well for their exams, instead of reading and trimming his or her own set of statistics.</div>
