The Singapore govt has invested money into making our ITE's world-class and if someone as high-ranking as a Principal has the sheer audacity to imply that ITE's are "dumping grounds" for students who cannot do well academically, the MOE should really call that Principal in for a good, long talk on what a career in teaching is all about!<br><br>It is alright to provide career counselling to a student who's obviously struggling academically, and evaluate where her strengths and aptitude lie, and then help her get into the ITE.  We should always help find the job that's the best fit for a person, no matter what job it is.  However, what we should never do, is to storm into a classroom, apply Board Room tactics to scare the bejesus out of the students, completely shatter their self-esteem, and then leave them with the thought that they are not good enough for anywhere else but the ITE because the ITE is the only place that will accept people like them!

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont like this kind of principal. Seriously i had a teacher when i was in p3 who discouraged me alot. I was transferred to the first class when i was in p3, and of course first class expected to do well in acedemics. Im not a person who is strong in acedemic. I was often discouraged when the teacher have no faith in me and often mock me infront of the class. There was even once when the whole class laughed at me for my maths mock exam paper, because i score 77/100, while the others score 80 and above. 80 was the passing mark to them.<br><br>Now come to think of it, its quite ignorant of the teacher. Many people think that acedemic is the ONLY way to success in life, but probrably not. After so many years now, i've found my talent in music and singing. Not doing well for exams doesnt mean one is lousy or useless in life. If they look down on me, they are snobbish.<br><br>But after so many years, sometimes these images still run vividly in my mind.
