Where's the compassion?'<br><br>She said she thought moves to weed out weaker students by urging them to drop difficult subjects were a thing of the past.<br><br>When annual ranking of secondary schools was introduced in 1992, some schools were reported to have pressed students to drop 'tougher' subjects such as Literature, in apparent attempts to protect or improve their rankings.<br><br>MOE has tweaked the system, taking fewer subjects into account.<br><br>About 60 per cent of Normal stream students who sit for the O levels do well enough to win places in the polytechnics.<br><br>Of the five girls who spoke to The Straits Times, only one defended her principal, saying she 'meant well'.<br><br>Said the teen: 'My class is a weak class. Some of the girls may be better off in the ITE.'<br><br>sandra@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2008, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

If a student scored a Grade 4 or 5 for a subject in the N levels, she is unlikely to pass the subject in the O levels.'<br><br>N-level subjects are graded from 1 to 5, with 1 being the best grade.<br><br>The principal added: 'Some...who don't qualify for poly will end up in the ITE anyway, so they might as well go direct to the ITE.'<br><br>She confirmed that she told the girls she wanted 100 per cent passes in her school, but that what she meant was that she wanted all her girls to do well in the O levels - not that she did not want poor performers to tar the school's record or lower its ranking.<br><br>Noting that well over 80 per cent of her Normal stream students who sat for the O levels last year did well enough to qualify for the polytechnics, she added: 'But it takes a lot of hard work and the girls needed to know that.'<br><br>When given the principal's side of the story, two of the parents interviewed said that if all she wanted was to give the girls a wake-up call, she could have done it differently.<br><br>One parent said: 'I would have preferred it if she had called the parents in and given them the hard facts, instead of destroying the confidence of the girls.'<br><br>SANDRA DAVIE<br><br>Copyright, 2008, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was from Normal Academic stream during my sec sch days. Did my N-Level with average results and went to sec 5 after that. Did my O-Level (average results as well) and managed to enter the Polytechnic studying my 1st choice course. Did well enough to be awarded the Certificate of Merit for my diploma.<br><br>Currently, i'm in NTU year 2 semester 2. It's definitely not the usual route taken by students.<br><br>What i'm trying to say is that one, especially an authoritive figure like a sch principle shouldn't discourage pupils frm going to sec5. The school should instead encourage all their students to go to sec5 and from there, identify those weaker students and gif them extra coaching so that they can go to a Poly or even a JC.<br><br>That's what a school supposed to do isn't it? Instead of discouraging Normal Acad students to go to sec5 so as to prevent them from pulling the school's ranking down.<br><br>That's a very selfish principal and i tink she doesn't understand the true responsibilties of being a school principal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The principal might just meant well to the students, no point for them to waste another year without a full cert to even a poly and go to ite instead right?<br><br>in life, we can have all sorts encouragement but in the end we still have to be realistic.<br><br>i believe in pushing the students till then the end even tho their n lvl result might not make it. they are willing to study, why give them up?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What's the most important role a principal should play in the school?<br><br>1.	Focusing on testing and student test scores<br>2.	Creating a safe and supportive school environment<br>3.	Motivating students to do their best, especially to encourage students from lower-middle and low-income homes to do better.<br><br>I think 2 and 3 are more important than 1 if Singapore hopes to produce her own Nobel Laureate one day.<br><br></div>
