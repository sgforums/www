            <div class='col-md body'>Well, just another noteworthy remark: Secondary School ranking is now valued even more dearly for School principals because the top league schools (e.g. RI, RGS etc) are offering "straight-through"  6 years programs skipping the "O" level exams. With these top schools no longer participating in the school ranking system based on "O" level results, other top 2nd tier secondary schools believe that they now have a greater chance of reaching the top of the ranking. Hence, the over-emphasis by school principals to weed out obstacles that will pull down the ranking. (in this case, PLMGS).<br><br></div>
