            <div class='col-md body'>Arrogance and an affront to the brains of Singaporeans.What gives the MIW the divine mandate to decide that they and they alone should control Singapore "forevermore".Its this kind of self-righteousness that leads to the inability to really apologize when there is a problem , instead they fudge up some nincompoop excuse or a limp story and blame it on something external.When you've been so indoctrinated into thinking that you have the divine right of Kings, your ego and thirst for that continued power to hold in your hands is human excess at its worst.Call me extreme but this is a harsh and dirty truth that the whitewash has tried to paper over.<br><br>Same goes for the other political parties, be professional and do not let them capitalise on your mistakes and "shortcomings" and showcase it like its some capital crime.Be your best and give us all another shot at the island under the sun.</div>
