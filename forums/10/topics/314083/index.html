              <p>While the Church can involve its members to be concious of their social responsibilities towards the fellow citizens in their communities and country, it becomes a different issue when the leader of the Church decide to challenge the position of the leaders of the Government.</p>
              <p>Some religions insist that their religious teachings is relevant in guiding, involving and encompasses the complete man - the political, socio-cultural, moral, philosophical and religious needs of man.</p>
              <p>While religion serves as a beacon to guide a person in his responsiblity to live his life for himself and his relationship with those around him, it does not allow the Pastor or the Church Leader to use his / her position in the Church for personal political gains.</p>
              <p>If the Pastor or Church Leader decide to enter politics - he / she should declare his / her position, and do not preach his / her version of ''religious influenced politics'' from his / her pulpit.</p>
              <p>The Pastor or Church Leader could enter the political fray by joining a political party to actively involve himself in politics and guided by his own religious tenets and moral beliefs, and stand on equal ground with all politicians to gain his own political standing in the community.</p>
              <p>There are religions today that will allow any one with the gift of the gap - {but whose brain is half as intelligent as the mouth} - to usurp the pulpit to stir the congregation with fiery speeches in the hour long sermon, to a captive audience that has assembled to comfort their own religious needs.</p>
              <p>Many of these schemers have gained political prominence by the backdoor through the powers available from the pulpit that control the minds of those that are weak and troubled turning to religion to find comfort and answers to their problems.</p>
              <p>In many cases, the stronger minded religious persons will be sidelined by brute force or by politics from these usurpers of the pulpit, enabling these shady characters to hijack the religion for their own political agenda.</p>
              <p>Politics should be played on a level playing field.</p>

              <p><em>...In the West, the Roman Empire (which continued in the East as the
              Byzantine Empire) disappeared in 476 and, although many efforts were
              made to revive it, there was clearly a period, about goo, when there
              was no empire, no state, and no public authority in the West.</em></p>
              <p><em><strong> The state
              disappeared, yet society continued.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong> So also, religious and economic
              life continued.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em> This clearly showed that the state and society were not
              the same thing, that society was the basic entity, and that the state
              was a crowning, but not essential, cap to the social structure.</em></p>
              <p><em> This
              experience had revolutionary effects. </em></p>
              <p><em>It was discovered that man can
              live without a state; this became the basis of Western liberalism. </em></p>
              <p><em>It
              was discovered that the state, if it exists, must serve men and that it
              is incorrect to believe that the purpose of men is to serve the state. </em></p>
              <p><em>It was discovered that economic life, religious life, law, and private
              property can all exist and function effectively without a state.</em></p>
              <p><em> From
              this emerged laissez-faire, <strong>separation of Church and State</strong>, rule of
              law, and the sanctity of private property. </em></p>
              <p><em>In Rome, in Byzantium, and
              in Russia, law was regarded as an enactment of a supreme power.</em></p>
              <p><em> In the
              West, when no supreme power existed, it was discovered that law still
              existed as the body of rules which govern social life. </em></p>
              <p><em>Thus law was
              found by observation in the West, not enacted by autocracy as in the
              East. </em></p>
              <p><em>This meant that authority was established by law and under the
              law in the West, while authority was established by power and above the
              law in the East. </em></p>
              <p><em>The West felt that the rules of economic life were
              found and not enacted; that individuals had rights independent of, and
              even opposed to, public authority; that groups could exist, as the
              Church existed, by right and not by privilege, and without the need to
              have any charter of incorporation entitling them to exist as a group or
              act as a group; that groups or individuals could own property as a
              right and not as a privilege and that such property could not be taken
              by force but must be taken by established process of law...</em></p>

              was total. </em></p>
              <p><em>We in the West have escaped the fascination of
              totalitarianism because we have in our tradition other elements—the
              refusal of the Hebrews to confuse God with the world, or religion with
              the state, and the realization that God is transcendental, and,
              accordingly, all other things must be, in some degree, incomplete and
              thus imperfect. </em></p>
              <p><em>We also have, in our tradition,<strong> Christ, who stood apart
              from the state and told his followers to "Render to Caesar the things
              which are Caesar's."</strong> </em></p>
              <p><em>And we have in our tradition the church of the
              catacombs, where clearly human values were neither united nor total,
              and were opposed to the state. </em></p>
              <p><em>The Germans, as later the Russians,
              escaped the full influence of these elements in the tradition of the
              West. </em></p>
              <p><em>The Germans and the Russians knew Rome only in its
              post-Constantine phase when the Christian emperors were seeking to
              preserve the totalitarian system of Dioclesian, but in a Christian
              rather than a pagan totalitarianism.</em></p>
              <p><em> This was the system the
              detribalized Germans glimpsed just before it also was shattered.</em></p>
              <p><em> They
              saw it as a greater, larger, more powerful entity than the tribe but
              with the same elements which they wanted to preserve from their tribal
              past...</em></p>

              <p>That would risk dividing Singapore into groups instead of achieving integration among Singaporean collectively as a multi-ethnic society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beside, there might surfaces 'spillover effect' on the social disharmony as well as political instability and arouse unhappy sentiment among the rest of the religions. I share with Atobe that pastors should not get with state politics but rather restrict to their own Church's Ministries. This is to prevent influencing the leader's judgement in crafting nation policy.</p>

              <p>hei guys, talking about the war in Iraq being a "religious" war by Christian churches in America against Iraq is really out of line with the topic.</p>
              <p>Christianity has great influence in America, just like Islam has great influence in the middle eastern countries, in the same way Buddhism has great influence in Thailand and Catholitism in the Philippines. But anything that happens between any of the two countries cannot be inferred as clashes of the religions, or it would be easy for some fanetics to cry out for jihah or holy war.</p>
              <p>We need to be able to discern the difference or else we would get into unnecessary disputes or worse, used by politicians for their own agenda.</p>
              <p>Whether we like LKY or Chiam ST or Chee SJ, keep religions away from politics, and we will continue to enjoy peace. cheers.</p>

              <p>Many of you feel the need to be cautious in mixing politics and religion because we the people have been brainwashed into believing such a need to separate the functions of state from religion.</p>
              <p>If the government is indeed a good government which looks after the people, practise morality and compassions and citizens are looked after for their basic needs and necessities, will there be such an urgent need for any one to preach such morality and rights of citizesn in the pulpit.</p>
              <p>If there is injustice committed against the people resulting in people talking to their pastors of problems caused who is the cause of such problems requiring the intervention of pastors to play a part in putting wrongs to right. If a pastor offers views on the need for government to look after its people instead of pushing all its resposibilities back to them and keeping all the taxes for their own purposes then shouldn't the pastors speak up and correct such wrongs instead of timidly fearing to preach values and correctitude from the pulpit.</p>
              <p>So all the issues of government and religions are interconnected and should be scrutinised for rights and wrongs and not simply be treated in such a simplistic manner like pilitics and religions should be separated when in reality they are not separable.</p>
              <p>Practising politics and religions at the same time needs a higher level of maturity and it is hoped one day a pastor joining a party is no longer taboo like now.</p>
