              <p>Agreed!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DO NOT MIX RELIGION WITH POLTICS!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For crying out loud, you think US is a good example of seperation between religion and state?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me explain this to anyone who isn't clear about the US. The US is a democracy. Democracy is supposed to represent the interest of the majority. Now, the US also happens to be a country where the majority of the population are supposed to be christians. Where does this leads us, whoever that got elected will try and get approval from the religous community. Thus, religion holds a huge influence in people's day to day life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On paper, the US is supposed to have a clear seperation between religion and politics. But in reality, religion holds too much power in the US.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I DO NOT want a country where religion text and etc, is accepted as science.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How many of you are even aware of the evolution creationism debate going on in the US? A large population of the US public don't really accept evolution as a reality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And why should pastors get involved in politics? Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't singapore supposed to be a multi-religious society?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you allow pastors to be in politics, then how about people who are NOT christians? If politics is influenced by pastors, then how is singapore supposed to be fair towards all religion?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean come on, the bible canon was shaped by the polticial agenda of the religion leaders as compared to what is really written or approved by god. Holy Crusades was launched in the name of christianity back in the medivial times.</p>
              <p>And guess what the crusades is? A war!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a age where freedom of religion is accepted, we should NEVER EVER allow a religion leader to step into politics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Never.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Whats the point..... he have already decided on what he/she wanted to believed in. Anything we could said just sounds like more propaganda to - <strong>mihiro</strong> - .....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hahaha..... I think a better example would be "Any defence I could give for LKY.... would sound like propaganda to you".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have learn when to keep my peace in 'Speakers Corner' long ago...... most are here not to have a debate and/or see others point of views..... but to 'force' their views on you.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, let - <strong>mihiro </strong>- think whatever he/she wanted..... much like how some ppl believe that the Holocaust didn't happen.</p>

                  NOT Religion." by telling this and relate  back to your pervious post, you are trying to enforce your point of view  on me by telling me that it is not Religion war. anyway, watever la, as you have said it.</p>
              <p>There is too much conspiracy in regards to the war which we yet to find out, so whether or not it  is war on terror, war on religion or whatsoever, there is still no definite conclusion.</p>
