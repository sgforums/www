Singapore don't take up that job not becos of looking down on those job. It's becos those job pay TOO LOW. $700,u need to pay transport,food and buy neccessity. SIngaorean are the one going to stay here and retire. While those people saving up a bit can go home and enjoy a better standard of living. If road sweeper pay is $2000,I bet many singaporean are willing to take up that job but is that the case now?</div>

I think the government by telling us that these is a global issue and we must accept it, they are actually telling us that we must accept these peoples into our fine fine city.And ... frankly speaking from my heart, it wont be long... i say again it wont be long when our Singapore land will be full of these China peoples or hooligans,coming here laughing at us for being so useless and in the end, the foriegners see us as second class citizens.<br>Global issue is just a lie.I think the government is trying to sell us out to the China government.Or else why are there so so so many many China peoples in Singapore now??????? I need an answer from the PAP government, are they trying to sell us out to Communist China???</div></blockquote>Yes. As long as they get their million dollars salaries, why should they heck care what you think and how it affects you? As long as they can get their children and grandchildren and husbands and wives into positions of power... why should they heck care of you?</div>
