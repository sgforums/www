            <div class='col-md body'><strong>TARGET TEACHER<br>Students film teacher and post clips on YouTube. Has her privacy been breached?<br>May 03, 2007    </strong><br><br>THESE days, anyone can shoot a video, thanks to the advent of the camera-phone.<br><br>And anyone can be the subject.<br><br>The filming goes on around the clock in MRT trains, shopping centres, void decks and so on.<br><br>So what's wrong with filming in a classroom in school?<br><br>That is the question educators and students are increasingly grappling with as technology invades the classroom.<br><br>What used to be a private space shared by a teacher and her wards is now being treated as a public one by those who use camera-phones and computers.<br><br>Take the example of what happened in a secondary school here last month.<br><br>CAUGHT ON CAMERA<br><br>On 5 Mar, a humanities teacher was filmed giving her lessons in class by a camera-phone.<br><br>The student then posted the 36-second clip on the popular video-sharing website YouTube.<br><br>On 29 Mar, the student posted a new clip of the same teacher looking frustrated and raising her voice at the class for their poor behaviour.<br><br>Less than two weeks later, another two videos of the day's lessons were uploaded.<br><br>The videos attracted 864 views and some snide comments.<br><br>One of them remarked: 'Hahah, who's next?' and then asked if it would be the head of the English department at the school.<br><br>One video was sarcastically entitled I Love Flapping Arms During Lessons, presumably because the teacher could be seen gesticulating with her arms in the footage.<br><br>The New Paper found the clips last Monday and contacted the school the next day for comments.<br><br>The vice-principal said: 'We believe the students posted the YouTube video out of mischief, with no malicious intentions towards the teacher.<br><br>'Nonetheless, it is an inappropriate act, as it shows disrespect to the teacher and the class. The school rule of not using handphones in school had also been broken.'<br><br>The vice-principal also said that the school will investigate the matter and follow up accordingly.<br><br>Two days later on Thursday, the videos were removed from the website by the same person who posted them.<br><br>So how much of what goes on in the classroom is private?<br><br>Or is it a case of disrespect, of not asking for permission before the act?<br><br>Most teachers and principals The New Paper spoke to believe that what goes on in the classroom should stay within it.<br><br>Mr Low Eng Kee, principal of Orchid Park Secondary School, said: 'Students do not have the right to film teachers in class using their handphones unless prior permission is obtained'.<br><br>He said Orchid Park Secondary does not allow students to take their handphones to school.<br><br>Mr Lim Ghee Soon, 45, a university lecturer, said: 'It is disrespectful on the student's part to videotape their teacher without her permission.'<br><br>He said that sometimes, certain things that the teacher says in class are used purely to help students explore different perspectives of an issue.<br><br>OUT OF CONTEXT<br><br>'Once it is put on the Net, it might be taken out of context and misunderstood by the public,' Mr Lim said.<br><br>A former discipline master, who asked not to be named, said 'it is definitely wrong' if the purpose of the video was simply to demean or make fun of someone else.<br><br>A few students that The New Paper spoke to shared the same views. Miss Eunice Kow, a 19-year-old polytechnic student, said: 'I guess it's funny from a student's point of view, but the teachers will probably feel that the students are airing dirty laundry.'<br><br>Student Ang Minshin, 19, said this sort of behaviour is disrespectful towards teachers and invades their privacy.<br><br>'The way she behaves and what she says in class is meant solely for the students in the classroom and not meant to be broadcasted,' she said.<br><br>However, 19-year-old student Tok Jia Jie suggested that the classroom is 'definitely public to a large extent' when it has 30 people.<br><br>'Teachers have to be responsible for what they say in the classroom, but on the other hand, a teacher-student relationship can also be close.<br><br>'Sometimes, teachers say things like, 'Okay, I'm going to tell you all something, but you cannot go out and say, okay?'<br><br>Polytechnic student Elaine Wee, 19, is of the view that a classroom is a public place because 'it has so many people and you can't choose who you want to be with'.<br><br>But she said any unhappiness between a teacher and his or her students should be resolved between both parties.<br><br>'Why take videos of them, unless they are do something really wrong, like sexually abusing the kids,' Miss Wee asked.<br><br>So should video technology be allowed to step in when there is blatant abuse?<br><br>Who draws the line on that?<br><br>SHAMED<br><br>In July 2003, a Raffles Junior College student had his worksheets torn by his teacher in front of his classmates.<br><br>The teacher also berated him, saying his work was 'outdated and irrelevant' and called him a 'sly, crafty, old rat'.<br><br>Both the teacher and the student who filmed the exchange received counselling later.<br><br>However, the clip continues to be circulated in cyberspace.<br><br>Madam Judy Chia, 52, a mother of two, believes such clips can be useful.<br><br>'It serves as a warning for teachers to keep their behaviour in check and not to abuse their authority,' the administrative assistant said.<br><br>Mrs Lena Tan, 33, a former discipline teacher, said the debate is centred on two issues - professionalism and personal rights.<br><br>'Professionally, the teacher should not be afraid of being filmed, especially since she is not doing anything wrong,' she said.<br><br>'But on the issue of personal rights, everyone should be consulted before being filmed.'<br><br></div>
