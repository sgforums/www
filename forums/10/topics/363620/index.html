As a multi religions society, the ability to live in peace and harmony is already a blessing, we should not take politic into religion context, especially in a religion tolerable country like Singapore. In many country, Religion are used as a tool in their political and self interest advancement, but these countries alway end up either in wars or in a third world condition.</p>

              <p><br>In my opinion, as a political party, to use religions as the moral values should be the last thing people should do... Although political parties and religions do shared a lot of similarities.</p>
              <p>It seems better in some countries, but mainly because of one reason, to have faith/to believe a religion, is much easier than to the same thing to a political party... So you can find political parties often borrow values and ideas from religions, mainly just because that makes politician's job easier, right?</p>
              <p>But politics still just politics at the end of day, it's a dirty thing... you can pack it with beautiful values and ideas, but inside, they are all the same...</p>
              <p>To most of the political parties, religions are just tools, people's wealth or anything they promised, are lies or their mid-term goals, for the long-run, they are all the same, get control of the gov/country...</p>

              <p>True, we are not homogenous society unlike the rest, jap, korea, german, or event the thais.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The govt here base on the founders, meritocracy and the icon of our flag to influence the people and therefore identify its belonging. Religious is a very sensitive issue here, unlike the heads of the other countries, they can visit church or monastary or even temple to protray their common belief and thereby influence their people, our leaders are also multi regligous, they performed their belief prayer or ceremony privately. Therefore, religous influence can never play a role in our morality here.</p>
