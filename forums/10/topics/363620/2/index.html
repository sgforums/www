              <p>Everytime, the topic on homosexuality pops up, some minister or so would remind Singaporeans that Singapore is a conservative society. The homosexual law was due to the Christian British Colonial government. Just to pull some strings with China, the ruling government tries to put up a confucianist front with a advancing outlook.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party seems to be pro-christian as it is against the setting up of the IRs in Singapore due to immoral means of creating a new niche market.</p>
              <p>The Workers' Party seems to be based on confucianist values on society and family while having a democratic legal system to support the common working people.</p>
              <p>While the SDA seems to calling itself democratic socialist, there are signs of it being morally guided by judeo-islamic-christian religions. It doesn't show signs of supporting secular growth in new unexplored niche markets like cloning, bio-electronics, bio-materials, etc.</p>

              <p><br>We as asian should preserve our asia conservative image, do you know that many a time, westerners of normal genes told me that they like our culture, conservativism has it own advantage, not only we dun openly accept homosexual, we are more family orientated, more social concious of the older peoples and more filial piety than our counterpart in the west. We do not condone homosexual, we just leave it as it is, homo peoples have the right to love each other, book rooms, be romantic, etc etc..just that there is no legal paper to marriage. Unlike some die hard oppose of homosexual in the west, they will kill them, protest on street, kick the govt etc etc...you should be glad that we are still tolerable to live side by side with homosexual peoples. However the increase of homo peoples is a worrying part tho.</p>
