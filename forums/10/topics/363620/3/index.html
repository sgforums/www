              <p>what the british left behind are the common laws, it is practiced in all commonweath countries, these laws are common in all countries, eg if you litter you get fine $500, therefore, to be a lawyer, one must at least study common laws in Britain to have some credibility in future. Other than that, each countries can have their own laws to suit each individual country base on each situation. However the system of laws been passed is still very much following the British style, that is bills thru parliament where elected MPs vote.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two controversal laws that is still being argued by human rights group and the west, that is capital punishment and canning, malaysia also have these laws, and so far, it serve us well to deter the wrong doing. In the west, the ideology is no one can take a person life except God, their christian God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chiam is more or less a puppet of PAP when Singapore was condemned by the world to have no opposition, so LKY make a few seats for the opposition lor...PAP is so powerful that they can even control the opposition seats, who should seat and who should not, even now, they also said that they allow 9 opposition to come in, isn't that controlling. Why said 9, cannot be 50 seats or 34 or etc etc??? voting is free mah</p>

              <p>While i hate the concept of religion and wished we could be done with it as soon as possible, still it is currently still the most effective way of encouraging moral behaviour upon the average human being.</p>
              <p>Science has yet found a good way of encouraging socially stable behavours among humans. While religion at least encourages *MOST* people to be nice to their fellow human beings without preconditions.</p>
