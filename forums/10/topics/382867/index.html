              <p>So where did this fabulous but allegedly legal Marcos wealth come from?
              That’s where the "Imelda vs cronies" series gets really interesting,
              not to mention entering the realm of fantasy. Part 4 (PDI, 8/12/98) had
              the astonishing headline: "‘Marcos had gold hoard of 4,000 tons’".
              According to Imelda, Marcos was the world’s shrewdest gold trader,
              accumulating his first 1,000 tons whilst a guerilla fighting the
              Japanese in WWII (the legendary Yamashita Treasure) and amassing 4,000
              tons by the 1970s (as against the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ [BSP]
              mere 650 ton gold reserve). She reckons that he bought gold at $US 17
              per ounce and sold it at $US 32. Things really took off in the 1970s,
              when the price of gold hit nearly $US 800 per ounce</p>
              <p>The 500 billion pesos (divide by 20 for
                $NZ or by 25 for $AUS) is described as a conservative
                estimate; Marcos lawyers say that it might go as high as a
                trillion pesos. If such a case or cases actually comes to
                pass, it will undeniably be the biggest litigation in
                Philippine history. The P500 billion is in addition to the
                P22 billion ($US580+million) of Marcos wealth found in
                Swiss banks. Interesting when you
                consider that the 1965–84 tax returns for Ferdinand and
                Imelda Marcos declared a total combined income of
                P6,756,301.</p>
              <p>Imelda’s first target is PLDT,
                specifically to attempt to block the P30 billion deal
                passing control of the company to the Suharto–linked
                First Pacific Co. She contends that a 1967 deal
                establishes the Marcoses as the real owners of PLDT, not
                the leading crony family, the Cojuangcos. She is targeting
                the Philippines’ leading capitalists, such as
                billionaire Lucio Tan (Fortune Tobacco, Allied Banking,
                Asia Brewery, and Philippine Airlines. He is also a very
                close friend and ally of President Estrada). "That
                Lucio Tan, he’s nothing, just somebody who used to buy
                used bottles" (ibid). Her logic is impeccable – the
                Government, via the Presidential Commission for Good
                Government (PCGG) has tried since the mid 1980s to prove
                that these companies are Marcos owned and controlled. It
                has been stymied at every step by failure to prove
                ownership. So now Imelda openly admits ownership, and
                wants control back. But unlike the PCGG, she asserts that
                ownership came from legal, not illegal, Marcos wealth and
                that her motive for going public is to clear her late
                husband of the accusation of being a thief. Indeed, Imelda
                claims that Marcos used his vast fortune to personally
                finance the development of the Philippines – but
                presents zero evidence to support this incredible claim.</p>

              <p><span>The Marcos gold deposits alone,
              Zobel said, may have reached US$35 billion. Zobel had also mentioned
              the US$13.4 billion Irene Marcos Araneta account at the Union Bank of
              Switzerland. The gold bars are allegedly kept in various banks in
              Portugal, Vatican City, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, Solomon Island,
              and the US. Zobel said Marcos obtained the gold bars after the
              Liberation (1946) from the Yamashita treasure and from soldiers who
              sold their gold bars for only US$20 per bar. Another version was that
              of Rogelio Roxas who claimed that Marcos' men seized the real golden
              buddha from his house at Aurora Hills in Baguio City on April 5, 1971.
              The buddha reportedly costs billions of dollars.<br> <br>In
              February 2001, the Philippine Daily Inquirer disclosed the alleged
              attempt of Irene Marcos Araneta to launder billions of dollars in
              deposits under the 885931 accounts from Union Bank of Switzerland to
              Deutsche Banks in Dusseldorf, Germany. Aside from the Marcos family and
              the Philippine government, the 9,539 victims of human rights under the
              Marcos regime have interest in the Marcos wealth</span></p>
