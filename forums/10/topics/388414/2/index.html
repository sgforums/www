              <p>Well, I agree to what shunmugam has said about singaporeans are choosy in looking for job...</p>
              <p>Locals are really too choosy about looking for a job. Everyone wants to find a perfect job.</p>
              <p>High salary, 5 day week... And always thinking about slacking while working... Things are often not up to standerd...</p>
              <p>Think about it...</p>
              <p>If you need to look for a job now, are you willing to take up a 6 days work week job with only 1k pay?</p>
              <p>Of couse you will say you are willing, but often you will go around looking for higher pay job.</p>
              <p>Employers don't have the time to wait for us to choose... they have a business to run... Which is why they fill the empty slots in with foriengers rather then singaporeans...</p>
              <p>Then here come the singaporean, complaining.</p>

              <p>Sorry I am disagreed with you for this.</p>
              <p>Supposing or putting yourself in one's shoe.</p>
              <p>He has 2 kids, wife is a housewife and a parents who is retired and old.</p>
              <p>He offered $1k per month job, can he take the job? $1k after cpf is $800. How to support the family with this amount.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not that sporean are choosy, sporean are fighting for own survival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He cannot take $1k per month job cos the salary simply cannot feed and support the family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is indeed lower income group as those group suffer the most.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also especially middle income group that has been retrench or jobless, they no choice downgrade but then cannot sustain $1k per mth job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope u understand this.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>He cannot take $1k per month job cos the salary simply cannot feed and support the family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is indeed lower income group as those group suffer the most.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also especially middle income group that has been retrench or jobless, they no choice downgrade but then cannot sustain $1k per mth job.</p>
