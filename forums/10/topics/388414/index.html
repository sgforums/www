              <h1>Shanmugam defends foreign workers: They are doing jobs Singaporeans “shun”</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">January 18, 2010</span></p>
              <p>For some strange reason, it was not the Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong, but Law Minister K Shanmugam who has been defending the ruling party’s pro-foreigner policy, lately a testimony of Singapore’s “multi-talented” ministers who command the highest salaries in the world.</p>
              <p>During a dialogue session with Yew Tee residents yesterday, Mr Shanmugam jumped to the defence of foreigners and blamed locals for being “choosy” about jobs instead.</p>
              <p>“Contrary to popular belief, foreigners who take up low-paying jobs here are not depriving Singaporeans of work. Rather, they are doing jobs Singaporeans shun,” he said, echoing a view espoused previously by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong who claimed that foreigners are needed to “build HDB flats and MRT lines”.</p>
              <p>A resident had complained that “foreigners were crowding Singaporeans out of jobs, depriving them from even becoming cleaners.”</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam disputed the statement:</p>
              <p><em>“The ‘actual practical reality’ was that employers often turned to foreigners only as a last resort when they cannot find local staff. More often than not, employers were even willing to pay Singaporeans more…..If the foreign worker gets $800, we’ll try to get the Singaporean $1,300. But you have to work on weekends. The Singaporean says ‘no’.”</em></p>
              <p>His stance was repeated by several PAP leaders in the past who refused to acknowledge the problem which is largely caused by their flawed immigration and labor policies.</p>
              <p>During a May Day Rally in 2009, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong claimed that foreign workers were of “value” to Singapore:</p>
              <p><em>‘They are not here to steal our jobs, but to help us enlarge the economic pie….Foreign workers were of value to Singapore. Because they are hard-working and willing to work long hours, coffeeshops can stay open late or even round the clock. The airport, seaport, factories, offices, hotels, restaurants and retail outlets here can offer better service and business hours. Even smaller businesses, such as neighbourhood shops, can reduce business costs and stay afloat if they hire some foreign workers on top of locals,”</em> he said.</p>
              <p>NTUC Secretary-General and Minister in Prime Minister’s Office Lim Swee Say added:</p>
              <p><em>“‘Let us be very clear. Foreign workers…are our partners because they are here working together with us…that makes us the number one workforce in the world.’”</em></p>
              <p><strong>[Source: Straits Times, 2 May 2009]</strong></p>
              <p>Mr Lim’s shameless boast about Singapore being the “number one” workforce in the world is quite “divorced from reality” as a recent article by Wall Street Journal revealed that the relentless influx of foreigners into Singapore over the last few years has decreased the wages of Singaporeans, lowered labor productivity, increased the cost of living and led directly to a lower standard of living.</p>
              <p>While in the past, only very highly qualified foreigners or those doing menial jobs like construction were permitted to work in Singapore, there are increasingly number of semi-skilled foreigners who are competing directly with locals for jobs which can otherwise be taken up by them.</p>
              <p>Singapore Courts splashed a full-page job advertisement in the Malaysian newspaper The Star last weekend seeking Malaysians for various positions in Singapore such as cashiers, operation executives, and assistant accountants.</p>
              <p>The interview will be held today from 9am to 5pm at The Puteri Pacific, Johor Bahru.</p>
              <p>If foreigners are indeed doing jobs only shunned by Singaporeans, why is Courts not employing locals for these positions?</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans not interested in working as cashiers, operation executives and assistant accountants?</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam added that “foreigners were not to be blamed for retrenched workers being unable to get re-employed at their old pay.” due to “companies still being uncertain about the economy and workers who may not have the right skills.”</p>
              <p><em>‘So, our problem are people above 40. So NTUC sends them for job schemes where they get them trained, but individuals also have to reduce expectations,’ </em>he said.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the problem still lies with Singaporeans – we are too choosy about jobs and we have too high expectations, and not the PAP which opens the floodgates to let in too many foreigners in too short a time.</p>
              <p>One thing Singaporeans can be very “clear” about judging from recent statements made by PAP leaders is that they and the foreigners are “partners” in Singapore and we are no more than “sheep” driven around by them, to borrow the words of the second most senior “lion” in the cabinet Goh Chok Tong.</p>

              <p>Uncle John,</p>
              <p>You can dig the road for 12 hours or not, you can balance yourself on a beam in construction site 50 floor up or not??? or Can you go into a 100 degrees C ship engine room and work there for a day or not? I think most likely you will end up in hospital A &amp; E dept. If you really want to work in such condition, i know a casket company giving discount.</p>
              <p>The most singaporeans can do is to baptise people like John.</p>
