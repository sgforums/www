            <div class='col-md body'>Found this circulation in email about sentiments of commoners in Spore. Which my greatest fear is for next generation to come. So why have kids??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>////QUOTE////<br>""I draw 1700 dollars a month with no increment for the last 3 years. My mum draws 500 dollars a month. We have long working hours, and rarely get to see each other. After CPF 20% cut and other taxes, we can barely make it through the end of the month.<br><br>Yet we have a rude shock when we both found out we are the third highest paid workers in the world. Our PAP Government has just told us that we draw higher salaries than even Australia and USA! Our unemployment problem is due to the Singapore Citizen's fault. Our Salaries are just too high!!<br><br>Well, just a few years ago, the PAP government says they were going to resume CPF to 40%. Now, the tune has changed. We are paid too high. Cut CPF. At the same time the signal is being sent that salaries should not be paid too high. Remember? China and India much cheaper. Yes! But does the cost of a car or a house the same as the cost in Singapore??<br><br>Next year, GST increases to 5% and everybody pays. This they keep mum. Our ministers and MPs are the highest paid in the whole world. They get millions a year. Each constituency have 3 or 4 MPs. PAP is a big party. Singapore is very small island! Do we need so many MPs? So many civil servants are redundant, overpaid and highly inefficient.<br><br>Here we have a government who thinks they know best and never consults the citizen of any decision that's made. In these times of difficulties we have a $650 million Esplanade splurge.<br><br>Plus:<br><br>We have a transport minister whose main priority isn't transport efficiency but profits.<br><br>We have the first driverless system that cost the citizen's transport extra and breaks down frequently since its 1st use. We were told the fully automated system was developed to keep running cost down. Yet we're required to pay a lot more for it. And it comes free value-added random breakdown feature to 'attract' passengers!<br><br>We have a government who on one hand splurge on the Esplanade but scrimp on HDB upgrades on the other. Who won't learn after repeated mistakes of bankrupt contractors delaying the upgrading project time and again? It is only after flare ups do they take attention to the issue. Have they gone so fat in the middle that they have gone thick in the head??<br><br>PAP is entirely faultless, so they claimed.<br><br>I see now an increasingly bleak future for Singapore. The government has a death gripe on the enterprises here and practices pseudo-deregulations and privatizations. They have no directions. Despite top scholarly decisions made, Singapore's economy is going down, down, down. And now, to top it all, they have resorted to pointing fingers shifting blames. The lowest of the low. Our salaries are higher than the US (what a joke) Now we can all look forward to work till the end of our lives trying to pay up mortgage and have an absolutely zero quality of life.<br><br>I can barely survive on my own, much less talk about getting married and having children. I guess that option is reserved for the PRs and the expats. I am in a country where Singaporeans and its government look down on its own Singaporean citizens. Where they give all the key roles and development to Angmoh expats and PRs.<br><br>Seems to me as the day goes by that the quitters are winners and losers are stayers.<br><br>Ask yourself today, do you want a better quality of life? Will and can Singapore gives you a better quality of life?<br><br>Make a decision today. You'll feel better after you know where to go. For those who want a better quality of life? Make plans. The PAP has shortchanged you and makes you slave to their system till the end of your days. Only you can change your life.<br><br>Emigrate when the time is right. """<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Appreciate...apparently story could be true or false to instigate a debate.<br><br>Nevertheless, personally I felt the recent sandwich from both ends...increase in prices from vendor which I believe have no choice due to hike in rentals &amp; GST or by self-driven greed. Plus effect of CPF cuts, own GST and now flexi + future reduction of CPF again on grounds of global competitiveness.<br><br>So why compare our productiveness/living standard to 1st world while citizens are to earn a 3rd world wages?<br><br>Yes indeed mirgate is no solution...but different set of problems. But no doubt such circumstances encourage such thinking of future generations.</div>
