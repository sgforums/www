              <p>Connecting to other spheres - vertically or laterally ?</p>
              <p>If constructed laterally, it will occupy quite a huge area and will need to be stacked up vertically into multi-storeys to allow for a larger community of human habitation.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, with land reclamation pushing our shore-lines outwards - it has reduced the 3 mile or 5 km limit from the "old" shoreline to the fixed territorial border with Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i209.photobucket.com/albums/bb111/atobe-album/100403-1130SGMap.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is especially relevant towards our southern most island that marks the beginning of the 3 mile or 5 km limit - and where there are no overlapping claim such as that found in the northern narrow waterways with Johor that require the internationally accepted demarcation method to be modified.</p>
              <p>With busy shipping in the wide expanse of water in the southern side of Singapore, it is almost impossible to consider an exclusive area for such construction to allow for human habitation undersea.</p>
              <p>Any area designated for such human habitation will require ships of heavy tonnage to avoid traversing any where near to such nodes of communal living, and which will affect our port activities.</p>
              <p>This will require PSA to move its operations along the entire southern coastline - from Prince Edward-Anson Road area through the entire length of Tanjong Pagar to Pasir Panjang - relocating to the Jurong area.</p>
              <p>This will release alot of square kilometers of high value land for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The various shipyards in the Jurong area that face south can move to the new reclaimed land at Tuas, and allow PSA to move in and connect with its Jurong Port operation to form a continuous dock front.</p>

              <p>I would prefer placing the turbines to harness wave energies from undersea currents.</p>
              <p>Especially when so many ships are travesing the area, there are energies that are lost to generating waves in the sea. Scavenging these energies into electricity would be great and environmentally friendly!</p>

              <p>being a good port here is because our water and current are so
              stable, deep and coral free. You need to use at least a big
              waterfall, either thru nature or man make to produce enuf energy
              for the turbines to work. A few waves that can topple only small
              boats is not going to do much, a total waste of resouces, cost and
              planing.</p>

              <p><br>My dear,</p>
              <p>using wind propulsion, how much do you think i can generate electricity, My dad wanted to import solar cells, but the govt do not approve, imagine your own house, you cannot put solar cells, you can put satellite TV dishes,..omg, govt is so strict, even on landed property.</p>
              <p>There is one dutch professor, a friend of my Dad once visited us, he was surprise to find we using old fans to make propulsion and create electricity, he said that we can easily order those big wind propeller fans that can generate more electricity for the whole street, but he also observed that the winds here is not that strong, so he suggested solar cells, as singapore is a tropical area with good sunshine, high rise buildings, why not place solar cells. My dad told him, if can put solar cells, how is the govt going to collect bills?</p>

              <p>maybe your windmill is too small....and theres not really much wind in singapore.but for power from sea....if u have watched discovery channel small waves are able to generate electricity....and since waves happen most of the time...its still worth a try as compared to nuclear power.</p>
              <p>maybe angel needs to have an elephant running on a conveyor belt  treadmill thats hooked up to generators to produce enough power to power yer home.i think yer batteries would be fully charged after elephant runs for  one hour on the threadmill.</p>

              <p><br>Talking about treadmills, i see alots of hunks and chio bu running treadmills all day long at California and other gyms, why not use those running energy and convert to electricity, what a waste. By the way, i run too, but not on treadmill, i hate treadmill, running on it makes me headache, i like to run on parks, good air and sight.</p>
