              <p><strong>SKM chief says Singapore will need many years to improve social graces</strong></p>
              <p>Channel NewsAsia - <span>Friday, August 22</span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p class="first">SINGAPORE: Singaporeans have been urged to improve their social graces as the country prepares to host the Youth Olympic Games in 2010.</p>
              <p>But the new man in charge of making Singapore a more gracious society said that a sea—change in attitudes and social habits will take several generations at least.</p>
              <p>For example, an initiative launched in 2002, encouraged commuters to stand on the left side of escalators at train stations, leaving the right lane free for those in a rush. However, this habit is hardly practised.</p>
              <p>And in busy foodcourts, customers walk away after eating, leaving their food trays behind. This often happens even after an initiative to get customers to clear up after themselves was recently launched.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Kindness Movement hopes to get the message across better by targeting the home, workplace and schools. One way to do it is to regularly highlight the efforts of gracious Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Koh Poh Tiong, Chairman, Singapore Kindness Movement, said: "I don’t think we should expect a transformational change in the next few years. As I said, it may take a generation, or two generations or three generations.</p>
              <p>"But I believe as long as we can improve, in our behaviours and our courtesy, bit by bit each day, I think that’s good enough."</p>
              <p>The Singapore Kindness Movement started over a decade ago, but currently only 40 individuals have pledged their support to the cause. Its chairman wants to increase that number, to one million pledges. — CNA/vm</p>
              <p>====================================================================</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The last IMF meeting in Singapore,  Lee hsien loong launched the smiles movement/campaign to get Singaporeans to smile.    Now, they want Singaporeans to improve social graces for the Youth Olympics 2010.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Who is this KOh Poh Tiong?    Point fingers at the common people leaving out the leaders who run this country.     The leaders, too, need to set good examples.    It is so "gracious" for lee hsien loong to say to fix the oppositions.    He is demonstrating he is so "gracious".     The LKY and LHL are "gracious" to make the oppositions bankrupt.   If the leaders can't be gracious, don't expect much from the common folks.</span></p>

              <p>I suppose LKY, arrogant LHl and Pay and pay consider themselves perfect where social graces are concerned.</p>
              <p>It is definitely not gracious to force the people to buy annuity.   It is not gracious to call people losers, quitters, sound more like gangster than a minister.   It is not gracious to ever ready point fingers at people when things go wrong.  It is not gracious for LKY to blame people for not being grateful.    Look at yourselves Pay and Pay before you expect any better from the people.    Tyrants they are.</p>

              <p>Social graces have to start from young.</p>
              <p>At Primary 1 - 6 , the children have to pass an exam on basic etiquette and courtesy</p>
              <p>At Secondary school level, they have to pass another exam on intermediate etiquette and courtesy. Practical exams will be held and assessed by peers .</p>
              <p>At JC and poly level , an advanced level practical exam on etiquette and courtesy will be set. Those who cannot pass above grade B will not be allowed into University.</p>

              <p><br>For me it seems like that. Cause i've been in other country forum before.</p>
              <p>Besides, I don't see any point of changing our social habits. Our country is made like this, thats why our habits are formed to fit into the different environment we are born in. Just like in any other country. Its not fair to say that our habits are not good. We simply have to change to fit into out surroundings.</p>
