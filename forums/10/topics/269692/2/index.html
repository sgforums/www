            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Singapore English has its origins in the schools of colonial Singapore. In the nineteenth century very few children went to school at all, and even fewer were educated in English. The local lingua franca was a pidginised variety of Malay, called Pasar Melayu, or Bazaar Malay. This can still be heard in the region, especially from older people. The people who spoke English and sent their children to English medium schools were mainly the Europeans, the Eurasians (people of mixed racial ancestry), some of the small minorities, such as the Jews, some of the Indians and Ceylonese, and also a group of Chinese people usually called the Straits Chinese, who had ancestors of long residence in the region, and who spoke a variety of Malay usually called Baba Malay which was influenced by Hokkien Chinese and by Bazaar Malay. The fact that all these children would have known Malay probably explains why most of the loan words in Singapore Colloquial English are from Malay. The largest group of teachers were Eurasians, and there were also many teachers from Ceylon and India. European teachers were never more than a quarter of the total teaching staff in a school, and they usually taught the senior classes. These Europeans may have been from Britain (which at that time included Ireland) but were also from the USA, Belgium and France. The children in these schools would have been exposed to many varieties of English.<br><br>In the first twenty years of the twentieth century, English medium education became popular for all groups. Girls started going to school in larger numbers too. By the 1950s nearly all children went to school, and the majority were educated in English. By the 1980s. all education was in the medium of English (with children learning another language alongside English). Singapore English probably grew out of the English of the playground of these children of various linguistic backgrounds who were learning English at school. As more and more of its people experienced learning English at school, English became widely spoken, alongside Singapore's many other languages. Since Singapore became an independent Republic in 1965, the use of English has increased still further. For many Singaporeans, English is the main language. Many families speak English at home and it is one of the the first languages learnt by about half of the current pre-school children. Well over half of the population born since 1965 are native speakers of English, and the proportion of native speakers of English is still rising.<br><br>Nearly everyone in Singapore speaks more than one language, with many people speaking three or four. Most children grow up bilingual from infancy and learn more languages as they grow up. Naturally the presence of other languages (especially various varieties of Malay and of Chinese) has influenced the English of Singapore. The influence is especially apparent in the kind of English that is used informally, which is popularly called Singlish, but which is called Singapore Colloquial English or Colloquial Singapore English in most academic writing.<br><br>Singlish is a badge of identity for many Singaporeans, and, as you can see from the satirical website, Talkingcock, there are some websites that are written in it. Many Singaporeans move smoothly between Singapore Colloquial English and Standard English. As most Singaporeans use a lot of Singapore Colloquial English to their children, children tend to speak Singapore Colloquial English before they speak Standard English. It is still the case in Singapore that the younger you are and the richer your family is, the more likely you are to have English (and that usually means Singapore Colloquial English) as your native language. But Standard English is used in formal contexts, as it is all over the English-using world. Take a look at Singapore's leading English newspaper, The Straits Times.<br><br>Since the 1960s linguists and sociologists have studied the features and the functions of English in Singapore from a number of perspectives. Those who would like to know about studies of Singapore English should look at my annotated list of the major works on Singapore English. You might also like to look at the articles which I wrote on Singapore English for Speech Therapists. David Deterding maintains a full scholarly bibliography of academic work on Singapore English.<br><br>There is also plenty of creative work in English by Singaporeans and you can find lots of information about Singapore literature at the Contemporary and Postcolonial and Postimperial Literature in English site maintained by George Landow.<br><br>You can read more about the history of Singapore English in:<br><br>Gupta, Anthea Fraser. 1994.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Mechanics<br>Code-switching is distinct from pidgin, in which features of two languages are combined. However, creole languages (which are very closely related to pidgins), when in close contact with related standard languages (such as with Jamaican Creole English or Guyanese Creole English), can exist in a continuum within which speakers may code-switch along a basilect-mesolect-acrolect hierarchy depending on context. Code-switching is also different from (but is often accompanied by) spontaneous borrowing of words from another language, sometimes outfitted with the inflections of the host language, sometimes not.<br><br>Code-switching within a sentence tends to occur more often at points where the syntax of the two languages align; thus it is uncommon to switch from English to French after an adjective and before a noun, because a French noun normally "expects" its adjectives to follow it. It is, however, often the case that even unrelated languages can be "aligned" at the boundary of a relative clause or other sentence sub-structure.<br><br>Intersentential switching, switching outside the sentence or clause level, for example at sentence or clause boundaries<br>Intra-sentential switching, switching within a sentence or clause<br>Tag-switching, switching a tag phrase or word from language B into language A (this is a common intra-sentential switch)<br>Intra-word switching, switching within a word itself, such as at morpheme boundary<br><br>Example<br>Kroskrity (2000:340-341) gives the following example of code-switching by three older male Arizona Tewa speakers, who are trilingual in Tewa, Hopi, and English. The topic concerns the selection of a site for a new high school on the eastern Hopi Reservation:<br><br>Speaker A: Tututqaykit qanaanawakna. [spoken in Hopi]<br>Speaker B: WÃ©dÃ­tÂ’Ã³kÃ¡nkÂ’egenaÂ’adi imbÃ­ akhonidi. [spoken in Tewa]<br>Speaker C: NaembÃ­ eeyae nąeląemo dÃ­bÃ­tÂ’Ã³Â’Ã¡mmÃ­ kąayįÂ’į wÃ©dimu::di. [spoken in Tewa]<br>English translation:<br><br>Speaker A: "Schools were not wanted." [spoken in Hopi]<br>Speaker B: "They didn't want a school on their land." [spoken in Tewa]<br>Speaker C: "It's better if our children go to school right here rather than far away." [spoken in Tewa]<br>In this two-hour conversation, these men had been speaking primarily in Tewa. However, when Speaker A makes a statement that considers the Hopi Reservation as a whole, he switches to Hopi. This usage of the Hopi language when speaking of Hopi-related issues is a conversational norm in the Arizona Tewa speech community. Kroskrity makes the claim that these Arizona Tewa who identify both as Hopi and Tewa use the different languages to help construct and maintain these discrete ethnic identities linguistically.<br><br>See also</blockquote></div>

Linguists now agree that this early claim was incorrect[citation needed].<br><br>There are two principal directions in which code-switching research has developed. One focuses on the social motivations for switching, a line of inquiry concentrating both on immediate discourse factors such as lexical need and the topic and setting of the discussion, and on more distant factors such as speaker or group identity, and relationship-building.<br><br>The other direction of research concerns syntactic constraints on switching. This is a line of inquiry that has postulated grammatical rules and specific syntactic boundaries for where and why a switch may occur.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Indeed here's a tip, if you are unable to understand something directed at you... do not be too quick to brush it off with a witty one-liner or you might actually end up proving your opponent's point.<br><br>Just becuause you do not understand the point directed at you does not mean that others do not, and in which case your one-liner and claims of self-victory actually works against you.<br><br>In the same vein, just because you do not understand a word like <span style="font-style: italic;">Curriculum Vitae</span>, you do not assume that all the companies in the world are idiots for asking you for it... you might be hard pressed to find employment with such an attitude.<br><br>Not say I want to say you leh, but you want to post a witty rebuttal, at least do it properly lah, if not it's just lame and reflecting badly on you when you pwn yourself with each post leh.<br><br>I mean seriously, there are so many better things you can write that would be far more effective in affecting your opponents instead of constant claims of victory and the-only-thing-that-matters-is-what-matters-to-me which kinda loses it's effect when you have used it too many times liao. I mean if you actually bothered to use some wit, it might actually have an effect... I mean seriously, what you are doing here is just... lame.</div>
