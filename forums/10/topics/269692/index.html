            <div class='col-md body'>Like it or not Singlish will be here to stay, for the simple reason you can't stop a grassroots movement that arises from the failings of our own language policy.<br><br>Singlish was the child of the artifical attempts to enforce one mother tounge on the local population regardless of their dialect, as well as making them bilingual in english as a functioning language. Not to mention having a mismash of languages like malay as our national language, english as our functioning one, and pushing chinese to the local population.<br><br>While this served to work for a while, it is no surprise that eventually the locals who feel left out of the loop will find a more efficent way to communicate much to the government's despair.<br><br>So no matter what the purists say, Singlish will survive no matter how hard the government attempts to hit it short of a total ban and fine for its utterance (and even I doubt that will help), and as long as a marginalized linguistic culture survives in our various dialects, it will trive.<br><br>In Singapore, Queen's English is simply no match for Singlish in its ability to reach out to the masses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL, you're missing out the point... if there's anything more obvious from the language policies of Singapore is that it has created a disparity of skill in the midst of its speakers.<br><br>This condition is not unique to Singapore, but you could say that Singapore has been less consistent in dealing with it. This is because Singapore often pushes a contradictary language policy when it comes to promoting it's languages, trying to push for good english (for functional purposes) as well as mother tounge (for social purposes), and then keeping a national language of malay. All this while ignoring the cultural and social aspect that arises from dialect that leads the some being quite confused in which language they can muster.<br><br>If you won't take it from me, at least take it from others who have observed the same thing.<br><br><blockquote>How this situation came about is too complex a tale for here, not that I even know half of it, but I shall touch briefly on the role played by our politics.<br><br>Up until the 1960s, and even in schools where English was the medium of instruction, no one assumed that the children spoke English as a family language. Consequently, the methods used were those of teaching English as a second language, which meant very careful attention paid to enlarging vocabulary and instilling the rules of grammar. Much time was spent on grammar drills to hone the pupils' skills at things like the future perfect tense, the subjunctive and the fine shades of meaning among similar words. See example at right.<br><br>However, in the 1970s, a rapid conversion of all schools into English-medium ones took place, as the government shut down Chinese, Malay and Tamil-medium schools. As demand for English teachers grew, so standards fell. Furthermore, geography, physics or carpentry teachers were also required to use English in their classes, but as these adults were not using English as their first language, it meant that the students would hear broken English from those teachers.<br><br>In addition, the rapid expansion of English-medium education meant that students from families that never used English at home had to use English in school. This was unlike the previous decades when the English-medium schools tended to attract pupils from homes that did speak some English. Just when the task of teaching English became wider and harder, the difficulty of getting teachers who spoke good English became greater.<br><br>At around the same time, the Education ministry experimented with American teaching methods. Those were the days when British prestige had sunk to new lows and even the Sterling Pound had to be bailed out by the IMF. America was the shining example of modernity. These teaching methods involved more listening and speaking than being drilled in grammar rules.<br><br>It was a hopelessly misguided change, for the linguistic background in Singapore was nothing like White middle-class America, where children absorbed English with mother's milk. Learning by immersion and example cannot work if the environment was saturated with bad English.<br><br>(Nowadays, the scales have fallen from our eyes. Every time we see some American write on any bulletin board something like, "What I want to know is whether your expected to tip...." we see living proof that teaching language without grammar drills simply doesn't work.)<br><br>Another American idiocy imported into our education system was the multiple-choice test. I myself don't remember any use of multiple-choice testing when it came to English in my schooldays. We had to write long essays. We had to read and re-read dense passages followed by some questions to test our understanding of the text, and those questions had to be answered with a paragraph or two. We had to paraphrase other sentences or condense an entire paragraph into a key sentence to capture the gist of it. We had to pen telegrams in exactly 25 words (which I thought was a useless skill since telegrams were obsolescent, only to discover decades later that I can tap out more concentrated sms messages than most). And we had to transpose sentences into other time frames to test our mastery of tenses, or insert new ideas into an existing sentence by means of additional clauses.<br><br>How multiple choice questions would teach students to do all that with language, I cannot imagine.<br><br>Thus, except for a small minority, the masses picked up, not English, but a corrupted form of it.<br><br>More politics was to come. The annual Speak Mandarin Campaign confused priorities. Together with political campaigns against western "yellow culture", official veneration of Confucianism and emphasis on our "roots", "aping the West" became a liability. It was a small step from here to a general ridicule of people with perfect English and internationally acceptable intonation.<br><br>Meanwhile, the economics-trained technocrats in our government said that Singapore must preserve our competitive advantages vis-Ã -vis a rising China, and one of them is the fact that we're an English-speaking country.<br><br>Lo! we're now officially an English-speaking country, because the government said so. Therefore, what we speak must be English. If it sounds like English and the government says it's English, it's English. Since we have arrived, why is there a need to make an effort to improve our English?<br><br>It's hardly surprising then that Richard Teo, in his letter to the Straits Times (15 January 2005), said, "there did not seem to be any effort to speak in complete sentences or even speak coherently without the interjection of other dialectal or language words."<br><br>As he concluded, there "is a seeming disregard of the use of proper spoken English."<br><br>Good he left it at spoken English. He'd get a heart attack if he saw the written English we have here!<br><br></blockquote></div>

Code switching comes naturally to all good English speakers. Simply put, to teach code switching means one has to teach our people to speak good English. Code switching comes naturally once the user understands the difference in structure in both languages.<br><br>The problem is, do you seriously think our educational system offers a route out for non-native english speakers who are not raised up in an english-speaking household? Or are all Ah Bengs and Ah Sengs who can't speak good English simply lazy?<br><br>Our language habits will not change for the simple reason language habits ARE a social construct, and you can't change the language without having to change the social structure of things.<br><br>Asking Ah Beng and Ah Seng to start using proper English simply won't work for the simple reason having a good grounding in any language comes from a lifetime and upbringing grounded in the language. Hence the MOE's first few language policies were correct in teaching English as if it was for non-native speakers, but ran into error when they decided to flip over totally to the system we have today that teaches English as if ALL households were raised with an English background, language stratification is inevitible.<br><br>From language stratification, creoles will simply emerge. Singlish is not broken english as it is a almost whole new language in itself, with its own unique structure and sense.<br><br>And seriously it's not as if I have not encountered people who are making an active effort to learn better English, but unfortunately our educational system isn't helping by tieing their hands behind their back by assuming they are raised as English speakers.<br><br>And most importantly, the most productive way of teaching Singlish speakers on how to use original English is not in telling them to stop using Singlish, but how to TRANSPOSE from Singlish to English. Unfortunately since Singlish is not a formalized language, such a thing can only be done in the informal manner from friends or family.<br><br>If you want a course I seriously doubt that is possible. But for some reason you seem to think that formalized courses are the solution to each and every thing, especiall social and cultural things like language... last I checked the government hasn't launched courses to raise our birth rate.<br><br><blockquote>Singlish is a key ingredient in the unique melting pot that is Singapore. This is a city where skyscraping banks tower over junk boats; a city where vendors hawk steaming pig intestines next to bistros that serve haute cuisine. The SGEM's brand of good English is as bland as boiled potatoes. If the government has its way, Singapore will become a dish devoid of flavor. And I'm not talking cock. </blockquote></div>
