              </div>
              <p></p>
              <div class="entry">
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23028" style="margin: 10px; float: left; border: black 3px solid;" title="cpf320240" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cpf320240-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="207">The CPF Minimum Sum (MS) is the amount a member has to set aside in his or her Retirement Account (RA) for retirement needs. The RA is set up when a member reaches 55 years of age, drawing from savings in the Ordinary and Special accounts (OA and SA respectively). During retirement, the savings accrued in the RA will then be disbursed monthly to the retiree.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">At present, the MS is set at $117,000. It will rise to <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1056662/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">$123,000 with effect from 1 July</span></span></a>, as reported in the news recently. CPF members are allowed to pledge property that was bought with CPF funds toward the MS, with the value pledged capped at 50 per cent of the MS.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">According to the CPF’s web site, the <a href="http://www.cpf.gov.sg/MyCPF/Reaching55_Print.asp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">property pledge for the CPF MS</span></span></a> at age 55, has been changed to the following: “If you are unable to set aside your full Minimum Sum in cash, your property, bought with your CPF savings, will be automatically pledged for up to half of the Minimum Sum”.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The important thing to note with this rule is that if the shortfall is less than half of the MS (or $58,500, at the current level), the remaining value of the property ($58,500 less the MS shortfall) becomes irrelevant.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">This is different from a previous “property pledge” rule, as seen in this <a href="http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/CPF/News/News-Release/NR_30Jun2003.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">2003 CPF Board press release</span></span></a>, which allows members to choose to pledge their property for up to half the MS.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Under this rule, members who are unable to meet the MS are allowed to pledge their property for up to the full 50 per cent of the MS – rather than just making up for the shortfall. Therefore, if their MS shortfall is less than the 50 per cent of the required amount, the remainder from the property pledge would translate into funds available for withdrawal.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s an illustration. Currently, in the example given in the <a href="http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/NR/rdonlyres/C7A3F0C7-F0E7-4B5A-9792-2C07D4B6C119/0/Reaching55_booklet.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">new CPF booklet “Reaching 55”</span></span></a>, a person with $100,000 in the CPF Ordinary (OA) and Special Accounts (SA) can withdraw 30 per cent, which is $30,000.<a href="#_ftn1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[1]</span></span></a></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Under the new “property pledge” rule, the MS shortfall of $47,000 (current MS of $117,000 less the $70,000 retained in the RA) will automatically be pledged with property.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Under the old “property pledge”rule, this person would have been able to pledge the full 50 per cent of the MS, which is $58,500. This means he or she would be able to withdraw $41,500 (from the $100,000 in his or her OA and SA, less $58,500), as compared to just $30,000 under the new rule.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Another implication of this new rule will take effect in 2013. For members who turn 55 on or after 1 January 2013, the CPF cash balance can only be withdrawn after setting aside both the CPF MS and Medisave Minimum Sum. If this is not met, they can withdraw only $5,000 from their CPF account, regardless of any property pledge.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">With the MS in 2013 being likely to be $135,000, assuming the current rate of increase of $6,000 per year remains constant, there may be more people who will face an MS shortfall when they turn 55.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, since February 2009 , <a href="http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/CPF/my-cpf/buy-house/BH7.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">property sale proceeds must be retained in the RA</span></span></a> if there is a shortfall in the MS. In some cases, where the member’s MS shortfall is too great, the property sale proceeds retained may be even more than 50 per cent of the MS. Part or even all of the net sale proceeds may not be available for the member to buy another property.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The view that one’s HDB flat is an asset enhancement – something one can monetised for retirement – may increasingly become less valid, with the MS increasing every year.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Given all the significance this “property pledge” rule change has on CPF members, it should be asked as to why there was no announcement made in Parliament or to the media?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To be sure, even the previous CPF booklet “Reaching 55” (attached) covering the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 showed the new “property pledge” rule.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">So when exactly was this rule changed?</p>
              <hr>
              <a href="#_ftnref1"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[1]</span></span></em></a><em> The booklet states that “the figures here apply to members who turn 55 from 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2010”. I believe that this is because the Medisave Required Amount (MRA), currently fixed at $22,500, is scheduled for its annual increase on 1 January 2011.</em>
