              <p>The key concerns are :</p>
              <p>1. TRANSPARENCY.</p>
              <p>2. ACCOUNTABILITY.</p>
              <p>Most people are not against FTs in general. REAL FTs. The definition of FT has to be understood. Many are innocent and naive about FT definition. They accept that a 2.5k is a talent.</p>
              <p>A real talent is someone who is a world champion, potential to be world champions or scientists with proven track record.</p>
              <p>The NEED for a FT is when locals really do not have such talents. How many of these several hundreds of thousands of FTs here are here because locals are incapable of doing what they do? Or are they here to make MNCs happy? lower cost higher profits? Are 1st worlds all like this?</p>
              <p>A FT who comes here to lower your salary is not good for you. at least this is so to me. This means the FT does what you do. Same standard. just cheaper by a bit.  We no choice need to pay for expensive HDB and MEDICALs and GST and many more things to come. They go back, live like a millionaire.</p>

              <p>are you joking?? for how long has eradication of poverty a major aim of the world's government?? and pray tell me how many governments have achieved it?? and even if they did, how long have they sustained it?? All the great leaders over the years and none has been really capable at eradicating poverty....you might as as well try to control the weather, it might be easier...</p>
              <p>The really truly achieveable method is through adoption of the communist ideology, and by it i mean the true communist ideology and not the adulterated Chinese communist ideology. However, i think even you wouldn't want to stay in such a country....</p>

              <p>Running a country is the same as running a company.  In Singapore, we are all workers in this company and the company is a family business and only relatives and friends are in management position.</p>
              <p>This company is making money and at times lower operation cost by cutting our salaries for no reasons.  Yes, we keep our job, but we are always oppressed in this company and will never achieve anything.  Instead of being human, let's call ourselves a part of the automation system.  Cannot make noise, only can work and be controlled.  The company even want to deny our pension fund by increasing the retiring age.  Welcome to Lee private limited.</p>
              <p>Like all family business around the world, it is destined to fail and the owner is creating his own family rivalry.  He should have knew it before.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Singaporeans may lack much freedom under the authoritative and over protective control of the nanny government. But one cannot deny the fact that</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">is indeed thriving relatively well compared to many other countries. At the very least, most of us need not worry about our meals, shelter and security due to aggressive nations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Of course, I would not be as bold as to suggest that all Singaporeans are well-fed and have a comfortable shelter over their head. But please, if you can, name me a country where there are absolutely zero poverty rates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Granted, the government is very wrong to restrict our freedom of speech. That, I give it to you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">But other than that, the forumers here seemingly expect our government to be perfect through their constant complaining of various implemented policies (weather failed or otherwise) without providing alternative solutions to the problem, blaming our governments for every negative phenomenon that happened to our country (ridiculously including the rising trend of students choosing poly over JC...wth?!).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Perhaps once in a while we should remind ourselves that in many many other countries, the citizens who are not really citizens don't even have proper clothing to wear, proper shelter, health care, food and even clean water. Why has not a single soul here complained against their government for utterly failing their people?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Some had even diverted from discussing real issues at hand and resorted to various name-callings (we-can't-sing...very funny, haha), or even throwing various accusations at the government without giving proper evidence. (Perhaps our government is corrupted, perhaps they are not. Perhaps our government is as authoritative as those from</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Myanmar</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and N.Korea, perhaps they are not. Is there any concrete arguments and proper evidence at all?)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The thread that ask for the death of LKY could even last for up to a year, as if LKY had not done a single good for the country in the last 40 years other than suppressing his people and pocketing their money. While the undeniable fact remains that his contribution to our nation remains significantly large, many chose to zoom in on his faults and encouraged the spread of irrational hatred.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Once again, name me a perfect government, or at least one that has never ever try to suppress their people and their ideas in the slightest of manner. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">If we sincerely want the political scene in Singapore to improve, then the least we can do is to cease and go beyond such childish and unconstructive complains of the government, but instead be more proactive in engaging in intelligent debate or providing alternative solutions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Lastly, please note that I'm not pro-PAP in any way at all, nor seeking any arguments, but just stating a simple observation. For that, I shall not reply to anyone in this thread.</span></p>
