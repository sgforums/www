              <p>I think many people will agree PAP has done a good job in many aspects. It is also not an easy job managing Singapore well, building it up to be a strong economic power (comparatively), and having to juggle uneasy relations being in the SEA region, and between China and US, etc. Foreign relations, if you know what I mean.</p>
              <p>However, most people here also realise that PAP are doing certain things that are quite obviously not right, to put it mildly. Yes, no government is perfect, but that also means that many things that they have done or are doing are not right, or at least not the best possible action. The people are here to voice their concerns, even though at times it might seem overboard.</p>
              <p>Personally, if our governement is perfect, or if they are willing to listen to the people and take the best possible actions (best possible meaning giving proper explanations for their actions, not keeping us in the dark or trying to smoke us), I'm all for PAP. But it's clear PAP's not like that. Hence, the number of people who feel dissatisfied.</p>

              <p>Totally agreed. I'm personally not agreeable on some of their policies, ERPs, GRCs, etc. But I am more against those who "twist" whatever articles/information they find to align with their agenda, to blame the government. This group of "twisters" I'm glad are a minority here, but there are alot of impressionable young chaps here who could be easily convinced, will eventually become bias, blocking their own objective view of issues.</p>
              <p>People tend to believe negatives than positives. And once they have a first negative impression on a subject/person, it was almost impossible to change that perception, even when their initial belief was proven wrong. Hopefully, more people will have awareness on what they read, was the source bias, how it was intepreted, and why it was put across this way.</p>
              <p>In the new century, with the easy availability of information especially over the internet, we have to be very aware what we are putting in our head. Almost every supposedly good thing will be countered and proven with every supposedly bad thing ans vice versa. Example if u read up about bodybuilding, most will tell u running is bad for the knees, best way to lose fat is to do anarobic exercise. But if you read up about delicated running websites example Runners magazine, they'll say running is good of the knees and is a better and more efficient way to lose fat. Both sides have their own scientific studies and numerous testmonials from kids to adults to aunties, retirees, cancer-striken, depressed, ah bengs, etc. Who to truely say who is right or wrong?</p>
              <p>The political scene is even more complicated. Everyone is "marketing" themselves and their parties. Everyone can find their own facts and statistics supporting or disproving whatever policies anyone put in place. Even centuries of exercise/fat loss methologies cannot be proven in rock and stone, consider SG, a young nation with our unique hybrid kind of governance style from US and England.</p>
              <p>The information we read, the source, and especially the basis of how the conclusions are arrived are especially important. We should guard ourselves and not be influenced by those with their own negative agenda.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Some had even diverted from discussing real issues at hand and resorted to various name-callings (we-can't-sing...very funny, haha), or even throwing various accusations at the government without giving proper evidence. (Perhaps our government is corrupted, perhaps they are not. Perhaps our government is as authoritative as those from</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Myanmar</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and N.Korea, perhaps they are not. Is there any concrete arguments and proper evidence at all?)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The thread that ask for the death of LKY could even last for up to a year, as if LKY had not done a single good for the country in the last 40 years other than suppressing his people and pocketing their money. While the undeniable fact remains that his contribution to our nation remains significantly large, many chose to zoom in on his faults and encouraged the spread of irrational hatred.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Once again, name me a perfect government, or at least one that has never ever try to suppress their people and their ideas in the slightest of manner. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">If we sincerely want the political scene in Singapore to improve, then the least we can do is to cease and go beyond such childish and unconstructive complains of the government, but instead be more proactive in engaging in intelligent debate or providing alternative solutions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Lastly, please note that I'm not pro-PAP in any way at all, nor seeking any arguments, but just stating a simple observation. For that, I shall not reply to anyone in this thread.</span></p>
