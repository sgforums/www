              <p class="ap-story-p">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress have as
                          much as $196 million collectively invested in companies doing business
                          with the Defense Department, earning millions since the onset of the
                          Iraq war, according to a study by a nonpartisan research group.</p>
              <p class="ap-story-p">Not
                          all the companies in which lawmakers invested are typical defense
                          contractors. Corporations such as PepsiCo, IBM, Microsoft and Johnson
                          &amp; Johnson have at one point received defense-related contracts,
                          notes the report by the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
              <p class="ap-story-p">The
                          center's review of lawmakers' 2006 financial disclosure statements
                          suggests that members' holdings could pose a conflict of interest as
                          they decide the fate of Iraq war spending. Several members earning
                          money from these contractors have plum committee or leadership
                          assignments, including Democratic Sen. John Kerry, independent Sen.
                          Joseph Lieberman and House Republican Whip Roy Blunt.</p>
              <p class="ap-story-p">The
                          study found that more Republicans than Democrats hold stock in defense
                          companies, but that the Democrats who are invested had significantly
                          more money at stake. In 2006, for example, Democrats held at least $3.7
                          million in military-related investments, compared to Republican
                          investments of $577,500.</p>
              <p class="ap-story-p">Overall, 151 members
                          hold investments worth $78.7 million to $195.5 million in companies
                          that receive defense contracts that are worth at least $5 million.
                          These investments earned them anywhere between $15.8 million and $62
                          million between 2004 and 2006, the center concludes......end of quote</p>

              <h2>Senator Feinstein's Iraq Conflict</h2>
              <p>http://www.metroactive.com/feinstein/</p>
              <p class="articledeck">As a member of the Military Construction
                          Appropriations subcommittee, Sen. Feinstein voted for appropriations
                          worth billions to her husband's firms</p>
              <p><strong>By Peter Byrne</strong></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>I</strong>n the November 2006 election, the voters demanded congressional
                          ethics reform. And so, the newly appointed chairman of the Senate Rules
                          Committee, Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is now duly in charge of
                          regulating the ethical behavior of her colleagues. But for many years,
                          Feinstein has been beset by her own ethical conflict of interest, say
                          congressional ethics experts.</p>
              <p>As chairperson and ranking member of <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/feinstein/feinstein-resigns.html">the Military Construction Appropriations subcommittee</a> (MILCON) from 2001 through the end of 2005, Feinstein supervised the
                          appropriation of billions of dollars a year for specific military
                          construction projects. Two defense contractors whose interests were
                          largely controlled by her husband, financier <a href="http://www.metroactive.com/feinstein/blum.html">Richard C. Blum</a>, benefited from decisions made by Feinstein as leader of this powerful subcommittee...</p>
              <p>From 2001 to 2005, URS earned $792 million from military construction
                          and environmental cleanup projects approved by MILCON; Perini earned
                          $759 million from such MILCON projects....And she is wealthy. In 2005, <em>Roll Call</em> calculated Feinstein's
                          wealth, including Blum's assets, at $40 million, up 25 percent from the
                          year before. That made her the ninth wealthiest member of Congress.
                          Feinstein's latest Public Financial Disclosure Report shows that in
                          2005 her family earned income of between $500,000 and $5 million from
                          capital gains on URS and Perini stock combined.</p>
