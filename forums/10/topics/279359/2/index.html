It becomes even more ridiculous when the Minister MBT will even offer to help Singaporeans to re-mortgage the fully paid HDB units so as to free up the money that is locked in the over-priced HDB units; and with more money to be made by HDB in this re-mortgage.<br><br>The CPF monies from Singaporeans were used to start-up Government Linked Companies - from SIA to Sembawang Engineering, to National Orient Lines, ST Engineering, Chartered Industries, and a whole stable of GLCs with assorted names.<br><br>If the MIW and the Government has the interest of Aged Singaporeans at heart, it would have been less controversial for the MIW and the Government to take 1% from the Gross or Net Profit of the combined TOP TEN Government Linked Companies - or simply from the Gross or Net Profit of GIC and Temasek Holdings - and pay for the annual premiums of a National Annuity Scheme.<br><br>Why will the Government be so generous in planning to give away the private monies of Singaporeans, but will not be as generous with the monies from their own Government Owned Companies that righfully belonged to All Singaporeans ?<br><br>Surely, in attempting to help Singaporeans, the Government is actually helping themselves in covering up their own inability to pay out all the monies from the CPF that are due to be paid to every Singaporean Citizen who is retiring ?<br><br>Did we mis-interprete the Government efforts to help us, when their actions and words are as clear as daylight that our monies in the CPF will finally not be returned to us - even as we pass on from this Life ?<br></span><br><br></div>

The main gist is about your monies being held, and you being told what to do with it.<br>Its like telling you which girl to get married to, which day to have sex, when to have kids, etc.<br><br>Finally, if you aren't able to convince your old relatives, so be it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys...<br><br>Well.... there are bound to have some PAP lovers and PAP Haters in SgForums...<br><br>Same goes for the annuities, some people like it some people dun..<br><br>I am one of those 66.6% voters and I am regretting my decision...<br><br>No matter how much we argue abt it, annuities will still be made compulsory...<br>Those who continue to believe in PAP....Let them be...<br><br>As for those more politically aware as well as tech-savvy, do wat u can to amass ur wealth and get out of this country...<br><br>I dunno for u guys but I eventually will...<br>Label me as a QUITER ..I dun really care...<br>Why should I slog and slog and help my country propser and get treated like a dirt-bag and burden in my twlight years...<br><br>PAP will definitely quote some statistics that POINT out that people are indeed living longer and beyond 85 years old... So wat ???<br>How many can there be ? Singapore is already a very stressful working society and this is evident from our ever decreasing birth rate... Can stressful people be happy and live to 85 years old ? Even if one managed to live to 85 years old, how many more years can one enjoy the paltry payout from the Annuity... In fact, how much percentage of our CPF are going into this pool?? No details has been announced...<br><br>As for the 1% increase.... it is just crap... Yes... People claim that it is risk free and the PAP made it sound like such a good deal...but actually it is not... In Europe, the average interest rate from a saving account in a bank is 5% and they are 1st world countries.....Singapore is just a country with 1st World COST and 3rd world WAGES... Looking at the ever spiraling increase in cost of living is evident... Fare hike...Electricity hike... CPI rising...etc...<br><br>Anyway..I am digressing...Back to the annuity scheme..<br>Just looking at the BIG PICTURE of the scheme is evident that the PAP is shirking their MORAL responsiblity to take care of their aged citizens... I do not avocate a WELFARE solution but the govt should play an active role in caring for its citizens... Offering of 1% is simply a gesture and not a generous move .... GIC and Temasek made tons of $$$ from investment using cheap money source from our CPF.... Where has these $$$ gone to ??? With a combined reserve of $400 Billion locked in Assets or other investments in GIC and Temasek, I am sure these investments can generate enough cashflow to fund the annuity scheme instead of the citizens having to fork out for it...<br><br>Avocating the citizens to work beyond 55 is also a crappy notion... How many can find meaningful work beyond 55 ?? Clearing the tables and being floor sweepers !?!? Only in SINGAPORE can we find the aged clearing tables in food courts and fast food restaurants.... Will that become the future for the Aged ??? Only the Ministers get paid a pension and millions of salary as they age... How abt the citizens !?!!? There are so many people with Managerial experience but being retrenched and ended up as Taxis Drivers.... People with the plight of Derek Wee.... I do not know abt u guys... But I am taking my cue from the PAP... BAscially...AMASS as much wealth as u can when u are young and do not even hope to depend on the govt... They have shown their GREED and they have been ruling by GREED...<br><br>Be smart and amass ur wealth and then retire somewhere with a slower pace of life and lower living cost.... As PM Lee says... OLD people are "BO GEH" and need just porridge to survive...No need for so much money and thus the paltry payout will suffice... Well.. Do not forget that we Singaporeans can always relingush our citizenship and migrate somewhere and in the process withdrawing all our CPF money IMMEDIATELY....<br><br>DO NOT LET UR LIFE BE BOUND BY THE ILLUSIONARY DEBTS LAID UPON U BY THE PAP....<br><br></div>

I fully agreed people need to learn how to take care of themselves, need to be independent. However not all people are responsible. I have friends who are AMs, even AVPs in a bank, that gets into huge credit debt.<br><br>I fully agreed people need to learn how to take care of themselves, need to be independent. But what if at the end, they dun?<br><br>In the case of GoodEarth's relative, if he/she dun bother, and ended up penniless at old age, can GoodEarth ignore him/her when he/she comes begging at GoodEarth's door? Can GE say, "See i told you you should do this do this do this, but u never follow, so now u suffer!" and shut the door??<br><br>I think the ruling party too cannot afford to have citizens begging them for money dun to the citizens own irresponsible spending. If citizens come begging, the government can't turn them away too. If they do that, the citizens are going to bad-mouth the government....<br><br>Personally, I'm against the annuity thing too. But this is only because I understand my own requirement in future, and I take steps towards it. So the annuity thing to me is a "liability". But how about people who doesn't care?<br><br>Even a bank AVP can spend more then her pay every month and build up huge credit card/credit line debts.....how about the normal layperson on the street?<br></div>
