Therein lies in its achievement.<br><br>If there was any quanitfiable success, it lies not in the large crowd assembled, because there wasn't one, but that it has - knowing the serious nature of the ruling party - jolted the attention of the people who walk the corridors of power.<br><br>What was rational about the 'Black September' call to go shopping wearing black: -<br><br>* Firstly, it wasn't a gathering or a rally and broke no laws;<br><br>* Secondly, it wasn't anti-government or tied up to any party but had a limited, specific goal of showing opposition to a policy; and<br><br>* Thirdly, as a strategy to provide feedback it holds future promises but only if it is not deviated into a political cause and used sparingly and selectively.<br><br>I wasn't surprised by the relatively poor response because the 'target' protestors are the better-educated, Internet-savvy professionals and students, who are generally more concerned about careers rather than taking any firm public stand.<br><br>The organisers, commendable as their effort was, had a major problem. They could only publicise it online, which prevents them from spreading their message to the non-English speaking heartlanders.<br><br>For any public action to succeed, however, it has to have the participation of the broad Chinese or Malay speaking masses who live in the HDB estates.<br><br>That will mean, of course, protests not at Orchard Road - but in the midst of HDB estates.<br><br>The Western educated intellectuals (with the exception of a several hundred activists at best count) are too few to be a true force. Nothing succeeds without the participation of the broad masses - the heartlanders.<br><br>I'm sure Mr. Lee Kuan Yew knows this and will work hard to prevent it.<br><br>However, any effort to involve the heartlanders will be extremely difficult without the Internet since the majority does not surf. Outside the web will involve mass organisation that could invite an official crackdown.<br><br>As expected, the mainstream media has ignored the event, .....<br></div>

I think it is our responsibility to do that now."<br><br><strong>Mr Lee said the CPF interest rate is better than that given by the banks, and he had a tip for wives</strong>.<br><br>"All the women should tell their husbands that the government's CPF interest rate is now very high, better than the POSBank anytime so better take your money from your POSB (account) and put into my CPF account," he quipped.<br><br>The extra one percentage point given by the CPF Board is something Singaporeans will find hard to get anywhere else.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "The government is taking care of it Â– 100-percent risk free. The money is there, it will never disappear. People say go with GIC, Temasek; GIC makes so much money, you should give me the same like GIC. But GIC invests long-term Â– they buy shares, the stock market goes up, the stock market goes down.<br><br>"(In the) last few months, the stock market has gone down. I am sure GIC's portfolio would have gone down. And not just your interest is less Â– that means your capital gets less. I was persuaded by MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOF (Ministry of Finance), against my preference, that it's better for the government to take on this responsibility for the first S$60,000 because it's a big burden."<br><br>Measures to ensure that Singaporeans have a secure retirement go beyond just improving the CPF system.<br><br>PM Lee explained that the various measures taken by the government to improve the housing programmes, education system and even Workfare all contribute to achieving that objective.<br><br>On the Longevity Insurance or annuities, Mr Lee said he is prepared to consider various options.<br><br>"You put the money, you buy the annuity, they pay you, you die, (but) they will continue paying your spouse until she dies. That is something we should consider and can be an option in the scheme which will address the needs of quite a number of old folks," he said.<br><br>Mr Lee said the CPF changes are major and hopes the dialogue will help community leaders better understand what the government is doing for the country's long-term good.<br><br>- CNA/so </blockquote>minus all the wayang, it's a pretty dead sure thingy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it a wrong assumption to assume the current X, Y generation will live longer than the current old folks. we have high stress level, and i bet most of us can barely survive such environment longer than 70.<br><br>even current old generation 2/10 can survive beyond 85. then why is it necessary to make it compulsary? and worse off all, we cannot touch the basic $4000 in it should we die early , which will be form in rolling pool. Govt should not shed it own responsibility and must match dollar by dollars so show us sincerity.<br><br>actually LEE hsien Long forgot another way to besides the few way he mention <strong>The first is to work longer and enjoy a shorter period of retirement, the second option is to save more while working, and the third is to choose to have less money when one grows old. </strong><br>fourth way, the govt sucks less money from the ppl so they have more money to retire IN PEACE!!<br></div>
