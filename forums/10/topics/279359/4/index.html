So it is to our disadvantage. The pAP is so worried about our life after 85, obviously, the Gavernment does not want to care for the elders who are burden to them</div>

They have their RCs to tap on. Call them running dogs but they are also Singaporeans and humans. If they paid annuity, they will suffer like the rest.<br><br>For Singaporeans to organise a protest out of a forum - something unprecedented - shows the temperatures rose. The temperatures in the PAP's own networks - which are much much bigger than the few at Centrepoint - would have raised in tandem. So I believe that was the key effect, not the protest.</div>
