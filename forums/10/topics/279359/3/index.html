Manpower Minister Ng Eng Han said that of the 22,600 CPF members who turned 62, 7,600 - or 34 per cent - were able to meet their MS, which in 1999 was set at $ 60,000. The remaining 15,000 members who did not meet the MS had a median shortfall of $ 49,300Â”.<br><br>Does this mean that despite the 4 per cent accumulation, and new CPF contributions for those who were working beyond age 55, 66 per cent could not meet the $ 60,000 MS, and 33 per cent had less than $ 10,700 at age 62 ?<br><br>Â“He (Manpower Minister) noted that one important reason why many members fell short of the MS is the current rule letting them withdraw half of their CPF savings at age 55Â”.<br><br>Phasing out Â“the current rule letting them withdraw half of their CPF savings at age 55Â”, delaying the MS monthly payouts to 65, and the compulsory deferred to age 85 life annuity purchase, may just be reactive ad-hoc measures, to address a fundamental core problem.<br><br>Are there systemic problems in our CPF system ?<br><br>Are HDB flats priced such that they are eating up too much of the average SingaporeanÂ’s CPF ?<br><br>Are there too many Singaporeans who lose their CPF life savings, when their HDB flats are foreclosed ?<br><br>Are we paying too low an interest rate on CPF ?<br><br>Why is it that according to the AXA Global Retirement Study, Singaporeans are the highest savers in the world, but have the lowest income in retirement ?<br></blockquote></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CNA yesterday broadcast PAP's forum with people who I not sure come from where but one guy went to the mike and posed a 'question' to LHL and actually not a question but support for the PAP's Annuity saying retirees if allowed to take out all their money after retirement will BAO XI (sure die) and lose all their cpf in the Casino which I believe is also a PAP idea.<br><br>So, people who watched their 'telecast' will also feel the same lah : Compulsory Annuity is the right thing for ALL singaporeans who may live to 85.<br><br>feel free to correct me if wrong understanding or if there is misunderstanding.<br><br>If 'sure die' should there not be a law to block all retirees from betting in the upcoming casino of sg? they can still enter but never be allowed to bet. How is that?  Why allow retirees to bet in this case?<br><br>I puzzled like sotong leh.  I super naive singaporean.<br><br>I see the key is to educate/inform the general politically unsavvy and apathetic majority what the Compulsory Annuity policy is all about in a concise and clear way.<br><br>I was given an impression that if retiree dun buy compulsory annuity, they will BAO XI at Casino. But then there are those who never will gamble at casinos even though its freely and easily accessible to them in the past and now : Genting,  Indonesia, Macau etc.   Well, since Compulsory Annuity is said to be so solid. I can only sigh it never was implemented although many countries in the world , even many 3rd worlds,  have already implemented. Why delay such wonderful thing for singaporeans to enjoy? Why now?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>Anyway, late better than never .  I hereby CONGRATULATE ALL SINGAPOREANS who will be the 1st in singapore history to be enjoying the marvellous like milo COMPULSORY (no Opt-Out even if you want to badly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  not in your life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) Annuity.<br><br>YOU Deserve IT!
