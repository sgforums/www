            <div class='col-md body'>9 Nov 05<br>The New Paper<br>by Clarence Chang<br><br>Raise CPF withdrawal age?<br><br>That's one of the issues NTUC Chief wants to raise for discussion among S'poreans.<br><br>It may sound radical, but it's an idea the labour movement feels Singaporeans should think about to stay employed longer and later.<br><br>What if you can't touch your CPF savings, built up throughout your working life, when you hit 55?<br><br>What if you need to wait until you're 60, or even 65?<br><br>Will you keep working, at lower pay and with fewer perks, to feed yourself and your loved ones?<br><br>Is that reason enough, incentive enough, to hang on to your job?<br><br>Too painful? Unpopular? Drastic? Perhaps, but still worth chewing on, union leaders feel. With a fast-ageing population and a shrinking workforce, they argue, ponder this for your own sake and the country's. Their source of inspiration - the Land of the Rising Sun.<br><br>JAPAN COPING BETTER<br><br>An equally-greying Japan, like Singapore, said NTUC Secretary-General Lim Boon Heng, has been coping "better" because they've been able to do three things.<br><br>First, make it compulsory for employers to re-hire workers aged above 60 - although "not necessarily in the same job or at the same pay".<br><br>Second, once an elderly worker reaches a certain age, allow his employer to take away specific allowances or job perks to cut the cost of keeping him on the payroll.<br><br>Third, and maybe the most eyebrow-raising of all, raise the age at which workers can draw on their pensions (or in Singaporeans' case, their CPF) - so they'll have little choice but to continue working to support themselves.<br><br>In Singapore, the current CPF withdrawal age is 55, which means you can start taking out your money on your 55th birthday, to invest or to live on.<br><br>In Japan, this age has gone up from 60 to 63, and soon it will be 65. "We should be studying what the Japanese are doing and adapt what we think suits our needs." Mr Lim told reporters after meeting some 900 unionists over two days.<br><br>"I get the sense from the delegates at this conference that they want to see some concrete targets set for the nation." As it stands, he added, the labour movement is just "surfacing this for discussion". The current reality, for sure, isn't encouraging. Only half of all Singapore workers aged 55 to 59 are now employed. When they reach 60 to 64 years old, only one-third are still working.<br><br>So as we grow older, we also grow more sedate - which means more retirees, a smaller workforce and a strained economy. (Japan, on the other hand, boasts a 72 per cent employment rate for workers aged 50 to 64.)<br><br>Government and union leaders have long decried what they consider the premature retirement of local workers - especially those who call it a day even before hitting the "official retirement age" of 62, just to live off their CPF savings.<br><br>IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES<br><br>That's why Mr Lim Swee Say, the man set to succeed to Mr Lim Boon Heng as labour chief "sometime next year", says getting jobs for 50- and 60-year-olds and keeping them there must be the NTUC's immediate priorities. "Non of this will be easy," he admitted.<br><br>"We cannot expect an overnight change. There's no such thing as a big bang approach." Yet perservere we must, he added, calling on employers and the Government to be "willing partners" and "early adopters".<br><br>The New Paper understands that Minister of State for Manpower Gan Kim Yong who also chairs the Tripartite Committee on Older Workers, will lead a delegation to Japan for three days next week for more in-depth study of the Japanese system.<br><br>This bright spark, in fact, was first lit when Mr Lim Swee Say himself paid a five-day visit to Tokyo last month. That was when the minister saw up close how Japanese powerhouses like Canon and Toyota turned their ageing workers into business success stories through wage reform, without eroding profits.<br><br>To put it simply: However old they are, keep them, train them, pay them based on performance, nd watch their productivity and the company's bottomline grow.<br><br>But will workers here bite, especially since anecdoctally, many nearing 55 often can't wait to get their hands on a lifetime of CPF dough? Perhaps surprisingly, one 50-year-old says: Go for it. Mr Michael Koh, hwo runs a cleaning company, told The New Paper: "Right now, my CPF account generates more interest than what I can get from a bank anyway. And with the Minimum Sum, it's not as if I can just withdraw it all and invest in property." For him, waiting not five, but perhaps another 10 years, isn't as scary as it sounds. Mr Koh's plan? Keep earning a monthly pay, rely on personal savings, and if desperate, cash out on insurance policies.<br><br>clarence@sph.com.sg<br><br></div>

They were simply getting us used to the notion earlier so it wouldn't be a cruel shock for locals.<br><br>Yesterday, the govt announced that they will continue to broaden the sale and lease of state-owned land to potential developers.<br><br>Another sign of bad times?<br><br></div>
