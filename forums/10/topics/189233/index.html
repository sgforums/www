            <div class='col-md body'>Yet where there is dream there is life. Life is over-pragmatic with every single action aimed at filling the government coffers and acquitting itself of accountability for larger challenges in social and cultural enrichment of people.<br><br>Citizens are herds of milking cows leading a colorless and materialistic detached existence with many losing their motivation. Attention is given to elites and their continuous wellbeing plus the foreigners who are more treasured than the heartlanders except during election time.<br><br>The victors are the inner sanctum of chosen elites and their sycophants. Leaders are sucking away wealth from citizens through housing and transportation alone. Let us hope come July the fares will not increase again.<br><br>Life is turned into souless biological existence, meaningless for many. We have witnessed many such souless meaningless life among citizens old and not so old.<br><br>Carry on dreaming..with a dash of reality.</div>
