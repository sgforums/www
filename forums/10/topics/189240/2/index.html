I am still waiting for road tax to be scrapped and vehicle tax to be reduced. I am still wondering why single need to be 35 to buy a flat when there are no family waiting for one.<br><br>George Yeo is an approachable and good minister. Lim Hwee Hua is an excellent MP and MOS. Think quite difficult to displace them, they have done good work and honest work.</div>
