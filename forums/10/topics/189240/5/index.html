WP and PAP showdown in Cheng San.<br>PAP nearly lost. PM Goh (now SM Goh) went down to help PAP during campaign. When announcing the results of the elections PAP won by a very small margin. WP supporters kept shouting "Worker's PArty!Worker's Party!" Then the PAP supporters and the candidates who won shouted "PAP! PAP!"<br>Until an old indian guy (I think it's Rajaratnam) came out to stress the importance we are still Singaporeans then the WP supporters and PAP supporters shut up. I thought for a moment, he was the only sensible person at that time in the situation.<br><br>When I saw the courages 6 warriors of AMK (I will not call them suicide 6), East Coast contender Chia Ti Lik... I was so bloody ashame of myself that I made plans to migrate before because of the government. Glenda Han came back to fight. She's a girl and I did NS before. I feel so ashamed of myself. So I decided to stand firm &amp; vote for the opposition in order to send a message across that I want a fair and balanced government. I voted for SDA. (Not secret and I dare to tell)<br><br>The AMK WP 6 warriors led by Yaw Shin Leong are what SM Goh used to praise as "<strong>STAYERS</strong>". The very group of people who came back or remained here and never Quit on Singapore. Chia Ti Lik reminds everyone that no matter what sort of election results, we are 1 nation on 1 boat. Do we hear PAP candidates stress the pillars of the election as much as Chia Ti Lik? All I remember was James Gomez until I sick of the CNA. Then use $$$ to seduce the people that if they vote for PAP they will get that. Shamelessly no integrity. (Talk about integrity?)<br><br>The election results have swayed away from PAP by 10% as predicted by the starter of this thread. It will continue to swing away from the PAP until they know that <strong>WE DO NOT SERVE THE LEE FAMILY! WE DO NOT SERVE THE PAP! WE SERVE OUR OWN HOMELAND CALLED SINGAPORE!!!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>These 9 days have been life-changing for me.<br><br>I think we all know what the results will be tomorrow. In all honesty, I'd like to optimistic, but I truly think the PAP will sweep 83 out of 84 seats. Only Mr Low will be re-elected (with a large majority), with Sylvia and Chiam as NCMPs. But the PAP has been rocked. Their percentage of votes will drop from 75% to 65%, which is a huge decrease. The seeds of democracy have been sown, and in 2011 I am sure the winds of change will blow. Singapore needs people like this to revitalise the nation. I hope that they don't give up, and continue to fight for people like you and me. </strong><br><br>As extracted from the 1st post. This person has insight on this matter.<br><br>As the English educated young grows up, more &amp; more patriotic Singaporeans who understands the importance of NS, who learns how important it is to consult the people &amp; not autocratic dictatorship. More and more will get pissed with the present styled of government. The old style of PAP methods does not work now. They must change and accept that Singapore is not about PAP. Is about each and everyone of us. Including the opposition political parties. Becos they are also the ones who will carry the guns and march into the battle ground with us in case of terrorism, war, SARS etc.<br>SAF is not built to protect PAP. It is built to protect Singapore as a whole. If our soldiers on the front line has the idea that they are there to protect PAP more than our country, what will they think. I was an Army Regular before and though I cannot remember the SAF pledge, I remember the last 3 words "WITH OUR LIVES". Total commitment and integrity to fight and if need be fight to the last man before we die for the country than to let the pains of WW2 happen to our homeland again. Not fight for PAP or PM Lee.</div>

Mr Khaw Boon Wan &amp; Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam are some of the PAP candidates that really did very well. If last night Mr Khaw loses Sembawang, I think Heaven must be blind.<br><br>Mr Chiam See Tong, Mr Low Thia Kiang are the longest running oppositions. They are elected despit the lures of money from PAP shows that these 2 are more than quality and integrity.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have no respect for a Prime Minister who can't even be honest in admitting that the result in his own constituency was below expectation, and calls it a "strong mandate".  By doing so, he is behaving like an ostrich and I believe he is lying about his innermost feelings.<br><br>This is the first time in our history that the PM polls less than the national average in a GE - 66.1% versus 66.6%.  And he is fighting a first time team averaging 30 years old!<br><br>He has also conveniently forgotten that he himself had said that he hoped to cost his opponents some money, meaning they will lose their deposit (by polling less than 12.5%).   PAP Chairman Lim Boon Heng also said they expect the high 80s.<br><br>A PM that prefers to gloss over the facts deserves no respect.<br><br>And a media that also fails to point these facts out, well what can I say?<br><br></div>

Elites may also treat others as not being good enough to be their companions. Thus elitism sees an elite as occupying a special position of authority or privilege in a group, set apart from the majority of people who do not match up with their abilities or attributes. Thus this selected elite is treated with favouritism.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I have no respect for a Prime Minister who can't even be honest in admitting that the result in his own constituency was below expectation, and calls it a "strong mandate"</blockquote>no lah; as a prime minister, he got his own ego and status to protect mah.....that one is understandable.<br><br>what i cannot stand is the straits times(Sunday times today). the headline contained something like "PM gets strong mandate or something".<br>somewhere in the paper, there's also mention of "Singaporeans decided they want only 2 opposition in Parliament"(somewhere around there).<br><br>and there used to be mention of how impartial the straits times is? maybe not when it comes to Poor Also Pay, Punish And Pay kind of matters.<br>strong mandate at 66%? i say that's "not a very steady mandate". strong mandate should be a solid 85% and above. whoa......ST's expectations so low meh? 66% = strong? 80% == dictatorship? 90% == God?<br><br>also, the trend in the number of votes the opposition get......u all got notice anot? all the oppposition have gotten more votes and improvement compared to GE 2001. if the opposition keeps going like this, GE 2011 will be opposition gets strong mandate liao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>with the rising number of youths and the new educated who starts to question the government and such, i think it's only a matter of time(maybe after GE 2011 and GE 2016) before SG is ruled by 60% opposition, 40% PAP.<br><br>when that time comes, then we won't be such a peaceful country liao; most probably some kind of US. or in a worse case scenario, Indonesia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>opposition is good, but not too much lah, or else country will also crumble.<br>PM Lee said that SG is so strong nowadays because we have a dominant ruling party; that one is correct lah, but we also need some opposition in check one. PAP must be open-hearted enough to accept this : without light, shadows can never be formed.<br>the best is : out of the 87 seats in parliament, the opposition should occupy 30%, the PAP should occupy 70%. then if got crap like cost of living go up terribly, got something to hit them back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>also, for steve chia to quit politics, quit sad leh. ok lah, he took sexy photos and nude pictures, but what's wrong with that? personal hobby got wrong meh? satisfy sex drives is normal mah!<br>look at Clinton and Bush lah. Clinton got big big affair and got into a mess, but all was fine afterwards. Bush is loyal to his wife, no affair.<br>but in terms of running the country, who is a better American president? Clinton lah!<br>this shows that even if a MP/Minister/PM/President has sex stuff to fulfil, if they can run a country/county/state/GRC/province/city/town/area/ward well, what does it matter?<br>it's more "shun(4)-yan(3)" than people who treat others to S$2 abalone porridge, shark fins and trips to Malacca. as if that's not enough, still send Gohliath down to help. 2 against 1? but the "One" still wins leh!<br>somemore got slogan one, like the previous World Cup Korean slogan that goes "Oh Korea! Oh Korea!"<br>but for this GE 2006, it's "Potong Pasir, Chiam See Tong! Potong Pasir, Chiam See Tong!"<br>can trademark this already wor!<br><br>also, more XMM nowdays really cannot make it. they should behave more like Glenda Han mah.

I have always been patriotic, until the age of 16 I never missed a single NDP and I would cry if for some reason I couldn't watch it live. I would record it on tape and watch it again and again. Lee Kuan Yew was my hero. I used to think 'this great man has done so much for Singapore.' My heart swelled with pride whenever I saw them play his life-story on the big screen during NDP, his communist fighting days and independence from Malaysia, etc.<br><br>However, as I grew older, I became disillusioned. The turning point for me was the Cheng San incident in 1997. I was shocked that my 'hero' could stoop so low, to attack Tang Liang Hong and Jeyaretnam, and twist the law in their own favour. With my new found curiosity, I started researching on my own, including reading books like 'To Catch a Tartar' by Francis Seow, and 'The Hatchet Man of Singapore' by JBJ. I have an autographed copy of the book, signed by JBJ himself, on his 79th birthday no less. I will always remember buying it from him outside the SIR building at Lavender. He was so humble and obliging when I asked for his autograph.<br><br>I was incredibly moved when I heard Mr Low's speech. I truly admire the courage of the Ang Mo Kio 'Suicide Six' and I hope they won't lose their deposits. I feared the worst, but when I saw the pictures of the Ang Mo Kio rally, I now am certain that they won't lose their deposits. For six young first-timers, challenging the Prime Minister with all his heavy machinery, is no small task. They come across as very human, and I think they themselves have felt daunted at times.<br>But Mr Low said 'daring to die (gan2 si3) is much better than being afraid to die (pa4 si3).' This captured my sentiments exactly.<br><br>For too long, Singaporeans have been afraid to stand up for what they believe in. This is typified by the "all talk, no action", risk-averse mindset. All my Singaporean friends are concerned only with their own self interest, their own careers and their own social life. No one cares about their community, society or the nation. When I started my own business some years ago at the age of 21, people sneered at me and laughed. They said I should go and study hard and try to get a government job. That's why Glenda's story is truly an inspiration for me. She was 22 when she started her own business.<br><br>Something dawned upon me at 2 am in the morning, as I listened to Mr Low's speech on my headphones. I learnt that COURAGE IS NOT THE ABSENCE OF FEAR. IT IS THE WILL TO ACT IN SPITE OF IT.<br><br>The 'Suicide Six' and the whole WP team has shown immense courage, they are a true inspiration to Singaporeans, far more so than the gutless, faceless, anonymous PAP MPs who 'walkover' into Parliament hiding behind the shadows of their anchor Ministers. What's more, all these people had to be PERSUADED to join politics. They had to be invited to tea. And they miss Parliamentary sittings, they miss meet-the-people sessions.<br><br>Where is the justice when people like that get to represent us, whereas courageous, lion-hearted, passionate people like the "Suicide Six" and Steve Chia (who pledged FOUR MONTHS of his MP allowance to CCK, swore to move house to CCK if elected, and also GAVE OUT HIS HANDPHONE NUMBER during a rally) are derided as 'troublemakers' and their contributions mocked and scorned?<br><br>These 9 days have been life-changing for me.<br><br>I think we all know what the results will be tomorrow. In all honesty, I'd like to optimistic, but I truly think the PAP will sweep 83 out of 84 seats. Only Mr Low will be re-elected (with a large majority), with Sylvia and Chiam as NCMPs. But the PAP has been rocked. Their percentage of votes will drop from 75% to 65%, which is a huge decrease. The seeds of democracy have been sown, and in 2011 I am sure the winds of change will blow. Singapore needs people like this to revitalise the nation. I hope that they don't give up, and continue to fight for people like you and me.<br><br>I'd also like to thank those of you who courageously took videos and audio clips of the rallies. Without you, people like me (I'm in the UK) will never have gotten a chance to know what REALLY transpired on the ground, with CNA's biased reporting and all.<br><br>I would just like to appeal to my fellow Singaporeans, not to let these brave people down. Show a bit of courage yourselves, overcome your fears, and vote WP this election. Every vote counts, because every vote for the WP makes a two-vote difference (1 more for WP, 1 less for PAP). They will read out your NRIC number and your name. They will print serial numbers on the ballot paper. But please, don't let these brave people down and show a bit of courage yourselves.<br><br>That is the ONLY way forward for Singapore.<br></div></blockquote>agree...</div>
