Many of the candidates from the PAPs are Profs, Drs, ex-Chief and elites. They claimed they know the grounds well. They claimed they can understand the high cost of living standards most Singaporeans are going through.<br><br>The point here is, many of them are born with silver spoons. A lot are highly educated, they get highly paid jobs. Those who used to lived in kampongs and HDBs, have long lost touch with life as a struggling Singaporeans who finds life tougher than ever.<br><br>Looking at APs, these candidates are the people who really are on the ground and most of them are like us, still feeling the impact of high cost of living standard, effect of globalization and flood of foreign talents. They can better understand people on the ground and object for any price hike that is going to cause more people to suffer, because they too, are a victim.<br><br>For example, if I have a son who has congenital heart disease. And If you want to help me, don't tell me you know how I feel, because you don't. I don't need you to tell me you know how I feel, it don't help to get my son better. Find me a good doctor, find me a cure and when I need money for surgery, where can I get them?<br><br>This goes the same for those who said they understand the poor, but in fact, they are the rich and was never poor before. What the poor needs are actions, not just words of sympathy. Poor don't need credible people who take out-of-the-world pay to plan policy that solve problem for today's meal. What about the meal for tomorrow?<br><br>Therefore, again, credibility is important, however, it doesn't mean just by being highly educated and so-called "Understand what you are going through?", you are credible. You have to earn it.<br><br></div></blockquote><strong>But the PAP candidate are capable.  Look, Besides being an MP, he also have their own  job, drawn two salary.  And  also, some of them  be a director of listed  company.  So they must be very capable.  So when you vote, dont cross them away.  Put the cross in the box where the incapable party belong.

            <div class='col-md body'>The PAP ran a horrendous unintelligent campaign. Poorly coordinated and one with a total dearth of a coherent message. The mistakes include:<br><br>1. Gomez. Whatever plot they were trying to prove out of Gomez's application forms, they looked like murderous character assassins going after a young man who is a well known speaker and author. They thought they can spin it into the equivalent of a 'CSJ heckling GCT' using the media under their control. But 2 headlines, 7 days later, they realised nobody is convinced. How did they expect to convince people they know what was going on Gomez's head?! Their accusations were also so totally full of holes even if you want to believe them you would have found it difficult. The Worker's Party exploited it to the maximum remaining highly focussed and getting their messages across.<br><br>2. Media. Saying that the media is bias during this election is a total understatement, They didn't even pretend to objective. You just have to attend 1 rally and you will realise the disparity of the reporting....and Singaporeans attended rallies by the thousands. The Internet disseminated it to people who couldn't attend. People can see what is real and tell it from the illusion the Straits Times was trying to create. The media lost its credibility....it lost its effectiveness as a propaganda tool.<br><br>3.No Intelligent Message. The PAP manifesto looked like it was put together by an advertising company - totally unsincere and motherhood. Frankly it looks pretty hollow and really reflects badly on them. Are the PAP candidates especially the new pnes too busy to come up with a decent manifesto? Where are the new ideas from the new people? Singapore faces the biggest challenge in the coming decades with globalisation &amp; competition - the last thing we need is complacent govt and a group uninspiring group of 'reluctant politicians' who can't even bother to serve us full time as MPs because their own career are more important. You don't see any passion, you don't see any fresh ideas....you don't see effort, just people riding on the coattails....<br><br>4. Upgrading, upgrading and more upgrading. When ever the sense their position weakening, they instantly cough out an upgrading package. The WP mentioned that there were 2 blocks left out in the lift upgrading, the PAP instantly offered it to them. Losing at Hougang....no problem just dump an $80M upgrading package at them...etc. Upgrading as an election weapon is losing its edge, people know it is taxpayers money and are starting to feel insulted it is being used to buy their votes,<br><br>The biggest blunder is by PM Lee who admitted to a lunch time crowd he can't handle the opposition, he has to fix them and buy votes from supporters. His quote was instantly spread to thousands through email and the appearance in blogs &amp; webpages. In a single statement he lost alot of credibility, he STRONGLY INSULTED the people from whom he is seeking mandate and admits the PAP is involved in the dirty politics of fixing opponents. Who is going to believe their accusations of Gomez now?!<br><br>The PAP lost the moral high ground this elections, they lost credibility, they blackened their own White shirts.<br><br></div>

So anyone has any brilliant ideas to solve the above problems? (Make car ownership cheaper but at the same time not having over-congested roads in Singapore)</div></blockquote>Hi, I think that this is a great question to ask...esp in light of the constant criticism  by the ruling party of opposition party (and everybody else) for not being able to come up with credible alternative.<br><br>First, I agree that car ownership in Singapore has to be controlled one way or another. The social cost is too high (i.e. traffic jams) as the cost of time wasted just travelling around to go to work or to do business is just too high. I am now living in the Washington DC and the bloody traffic is always a big problem. They have tons of statistics to show how much that is costing the people in terms of wasted time and productivity. I was also in Korea a few years back and on the one hand they are proud of the fact that Koreans can own on average about 3-4 cars per household, they were also complaining of the massive jams in Seoul. In other words, there is much wisdom in keeping the car population in Singapore in control.<br><br>Second, I don't agree however that the cost of every mode of transportation in Singapore should be increasing. Especially public transport run by public/govt organizations (trying to be private). I propose that the monies collected from the ERP/COE should be used to subsidise the operations of public transportation. I don't see the rationale that all monies collected by the government via whatever form (e.g. income tax, property tax) should go to a general coffer so that we can see a grossly over exaggerated reserve. Now that everyone is hurting with the gas prices being in the 70dollar a barrel stratosphere, the govt or whoever is in charge of the transportation (PTC e.g.) should step in and give us who care about the environment/or who can't plain afford the car a "break". Like the show, Something's got to give. You can't expect us to just keep coughing up money.<br><br>This "solution" is not rocket science and in fact is a practice used here in Virginia and Maryland. The state tolls monies are used to pay for extra roads and other public transportation. Their problem here is that they are not getting enough money and are even contemplating increasing tobbacco tax to subsidise public transportation (so that they can ease traffic jams). I hope this qualifies for a ok response to this teething problem.<br><br>This is also in line with the overall societal equalization - the rich should not just get richer. They should also shoulder more of the cost of society. Because in the same line of thought, those who are given more, more is expected of them.<br></div>
