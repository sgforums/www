            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by vaxjunior:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, I think that this is a great question to ask...esp in light of the constant criticism  by the ruling party of opposition party (and everybody else) for not being able to come up with credible alternative.<br><br>First, I agree that car ownership in Singapore has to be controlled one way or another. The social cost is too high (i.e. traffic jams) as the cost of time wasted just travelling around to go to work or to do business is just too high. I am now living in the Washington DC and the bloody traffic is always a big problem. They have tons of statistics to show how much that is costing the people in terms of wasted time and productivity. I was also in Korea a few years back and on the one hand they are proud of the fact that Koreans can own on average about 3-4 cars per household, they were also complaining of the massive jams in Seoul. In other words, there is much wisdom in keeping the car population in Singapore in control.<br><br>Second, I don't agree however that the cost of every mode of transportation in Singapore should be increasing. Especially public transport run by public/govt organizations (trying to be private). I propose that the monies collected from the ERP/COE should be used to subsidise the operations of public transportation. I don't see the rationale that all monies collected by the government via whatever form (e.g. income tax, property tax) should go to a general coffer so that we can see a grossly over exaggerated reserve. Now that everyone is hurting with the gas prices being in the 70dollar a barrel stratosphere, the govt or whoever is in charge of the transportation (PTC e.g.) should step in and give us who care about the environment/or who can't plain afford the car a "break". Like the show, Something's got to give. You can't expect us to just keep coughing up money.<br><br>This "solution" is not rocket science and in fact is a practice used here in Virginia and Maryland. The state tolls monies are used to pay for extra roads and other public transportation. Their problem here is that they are not getting enough money and are even contemplating increasing tobbacco tax to subsidise public transportation (so that they can ease traffic jams). I hope this qualifies for a ok response to this teething problem.<br><br>This is also in line with the overall societal equalization - the rich should not just get richer. They should also shoulder more of the cost of society.

            <div class='col-md body'>with regards to city transportation, i am of the opinion that the car we have today is no longer suitable for todays' megapoli.  not only are we enslaved to oil by it, it is also not energy efficient and polluting as well.<br><br>fuel cell cars does not really resolve the pollution problem because the energy that is required to recharge the fuel cells comes from burning some other forms of fossil fuels in power stations.  hybrid cars that promise greater efficiency and lower fuel consumption is also not the answer because it still uses up too much oil.<br><br>from the time the car was invented, it was meant to be a family car, for the enjoyment of the family.  but if you look on the roads today, and you see the number of people sitting in those cars, especially on weekdays, more often than not, it is only the driver himself or with one other passenger.  we have built ourselves cars meant to carry an entire family when most of the time we use it to carry just one person - ourselves.<br><br>the bulk of the energy that comes from burning oil is used to transport this 1-ton piece of metal everywhere we go, when what we really want is to transport one or two 60 kg persons.  the present day car is clearly not optimised for city travelling, we really need a different sort of car to optimise traffic and economise oil usage.  it would be as lightweight as a motorcycle but yet offer the protection of a car.  this is no fiction and can be found here:<br><br>http://www.carver-europe.com/<br><br>if only companies like Toyota, General Motors would take the initiative to mass produce these cars of the future, we would revolutionalise tomorrow's city travelling.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bros, with all you bright people in this forum, the solutions discussed regarding the car issue as mentioned by freakass, can definitely play a part in alleviating the costs of car ownership in S'pore. Hearing how other govts in other countries run their systems is refreshing too.<br><br>I personally believe that there are also other alternatives to the COE system which controls our car population, for eg: 1) Pegging car ownerships to personal income or money in the bank 2) Impose a ruling which bans $0 downpayment and set a minimum one (30% or 40%) as in the 80s and 90s. and etc.<br><br>However, no matter what we have discussed here, we cannot deny that these are all works of the ruling party. If they have a strong mandate, things are not gonna change. Unless bros like freakass or vaxjunior joins the PAP or fight it out from the opposition party.</div>

I have a question to ask and I hope to see really interesting and smart replies.<br><br>We all hate the high COE, road tax and ERP charges in Singapore, especially current car owners and most probably future car owners too.. It makes owning a car in Singapore so darn expensive! However, the main reason for making ownership of cars in Singapore expensive is that we seriously do not have enough roads to accomodate high numbers of cars. Next, even if the number of cars have been limited by high COE and road tax, we still face the problem of traffic jams in certain areas due to peak hours, therefore the ERP was implemented.<br><br>We complain about the high costs of car ownership in Singapore, but at the same time we do not want to be caught in a jam every now and then. So anyone has any brilliant ideas to solve the above problems?

It's true that u save time and it is more convenient but guess that's the price you would have to pay in a land-scarce, city-state like S'pore.  If u live in M'sia, then u won't have this problem.

I have always been patriotic, until the age of 16 I never missed a single NDP and I would cry if for some reason I couldn't watch it live. I would record it on tape and watch it again and again. Lee Kuan Yew was my hero. I used to think 'this great man has done so much for Singapore.' My heart swelled with pride whenever I saw them play his life-story on the big screen during NDP, his communist fighting days and independence from Malaysia, etc.<br><br>However, as I grew older, I became disillusioned. The turning point for me was the Cheng San incident in 1997. I was shocked that my 'hero' could stoop so low, to attack Tang Liang Hong and Jeyaretnam, and twist the law in their own favour. With my new found curiosity, I started researching on my own, including reading books like 'To Catch a Tartar' by Francis Seow, and 'The Hatchet Man of Singapore' by JBJ. I have an autographed copy of the book, signed by JBJ himself, on his 79th birthday no less. I will always remember buying it from him outside the SIR building at Lavender. He was so humble and obliging when I asked for his autograph.<br><br>I was incredibly moved when I heard Mr Low's speech.

They come across as very human, and I think they themselves have felt daunted at times.<br>But Mr Low said 'daring to die (gan2 si3) is much better than being afraid to die (pa4 si3).' This captured my sentiments exactly.<br><br>For too long, Singaporeans have been afraid to stand up for what they believe in. This is typified by the "all talk, no action", risk-averse mindset. All my Singaporean friends are concerned only with their own self interest, their own careers and their own social life. No one cares about their community, society or the nation. When I started my own business some years ago at the age of 21, people sneered at me and laughed. They said I should go and study hard and try to get a government job. That's why Glenda's story is truly an inspiration for me. She was 22 when she started her own business.<br><br>Something dawned upon me at 2 am in the morning, as I listened to Mr Low's speech on my headphones. I learnt that COURAGE IS NOT THE ABSENCE OF FEAR. IT IS THE WILL TO ACT IN SPITE OF IT.<br><br>The 'Suicide Six' and the whole WP team has shown immense courage, they are a true inspiration to Singaporeans, far more so than the gutless, faceless, anonymous PAP MPs who 'walkover' into Parliament hiding behind the shadows of their anchor Ministers. What's more, all these people had to be PERSUADED to join politics. They had to be invited to tea. And they miss Parliamentary sittings, they miss meet-the-people sessions.<br><br>Where is the justice when people like that get to represent us, whereas courageous, lion-hearted, passionate people like the "Suicide Six" and Steve Chia (who pledged FOUR MONTHS of his MP allowance to CCK, swore to move house to CCK if elected, and also GAVE OUT HIS HANDPHONE NUMBER during a rally) are derided as 'troublemakers' and their contributions mocked and scorned?<br><br>These 9 days have been life-changing for me.<br><br>I think we all know what the results will be tomorrow. In all honesty, I'd like to optimistic, but I truly think the PAP will sweep 83 out of 84 seats. Only Mr Low will be re-elected (with a large majority), with Sylvia and Chiam as NCMPs. But the PAP has been rocked. Their percentage of votes will drop from 75% to 65%, which is a huge decrease. The seeds of democracy have been sown, and in 2011 I am sure the winds of change will blow. Singapore needs people like this to revitalise the nation. I hope that they don't give up, and continue to fight for people like you and me.<br><br>I'd also like to thank those of you who courageously took videos and audio clips of the rallies. Without you, people like me (I'm in the UK) will never have gotten a chance to know what REALLY transpired on the ground, with CNA's biased reporting and all.<br><br>I would just like to appeal to my fellow Singaporeans, not to let these brave people down. Show a bit of courage yourselves, overcome your fears, and vote WP this election. Every vote counts, because every vote for the WP makes a two-vote difference (1 more for WP, 1 less for PAP). They will read out your NRIC number and your name. They will print serial numbers on the ballot paper. But please, don't let these brave people down and show a bit of courage yourselves.<br><br>That is the ONLY way forward for Singapore.<br></div></blockquote>*yawn*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The bottom line is that we are not privy to the cost structures of the transportation companies (SMRT, SBS) and we are not clear how the machinery works (PTC) such that fare increases are always being implemented regardless of how profitable or not they are. We defintely don't want to have a lousy public transport system but yet there are other ways to support them and I am just pointing out one obvious one.<br><br>Having said that, this is my two cents. I do not propose I have a holistic view of the problem - all complex problems have that property but the highly paid scholars and other civil servant might need to work harder and put their thinking cap together to think through and work out more ingenious solutions. ... that's all for now.<br><br>BTW...Freakass...you are welcome and I am glad that my two cents have some value to you...it would be really great to have more of such chats and discussion here. In a way, it is our limited way of providing feedback (assuming these threads are monitored) to the society/government.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the most noble spirit is trying your best, even in the face of a certain failure. IsnÂ’t that what we see in this new batch of young well qualified WP members?<br><br>Would u study as hard for an exam if u knew that u are assured that u will FAIL. Or love a gal with the same passion even there is no chance ever of being with her?<br><br>It was commendable then when LTK said all the WP members were prepared to lose. They had no illusion of replacing the current governance, all they wanted was to provide an alternative voice for the mass. I guess a common perception people have is, how do I know the AP (I prefer the term to OP) members are credible and capable people who can steer SÂ’pore safely in times of danger? Passion is one thing, but ability and integrity is another issue right?<br><br>Nobody is suggesting that the current govt is replaced. PAP has done a good job and we should leave it that way. ItÂ’s just that not every of their policies sits well with the people, especially the lower income group.<br><br>So what we should be looking at is simply providing substantial check &amp; balance against the ruling party. We all have the seen the pitfall of a single-man rule through NKF incident. ItÂ’s not like having a few AP more members in the parliament would topple the govtÂ… or these AP would orchestrate a grand strategy which seeks to slowly access our vast reserveÂ… all these just sound so far-fetched.<br><br>I just donÂ’t buy these conspiracy theoriesÂ… in other countries maybe, but if u open ur eyes and see, AP in Singapore has so much to lose rather than gain.<br><br>So whilst key issues like national securities and finance should rest firmly in the capable hands of PAP, it wouldnÂ’t hurt (amidst 84 seats) to have a few more non-conformity voice. They will certainly make the ministers think twice before implementing certain polices or think hard about how to make better use of the taxes collected.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the opposition did well and their best. Losing is a great learning lesson.<br>Considering the facts, the winners<i> echoed the words of the truly Singaporeans: we must leave the election behind and work towards common good <br>My family and I voted for the WP  but that is not good enough to change politics entrenched so deeply in many minds whose votes still count for PAP. The results certainly show People are not apolitical as many so believed. Most people voted according to their lower aspirations  but for many who are of higher IQ and wanted a fairer government: I believed a good percentage voted for the opposition parties  We are a peaceable nation of people who understands the dynamics in election  i.e.  we all had the great People Power, but our people  had never wanted or desire to take to the streets to protest unlike many neigbouring countries. However, the Internet is a great indicator of the higher aspirations of most thinking Singaporeans. This is a fact that the ruling party will and cannot ignore. I welcome the statement of the Minister of Communication that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the Internet will be studied</span>. However, to take high handled actions  against those who decide not to vote for them will definitely leave people with other alternatives:<br>Which I guess nobody will ever know for sure. It is therefore understandable that the high handled tactics of intimadation by fears and threats will not work well among such protest votes. To me, that's a good source &amp; great feedback for the garmen!<br>I prayed and congratulate the our P.M. which has a comfortable margin of win, and within my expectations&lt; I never sold any stocks, 'cause they will win between 60 - 70 &gt;however, he has a lot to convince us that the future in his hand for the nation will truly be that good and work towards that for all Singaporeans.<br>May God continue to bless the people as we all acknowledge in this election His sovereign hand as expressed in the minds and heart of the people of Singapore, and to give us this freedom of expression, and to be able to worship Him freely according to our beliefs, and may Singapore be a prosperous people and may we continue to care for the people who have not what we have, and be generous to share.
