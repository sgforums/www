Once the government leads by example and voluntarily stops using such civil libel to suppress its critics or opposition the rot will naturally stop and our whole society currently so divided by fractious and dirty politics by the ruling party against oppositions and its critics will mend again for the good of all.<br><br>There is no reason once the above-stated problem is recognized and civil libel is removed from the government ammunition this restriction of use of civil libel cannot be similarly applied to the opposition with full understanding of all.</div>

Government has the fund.

Look at the whole picture objectively and you will no doubt see that it has been a consistent pattern throughout how M/W has been using civil libel to put down potential challengers to his authority or his policies or actions.<br><br>If CSJ wants to play the matyr there are many other ways to go about it why should he engage in expensive libel suits which will completely exhaust his resources to stay in politics.

            <div class='col-md body'>Which is the bigger problem facing our nation now ? A population which is so afraid to participate in political process or citizens' failure to act responsibly in speaking of his views or criticisms against the government.<br><br>If your answer is citizens' not behaving civilly and defaming the leaders at the drop of a hat I think resort by our political leaders to using defamation suits against the citizens may remain a better solution. There is then a case for continuing use of defamation suit by the government to check on rampant ill-behaving citizens who were all out to destabilise society probably a bigger problem leading to anarchy.<br><br>Civil libel is already in existence for ages and we do not see citizens resorting to civil suits so often to clear their names being defamed.<br><br>Most of our civil libel suits were political in nature some even for worlds uttered in the heat of election.<br><br>So to me the bigger problem is misuse of civil libel for tackling or fixing political critics and that is something has to be checked and stopped to bring back our vibrancy as a country where people will speak out to check on wrong doings or incorrect policies rather than being so cowed by all the threats caused by misuse of such politically motivated civil libel suits to serve the narrow minded hidden agendas of politicians.<br><br>This move to stop the use of civil libel for political purpose will also be good for the government because with such bad blood purged from our present politics government will once again become more participative and professional.<br><br>Our present leaders if far sighted should take the lead in this matter - think out of the box or change their present "I win/You lose" paradigm.</div>
