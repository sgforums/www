              <p>http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23493707-20142,00.html</p>
              <p>The UBS chairman had spent the weekend in board meetings. Although
              the financial markets were focused on the imminent rescue of the US
              investment bank Bear Stearns, UBS had uncovered problems of its own.</p>
              <p>A tortuous analysis of the bank's remaining exposures to sub-prime
              mortgages in the US had confirmed that Switzerland's biggest bank would
              have to launch an enormous rights issue to shore up its balance sheet.</p>
              <p>Ospel told Wall to begin rallying the troops. Within 48 hours he and his team had their backers in place.</p>
              <p>Top of the list was JPMorgan Chase, which had just completed its
              Bear Stearns bailout. It was joined by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs
              and BNP Paribas.</p>
              <p>The same four banks had helped Societe Generale raise cash in the
              wake of their rogue trader scandal weeks earlier. They were the first
              that UBS approached in its time of need.</p>
              <p>Two days later, on Good Friday, the banks were pulled together for a
              series of conference calls with the UBS senior management team, and
              over the following week they fine-tuned the details on what would
              become a pound stg. 7.4 billion ($16 billion) cash call.</p>
              <p>Within the inner sanctum of Wall Street's ruling elite, it was an
              open secret that UBS was about to announce huge write-downs and a new
              fundraising exercise.</p>
              <p>"A lot of the Swiss establishment had been calling for Marcel's head
              for some time," says one UBS executive. "When the size of the
              fundraising became apparent there was no way he could stay on."</p>
              <p>By the time Ospel walked into the boardroom of the bank's Zurich
              headquarters last Monday night, he had made up his mind. He would have
              to stand down -- his dream of turning a Swiss private bank into a
              global financial powerhouse had turned to dust.</p>
              <p>On Friday an old adversary emerged with a plan to undo Ospel's work.
              Rebel shareholder Luqman Arnold, who was forced out of UBS in 2001
              following a row with Ospel, called for the bank to sell its asset
              management business, along with its Brazilian and Australasian
              operations.</p>
              <p>The former chief executive of the British mortgage bank Abbey -- and
              now head of the investment vehicle Olivant -- also demanded UBS hive
              off its investment bank from its private banking operations. Ospel's
              humiliation was complete.</p>
              <p>Ospel had been one of the great survivors of the global credit
              crisis. He clung to office while Chuck Prince fell on his sword at
              Citigroup and Stan O'Neal was forced out at Merrill Lynch.</p>
              <p>He became UBS chief executive after leading the reverse takeover of
              the old Union Bank of Switzerland by the Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) in 1998.
              UBS had been laid low by the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management
              and long-running legal battles related to tracing assets held by
              victims of the holocaust.</p>
              <p>In his time at SBC, Ospel did a string of deals, buying British
              merchant bank SG Warburg, then the US-based derivatives business
              O'Connor. He later added US brokers Paine Webber and Dillon Read.</p>
              <p>The old UBS had bought Philips &amp; Drew, among other things. The combined bank would conquer the world, according to Ospel.</p>
              <p>"Marcel built UBS from nothing," says one of his former key lieutenants.</p>
              <p>"We were the first European bank to really take on Wall Street on their own patch. That was all down to Marcel."</p>
              <p>Ospel, who came from a relatively poor family in Basel and worked
              his way up without a university degree, became chairman in 2001 --
              Luqman Arnold was chief executive. Ospel had not been long in the
              chairman's seat when Swissair, the Swiss national airline, collapsed.
              He pledged the bank's support to a rescue without involving the board.
              A furious Arnold attempted to stand up to Ospel. In the end it was
              Arnold who was forced out.</p>
              <p>Critics of Arnold claim that his attack on Ospel's legacy is a straightforward act of revenge.</p>
              <p>"Luqman didn't realise that while he was notionally the chief
              executive, he wasn't in charge of anything really," says a former UBS
              executive who remains close to Ospel. "Marcel ran that bank."</p>
              <p>Another former UBS executive said: "Marcel was never someone to jump
              around or raise his voice. But he's all about ego. He always wanted to
              be bigger than the Americans. That seems to be why they've ended up
              where they are today."</p>
              <p>Ospel's aim to conquer Wall Street took shape with the appointment
              of John Costas as chief executive of investment banking. Costas, who
              had been poached from arch-rival Credit Suisse, was given licence to
              splash out on big-name investment bankers.</p>
              <p>Costas and his team developed the strategy of investing in
              mortgage-backed securities. By June 2005 he committed himself to the
              project full-time, stepping down as investment banking head to set up
              Dillon Read Capital Management (DRCM), an internal hedge fund. The
              traders left to run the UBS book followed their former leader into the
              sub-prime bets.</p>
              <p>"Ospel is the best banker in Switzerland by a mile," one UBS
              executive in London says. "But he was still the guy who sat on the risk
              committee while everything was ploughed into US mortgages. At its peak
              our balance sheet was $US2.3 trillion. It got to a point where $US400
              billion of that was held in US mortgages. John Costas made those
              decisions and Ospel let him."</p>
              <p>Donald Marron, former chairman of UBS America, said he has been
              "surprised at the breadth of the problem" the sub-prime crisis had
              triggered.</p>
              <p>Marron, now chairman of venture capital firm Lightyear Capital,
              won't comment specifically on his former firm's woes but says credit
              standards were lowered across the board, "not just in mortgages", and
              that "risk was not repriced to account for this".</p>
              <p>"Banks went from being long-term lenders to packagers. That's
              obviously a very different dynamic. It's not that people didn't figure
              out that there were issues, it's just that once they did there was no
              liquidity in the market," he says.</p>
              <p>Losses in DRCM began to emerge a year ago. By last May it was closed
              down after published losses hit pound stg. 190 million. Costas left
              UBS, but it was too late to get out of the positions.</p>
              <p>A slew of top executives followed Costas out of UBS. Eventually,
              Peter Wuffli, the UBS chief executive, was fired. Ospel, however,
              stayed put -- until last week.</p>
              <p>A $US3 billion fundraising announced last week by Lehman Brothers
              served as a reminder that UBS is not the only bank in trouble. That was
              followed by a further $US4 billion of sub-prime write-downs by Deutsche
              Bank.</p>
              <p>Merrill Lynch is expected to announce more write-downs with its forthcoming results.</p>
              <p>Expectations are mounting that Citi's new boss, Vikram Pandit, is
              poised to go cap in hand to sovereign wealth funds for another
              injection of capital.</p>
              <p>"Since the start of the year, particularly in March, there has been
              further deterioration in asset quality," Jon Peace, an investment
              banking analyst at Lehman Brothers, says. "Citi and Merrill have been
              heavily involved in what are now recognised as the most problematic
              types of investment. They will have to take further marks against those
              assets, which will lead to further write-downs."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The pain has not been confined to UBS's senior staff, who received
              80 per cent of their pay last year in shares. GIC, the investment arm
              of the Singapore government, is sitting on paper losses of about pound
              stg. 2.4 billion on its pound stg. 6.5 billion bailout of the bank late
              last year. The fund has also pumped money into Citi's $US12.5 billion
              fundraising earlier this year.</span></p>
              <p>The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is nursing paper losses of close
              to pound stg. 1 billion from the capital injection it gave to Citi in
              November.</p>
              <p>The Kuwait Investment Authority, Korea Investment Corp and Mizuho
              Corporate Bank are estimated to have combined losses of around pound
              stg. 450 million from their January capital injection into Merrill
              Lynch.</p>
              <p>China Development Bank and Temasek, which bought into Barclays to
              support the British bank's attempted bid for ABN AMRO, have made paper
              losses of about pound stg. 900 million on their investment.</p>
              <p>In spite of the losses, sovereign wealth funds are likely to be
              prepared to shell out again. If the global banking system is to get
              back on its feet, new capital is likely to be needed and the sovereign
              wealth funds are the only investors with serious cash in their coffers.</p>
              <p>Until and unless they do, the global banking nightmare seems far from over.</p>
