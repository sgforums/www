              <p>I wish you guys would stop using prices from other countries as
              an argument that the sg gov is charging too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's not like we have the same resources or suppliers. Next
              you'll demand to know why we need to recycle water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And here's an important concept it's time you learnt. If the gov
              was earning more than another gov on a utility, there is no reason
              to believe the government should ABSORB the price hike of raw
              materials just because it was earning more.</p>
              <p>Let's pretend we're actually old enough to understand why
              comparing apples with pears is wrong despite the fact that they are
              both fruits.</p>

              <p>So you think the huge Profits made by Singapore power is not due to overcharging its citizens? Which company can give you 20% return on equity in such a stable industry like utlities? SBS comfort Delgro only yields 6% and SMRT yields 9% and SMRT is regarded as having very high returns.</p>

              <p>I apologize if I caused some misunderstanding earlier. I mean the solar cells might one day be cheaper than electricity from oil. Disregard the mass production part.</p>
              <p>Well, the government is subsidizing the research to bring down the costs of production. I would say that it is better in the long run than blindly subsidizing a technology that is still rather high costs as of now. And solar trees are things envisioned by a certain govt agency (I forgot name at the moment), the one which is subsidizing the research.</p>
              <p>Instead of finding more ways to generate energy, another way would be to ensure less energy being consumed. The things Singapore are doing can be considered rather interesting, but whether other countries are doing better in this area, I have not yet researched enough to comment. I'm currently doing a report on sustainable development (which includes energy). Perhaps I can post it when my team finishes it?</p>

              <p>The amount of electricity used by solar panels production is not any less than the amount used in RAM or other silicon based transistors production. Having worked in a silicon based company before, I can safely say that electricity bills are not as high a cost when you divide it over the total possible number of units that can be produced. Most of the costs come in the form of labour and machines maintenance.</p>
              <p>My report's concentration has to be largely within Singapore. The basis is not only on finding cheaper sources of energy, but also, ways to reduce usage of energy.</p>

Let's start with the countries you like to list as examples. Hong kong and australia. I notice you're really good at digging up spreadsheets. Go on, dig up the entire gov budget instead of just one item. You'll see that while our energy costs may be higher, other aspects of taxes will be lower.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A government has to get money. The money has to come from somewhere. Stop focusing on an irrelevent issue and look into the bigger picture. Is there a REASON the costs of energy is higher here than elsewhere? Consider lurking variables. Honestly, you remind me of the boss in dilbert.</p>

              <p>If you are asking me this question, it is obvious that your understanding of correlation and equation is limited by what you have studied in your secondary E-maths. Even that, I suspect that you dont even quite understand what you have studied in class.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it is easier for me to show you how an empty vessel looks and sounds like than to explain to you what is correlation. So look yourself in the mirror and tell me what you see.</p>

              <p>So what you are telling us is that the equation between oil and natural gas has some aspects of correlation and that both have negative covariance?</p>
              <p>Then I would agree with what you said 100%.</p>
