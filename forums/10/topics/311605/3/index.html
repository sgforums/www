              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PLNG = A+B×PCrudeOil</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This clearly shows that once factors A and B are fixed, the price of Crude Oil (PCrudeOil) will affect the PLNG directly.  PCrudeOil goes up PLNG will go up by a factor of B (provided B is positive, to which common sense say it is).</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This explain that although power plants can be using LNG as fuel but the electricity production cost is always linked to the price of crude oil.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If possible, can you give some idea of the range of factor A and B.  Thank you again.</p>

              <p><br>I am glad that you learn something new because there are some forumers here who think that they have learn it all in schools and thats why they can only talk about equation instead of common sense.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to A and B, I believe they consist of pretty complex formulation basically to protect the interest of the seller. And I also believe that A and B do consist of certain political factor (which affect ths supply). Just take Dubai for example, the cost of their LNG is about 50% more expensive than if they were to import them from neighbouring Iran.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think Singpoare power plants or Singapore are over dependent on Indonesia LNG and recently there have been some talk about importing LNG from Woodside in Australia and also set up a LNG storage facility in Jurong Island so that they can import from far away place like Qatar via LNG vessel.</p>

In addition, why should I even discuss correlation with someone who has little idea about it.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br> </span></p>

              <p>Simply and merely pointing out how your basis was wrong, you would want to say I'm discussing with you and avoiding your question. I'm merely observing the discussions, and if there is a factual mistake, no matter by who, I will still state it.

              <p>Yes Crude oil and natural gas are strongly correlated so if you go and calculate the variance and standard deviation, you will probably get a strong positive correlation.</p>
              <p>HOWEVER, Correlation does not imply causation. (pls refer to google if you dont understand the meaning of causation) Hence if it has not been proven, you cannot anyhow insert an equation:</p>

              <p>Can we compile the Electricity tariffs of the neighbouring countries?</p>
              <p>Hong Kong Govt gives the power Company 10% ROE(<a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/07/business/energy.php">link</a>), and academics says the returns are too high (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V2W-4BMC984-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=969502ae0eaeb060c6124b4dd707575d">link</a>)</p>
              <p>and the tariffs the academics say, are one of the highest among all developed countries.</p>
              <p>Guess what?</p>
              <p>Hong Kongs tariffs are cheaper than Singapore!</p>
              <p>Per Unit Charge inculding Fuel adjustment charges is only 0.96HKD (0.17SGD) (<a href="http://www.hec.com.hk/hehWeb/DomesticServices/BillingPaymentAndElectricityTariff/TariffTable/Index_en.htm">link</a>)</p>
              <p>Hong Kongers sure know how to whine when they tarriffs are so cheap. These academics have the nerve to complain their tarrifs are expensive. Its just not the same when Singapore Power needs 20% return on investment.</p>

              <p><br>I am glad that you learn something new because there are some forumers here who think that they have learn it all in schools and thats why they can only talk about equation instead of common sense.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to A and B, I believe they consist of pretty complex formulation basically to protect the interest of the seller. And I also believe that A and B do consist of certain political factor (which affect ths supply). Just take Dubai for example, the cost of their LNG is about 50% more expensive than if they were to import them from neighbouring Iran.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think Singpoare power plants or Singapore are over dependent on Indonesia LNG and recently there have been some talk about importing LNG from Woodside in Australia and also set up a LNG storage facility in Jurong Island so that they can import from far away place like Qatar via LNG vessel.</p>

              <p>After givning the whole thing more thoughts, I now understand what you are trying to say.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think Factor A and B depends a lot including when is the time you enter the agreement, what is the base price of oil at the point the agreement is being inked, whether the oil price is on the up trend or down trend, the bargaining power, the relationship, political and etc.  Thank you. </p>

              <p>Our electricity rate is grossly overpriced when compared to a comparable country like Australia (in terms of GDP per capita).</p>
              <p>Electricity rate is charged in Australia (ActewAGL) at 12.10 cents (Australian Dollars), when converted gives a Singapore Dollar rate of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">15.13 cents.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>(AUD 1 = SGD 1.25)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore Power charges electricity rates <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">23.88 cents.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The difference between Singaporean electricity and Australian is 8.75 cents, a pecentage difference of 58% when compared to Australian electricity.</strong></span></p>

              <p>I think to a certain extend you are right that electricity rate in Singapore is more expensive than Australia, when you are talking about low tension rate.  This is the rate all house holds are paying to SP Services.  This is one of the main reasons that Singapore Power is making billion net profit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The picture is different when you look at high tension electricity rate.  Depend how efficient you are in "managing the electricty usage and with your supplier contract", the price can be comparable to that of Australia.</p>

              <p>The report is a forumla for LNG pricing. It does not tell us there is correlation between LNG and and oil prices. Sure, no one disagreed that the equation is likely to be valid; it definitely shows a relation between the two values. </p>
              <p>However, being related and being correlated are two different events altogether. True, the two values raised might be correlated, but neither the article nor the formula presents to us this conclusion; they merely tells us that there is a relation, that LNG price is dependent on Oil prices.</p>
              <p>The confusion here is the understanding of the concept of correlation. TCH has shown in another thread he cannot comprehend simple set theory. It's of no surprise that he cannot comprehend the difference between these two concepts too, since they are of the same nature.</p>

              <p>And here's an important concept it's time you learnt. If the gov was earning more than another gov on a utility, there is no reason to believe the government should ABSORB the price hike of raw materials just because it was earning more.</p>

              <p>I apologize if I caused some misunderstanding earlier. I mean the solar cells might one day be cheaper than electricity from oil. Disregard the mass production part.</p>
              <p>Well, the government is subsidizing the research to bring down the costs of production. I would say that it is better in the long run than blindly subsidizing a technology that is still rather high costs as of now. And solar trees are things envisioned by a certain govt agency (I forgot name at the moment), the one which is subsidizing the research.</p>
              <p>Instead of finding more ways to generate energy, another way would be to ensure less energy being consumed. The things Singapore are doing can be considered rather interesting, but whether other countries are doing better in this area, I have not yet researched enough to comment. I'm currently doing a report on sustainable development (which includes energy). Perhaps I can post it when my team finishes it?</p>
