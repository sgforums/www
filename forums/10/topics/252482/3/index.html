You explain why something is wrong with reasons - sounds more like moral education.<br><br>Character is a trait. You can never teach a trait to a child, what kind of person he will develop into will depend largely on society and the teachings of his teachers and parents.<br><br>Go read up on <img src="http://xs115.xs.to/xs115/07191/szj.PNG"></div>
