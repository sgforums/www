            <div class='col-md body'>Say january, why don't you actively involve yourself in some of the discussions in here instead of constantly saying "well, people will always find some way to support their own point of view.". Because not only does such a statement say, or add nothing NOTHING to plently of the issues in here, it is also getting annoying.<br><br>For instance, you are attempting to make an objective statement that Singapore has failed to develop the people's character as a whole, and we can really keep saying "well that's your perspective, you are just finding the parts that support your theory.Â” And keep on insisting that Â“people with your opinion are simply finding ways to find a fault with the way our nation raises our young minds.Â”<br><br>This is what C.S Lewis calls the fallacy of Bulverism:<br><br><blockquote>Bulverism is a logical fallacy coined by C. S. Lewis where rather than proving that an argument is wrong, a person instead assumes it wrong, and then goes on to explain why the other person held that argument. It is essentially a circumstantial ad hominem argument.<br><br>Lewis wrote about this in an essay of the same name (in 1941) which is available to us in the book God in the Dock. He explains the origin of this term as follows:<br><br>Â“ You must show that a man is wrong before you start explaining why he is wrong. The modern method is to assume without discussion that he is wrong and then distract his attention from this (the only real issue) by busily explaining how he became so silly.<br><br>In the course of the last fifteen years I have found this vice so common that I have had to invent a name for it. I call it "Bulverism". Some day I am going to write the biography of its imaginary inventor, Ezekiel Bulver, whose destiny was determined at the age of five when he heard his mother say to his fatherÂ—who had been maintaining that two sides of a triangle were together greater than a thirdÂ—"Oh you say that because you are a man." "At that moment", E. Bulver assures us, "there flashed across my opening mind the great truth that refutation is no necessary part of argument. Assume that your opponent is wrong, and the world will be at your feet. Attempt to prove that he is wrong or (worse still) try to find out whether he is wrong or right, and the national dynamism of our age will thrust you to the wall." That is how Bulver became one of the makers of the Twentieth Century.</blockquote>So unless you attempt to seriously and specifically engage people on many of the issues in here instead of to keep saying vague things like Â“people will always find ways to support their opinion.Â” (which actually applies to all men) without considering much of the evidence that is thrown into the air for discussion in hereÂ… nobody will take what you have to say seriously at all. It is just a meaningless cycle of circular logic that really goes nowhere with each post. At the end of the day one might as well say "you have your point of view and we have ours" without making any headway.<br><br>Not to mention they are pointing out a very valid point. As Confucius and Sun Tzu has long pointed out: A nation which is ruled by a system without morals will have that rot spread down to its people. DonÂ’t expect Singaporeans to be raised up with lofty ideas of Â“intelligenceÂ”, Â“freedomÂ” and Â“humanismÂ” when these have been long said to be Â“non bread and butterÂ” issues that should not be the focus of the Singaporean life.<br><br>And guess who are the ones who said it?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>From Bulverism by C. S. Lewis:<br><br>Â“ Suppose I think, after doing my accounts, that I have a large balance at the bank. And suppose you want to find out whether this belief of mine is "wishful thinking." You can never come to any conclusion by examining my psychological condition. Your only chance of finding out is to sit down and work through the sum yourself. When you have checked my figures, then, and then only, will you know whether I have that balance or not. If you find my arithmetic correct, then no amount of vapouring about my psychological condition can be anything but a waste of time. If you find my arithmetic wrong, then it may be relevant to explain psychologically how I came to be so bad at my arithmetic, and the doctrine of the concealed wish will become relevantÂ—but only after you have yourself done the sum and discovered me to be wrong on purely arithmetical grounds. It is the same with all thinking and all systems of thought. If you try to find out which are tainted by speculating about the wishes of the thinkers, you are merely making a fool of yourself. You must first find out on purely logical grounds which of them do, in fact, break down as arguments. Afterwards, if you like, go on and discover the psychological causes of the error. </blockquote>So sorry, we're just not going to take you seriously until you properly engage in discussion in here instead of spinning your normal, meaningless and somewhat one-track answers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean dude, I'm not trying to shoot him but if you say that we have failed to develop our soul and character as a whole, then look to the root cause of the problem and see what the solution really takes. Somehow january fails at this crucial step and remains the role of the lamenter, a person who makes a lot of noise and talk but NATO.<br><br>People in here have pointed out very real reasons why as a nation we seem to lack soul, and it goes all the way down to our basic ethos, the way we are run and the way our system thinks. For some reason these are the things that january does not want to touch, or claim not to have any problem with that is causing this lack of character... but at the same time fails to produce any other alternative reason except to keep saying "we don't have enough this and that".<br><br>How then, if we do not change our way of though from "character and all those ideas are less important then bread and butter issues" and make the real steps in our soceity to change them... can there be any real change or solution to his "big" problem?<br><br>What january does is like saying a car cannot move, but refuses all reasons and solutions (checking the engine, refueling) and keeps saying "we should be going somewhere, why can't we go?" as well as "oh well, you work at a petrol station, of course you will want to think the problem is that we have a lack of fuel".<br><br>At the end of the day, his talk is pretty meaingless. Unless we find the REAL reason behind our lack of national character, all his emo antics about lack of this and that will be utterly useless, and in that respect plenty of people in here are probably far more along in finding a soul for Singapore then him, who makes a lot of noise but is never willing to even peek at any possible reasons and solutions.<br><br>Sorry if that sounded harsh, but all this unproductive, pretentious philosophical gibberish must stop.

Not all people who think to be intelligent is a virtue end up being true intellectual, but often of the person who is of false Â“lofty and braveÂ” attitudes that on even basic examination, turn out to be utter pretentious rubbish.<br><br>To draw an example, not all people who can argue a lot make good debaters, some might just be simply dull or stubborn as opposed to having the real wit to debate. In the same vein, not all people who keep bemoaning the lack of character and thinking in our society are actually real thinkersÂ… they might just be holding the Â“thinkingÂ” appearance and thinks that qualifies them to be an intellectual.<br></div>
