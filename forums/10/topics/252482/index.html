            <div class='col-md body'>yup, i not sure abt other countries, but for singapore i believe that the education is spend too much on technical knowledge and problem solving skills.<br><br>At age 20 plus, people in singapore has obtained a degree but he or she still lacks the general knowledge about realities of life, about the nature of ehtics and right or wrong about things. They also do not know about nature of their self of self, existence and emotions. They hardly have any good knowledge abt finding a good gf or wife.<br><br>The education system and government has thus not develop its people whole enough. The priority is wrongly placed. One key aspect of education which is missing is <strong>to make people realize that knowledge is the greatest asset, proper reasoning is important and how to reason properly must also be learn deeper than secondary school english lesson, belief systems has to be checked regularly, understand more about emotions and human behavior and finally make people continous learner in life, not just in work. </strong><br><br>Singaporeans are mainly trapped in few things, working, upgrading himself for better work opportunities and lesiure time. Out of his leisure time, only a small percentage is used for developing the intelligence and wisdom of himself.<br><br>Philosophy, a very important subject (i have a philosophy forum), is not known or studied enough by so many people in singapore. So its psychology<br><br>High level of intelligence about life, not just specilaized knowledge in their work, is critical to human himself as well as the society as a whole.

Many social problem and social ill like gangster kids, crimes, stress and anixety of citizens can be reduced greatly by solving the root of the problem instead of treating the symptoms. Ignorance is a great cost really.<br><br><strong>General Knowledge is highly correlated to reduced crime, increased happiness and peacefulness, higher economy, better quality of life</strong><br><br>If singapore wants economy is be good and strong, it needs to make singaporean understanding the importance of learning so they will autmatically learn without other people pushing not for work but the betterment of himself as a whole.<br><br>singapore has the message learn, relearn and unlearn in the past which is right and helpful. It is not meant just for working but for life itself. This message is important but it is not develop enugh and people.<br><br>Humans need to know the value of knowledge, reasoning and nature of human behavior. Human needs to think regularly about things in life and read more news of reality like child soldiers.<br><br>I have told you all the secret to better life liao so the rest is up to yourself..<br><br></div>

They are not good reasoners and do not have good knowledge . they do  not think enough other than their own personal life. As a result, this lead to bias and narrow knowledge.<br><br>the consequence of not having smarter citizens is that very things singapore government do, he has to pacify and waste time reply to its citizens complaint instead of citizens who sees the large picture same of government and is thus acting as a coherent force as a nation.<br><br>i not saying that singapore government does not make mistakes. it sure does and needs it people to point out to. However, singaporeans are not that intelligent about politics and reality yet to understand problem outside their personal life. Those that i see trying to argue about government decisions are old people or middle age people who do not use internet but likes to talk in kopitiam and on gathering occasions but they are not equppied with sufficient knowledge. They just argue and it feels good for them.<br><br>that is why for singapore to be strong, it requires to make its citizens as smart as possible not in career wise but life wise.<br><br>i dare to say that readers of younger generation is fortunate that they are exposed to internet and forums at such young age because they can get good advices and insights from smart people among the loads of rubbish.<br><br>when i was young, computers is only for playing games and typing essays.</div>

Such unaccountable use of power will spell disasters for the future generation if not corrected by the talents who at best are unwillingly aping the past autocratic policies which no longer work today.<br><br>As predicted in many earlier posts, as soon as the world economy recover under such hypocrisy our talented ministers would start claiming they have done it and true enough recently the whole of newspapers and media controlled by the government is claiming success of the present system even though 80% of the citizens are earning hardly enough due to dropping wages which still are not recovered from last recessions to pay for their basic living expenses.<br><br>So what has all these past mistakes at policy or system level of government as seen in the foregoing got to do with lack of understanding of natural human reactions to complaints or problems or government policies or actions?<br><br>The alternative solutions to autocracy have been proposed many times by many people.<br><br>Ngiam Tong Dow the ex-civil servant has proposed diversifying the top-heavy decision and policy making process which he billed as spartan for courtesy to distributive processes or people-oriented system which incidentally were proposed by many writers.<br><br>Our system of autocracy or pseudo-democracy has been justified with many other look-good assumptions or concepts like Confucianism, Asian Values, Family values but at the end it is still a system as we have seen based on one man's unproven concepts about leadership, meritocracy or "pay top dollars will retain or attract top talents which do not lead to greater abilities in restructuring the economy to value-adding technology-driven model talked about for years.<br><br>Arising from the Asian Financial Crisis, which were found to have been largely caused by top-down leadership system among certain Asian countries, our leaders have stopped using assumptions about their leadership or Asian values which could not make any management of any business more competitive in today's intensive knowledge-based application environment.<br><br>Empowering the masses in practical knowledge applications in all fields at every level of society holds the key to successful government.<br><br>Without translating all the assumptions behind meritocracy or leadership or talents no matter how plausible into a more cohesive and integrated mplementation processes, leaders will be talking and talking about the same things year after year and they can back-track and deny problems created and at the end get out of failures with excuses.<br><br>Hypocrisy is only one symptom but it is bad enough to turn off many ordinary people irrespective of more advanced psycho-analytical theories mentioned.</div>

Let me explain<br><br>The government is the biggest threat to human rights because it holds a monopoly on the legal use of force. It is not those thieves or robbers that devastate countries but governments. So the bill of rights was written to subordinate the government to the people such that the people are free to do what they want but the government is limited to ONLY what is legally allowed, which is, to use force against those thieves and robbers<br><br>Contrary to what you think, communism, by taking away property rights, have strengthened the power of the ruling class and made the citizens their slaves</div>
