Makes you wonder, if he's crying because he'll lose his job next year... or that he'd bet on Susilo winning and he's losing his bet? Or is he only a sissy......<br><br>In the first place, does anyone know if this Susilo chap is a true-bred Singaporean. He speaks more like an Indon.<br><br>Imagine, as a minister, if he cannot even take the loss of a game, how can we put our fate and well-being in their hands. How can we trust that they can bring us to better heights? For all the monies we're paying them for their salary, can they only cry when meets with a loss?<br><br>sigh.... I'm beginning to lose more and more faith in them. I don't think we get this sight when Lao Lee was in power, do we? Or is it only because Jnr Lee cannot control his men?</div></blockquote>Lim Swee Say, being in charge of badminton, probably spent lots of time with Susilo. Lim probably saw how hard Susilo had worked and prepared....the relationship and therefore feeling for each other are certainly stronger and not felt by outsiders. If there are feelings, then an expression of feeling can include shedding a tear or two. He may not be disappointed with the loss of the game, but felt sad for Susilo. So, must he only feel inside the heart meh?<br><br>Then you have the cameraman, always ready to catch moment like this. If you have the taiwanese TV crew here, they will probably be able to catch a picture of a minister who forgot to zip his pants. Then what? can we put our fate in a minister who can forget to zip his pants.....??<br><br>Your speculation of the reason is amusing, 'Lim may lose his job, might have lost his bet'... but your inference is rather ludicrous.. 'Jnr Lee cannot control his men..' since when Jnr or Snr Lee control the expression of emotion by the ministers, can or cannot, where and when to shed tears?? Do you really expect LHL to control the ministers...(and the nation?) to that extent?<br><br>You sound like a true-bred Singaporean, but I din know anybody would put their fate and well being in Lim Swee Say or any minister as an individual. The well being of Singapore was never dependent on lao lee alone as there were Goh KS, Toh CC, Raja....., neither have we depended on GCT alone, and now certainly not just on LHL but the whole cabinet, the system, and the opposition to a certain extent, isn't it?<br><br>Ministers, politicians...are human beings and are therefore entitled to laugh, cry, shit in their pants.......but not all human beings are ministers, therefore we do not know if Lim Swee Say, besides shedding tears, has decided to do anything more to help bring our badminton to a higher level, like how to have more susilo. I guess at this moment, this is the appropriate and relevant question to ask Lim, if we have lost our faith in him.<br><br>Come to think of it, if Lim cried just because Susilo lost one game, and we lose faith in Lim just because he shed one or two drops of tears....are we all not taking things out of proportion?? sigh.....<br></div>

Does it mean someone who is born here and grow up here ? Singapore is an immigrant nation if we were to go by a narrow definition, a lot of us would never qualify as a true bred Singapore.<br><br>In the case of foreign born sportsman, I think we should we should embrace them and supported them whole-heartedly since they are completing under the Singapore flag.</div>

Few days ago, I read from the ST forum somebody made the remark that in the power handover, our new PM and ministers did not hug their wives like those american leaders. Whether they should hug or not is not the matter, what is clear is that more and more Singaporean are expecting our leaders to be more ppl oriented, have more feeling and compassion for ppl.  There is no hard and fast rule about how they should show their feeling and compassion. I can accept what Lim did without extrapolation on his character, though I still hold him accountable for our environment.<br><br>Under lao lee we were never so close to an olympic medal! The need for encouraging our sports and arts were never his agenda. Thats why lao lee could run the country with a stone face. In his time, there were only channel 5 and 8 but now there are cables TV. Now singapore is different liao, lao lee suddenly realised he could not understand why his granddaughter like MTV.

It is fair for us to discount all his efforts put into his training and played for singapore just because he was born in indonesia?<br><br>Look at it the other way round, if the new immigrant singaporean are not accepted as true bred singaporean, will they want to stay and fight to defend singapore? when the need arises.<br><br>or are we counting on the true bred singaporean??  but who and where are they??</div></blockquote>First of all...i said the lady is to symbolize miscarriage. If u dunno then dun talk to me about it. Not like just go to the internet and find something relevant and give me an assault The blindfold itself is the one that symbolizes that the court does not look at the person under the law. OK...get things right ya. Dun try to rephase the sentence of what i said to make urself feel more intellectual.<br><br>OK..how i define true bred singaporean. As for me...i define it as a person who are born in singapore before and after singapore got her independance and those who fight for singapore independance if they are not born in singapore.  Yes..some of them do leave the country..but izit 50% ? 10%? or just 5%? alot of difference. By the way, every country also got their citizen migrating.I know Susilo is fighting under Singapore flag...i know he trained very hard for it....but still I said from my own opinion...i do agree with my indonesian frens to a certain extent. That is my opinion, my logic and my thinking. To my own opnion, i believe that he is fighting more for fame and $$ then actually for the country itself. Is there a problem when i answer the question is Susilo a true bred singaporean?  U can have ur own opinion, but u make it sounds like a fact rather than an opinion.  I said that i am not against anyone and that includes u. Do u feel awkward in the first place to tell other nation ( especially indonesian) that how good and talented our Singaporean Susilo is? If u dont, I do. Even singapore lost in the ping pong, still i am more proud of her than Susilo. Do u grasp what i am trying to say? I am not having a personal attack on u, and i conclude that this is my own opinion. And i also believe that in order for one to love a country, alot of years are needed ( easier when u r young) sometimes decades and sometimes even generations.</div>

I am pointing to u a bigger problem, the concept of migration, ur 70-80's years old singaporean...<br>Have u attended the lecture hall?? boast ur command of english to the lecturer? Make urself famous...no one will do that loh. No one will raise the hand just to say it loh. U can trust me for that. For ur info...in NUS alot of lecturers are from PRC, Korea and India. And thier english cannot make it wan loh for some of them. So..we r used to not making a big fuss just becoz of some grammatical error or vocab error. It is his brain, his intellectual, his thinking that get him to PHD. not english. I do not disagree with ur definition of balance and scale.

It is not about good or bad english, it is about what it is.<br><br>It is good for young people to meet and talk to many ppl, but you must decide what you can accept. We should not define singaporean based on what the neighbouring countries said.  I don really care if the malaysian and indonesian accept our players as singaporean. The indonesia will have to slap their own face and ask why susilo played for singapore and not indonesia. Look at players in many games and you will find the table tennis representatives of england and australia were of chinese origin. the soccer players from france in world cup were of african origin. The world have changed. Ppl migrate, to places where they can find better future, where their potentials can be fully developed....how many of our leaders were born in malaysia, in india and sri lanka?? Does it make them less of singaporean than those born here?<br><br>Are you aware that the cream of the top malaysian chinese schools can gain direct acceptance into NUS and NTU? If they do well they will be given scholarship and then citizenship...they become full fledge singaporean, do they not? malaysian certainly don like it, so what?<br><br>Players like Li Jia Wei came at very young age, we accepted them because of their potential. They had not made it yet. Then we put them in our system and train them. They may or may not make it to the top. If they don't, they will still be singaporean but may be end up as coaches in schools. This is the risk they take. So why they cannot be considered true bred singaporean??? just because the malaysian, the indonesian, or whoever your foreigner friends say so??<br><br>Do not confuse such players with those like david beckhum, professionals who represent whoever pay them more, in club leagues. In Olympics, Yao Ming played for China, not USA!!! so your friend think they can buy back their players.....they don't know what they are talking about.<br><br>I don call your foreigners friends stupid but foreigners like to ridicule singapore for many things, like chewing gum, ERP....then later you find that chewing gum is also banned in MTR in HongKong, and ERP is implemented in london....singapore is a developed country in that we can now put money into training of sportsmen and women, give incentives for those with potential to join us, not only to win medals but to bring up the standard of the sports in our country. The neighbouring countries have population that is at least 5 times ours and they can hope to find the right talents. We don't have that many ppl so we find other ways. Our neighbours can do many things, I don have to approve their ways. Neither do I allow them to approve our ways. How did you defend the singapore way in front of yr foreigner friends? Defending singapore is not just about fighting in battles.<br><br>Be gracious in accepting new comers, be proud and defend our ways of life, defend our countrymen, defend our government ( fighting among PAP and opposition parties is our own internal affairs), IF YOU DO THAT, THEN YOU ARE A TRUE SINGAPOREAN, A TRUE BRED, FULL FLEDGE AND AN HONORABLE SINGAPOREAN, never mind where you were born.<br></div>

And thier english cannot make it wan loh for some of them. So..we r used to not making a big fuss just becoz of some grammatical error or vocab error.

For ur info..i am not illiterate. Is just so happen when i flip the notes i come across the word "scale" and i just overlooked it and type it in when i reply u.

It is when u win...u make others acknowledge that u deserve the victory. What i am trying to say is that..if susilo won the medal, our neighbouring countries especially indonesia will not accept that singapore had improve in badminton....but what u said is I don really care if the malaysian and indonesian accept our players as singaporean. I guess my principle is different from urs then. What is the whole point of winning if ppl do not acknowledge u as a winner? self praise?? I really hate it when in the olympic webpage,  in Susilo biography..they wrote singaporean then below, he was an indonesian ( do u know what they are trying to say??)Do u really dun care about what ppl say? Lets say..if everyone walks up to u and tells u that u r weird. Do u feel happy or sad? We live in the shadow of each other. So..is the same thing here...i dun wan other countries view singaporean as a kiasu ppl. Ppl win..i also must win, we cant win with our own players...use foreign talent. If one country view us as arrogant and kiasu ppl...well..we can afford to ignore them...but if there are more than that.....then..does it mean anything to u?<br><br>&gt;Are you aware that the cream of the top malaysian chinese schools can gain direct acceptance into NUS and NTU?<br>Of coz i am aware.

Why those memories of thier past still haunt them? Why ...is becoz they will tell u..that singapore buy them back and they are not truely singaporean.</strong> " Singapore buy them back..is like saying that singapore is buying the heart of foreign talent  to play for our country. i guess is a misinterpretation.<br><br>If at that time when Susilo is going to become singaporean...US gives tripple the amount of insentives that singapore could offer ..do u think he will say no..i play for singapore and singapore alone?? Let us put it this way, if u r born i an extremely poor country..but u r brilliant person, hence a few countries offer u scholarship to study in thier country...would u choose the one that benefits u the most? ..of coz u will right...U already said it "Ppl migrate, to places where they can find better future, where their potentials can be fully developed...." Find better future..what future..$$$ is one of them right? Where thier potentials can be fully developed..isnt this for thier own good... Money is a very powerful tool. As i mentioned...r u 100% sure that these ppl fight for our country and not for $$... if it is not ...then this issue will forever remain debatable.<br><br>Ask u one simple question, is susilo consider a foreign talent or local talent? The government knows that our LOCAL Talents are not good enough in sport ...therefore we must use FOREIGN talents. In order that these foreign talents could play for singapore...of coz they must first be singaporean. So...they are singaporean...but do u term them as local talent or foreign talent? We all know...in our heart...whether u wan to admit or not..ppl view them as foreign talent. Does this give u a feel of what i am trying to say all this while? Lets say...if this gal..Si Hau Lian...born in singapore, stay here until 18 years old...win gold medal for singapore...would u term her as local talent or foreign talent? U will be proud to say..well done to our local talent!! right?<br><br>This will be my last post in this thread. I know what i had mentioned will not change ur view...and vice versa.

If the answers to both questions are positive, that means he is a recognised singaporean, by the world!! Is this an acknowledgement?? Some of your Malaysian and Indonesian friends may think they are  higher authorities than the Olympics committee, but they are entitled to their opinion, the reality is there they cannot deny.<br><br>Imagine NUS confers you a first class honours, but Malaysian Institute of Idiots and Indonesian College of Dummies said they do not think you have learned anything, what do you think? If you care about what they, then you better go and join them. Don't waste the scholarship.<br><br>You live in the shadow of others and you don't see light. I use others shadow only to stay cool.<br><br>I care when ppl tell me Singaporeans are arrogant for being arrogant is not a good character. If I were told being kiasu, I will say kaisu is not necessarily bad, it has to depend on the circumstance. If you tell me I am wired, you better give me a good reason, otherwise I become your mirror.<br><br></div>

So I bought some good seeds from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand and plant them in my garden. These trees produce many fruits, many sweet fruits. If my friend come visit me, can I offer them the sweet fruits and say these are from my garden?<br>Or I must continue to do scientific research to change the DNA of my own rambutan trees to produce sweet rambutan?<br><br>It is different if I were to buy some sweet rambutan from the fruits sellers in the market and say that these are my rambutan.<br><br>When susilo came to singapore, what he had was potential only, he was nobody. What little he achieved today is a result of what he gained in singapore, the experience he gained when singapore sent him for overseas competitions. If he were a world class player in Indonesia, the indonesian would have offered him much more money than we can give.<br><br>Even now, he still has to work very closely with the Singapore Badminton Association to gain higher ground. and singaporean have to accept him and work together. The day when he achieves, it is this working together that make him and us proud that singapore has achieved. Being born in indonesia,singapore or malaysia does not mean anything!!<br><br>I will not be bothered to write so much if you are not a singaporean. I still don't give a damn what the &amp;^%$#@ the malaysian and indonesian think.<br><br></div>
