            <div class='col-md body'>Susilo is a Singaporean. He is more local than the other foreign talent. He came to Singapore when he is only 14 and went through our education system. He is here to study, he is not those FT "bought" by sports council.<br><br>Tan Howe Liang was born in China and when he won the medal Singapore is still not independent yet. But we are proud of him. I think we can be proud of Susilo too.<br><br>As for Lim Swee Say, I dont understand why he cry, losing is not the end of the world. I think he should be more gracious in accepting defeat.</div>

Do you think he, as a minister, one of the pillars of a nation should have more courage and grace... He should be holding the reins like a leader, which we are paying him for, and give the best encouragement he can to Susilo. Do you think it'll help at all to the morale of Susilo when he learns that his minister cried when he lost? Do you not think this will send the wrong signal to the poor chap?<br><br>LKY cried? For the independence he fought so hard for S'pore. Thats really his years of hardwork under Malaya. SM Goh cried? Maybe for one too many loss of lifes from SARS and the repercussion its having on the economy...<br><br>But cry for a loss in a game? Come on... We have a lot better reason to be doing that on national T.V. This may be seen by a lot of foreigners... Are we to portray ourselves all as faggots? Sissies? especially with his hair-style. I'm not trying to be personal, but this was how it had appeared on T.V. that night...</div></blockquote>i can understand ur point of view.. but really no big deal lah.. take it easy singaporean. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
