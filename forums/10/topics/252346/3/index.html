In all honesty, with an industrial output second only to that of the US in September 1939 (and all that before you consider the state of the German economy when Hitler took power in 1933), it is indeed admirable given its economic achievements - further accentuated by the fact no other regime comprising of despots and tyrants have been able to match in a similar span of time. That very fascist economic model, in essence, was what this economy was modelled on for the best part of a quarter of a century...<br><br>Having said all that, you can't expect too much from a generation schooled and raised with an overdose of fascist propaganda to even realise this regime has any parallels with the Nazis, can you?</div>
