            <div class='col-md body'>Yes and he's been very successful at it..  we citizens are not entirely faultless for letting LKY trade S'pore's liberty for this so-called "security" today.. we were naive to hand everything on a golden platter to him and stand by watching silently as those who saw the danger of spoke up and were cut down one by one.<br><br>However we are only as caged as we allow ourselves to be.  The mind is humanity's most powerful weapon.  Regain control of one's own mind and one will obtain freedom.  There's no such things as "we have no choice".

What should be done is to educate more Singaporeans about all forms of security, especially the non-traditional forms of security.<br><br>Do we have human security? Do we have the security of our individuality and beliefs? Do we have job security that is commensurate with your talent (given the erosion of real meritocracy)? Do we have retirement security?<br><br>Military and economic security secures a place for liberty to flourish, sadly this is not taking place here. Liberty is the only thing that strengthens a nation when her citizens feel that they CAN contribute on their own terms and therefore feel bonded. The more you instruct your citizens, the long run would show the idea of security becomes that of  regime security, and not an all-encompassing national security discourse.<br><br>Then again, not many people can appreciate the strategic necessity for greater  political reform and liberalisation, especially those who only chase the dollar and view the world in fiscal terms.</div>
