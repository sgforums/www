Having said that, I personally see no need for us to "do our own part" because there isn't much you can do anyway(but that's just my take of course) - as far as I'm concerned, the probability of one being a victim of a wanton terrorist attack is no greater than being the victim of a traffic accident or a crime victim due to a case of mistaken identity.</div>

Just as you would choose security over personal liberty, not everyone shares that sentiment.<br><br>Let's put it this way : if I wanted economic prosperity and an unrivalled opportunity to fully realise my potential, I'd be an American; if I wanted absolutely security to the extent of being prepared to compromise my livelihood and all my personal freedom/rights, I'd be a North Korean. As a matter of fact, most foreigners who choose to work/live/study in Singapore often cite having the balance of security, prosperity and opportunities as a factor in their coming here.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well explained SingaporeTyrannosaur.<br><br>Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is unobstructed action according to our will. But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law,' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the right of an individual. -Thomas jefferson</div>

Our society is bigoted and few even see that. They accept official truths like sacred religion and not questioning it. They take comfort in believing someone else will handle their problems and don't want to think too much about it. Unfortunately, in the process, they traded their liberty, their rights as citizens and finally their brains.<br><br>Simply put, a society that is too lazy to think will reap what it sows.</div>
