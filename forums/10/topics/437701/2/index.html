              <div><strong>Final Message to the Singaporean Youths</strong></div>
              <div><strong><br></strong>In a rare public interview in 1997 Radio Corporation of Singapore, Dr Toh passionately bemoaned the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> lack of idealism and creativity among the young and its implications for the future of Singapore.</span></span></strong> He said:<br><br></div>
              <p>“I would say the generation of the ‘50s and ‘60s took the plunge into politics without ever calculating the costs of the risk and the benefits to be gained. They were driven by ideology.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Today’s generation has no culture and averse to taking political risk.</span></span></strong> Really, an interest in politics is very necessary for the future. But I cannot blame the present generations, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">because they see the heavy-handed response by the government to dissenting views, even though they know that these matters involve their daily lives.</span></span></strong><br><br>So the result is that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">we have produced a younger generation who are meek and therefore very calculating. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They are less independent-thinking and lack in initiative. It does not bode well for the emergence of future leaders in politics and business. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Robots and computers can be programmed or if you like, can be trained. But the trouble, of course, is that computers lack soul and what we need in Singapore is soul.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Because it is soul that makes society.”</span></span></strong></p>
