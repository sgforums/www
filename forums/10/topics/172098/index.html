            <div class='col-md body'>It is reasonable to believe that by UNDERPAYING government ministers and civil servants there may arise a risk of corruption.<br><br>It is a BLATANT LIE to say that by NOT PAYING GOVERNMENT MINISTERS BY THE MILLIONS or to highest paid in the world, we will incur the risk of corruption.<br><br>Citizens !!!, do you see how a simple assumption is has been twisted into a ploy to PAY MINISTERS MILLIONS.<br><br>A lie is a lie proving that ministers are morally depraved who need to be paid the highest in the world to stop them from yielding to temptations.<br><br>What has the world come to??<br><br>To rub salt into the wound, now the latest lie is that the original lie is a lesser lie as millions are not a lot to pay ministers because we are running a GDP of billions.<br><br>SINGAPORE IS BEING GOVERNED BY LIES. There is no logic or rationale to pay millions towards ministers' salaries. It is a lie to say that by not paying ministers millions, they will become corrupted or open to corruption!!!<br><br>Similarly lies of such nature are being told to the people: e.g. Reserve for raining days, GRC (to ensure racial harmony in name but in fact to perpetuate one-party rule), Meritocracy, (protectionism of few chosen elites) Streaming of EM1, EM2 etc, (Protectionism and Class divide), Road Pricing (Triple taxes on Vehicle Excise, COE and ERP) etc etc.</div>
