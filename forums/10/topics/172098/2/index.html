            <div class='col-md body'>I really enjoy the arguments put forward here, besides enjoying the highest pay structure for politicians in the whole world, we also have an extraordinary large support struture for them. Yes, the civil service is being trimmed, many have lost their jobs (mostly middle and lower level) and are struggling now but yet the number of Ministers has not been trimmed, if we have such highly capable people, why do they need to have so many of them and a even bigger number of supporting staff. Why is there a need for a MM &amp; SM when our PM is the most brilliant, efficent , capable and the most honest in the world. Why do we pay three guys when years ago one was enough.<br><br>But I guess Salman will never agree to this argument...well he is the ultimate product, like the majority of Singaporeans of hegemony and doctrination. For that the MIW deserve what they pay themselves...</div>

I would say there is more a need to question the efficiency of the people we are paying so much to.

If you fail to deliver in private sector you go..and in some countries if major disasters happen (like collaspes) ministers resign taking responsibility...this should come with the big pay packet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the NKF saga has shown that the govt is not doing a very great job. I quite agree with veteran journalist Seah Chiang Nee:<br><br>"Because of the link, the crisis had rubbed off on the government, which is blamed for poor judgment and dereliction of duty as a watchdog of a body that handles so much public money.<br>........................<br><br>Predictably, the issue has also raised questions on a couple of longstanding policies.<br><br>One involves the absence of an independent check and balance structure, which exists in other developed countries in the forms of a strong opposition and an independent media, not available here.<br><br>The PAP has always said Singapore doesn't need either of them to play the role. It says an honest government is its best watchdog against wrongdoing.<br><br>The NKF fiasco questions how effective this can work over the long term.<br><br>Secondly, it calls into question Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's argument that high government salaries would prevent corruption. His rationale is that if a person is very well paid, he will not be tempted by greed.<br><br>While Durai has not been charged with corruption, his high pay had not kept him away from acquiring more even if it's from the charity basket."<br><br>Extract from littlespeck,<br>NKF impact<br>On longstanding policies<br>It will eventually settle down but underlying questions remain.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think many are missing the point.<br><br>What constitutes good performance? Is there a quantifiable scope we can measure their KPI against?<br><br>How can we fire them if they are not doing a good job? 2 weeks notice?<br><br>What is value for money? Some ppl dun want to pay anything, citing that they get nothing from the govt. Others are willing to double the president's pay so he can jog along west coast as well as his usual east coast (or did I get both mixed up).<br><br>The main hinderance in this discussion is that some forumites speak in "by right". How things should be, how the theoretical checks and balances work.<br><br>Others like Robertteh speak of more practical approaches to real problems. They also identify certain policies, checks and balances that were put in place for political reasons or for ensuring their power... etc.</div>

The public cannot monitor the NKF, KDF or any other companies.<br><br>Think about how many times the public has cried out against certain issues.<br>Million dollar salary, extravagant NKF spending, gambling dens, etc.<br><br>How was it handled?<br>We're constantly told we do not see the big picture, we do not understand the thought process and reasons for these... yada yada etc etc blah blah...<br><br>There seems to be no end of excuses to tell us why we're too dumb to know what's good for us.</div>
