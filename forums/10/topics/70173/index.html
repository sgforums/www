They can also transfer unspent pocket money to a POSBKids savings account to earn interest.<br><br>Addressing concerns that some needy students may not be able to afford the $2 monthly fee for the e-savings programme, Ms Lim gave the assurance that Chowiz will waive the $2 fee for pupils on financial assistance schemes.<br><br>"We want to bring the benefits of technology to every student," she said.<br><br>She also stressed that the e-savings programme was an optional one. Those who do not wish to take the programme can still use their ez-link cards to perform other functions under the basic suite, such as making purchases at the canteen or bookshop.<br><br>ChowizÂ’s clarification comes as a relief for many parents, who were worried that they would be burdened with even more fees when more schools adopt the programme. The company aims to introduce the e-savings plan at 40 schools by the end of this year.<br><br>But even though parents or students do not have to pay for their schools to go cashless, many still want the option of using cash at schools.<br><br>Mr Jamsari Ahmad, 38, a systems manager and father of a four-year-old, suggested that students should be given a choice of using cash or their ez-link cards. He pointed out that incentives could be used to encourage pupils to adopt the contactless card payment, instead of using a blanket ban.<br><br>He cited the example of commuters paying lower fares for using their ez-link cards on buses and the MRT than when they pay in cash.<br><br>Some parents also expressed concern that the young will not know how to handle real money as schools go increasingly "cashless".<br><br>Said Mr Jamsari: "How will my child know how to distinguish between a 10-cent coin and a 50-cent coin if he doesnÂ’t handle cash in school?"<br><br>Others questioned the wisdom of paying $24 a year to participate in an online savings scheme. They pointed that the interest accrued may not be sufficient to cover the cost of joining the scheme.<br><br>Said Mr Ho Chee Meng, 36, an account manager: "At the current level of interest rates offered in Singapore, the children will have to save thousands of dollars to offset the yearly fee of $24 (for the e-savings programme)."<br><br>Chowiz said that the fee should be seen as paying for the curriculum content and not just for the savings transfer alone.<br><br>There are those who support Naval Base PrimaryÂ’s decision to launch the e-savings programme.<br><br>Mr Michael Choy said: "It is important for us to understand that the school has taken a futuristic approach to helping their students adopt the right mindset to 21st century financial transactions, the age of the cashless society."<br><br>He added: "We should look beyond the administrative fees to see how what is done today in the school would benefit the students tomorrow."<br>----------------------------------------------------------------</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my thoughts:<br><br>1. i think most of us would agree going cashless tends to make us spend more, cos its not as visible. this will definitely apply for kids too. so how is this going to make them more prudent and learn abt savings??<br><br>2. tertiary students are harder to convince, so they admit. so why isit hard to push this to them? perhaps its cos its not a good idea at all! and so how? they shaft this down the kids' (and their parents') throats cos they cant complain! and MOE is sanctioning this? i am wondering if its MOE who wanted to go in this direction and den found the vendor to do so, or the other way round - MOE is jus the guinea pig.<br><br>3. remember when they introduced the fee for buying ezlink cards, they mentioned that the idea is to introduce ezlink cards into other commercial areas than transport? so! this is how they r doing it, and wat we r paying for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Their rationale on preparing the kids for a "futuristic" future is illy thought out and bordering on the ridiculus as those very kids are probably light years ahead of the school when it comes to grasping technological tends, as if they need to be thought to use some ez-link cards. Please, spare me. If you intend to make poorly justified desisions without consulting the public because it is your right to do so, just do it and quite insulting our intelligence.</div>

They know that out of every 10 times they push, most of us lie down without a whimper and let ourselves be ripped off.<br><br>Thats how the system works.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>EZ-Link the Holy Card Strikes Again<br><br>In a bid to bleed moe Singaporeans to keep the Ezlink Titanic afloat, the bloodthirsty barons of Ezlink have found a new target: under 12-year-old kids. Besides instituting a bloody $5 surcharge on replacement Ezlink cards in the midts of a recession, holding the citizenry hostage to the need to travel from Point A to Point B in Singapore, these Bloodhounds have now targeted the stomachs of under 12 year-old kids. No Ezlink no food. You want food, minimum two bucks. You want moe? You want moe?? No choice, no options. "You take it or starve and die kid", the message from our state-run enterprise of first world cashless and heartless technology. First transport, now food. Its as good as Ezlink asking underage kids to perform oral on them since they now dictate what goes into their mouths in school.<br><br>Wanna hear moe? That a school, a paragon product of the education hierarchy, a principal succumbs to this bloody plan with such ease and such zealousness of implemetation takes the cake. This is the weakest link? How so can a principal agree to this absurdity? A kid forgets to bring the Holy Card, lets hope his intestines do not start fusing together. Can we call the cops? Ear checks should be made the norm for civil servants aspiring to lead a school of children: take a peep through the ear, if you see light at the other end of the tunnel, stamp a "FAIL", next in line please. MOE hear this well.<br><br>Wanna hear moe? Ezlink barons to get out of the red, u smear urself with more blood, and your hearts turn black. How much moe you wanna bleed before you sink yourself and how many targets do you wanna drag down with your tentacles or technology manacles? Lets have a line of 12 year old kids, going up one by one to the tuckshop, swiping the Holy Card and asking "Gimme Some Change Please"<br><br>Zhong Eh<br>21.02.04<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>"Tertiary students are older and much<br><br>harder to convince (of the value of the services), he said</strong></blockquote>.<br><br>Its because if you piss tertiary students off, they will leave, or they may revolt. If the entire Singapore population were to revolt,, under a revolutionary leader, the government will be powerless. Seriously, the trick lies in uniting the people for revolution. But it may come one day.. one day. Anywayz, they dont want to be hard on older students, because older students have more rights than dumbass primary kids.<br><br><blockquote><strong>EZ-Link earns a commission each time someone uses its cards to pay for a purchase. </strong></blockquote>They must be desperate for $<br><br>But i dont give a damn, I have my rights, I have my card, which is useful for riding the bus and proving to people I am an innocent student. That's all the use it will ever be, besides helping prove i exist and for borrowing books.<br><br>But I question the logic of banning money? What is wrong with money? If you keep all your money in a card, that is very risky. How does one check how much money he has in his card in an OVERCROWDED stressful school environment, (like most primary schools), with hectic schedules, not enough time to go to the toilet even, let alone check how much money you have. Also, to check how much money you have in coins and notes is faster than using a card, you need a special scanner machine to check it. It is very illogical<br><br>After all the bull i have read, I still do not see the reason for such a programme. Other than: ""It is important for us to understand that the school has taken a futuristic approach to helping their students adopt the right mindset to 21st century financial transactions, the age of the cashless society."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A cashless society is the aim of our gahmen and perhaps many other govts of developed nations.<br><br>I always find it amusing when ang moh tourists seem baffled as to how to use the EZ-link card at MRT stations. Yet their nations boast of being the technological front runners in this and in that.<br><br>It is a bold move by MOE to consider this step (clearly naval base administration could not have dreamt of this fantasy) and it does have its virtues:<br><br>a. opening a shared (with their parents) account for kids (which is presently tax-free till they reach 21)<br><br>b. encouraging kids not to keep large sums of money in their pockets. (i do hope the ez-link cards have their identification on it like those for tertiary students)<br><br>However, i would question the manner in which it has been implemented. Schools have an alumni committee and a parents committee. These two 'unions' should be actively involved in the decision-making. In this case i seriously doubt they were given a chance to 'vote', if there was indeed a voting process.<br><br>This method is becoming more and more rampant within govt-related circles. A high-handed leadership who makes the decisions, believing their 'we know best' attitude is right for all, the lack of common sense and democracy in making the final decision etc etc.<br><br>Since the govt is eager to establish their methods as transparent and clean, perhaps they can 'educate' the public as to how MOE came abt this new implementation? Perhaps they could publish minutes of discussions abt a cashless school payment system which was held i presume? Why cut the apple in half and only offer us one side?</div>
