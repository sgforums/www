              National University of Singapore. She went on to earn her Masters of
              Law degree from the University of London in 1989. She was subsequently
              called to the Singapore Bar in 1991. During the course of her
              undergraduate and postgraduate studies, she did volunteer work with the
              Spastic Children’s Association, Salvation Army Home for the Aged and
              the University College Hospital (London). Later on, she did editorial
              work in a voluntary basis for the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme of the Law
              Society . She joined the Singapore Police Force as a Police Inspector
              in 1991 where she served for three years. She was subsequently
              appointed staff officer to the Director of the Criminal Investigation
              Department. She returned to practise law in the private sector, with
              M/s Lim &amp; Lim from 1994 to 1998, handling both civil and criminal
              cases in the High Court, Subordinate Courts and Juvenile Court. She
              joined Temasek Polytechnic in 1998 as a lecturer with its Diploma in
              Law and Management. She was also appointed Manager of Continuing
              Education and Training at the polytechnic’s Business School. Her
              teaching and research areas are in civil and criminal procedure,
              criminal justice and private security.<br> <br> KRC:What are the kinds of measures that can help Singaporeans tide through the current economic downturn?<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: black;">SL:Raising the skill level of the
              workforce is necessary, and the government has been focusing on this.
              That’s important to prepare for Singaporeans to snag the higher value
              jobs especially when recovery comes. In the interim, coping measures
              are important.<br> <br> </span><span style="color: black;">How do we respond to unemployment and under-employment?<br> <br> Workfare was a step in the right direction for under-employment,
              and such schemes will need to be constantly audited to see if the
              supplement amounts are reasonable and whether eligible persons are
              helped to get on board.<br> <br> As for unemployment, my view is that more attention needs to be
              paid to this. Even outside of the current downturn, economists have
              said that globalization will mean that full employment in developed
              countries will be a thing of the past. We will have unemployed who are not lazy but are just unable to keep up. Social safety nets will need enhancement to cater for joblessness. The
              government should study the effectiveness and costs of running the
              current case-by-case help at the CDCs etc and whether this is
              sustainable. Other options of a more straightforward form of help / an
              unemployment insurance scheme may need to be considered.</span></strong> <br> <br> KRC: You gave an interesting suggestion during the Budget Speech
              2009 – Jobseekers’ Allowance. Do you think now would be a good time to
              implement such a suggestion?<br> <br> <strong>SL:I think it is still a relevant suggestion in the current situation when,<span style="font-size: medium;"> though the economy may be bottoming out, the job situation may still worsen (as a lag indicator).<br> </span><br> It was proposed as a temporary measure (6 months)
              due to the meltdown of the global economy. The method suggested by me
              was straightforward – it is temporary assistance, if the person can
              show that he is actively looking for work and has not unreasonably
              turned down job offers. The allowance was limited to half his last
              drawn pay or a maximum of $500 per month. Some basic investigation will
              be needed to weed out those who have significant assets or family
              income.<br> <br> For the unemployed person, this suggestion is better than the
              current help schemes as there will be clarity as to how much he will
              receive and for how long. <span style="font-size: small;">Looking for work, going for interviews etc, costs money.</span></strong><strong> It is also not a very expensive scheme, estimated at not even 10% of the amount set aside for Jobs Credit scheme.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">The jury is still out on how
              far the Jobs Credit scheme actually achieved its primary purpose of
              saving jobs, and how much money was wasted or abused under the Scheme.
              The government often seems tight-fisted with social assistance but
              generous with supporting businesses. I agree we must support businesses
              which can generate growth for Singapore, but we also have to support
              our people in their time of need.</span></strong> <span style="font-size: small;"><br> </span> <br> KRC: What is your opinion of the current management of our
              national budget with respect to its allocation to various sectors such
              as defense, education, healthcare, etc?<br> <br> <strong>SL:I think that the general stance of the government to
              stick to fiscal discipline is correct. We do not want a situation of a
              country with so much debt that the future generations are shortchanged.
              However, there is legitimate debate over whether the government should
              be more generous in social spending. Though defense and homeland
              security are critical, we must also increase resources for local
              policing which have been depleted for counter-terrorism efforts. Areas
              which will also need more emphasis than before are healthcare spending
              and social services. Due to the ageing population and Singapore’s
              population soon breaching 5 million, we must ensure that the social
              services can support the needs of the new demographics. Otherwise, the
              quality of life will deteriorate and anti-immigration feelings will be
              exacerbated.<br> <br> There is also an interesting point about net investment income,
              which the government can tap on to help fund annual budgets, up to 50%
              thereof. This income is derived from investments particularly those
              made by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Government of
              Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC). The Constitution was amended in
              2008 to broaden the definition of “net investment income” to include
              realized capital gains, which Workers’ Party supports. However, there
              is still some lack of transparency about how the figures are derived,
              since the Minister for Finance certifies figures to the President,
              which process is not publicly available.<br> </strong> <br> KRC: You raised an issue of using gross pay of the household
              as a criteria in the current implementation of means testing for Step
              Down Care (nursing home care) during Budget 2009. How can the current
              means testing system be improved for Step Down Care?<br> <br> <strong>SL:Step-down care comprises a range of options, from
              residential options such as Community Hospitals and nursing homes, to
              non-residential options.<br> The Ministry of Health recently revised
              their means-testing for subsidies for community hospitals, to increase
              the number of tiers to 10% intervals i.e. there are 9 tiers of
              subsidies, ranging from 75% subsidy to 0% subsidy. The cut-off income
              for subsidies for community hospitals is now at $5,600 per household of
              4.<br> <br> For the nursing homes, the tiers remain at only 4 – either 75%
              subsidy, 50%, 25% or 0%, with the cut-off income per household of 4 now
              set at $5,200. The problem here is that while CPF (Medisave) can be
              withdrawn to pay for community hospitals, it cannot be used to pay for
              nursing homes. When we assess affordability, I think it makes sense for
              us to calculate exactly how much disposable income the family has left
              after paying the nursing home bills; therefore using gross pay (i.e.
              20% more than the take-home pay) is not correct. The Minister for
              Health responded during the debate to say that gross pay was used
              because their policy parameter is based on helping those at certain
              income levels. I realized then that we were talking at cross-purposes.<br> <br> Nursing home stays also tend to be much longer than stays at
              community hospitals. If the fear is the depletion of CPF savings (CPF
              is probably an overworked horse anyway), then we need to see if the
              subsidy level is adequate. Having more tiers is one way to make the
              means-test less harsh. The income cut-off levels should also be set
              bearing in mind the size of the bills and the disposable income of the
              family.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">The phenomenon of some
              families placing their loved ones in Johor Bahru nursing homes is not
              something that I feel we should be pleased about.<br> </span><br> I note that there is currently a government review
              on how to have the 3 Es – Eldersave, Eldershield (enhancing it) and
              Elderfund. This is a clear recognition that funding framework needs to
              be strengthened.<br> <br> Ensuring access to affordable healthcare is something the Workers’ Party believes is fundamental to a government’s role.</strong></p>
              <p>KRC: Do you have any issues specific to the current state of tertiary
              education in Singapore that you would like address now or in future?<br> <br> <strong>SL:Having been a Polytechnic lecturer for 11 years, I have
              learned a lot about tertiary education from that perspective. Students
              in the public sector educational institutions are fortunate as they are
              on the whole well-resourced and have competent staff.<br> <br> </strong><strong><span style="font-size: small;">I have raised the issue of rising tertiary fees vis-à-vis the universities, during the Committee of Supply debates. </span>While the government will announce loan schemes at no-interest, the situation is not that straightforward, as <span style="font-size: small;">I
              have seen poor students who were instructed by their parents not to
              take loans for fear of further encumbering themselves while in dire
              straits</span>. <span style="font-size: small;">Also, under the
              current MOE policy, university students’ fees must also include paying
              towards development expenditure and can go up by 10% per year. The
              possible inflation, and risk of reduced access to education, is
              worrying.</span></strong><br> <strong><br> Also, I believe that we should nurture a culture where students
              take on social and political causes and express contrary views. At
              their critical age when vibrancy should be at its height, we should be
              happy to see students protest fee hikes, unjust wars etc. This will
              naturally result in a more active citizenry, more ownership and greater
              rootedness to Singapore.<br> </strong> <br> KRC: You were critical of the GRC system, and have
              advocated a return to a contest for single member seats. If you are
              given a choice to decide, would you prefer to anchor a GRC team in the
              next elections or will you be targeting a Single Member Constituency
              instead? Why?<br> <br> <strong>SL:<span style="font-size: small;">Even though WP is
              against the GRCs, we have to contest within the system foisted upon us.
              Winning a GRC is a critical step for alternative parties to beat back
              this beast and raise the level of democratic participation nation-wide.</span></strong><strong> As such, I personally prefer to be part of that effort. However, when
              the election comes, the party will assess which combination of
              candidates is best based on the (revised) constituency boundaries.</strong><br> <br> KRC: Now is the third year of your term as Non-constituency Member
              of the Parliament (NCMP). What is the highest point and lowest point of
              your term so far?<br> <br> <strong>SL: <span style="font-size: small;">Sometimes after a
              Parliamentary debate is reported, I receive feedback from the public
              thanking me for raising certain matters (like workload among the Home
              Team officers and the nursing home issue) where people feel their
              burden is great. That is very satisfying.</span><br> <br> One of the low points would be during the debate on CPF reforms in
              2007. After working through the details of the CPF changes, the other
              challenge was trying to find something refreshing to say as many MPs
              had spoken before me. I recall sitting with Mr Low Thia Khiang (who had
              already spoken) in the Parliament Library running through possible new
              points, but at that moment, each point I was considering had problems.
              In the end, I had no choice but to deliver a safe and somewhat boring
              speech.<br> <br> I suppose one has to have the big picture and long haul in mind. A
              recruiter once told me that he did not look for top performance, but
              consistent performance. I find that a good and practical principle to
              adopt. </strong> <br> <br> The Kent Ridge Common wishes to thank Miss Sylvia Lim for her consent
              to our interview. We would like to wish Sylvia all the best in her

              <p>If the opposition has more personalities of Sylvia Lim's and Low Thia Kang's calibre then at least there would be more hope for stronger voices clamouring for alternative views in parliament.</p>
              <p>I am particularly curious about her suggestion about including a jobseeker's allowance. If we give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that the estimated costs are indeed only a tenth of the Jobs Credit scheme, then I hope at the very least the government conducts a feasibility study. While undoubtedly benefitting the disadvantaged, there is a potential for a welfare-seeking-mentality to sink in as there will no doubt be lazy bums who would abuse the system. It would be extremely hard to set criteria and determine which cases are truly worth the proposed allowance of $500 and this will probably have quite an impact on operating costs. We cannot "suka-suka anyhow" give people money. It would also not be in the public interest to sustain a scheme over periods of good growth unless the gini co-efficient really goes out of control.</p>
              <p>I feel that unless the economy goes into a prolonged W-shaped or U-shaped recovery, her suggestion has been left a little too late to consider seriously in the current economic crisis. Again though, I hope that the government conducts a serious feasibility study and see whether it's a worthwhile solution to be kept away and stored for use in future recessionary periods.</p>
              <p>If they ever do adopt it, for God's sake, please acknowledge Ms. Sylvia Lim and Co. for the idea.</p>
              <p>P.S. The best way to beat the PAP on the GRC issue would be for a opposition party to groom a minority-race election candidate and make him stand for election in an SMC and WIN. This looks to be a ten-year project at least and I wonder if the opposition should have at least focused on this aspect of the battle when the GRC system was announced many years ago. One of the first life lessons I learnt from my teachers in school is that never try to beat the system. Play by the system and change it from within! Jiayou WP.</p>
