They will try not to pay, even for a small sum (like Mr Lock's case). They have retained lawyers, so they want lawyer to work. Lawyers get paid by the 'size' of claim or 'complexity' of case. So, using common sense - you come to your own conclusion what lawyers will do in order to drive Lexuses.<br>I too have my fair share of frustrations dealing with insurance companies - not one (NTUC) included.<br>So, my conclusion is that insurance companies have the same tactics but a few may be worst than others.</div>

I can sue.  But I need to engage a lawyer and look at what happen to Mr Lock ...  I cannot afford that kind of money....  we do not enage lawyer very often, so how are we to know the lawyer is not out to fleece us !! ...   last time must report to police and then we claims from insurance... thing were fairly ok except that the police say they are blogged down with such paper work that they decided that otherwise ...  for their convenience, the people have to suffer lor ...  this is SINGAPORE !!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
