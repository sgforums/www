That was what the PDRC was set up for; to settle small dispute.  But it was the lawyers who dragged it to the high court which ruled that Mr Lock has to pay $60,000 of legal fees, which forced him to have no other choice but bring the case to the appeal court.  It would have settled if the lawyers did not dispute over a mere $60 of legal fees.<br><br>Anyhow, a few hundred dollars may mean nothing for a insurance professional like you, but for a teacher earning around $1800, that is a substantial sum.</div>

Firstly, he brought the case to the PDRC only and didn't intend to bring the matter further up the courts, for which he won: <a href="http://motoring.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20070913-25268.html" rel="nofollow">http://motoring.asiaone.com/Motoring/News/Story/A1Story20070913-25268.html</a><br>Why did he do that? Probably because the other party refused to take responsibility for the damages. I don't see any reason why he would take it up to the PDRC if the other party agreed to pay him. Of course, I don't know that for sure, but do you?<br><br>Secondly, he already received the cheque and it was because his lawyer made some counter-moves without his knowledge that made the other party appeal it to the higher courts, as can be seen from the article.<br><br><a href="http://tnp.sg/news/story/0,4136,143756,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://tnp.sg/news/story/0,4136,143756,00.html</a><br><br>Thirdly, he avoided the $25,000 offered by NTUC because he was being sued  for $80,000 by his former lawyer, Andrew Hanam, for unpaid legal fees. If he had accepted the $25,000, he might have to end up paying $80,000 legal fees to the lawyer and after deducting the $25,000 given by NTUC, would still have to fork out $55,000. That's why he took it to the court of appeal. So now that he has won, he doesn't need to pay anything. Get your facts right<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_158166.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/Free/Story/STIStory_158166.html</a><br><br>He was greedy? I have never read of him trying to get any money from anybody. He ended up not having to pay the legal fees of $150,000, from both NTUC and his former lawyer, which is exactly what he wanted. But now NTUC is still offering him some money anyway and you should ask why NTUC is suddenly becoming so generous instead.</div>

There are more than sufficient grounds for them to pursue NTUC, especially since the vehicle of the culprit was indeed registered under NTUC. Therefore, by proxy, they are the responsible party.<br><br>It doesn't matter whether the other party reported the accident. NTUC has an obligation to pay for your damages. Negligence and excuses from them are not acceptable.<br><br>And your insurance company sure as h.ell should not demand a payout from you before issuing a writ of summons. That's daylight robbery when they SHOULD be covering your costs and pursuing the case.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NTUC Income to further waive $15,000 of teacher's legal bill<br><br>NTUC Income, expressing relief with the closure of teacher Jonathan Lock's drawn-out court saga, on Wednesday offered to waive a further $15,000 of the $45,000 he is liable to pay the insurer.<br><br>This brings to $40,000 it has offered to help Mr Lock settle his costly legal tangle that started from a simple accident case.<br><br>Income's offer came hours after the Appeals court vindicated Mr Lock and ordered all the parties involved to bear their own costs, and a week after the primary school teacher turned down its earlier offer to give him a goodwill payment of $25,000.<br><br>Mr Tan had said then it was the company's way of helping someone who had "found himself caught in the middle of a protracted and unnecessary legal process". But a condition attached to Income's offer was that Mr Lock drop his case that was pending in the Appeals Court.<br><br>Mr Lock rejected it. Instead, he decided to let the Appeals Court decide whether an earlier court decision which made him ultimately liable for Income's legal bills still held. And he was vindicated on Wednesday.<br><br>Reacting to the Appeals Court's ruling, Income's Chief Executive, Mr Tan Suee Chieh, said in a statement on Wednesday: "Despite the Court of Appeal ruling against NTUC Income this morning, we are pleased and relieved with the closure of this unfortunate saga, which has gone on too far and for too long, without serving the interests of our customer, Jonathan Lock nor NTUC Income.<br><br>"Today's ruling is a positive outcome for Jonathan Lock and his family."<br><br>He added: "We deeply regret the distress which Jonathan and Shane Lock have had to endure. For these reasons, we had previously offered $25,000 to help them with their legal bills. To assist Jonathan Lock with his remaining financial obligations, we will increase our contribution by another $15,000, making it a total of $40,000.<br><br>"NTUC Income places people above process, and we seek to conduct our business with fairness and for the benefit of the people who are most important to us, namely our customers. Our overriding objective is to protect the interests of our customers, individually and as a whole. We believe our recent actions have been consistent with these principles."<br><br>Income had earlier also asked its lawyers to arrange for the lifting of the freeze on the items in Mr Lock's flat which were to to have been seized to pay for the costs he owed.<br><br>The case began with a hearing in the Primary Dispute Resolution Centre in March last year. It was to settle the November 2004 accident between Mr Lock's motorcycle and a car driven by Ms Jessiline Goh.<br><br>Mr Lock got $188 and Ms Goh was asked to pay $1,200 in costs. After getting a cheque for that amount, he thought the matter closed.<br><br>But the lawyer then representing him extracted a court order and took out a writ of seizure against Ms Goh to enforce payment of the $1,200.<br><br>This move set in motion a series of events that led to High Court judge Lai Siu Chiu agreeing, in May, with the NTUC's appeal that Mr Lock should be liable for the total costs of the case.<br><br>The $65,000 bill was cut to $45,000 after a review.<br><br>WHO IN THE RIGHT MIND, WANTS TO REJECT, AN OFFER LIKE THIS<br><br>20K GOODWILL MONEY, 48K TO WAIVE OFF THE LAWYER FEES</div>

As Billybong has pointed out to you, it was the lawyers who forced the case to higher courts.  It is obvious that you have a bias against people like Jonathan Lock, who gives a lot of paper work to insurance professionals like you.<br><br>And of course I got the information from the newspapers, where else can I get information on this case?  I certainly don't have access to all the documents of the court proceedings.  Don't tell me you have other sources of information on this case.  Oh, I forgot, you WORK at AIG...so you must know more than us mere mortals.<br><br>Anyway, for someone who work for an insurance company, I have a feeling from what you have written, calling Joanathan "stupid" and "greedy", you have a contempt against clients who give you a lot of paper work.  Thanks for the heads up, I will certainly avoid buying any insurance from AIG.<br><br></div>

The average man on the street will certainly not have adequate knowledge of the law and how best to proceed. Following a lawyer's advice is the best option.<br><br>If the lawyer somehow mushrooms the costs to exhorbitant amounts, is it really the client's fault? Yes, you can label the lawyer as greedy and such, but it is the actions and intent that one should question. It is too simplistic to dismiss the case as one  of a 'greedy lawyer' and 'ignorant client'.<br><br>A simple case like this mirrors many of the accident cases that are plaguing the legal system here. I'm sure there are plenty more cases just like Lock's pending to be settled but have not been blown to light. The ethical conduct of lawyers and insurance companies should take centerstage.<br><br>Ever since the TP absolved their responsibility to non-injury related accidents, insurance companies and their lawyers have been allowed to dictate play to their own ends. It is high time their unethical practices be brought to light and taken to task. Not only are they wasting the court's time, but their motives appear questionable: are they really protecting the clients' interests, as their role dictates?</div>
