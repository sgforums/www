            <div class='col-md body'>although i hate the annual IPPTs n ICTs , it is no choice that we are living in a small country like Singapore. We do not have a strong army in terms of numbers to protect our homeland and hence the compulsory national service of all adult man. Nobody is gonna do it for us and save us in times of war. In fact, by right why should we be asking for compensation when we are protecting our loves ones..??<br><br>Singapore has no natural resources to depend upon and the only reason why we are so successful is due to our high skilled labour and perhaps efficient governance, since our only resource is dwindling, it is only natural that we import this resources. Face it, whatever we have now might be acheiveable by any other countries given time and better governance but whatever other countries have we would never have it no matter how hard we try to acheive it. We do not have enuf land, big domestice market, natural resources. FT will only go to places where they have the best living conditions and opportunities unless we are able to sustain our own economies and stop relying on the government to attract MNCs to Singapore, this is something that we have to live with in this global world. For I say, it is getting tougher for the poor and middle class Singaporeans.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>instead of penalising FT , men like us who serve 2.5years of NS should get more compensation.<br>the 2.5years service should be paid regulars salary.<br>every ICT should be 2 times of our current salary.<br>national security dont come cheap. not to mention we still have to take care of our primary job, family and serving the country as well.<br><br>one should not doubt our patriotism for singapore afterall ppl like us serve singapore 2.5 years with only allowances paid.<br><br>i wonder whether our country appreciate our service. i am now in the mid 30s could barely run as fast or keep as fit. should we fail our IPPT, has to be penalising for RT, fine. is this the appreciation our country can show to us?<br>is it worth it?<br><br></div>

For that purpose, Singapore can recognise dual citizenship because your son automatically qualifies to become a Singaporean if you, his daddy , is Singaporean. National service is enforced on him once he touches "any benefit" in Singapore.<br><br>Unless the father is a foreigner and the mother is Singaporean , then the son might be able to escape NS drafting on the premise that he will never be a Singaporean citizen. The son ,and the mother ( for the period of her pregnancy), must have never touched "any benefit" in Singapore as well i.e. hospital care, schooling etc.<br><br>Sorry to disappoint you .<br><br></div>
