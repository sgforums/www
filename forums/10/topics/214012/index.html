            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I apologise for not making my stand clear enough. I was just reflecting, in fact playing around with the common arguement that will be brought into the equation by ardent proponents of national service. Yeah, I get a sense that many feel kinda short changed by this new FT innovation, esp us males who gave away 2 yrs of our youth. It will mean that individuals who do not require to fulfil NS requirements, getting the same rights as individuals who had to fulfil the mandated requirements. In order to broaden this discussion, I'll like to bring up two points for consideration. Firstly, foreign talents deserve citizenship base upon the talent they'll propsectively contribute or has contributed to our society. Secondly, shouldn't we Singaporeans look at this matter objectively and realize that it is for the common good that this policy must stand? I'll like to emphasize that this isn't my stand, but I'll just like to read the views of the people in this forum.</div>
