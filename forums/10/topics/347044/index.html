              <p>Saturday, 07 February 2009</p>
              <p><em>Muhd Husrin bin Tahale</em><em><br>Guest Writer</em></p>
              <p>Sometimes
                      when I have conversations with my friends<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> I find that many (if not all)
                      share one thing in common: they have an utter lack of faith in this
                      country, they have absolutely no sense of patriotism, and their desire
                      to leave this country is immense. I find this really sad.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It's sad when patriotism and loyalty is replaced by greed and
                      convenience. It's sad when you reject the country that has raised you,
                      nurtured you and shaped you the way you are.</strong></span> I don't mean to sound
                      preachy. I apologise if I do.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The number one reason for my mates
                      wanting to fly off and not come back is the government. The PAP has
                      vastly succeeded in creating a highly stressful environment. Who the
                      hell wants to live in an environment like this all their lives?</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
                      government treats us like cash cows.</strong></span> Part of our salary is taken and
                      put into our CPF, which in turn is used to invest in risky portfolios.
                      Remember, this is our money they're using.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The government
                      doesn't give a damn about our welfare.</strong></span> Oh sure once in a while you read
                      in the papers about how a government agency is doing this and how
                      another charity is doing that, but these are all just token measures.
                      These are all just to give people (mainly foreigners) a good
                      impression. That's it.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now who would want to live in such an
                      environment where we're nothing but expendable beings who cannot retire
                      when we want to because we don't have enough money in our retirement
                      accounts.</strong></span><br><br>But like I said Singaporeans are people of little
                      faith. Not many know this but despite its rather authoritarian stance,
                      Singapore has political parties besides the PAP. Despite repeated
                      persecution by the government, these parties actually present a real
                      alternative to the PAP that has been ruling us since 1959.<br><br>What
                      these parties represent, and what they are trying to convey to
                      Singaporeans is that there is hope. Change is possible. In fact change
                      is inevitable. But for this to happen, the people need to do their part.<br><br>But
                      it's hard when many just leave the island never to return. And it's all
                      thanks to our government. It's hard when at the first sign of trouble,
                      the first thing that most Singaporeans can think of is to flee the
                      country. It's hard, with such a mindset. It's pathetic.<br><br>I'll
                      tell you this right now. I love Singapore so much I could cry. I dunno
                      why. You can call me weird, or freaky, or whatever. If only we had a
                      government that really cared for us and listened to the people, it
                      would be perfect.<br><br>Singapore as a country has done so much for
                      me. I have lived my entire life here. Everything I live for is here.
                      Whenever I go overseas, usually short trips to Indonesia, a little hop
                      down to Australia, or a holiday to Scandinavia that I had with my Dad
                      in 2000, it was always reassuring to have someplace to call home,
                      someplace familiar, someplace where you know you feel safe, and that's
                      Singapore. That's how it is.<br><br>I'm going backpacking next year,
                      and I'll know in some way I'll always have Singapore as my home. I'm
                      proud of my country. I'll share things about Singapore to my backpacker
                      friends. But I can't say the same about my government. I will spill my
                      blood for Singapore because I know I owe her that much. This soil has
                      protected me, raised me, taught me how to live. This country has given
                      me an identity and I wear it everyday like a badge of honour.<br><br>You
                      see people in other countries like Germany, or the United States, or
                      Denmark or wherever, you see how proud they are of their country.
                      Germans, Americans, the Danes, you can see the pride that bubbles in
                      them when you ask them where they're from. Could the same thing be said
                      about my fellow Singaporeans? I doubt it. Really. I must be the only
                      patriotic fellow among my group of friends. That alone speaks volumes.<br><br>Personally,
                      I have faith in Singapore. It's a historical fact that authoritarianism
                      does not last forever. It will always fail as a system. Singapore can
                      and will change for the better. The opposition parties are more than
                      ready to take the reins of power as a true representative of the
                      people. And when that happens, Singapore can then be said to be
                      comparable to other First World nations like Germany or the US.
                      Singapore's society will become more vibrant. <br><br>When all this
                      happens, Singaporeans will truly be proud of their own country. I know
                      they will. Because I have faith in this country. I hope my fellow
                      Singaporeans feel the same way.<br><br>Be proud of your identity, the language you speak, your culture.<br><br>I love Singapore. I hope you do too.</p>

              <p>Singapore is not made a welfare state, lee hsien loong said this and he further reiterated this a number of times (this proves how heartless he is as a public servant, not fit to serve the public).    lee hsien loong, his senile evil dad and PAP can't afford to provide more welfare for Singaporeans because they need to make sure they have sufficient to pay themselves filthy obscene world class salary.   Instead of giving welfare to the locals, their main focus is to earn as much $ from the singaporeans as possible.   So people who still are ignorant, please wake up and vote PAP out. </p>

It is because the ang moh for example england, was a welfare state then they are in a bad financial situation. They may oso need to tap into the IMF for cash which is quite humiliating for a developed country.

              <p>no, thats not true. i love it here.i just think some of the policies here can be improved on, policies that are discussed/ criticised daily in forums like these.</p>
              <p>for example, just because i don't like chicken rice in my neighbourhood hawker centre doesn't mean i sell my house and relocate to another neighbourhood....</p>
              <p>migration is an option, but it's not the ONLY option. no matter where u migrate to, u'd never feel that it's home.why must i move out of this country i call home?</p>

Bottomline, its up to you. Sure you're welcome to give constructive feedback, but if you wanna go around insulting other people then what good is that? Even Chee Soon Juan, i would'nt tell him to migrate because i know he loves his country.

              <p>Please lah everyone has the freedom to say what about the govt of singapore.   if you don't like what is being said here and it is affecting you then you can consider to surf PAP website, this will make you happy.     Or you can go suggest to PAP to penalise us who speak the truth and reality about them.</p>
              <p>No wonder nobody interested to respond positively to your outing.</p>
