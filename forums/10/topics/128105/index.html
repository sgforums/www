It says: No. 1 cause of failure is: Arrogance.<br><br>So, ordinary people understand the true nature of leadership or elite approach. Leadership and elitism is inhabited by self and self-ness. At one time, people frequently claim leadership quality or talent. Then came the Asian Financial crisis that exposed leaderships as self and root cause of financial collapses. Subsequent large-scale corporate scandals in the aftermath of Asian Financial crisis further confirmed self or self-centredness as the root causes of company malpractices affecting many countries. Talents, elitism, Asian value, and Confucianism relied upon to justify leadership died off and subsided. Now leadership claims are seen to make a fast come-back once the world economy is recovering once more..<br><br>The falsehood about leadership is on the wall, of the 4-D shop showing that people understand what it means. It is paradoxical that the over-pragmatic is taking over the leading.<br><br>Many ultra-pragmatists including some found in forums are all over pushing to keep to status quo with robust rebuttals of non-conformist views.

Are you advocating that we should not have the best to be our leaders and that you would prefer those of mediocre ability to lead the country?<br><br>I share the sentiments regarding the need for leaders to bear in mind that they are servants to those they represent and behave accordingly.
