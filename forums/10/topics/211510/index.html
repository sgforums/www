            <div class='col-md body'>i don't think the problem here is bus capacity or frequency, but the fact that they keep raising prices, stating that operating costs have gone up, and yet their profits keep rising. there isn't a good reason to raise prices until they start bleeding, and even then after all these years of good profits, it's plain respect to bleed a little for the people that've been giving you a daily feast.<br><br>and don't try arguing that our transport fees are lower than other countries, standards of living are different.</div>
