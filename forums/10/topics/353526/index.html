              <p>...In sum, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>specialization of economic activities, by breaking up the
              economic process, had made it possible for people to concentrate on one
              portion of the process </strong></span>and, by maximizing that portion, to jeopardize
              the rest.</p>
              <p>The process was not only broken up into producers,
              exchangers, and consumers but there were also<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> two kinds of exchangers
              (one concerned with goods, the other with money)</strong></span>, with almost
              antithetical, <em>short-term, </em>aims.</p>
              <p>The problems which inevitably
              arose could be solved and the system reformed only by reference to the
              system as a whole. Unfortunately, however, three parts of the system,
              concerned with the production, transfer, and consumption of goods, were
              concrete and clearly visible so that almost anyone could grasp them
              simply by examining them, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>while the operations of banking and finance
              were concealed, scattered, and abstract so that they appeared to many
              to be difficult. </strong></span></p>
              <p>To add to this, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bankers themselves did everything they
              could to make their activities more secret and more esoteric. </strong></span>Their
              activities were reflected in mysterious marks in ledgers which were
              never opened to the curious outsider.</p>
              <p>In the course of time the central fact of the developing
              economic system, the relationship between goods and money, became
              clear, at least to bankers.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This relationship, the price system,
              depended upon five things: the supply and the demand for goods, the
              supply and the demand for money, and the speed of exchange between
              money and goods. </strong></span></p>
              <p>An increase in three of these (demand for goods,
              supply of money, speed of circulation) would move the prices of goods
              up and the value of money down. This inflation was objectionable to
              bankers, although desirable to producers and merchants. On the other
              hand, a decrease in the same three items would be deflationary and
              would please bankers, worry producers and merchants, and delight
              consumers (who obtained more goods for less money).</p>
              <p>The other factors
              worked in the opposite direction, so that an increase in them (supply
              of goods, demand for money, and slowness of circulation or exchange)
              would be deflationary.</p>
              <p>Such changes of prices, either inflationary or deflationary, have
              been major forces in history for the last six centuries at least. Over
              that long period, their power to modify men's lives and human history
              has been increasing.</p>
              <p>This has been reflected in two ways. On the one
              hand, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>rises in prices have generally encouraged increased economic
              activity, especially the production of goods, while, on the other hand,
              price changes have served to redistribute wealth within the economic
              system. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span>Inflation, especially a slow steady rise in prices, encourages
              producers, because it means that they can commit themselves to costs of
              production on one price level and then, later, offer the finished
              product for sale at a somewhat higher price level.</p>
              <p>This situation
              encourages production because it gives confidence of an almost certain
              profit margin. On the other hand, production is discouraged in a period
              of falling prices, unless the producer is in the very unusual situation
              where his costs are falling more rapidly than the prices of his product.</p>
              <p>  The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>redistribution of wealth by changing prices is equally
              important but attracts much less attention.</strong></span> Rising prices benefit
              debtors and injure creditors, while falling prices do the opposite. A
              debtor called upon to pay a debt at a time when prices are higher than
              when he contracted the debt must yield up less goods and services than
              he obtained at the earlier date, on a lower price level when he
              borrowed the money.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A creditor, such as a bank, which has lent
              money—equivalent to a certain quantity of goods and services—on one
              price level, gets back the same amount of money—but a smaller quantity
              of goods and services—when repayment comes at a higher price level,
              because the money repaid is then less valuable.</strong></span></p>
              <p>This is why bankers, as
              creditors in money terms, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>have been obsessed with maintaining the value
              of money</strong></span>, although the reason they have traditionally given for this
              obsession—that "sound money" maintains "business confidence"—has been
              propagandist rather than accurate.</p>
              <p>Hundreds of years ago, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bankers began to specialize, with the
              richer and more influential ones associated increasingly with foreign
              trade and foreign-exchange transactions.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Since these were richer and
              more cosmopolitan and increasingly concerned with questions of
              political significance, such as stability and debasement of currencies,
              war and peace, dynastic marriages, and worldwide trading monopolies,
              they became the financiers and financial advisers of governments.</p>
              <p>Moreover, since their relationships with governments were always in
              monetary terms and not real terms, and since they were always obsessed
              with the stability of monetary exchanges between one country's money
              and another, they used their power and influence to do two things: (1)
              to get all money and debts expressed in terms of a strictly limited
              commodity—ultimately gold; and (2) to get all monetary matters out of
              the control of governments and political authority, on the ground that
              they would be handled better by private banking interests in terms of
              such a stable value as gold...</p>
              <p> In effect, this creation of paper claims greater than the
              reserves available means that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bankers were creating money out of
              nothing. </strong></span></p>
              <p>The same thing could be done in another way, not by
              note-issuing banks but by deposit banks. Deposit bankers discovered
              that orders and checks drawn against deposits by depositors and given
              to third persons were often not cashed by the latter but were deposited
              to their own accounts. Thus there were no actual movements of funds,
              and payments were made simply by bookkeeping transactions on the
              accounts.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, it was necessary for the banker to keep on hand
              in actual money (gold, certificates, and notes) no more than the
              fraction of deposits likely to be drawn upon <em>and cashed; </em>the
              rest could be used for loans, and if these loans were made by creating
              a deposit for the borrower, who in turn would draw checks upon it
              rather than withdraw it in money, such "created deposits" or loans
              could also be covered adequately by retaining reserves to only a
              fraction of their value.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Such created deposits also were a creation of
              money out of nothing, </strong></span>although bankers usually refused to express their
              actions, either note issuing or deposit lending, in these terms.</p>
              <p>William Paterson, however, on obtaining the charter of the Bank of
              England in 1694, to use the moneys he had won in privateering, said,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"The Bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out
              of nothing." </strong></span>This was repeated by Sir Edward Holden, founder of the
              Midland Bank, on December 18, 1907, and is, of course, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>generally
              admitted today...</strong></span></p>

              <p> In Britain, throughout the nineteenth century, the supply of capital
              was so plentiful from private savings that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>industry was able to finance
              itself with little recourse to the banking system.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The corporate form
              was adopted relatively slowly, and because of the benefits to be
              derived from limited liability rather than because it made it possible
              to appeal to a widespread public for equity capital.</p>
              <p>Savings were so
              plentiful that the surplus had to be exported, and interest rates fell
              steadily. Promoters and investment bankers were not much interested in
              domestic industrial securities (except railroads), and for most of the
              century concentrated their attention on government bonds (both foreign
              and domestic) and on foreign economic enterprises.</p>
              <p>Financial capitalism
              first appeared in foreign securities, and found a fruitful field of
              operations. The corporation law (as codified in 1862) was very lenient.
              There were few restrictions on formations of companies, and none on
              false prospectuses or false financial reports. Holding companies were
              not legally recognized until 1928, and no consolidated balance sheet
              was required then. As late as 1933, of 111 British investment trusts
              only 52 published a record of their holdings...</p>
              <p> As part of this system and at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the core of English financial life have
              been seventeen private firms of "merchant bankers" who find money for
              established and wealthy enterprises on either a long-term (investment)
              or a short-term ("acceptances") basis.</strong></span></p>
              <p>These merchant bankers, with a
              total of less than a hundred active partners, include the firms of
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Baring Brothers, N. M. Rothschild, J. Henry Schroder, Morgan Grenfell,
              Hambros, and Lazard Brothers. </strong></span>These merchant bankers in the period of
              financial capitalism had a dominant position with the Bank of England
              and, strangely enough, still have retained some of this, despite the
              nationalization of the Bank by the Labour government in 1946. As late
              as 1961 a Baring (Lord Cromer) was named governor of the bank, and his
              board of directors, called the "Court" of the bank, included
              representatives of Lazard, of Hambros, and of Morgan Grenfell, as well
              as of an industrial firm (English Electric) controlled by these...</p>

              <p>Financial capitalism in Britain, as elsewhere,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> was
              marked not only by a growing financial control of industry but also by
              an increasing concentration of this control and by an increasing
              banking control of government.</strong></span></p>
              <p>As we have seen, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this influence of the
              Bank of England over the government was an almost unmitigated disaster
              for Britain. </strong></span>The power of the bank in business circles was never as
              complete as it was in government, because British businesses remained
              self-financing to a greater extent than those of other countries.</p>
              <p>This
              self-financing power of business in Britain depended on the advantage
              which it held because of the early arrival of industrialism in England.
              As other countries became industrialized, reducing Britain's advantage
              and her extraordinary profits, British business was forced to seek
              outside financial aid or reduce its creation of capital plant. Both
              methods were used, with the result that financial capitalism grew at
              the same time as considerable sections of Britain's capital plant
              became obsolete...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>  While Britain passed through the stages of capitalism
              in this fashion, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Germany was passing through the same stages in a
              different way.</strong></span></p>
              <p>     In Germany, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>capital was scarce when industrialism
              arrived.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Because savings from commerce, overseas trade, or small
              artisan shops were much less than in Britain, the stage of
              owner-management was relatively short. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Industry found itself dependent
              upon banks almost at once. </strong></span></p>
              <p>These banks were quite different from those
              in England, since they were "mixed" and not divided into separate
              establishments for different banking functions. The chief German credit
              banks, founded in the period 1848-1881, were at the same time savings
              banks, commercial banks, promotion and investment banks, stockbrokers,
              safety deposits, and so on. Their relationship to industry was close
              and intimate from the creation of the Darmstà¹„dter Bank in 1853. These
              banks floated securities for industry by granting credit to the firm,
              taking securities in return. These securities were then slowly sold to
              the investing public as the opportunity offered, the bank retaining
              enough stock to give it control and appointing its men as directors of
              the enterprise to give that control final form...</p>
              <p> The financial capitalism of Germany was at its peak in the years just
              before 1914. It <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>was controlled by a highly centralized oligarchy.</strong></span></p>
              <p>At
              the center was the Reichsbank whose control over the other banks was
              relatively weak at all times. This was welcomed by the financial
              oligarchy, for the Reichsbank, although privately owned, was controlled
              by the government to a considerable degree. The weakness of the
              Reichsbank's influence over the banking system arose from the weakness
              of its influence over the two usual instruments of central-banking
              control—the re-discount rate and open-market operations. The weakness
              of the former was based on the fact that the other banks rarely came to
              the Reichsbank for re-discounts, and usually had a discount rate below
              that of the Reichsbank. A law of 1899 tried to overcome this weakness
              by forcing the other banks to adjust their discount rates to that of
              the Reichsbank, but it was never a very effective instrument of
              control. Open-market control was also weak because of an official
              German reluctance "to speculate" in government securities and because
              the other banks were more responsive to the condition of their
              portfolios of commercial paper and securities than they were to the
              size of their gold reserves. In this they were like French rather than
              British banks. Only in 1909 did the Reichsbank begin a deliberate
              policy of control through open-market operations, and it was never
              effective. It was ended completely from 1914 to 1929 by the war, the
              inflation, and the restrictions of the Dawes Plan...</p>
