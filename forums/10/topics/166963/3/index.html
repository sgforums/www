The salaries will now take into account not only the latest private-sector salaries as benchmarks, but also the overall state of the economy.<br><br>The monthly salaries of political, statutory and judicial appointment holders, as well as those in the Government's premier administrative service, were first cut in November 2001.<br><br>This was amid the economic uncertainty following the Sept 11 terrorist attacks in the US.<br><br>Then in July 2003, after the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), their salaries were cut again, by another 10 per cent.<br><br>These reductions expire on June 30.<br><br>The Nov 2001 cut will be restituted on July 1, and the July 2003 one, on Jan 1, 2005.<br><br>The PMO noted that the economy was now getting back on track, so the cuts could be restored.<br><br>The PMO also explained that when the Government introduced the private-sector benchmarks in 1994, its intention was to adjust public-sector salaries to the benchmark automatically every year in order to keep them competitive.<br><br>However, in the past 10 years since then, adjustments were made in only four years. This is because economic conditions have been unstable, and private-sector incomes have been more variable than expected.<br><br>So the Government will continue to track the private-sector benchmark annually, and continue to set public-sector salaries that over time match this benchmark.</span><br><span style="color: red;">However, in deciding on salary adjustments each year, it will take into account not just the latest benchmark figures, but also the broader state of the economy.</span><br><br><strong>Notice the innocent last sentence, now govt pay not pegged to economy somemore. When private sector pay is good, govt pay is pegged, when private sector is bad, govt pay is not pegged. So on what basis are the salaries set?

If the Gini coefficient is rising as well as GDP, poverty may not be improving for the vast majority of the population.<br><br>The Gini coefficient can be used to indicate how the distribution of income has changed within a country over a period of time, thus it is possible to see if inequality is increasing or decreasing.<br><br>The Gini coefficient satisfies four important principles:<br>Anonymity: it doesnÂ’t matter who the high and low earners are.<br>Scale independence: the Gini coefficient does not consider the size of the economy, the way it is measured, or whether it is a rich or poor country on average.<br>Population independence: it does not matter how large the population of the country is.<br>Transfer principle: if income (less than the difference), is transferred from a rich person to a poor person the resulting distribution is more equal.<br></div>
