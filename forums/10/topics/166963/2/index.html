GDP index counts for nothing...And if u pp know, they have been trying to emphasis on the lower unemployment rate, which i think is also quite untrue.. Prob there are more part-time jobs ard..tats all...<br><br>Know that happens to US. The democrats blasts the Republicans for unemployment rate....Though more jobs were created, but most were part-time jobs...
