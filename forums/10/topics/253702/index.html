            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Blair to step down in June after tumultuous decade</strong><br><br>Prime Minister Tony Blair announced his resignation Thursday, ending a tumultuous decade as one of Britain's most successful leaders who divided the nation over the Iraq war.<br><br>Blair, who will stand down on June 27, defended his record supporting the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks and the Iraq invasion, insisting: "Hand on heart, I did what I thought was right."<br><br>An emotional Blair told supporters at his northern England constituency, "I may have been wrong, that's your call. But believe one thing, if nothing else I did what I thought was right for our country."<br><br>"I thank the British people for the times that it went right. And I apologise for the times I have fallen short."<br><br>Blair, 54, will leave office after 10 years in power which started with the handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997 a few weeks after the first of his three general election triumphs.<br><br>He guided the nation and the royal family through the trauma of the death of Princess Diana, presided over a booming British economy and secured a peace deal for Northern Ireland, which was finally sealed this week.<br><br>But for many his legacy risks being clouded by the 2003 invasion of Iraq.<br><br>His premiership started amid euphoria but is ending with his popularity at record lows.<br><br>Blair said he had taken over a country "uncertain of its future, uncertain about the future," but insisted his government had achieved more than any other in Britain since 1945 because of the improved economy.<br><br>"I have been prime minister of this country for just over 10 years. In this job, in the world today, I think that is long enough for me."<br><br>Britain's deputy prime minister John Prescott, who has frequently made newspaper headlines with his comments and his private life, said he would also stand down.<br><br>Finance minister Gordon Brown, the frontrunner to replace Blair despite their rivalry, hailed the prime minister's "unique leadership" at a cabinet meeting in London before Blair flew off to Trimdon in northeast England to make his announcement, a spokesman said.<br><br>"There was much thumping of the table," said the spokesman.<br><br>"Gordon paid a very full tribute to Tony in there," added Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain.<br><br>Despite his poll slump at home, Blair remains a hugely popular figure in the United States and many other countries.<br><br>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe praised Blair saying: "He has achieved great results for the past 10 years. He won people's support by developing the economy and carrying out education reforms."<br><br>Blair won three general elections and originally promised to serve a full third term of office, which would have kept him in office to 2010, but not fight for a fourth term in office.<br><br>But after a mini "coup" by some Labour lawmakers last September, allegedly orchestrated by Brown, Blair was forced to say he would step down by September this year.<br><br>Brown, 56, who shared an office with Blair when they were first elected to parliament in 1983 and who jointly reformed Labour, is a virtual certainty to become his successor.<br><br>Senior cabinet-level colleagues, including Home Secretary John Reid and the much-fancied Environment Secretary David Miliband, have ruled out standing, leaving only two token challengers from the left wing of the party.<br><br>Under the British system, the leader of the biggest party in parliament automatically becomes prime minister.<br><br>Blair is expected to endorse Brown publicly as his successor for the first time, although observers believe he could delay this until Friday.<br><br>The pair's relationship has soured over the years, particularly over Brown's perception that Blair repeatedly reneged on a 1994 deal to hand over the reins of power to him after two terms of office.<br><br>Blair will remain in office as Labour leader and prime minister as well as a lawmaker during the campaign to succeed him.<br><br>He is due at the Group of Eight meeting in Germany and the European leaders summit in June and is expected to travel widely, including to France, the United States and Africa.<br><br>Speculation is mounting as to his future plans, which could include a possible international role such as president of the European Union, or making money on the lucrative lecture circuit, or simply writing his memoirs.<br><br>Blair's agent confirmed that Blair will stay on as a member of parliament, unless he is offered a "mammoth" international job after his resignation.<br><br>"He's not going to leave to go swanning around the United States doing lecture tours and things. That will come later," John Burton told reporters outside Trimdon Labour club.<br><br>Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock paid tribute to Blair as he prepared to make his announcement.<br><br>"The one word that has to be associated with Tony is 'winner'," he told BBC radio.</div>
