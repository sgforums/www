He was a regular at the dinner tables of business folk who enjoyed the racier end of town. A lover of kick boxing, Mokbel could mingle with the high-powered set that frequented such events. He was well liked and made friends and business connections.<br><br>Like many villains, Mokbel aspired to legitimate business. Indeed, he had all the outward trappings of a prosperous, if slightly oily, entrepreneur.<br><br>By 2000, when Thomson gave his reference in support of MokbelÂ’s liquor licence application, the Lebanese-born drug czar was riding high. He had invested the proceeds of his speed and coke sales well, cashing in on the apartment boom. Thomson says he was not aware he had personally met Mokbel, but there were others who could vouch for the well-connected applicant.<br><br>Mokbel owned several of MelbourneÂ’s leading nightclubs and had undeclared interests in others. It was rumoured he had taken control of a leading brothel after a shareholder had defaulted in a debt repayment. He also backed a well-known designer, Christopher Chronis, in the South Yarra boutique Love of Style and Design. (Maybe the acronym LSD should have rung some bells, but Fat Tony was into much more contemporary substances than the 1960s hallucinogen.) Chronis has no criminal connections and only discovered his backer was one of the countryÂ’s most dangerous drug villains when Fat Tony was arrested for cocaine importation in 2001.<br><br>When Mokbel was arrested, police seized or froze numerous assets, including a 1998 Ferrari Roadster, a brand new Mercedes-Benz, eight units in Templestowe worth more than $2 million, a row of shops in Coburg, investment properties in Melbourne and Queensland and several fat bank accounts. He did have mortgages, but there was a huge undeclared pool of cash that he hid from his friends in polite society. ItÂ’s estimated that Mokbel had amassed $20 million by the time he fled the country last year.<br><br>Mokbel was also a voracious and lucky punter. Leading jockeys were warned to stay away from him after his name came up in telephone intercepts in the infamous Jockey Tapes scandal. He and his wife Carmel were banned from owning racehorses by the Victoria Racing Club in 1999. He cultivated contacts with leading stables to get the best tips and rewarded hoops generously for their information. He enjoyed an extraordinary run of luck on the punt but sometimes he declined to pay the bookies when he lost. Later, he used intermediaries to place his bets as bookies declined to do business direct.<br><br>Certainly, Thomson was strictly correct in his reference for Mokbel when he said Fat Tony had made Â“a significant contribution to the communityÂ” but his character reference was less than comprehensive. MokbelÂ’s Â“unblemished conductÂ” had by 2000 included a string of arrests but the best was yet to come. ItÂ’s alleged that he paid for the murders of former kickboxing champ Michael Marshall and western suburbs crime patriarch Lewis Moran.<br><br>Before his flit, police reportedly overheard Mokbel boasting that he had hidden a huge cache of pseudoephedrine a day-and-halfÂ’s drive from Melbourne, enough precursor chemical to produce amphetamines worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The extent of his wealth may never be fully known. One source told The Bulletin he had once witnessed MokbelÂ’s henchmen moving money around a warehouse on a pallet truck. </blockquote><img src="http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/img/2007/issue11/mokbel_sml_a.jpg"></div>
