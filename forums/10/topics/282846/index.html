            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, just stating some points from a GP essay I wrote years ago in JC.<br><br>I believe that freedom and secruity are linked closely by an inverse relationship. More freedom leads to less secruity, and vice-versa. Overwhelming amounts of freedom without secruity is meaningless- like a death-row convict released into the middle of the Sahara and told "you are free to go anywhere". On the other hand, too much secruity and no freedom? Probably a Utopian communist state then. Or maybe like Huxley's "Brave New World".<br><br>The question is then, to find a balance between the two. In SG, not having the freedom of carrying firearms pretty much gives you the secruity of going out of home without worrying about a Virginia Tech U incident. Not having the freedom of playing mahjong to the dead of night gives you the secruity of having a good night sleep when your neighbour has a sudden urge for 2am Karaoke. Not having the freedom to manage your own money(CPF) gives you the secruity in other areas(Medisave, children's University loans, etc. DEBATABLE I know, don't flame me).<br><br>The electorade, in extension, and the PAP(or is it the other way around) have chosen the balance of freedom and secruity for Singapore. This balance has already been deeply wedged so it will take a lot of time to adjust. In my point of view, giving me more freedom will give me less secruity anyway. That is why I am politically apathetic.<br><br>Of course some countries do have it better than others. I am not well-informed about the Scandinavian states but it SEEMS that they do enjoy a generous amounts of Freedom and secruity(until a bomb blows up in their face...sooner or later) compared to lawless yet ALSO restrictive Iraq. And the oldest democracy in the world? Britain is now saddled with all-time shocking levels of teenage crime.<br><br>Just my 2 cents. Don't flame me too badly okay, I am a n00b.</div>
