            <div class='col-md body'>In the next 50 years,  the parliament will , I humbly predict, still only have 2 opposition seats.  Why?<br><br>The existing system has proven so effective that the winner can apply the same way of 'managing' SG that only 2 opposition  are capable of competing. I mean, the next winner will have the same millionaire talents all employed to run for him and the opposition got no millions to employ the bestest best to run against him.  And many other ways of 'best practice'  'management' styles can be used to control the direction the SG is heading. Got good role models and examples and systems like COE, ERP , annuity etc to reference mah.  So, I predict that although, 'unfortunately', there is a chance that the winner may not be of the same family tree, he will continue to reign the same way as the current world champions and using the proven systems and models, only 2 opposition seats will exist in the next 50 years.<br><br>Congratulations, everyone, 50 years into the future should cover all our lifespans.
