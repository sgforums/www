            <div class='col-md body'>Review practice of retaining ez-link cards<br><br>IT IS time SBS Transit and SMRT reviewed their system of retaining students' ez-link cards.<br><br>Recently, my son faced such a situation again, but unlike previous cases when there was a warning beep and alert message, there was no beep at all when he tapped his card.<br><br>The bus driver immediately retained his card. Luckily, I was with him and demanded that the driver return the card as legally he had no right to retain a student's ez-link card which is also a student identity card.<br><br>A check with SBS Transit later revealed that the problem was not that it was a stolen card but merely that the magnetic strip was damaged so the card reader was unable to read the card.<br><br>Can SBS Transit explain why we were treated in such a manner as to imply that the card had been stolen? I have the name of the bus driver but it is a change in the system that I would like to see. There is no point taking action against a driver when the fault lies in the practice adopted by the public transport companies.<br><br>Furthermore, I cannot understand why bus drivers do not simply inspect the photo on the card to verify whether it is that of the user. If it is, all the driver has to do is tell the user his card is damaged.<br><br>I cannot imagine how many students face this predicament every day.<br><br>A few months ago, I had to intervene on behalf of a young student in school uniform. There was no beep or alert message but the card was retained. The poor boy called his father to explain but his father did not believe him, thinking his son had done something wrong.<br><br>It is not unusual for parents not to believe the word of a young child against the action of a mature bus driver. The driver returned the boy's card only when I told him I would complain about his behaviour as 'unfair treatment' as he was not able to show me evidence to justify why he retained the card.<br><br>I would like to know how the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Transport intend to resolve this issue as the ez-link card also acts as a student identity card.<br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:41e3c7606f4b2110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.c2aef3d65baca16abb31f610a06310a0/?vgnextoid=7532758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=vgnartid:41e3c7606f4b2110VgnVCM100000430a0a0aRCRD</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And i was mentioning in a earlier thread that our people are downright paranoid - to assume an EZ-link card is 'stolen' from the off based on a electronic 'beep' is surely ridiculous.<br><br>There are a ton of reasons why an EZ-link card does not respond in the 'appropriate' manner, chief among them is a FAULTY card. During beta-testing, there were plenty of problems raised by the pool of beta-testers who survey-tested the card during its final phases, only to be glossed over and forgotten.<br><br>I can only imagine the number of under-reported cases of students and the public being held by overzealous drivers on the base assumption that the card was 'stolen' property.<br><br>And one would think that even with such marvellous profits, our transport development teams could not develop a more reliable package.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's why there needs to be radical changes in the whole public transport system here.<br><br>When you have profit as the sole objective of sustainability for a public transport model, the drivers will still be the ultimate destination of the policies that are overtly strict and angled towards the salvage of every single cent even when we know that attrition in operation cycles cannot be totally regained.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Checking the student's face on the ez-link cards... doable, but a tough task.<br><br>How many dare say that the photo printed on the ez-link card is your most recent photo? Or is it just another photo from your secondary or primary school?<br><br>Primary and secondary school students are especially vulnerable. All these cards are given to students when they are in primary or secondary. In secondary, it's worse. Those cards are automatically upgraded, which means, you will receive the blue card, with the same old primary school photo.<br><br>If for some reason the card is faulty, and the face doesn't match, it's just looking for trouble.<br><br>For polytechnics and universities, all students have to submit a recent photo, which more or less solves the face recognition problem.<br><br>I don't get why secondary schools can't get their students to submit a recent photo of themselves and submit to Transitlink for printing of cards before distributing, rather than automatically upgrading the cards to secondary school student status.<br><br>And students have a part to play. Learn to protect the cards, not damage it. I know some people love designs, but designs can damage a card. They are magnetic cards after all.</div>

I'm pretty sure there's nothing on their books that guarantee you'd be compensated for the period where you've been denied access to your concession.<br><br>On the issue addressed above, actually one solution to the problem would be to refuse to hand over the EZ-link card (rightly indicated by the bloke who wrote the letter). As a matter of fact, bus drivers dealing with such matters are advised to contact their operations control centre for help when passengers refuse to comply in such instances. It's indeed ludicrous there's little to clarify the ambiguity surrounding the circumstances under which such EZ-link cards could be retained.</div>
