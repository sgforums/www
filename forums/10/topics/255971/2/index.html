Typical of poor beta and alpha testing. What's worse was that later, despite the extra costs of the cards, they obviously underestimated the costs, and made us OWN the cards. Then coupled with the multiple problems that besieged the project, there was an uproar. I have no idea whether they even fixed that bug with people getting charged more when they leave the front door.<br><br>It is just symptomatic of a lot of stupid policies forced down our throats. Looks great on paper, but implementation terrible to the extreme. Otherwise, it was terrible, and it was forced down our throats regardless. Well done.<br></div>

There's no rebates when you transfer. Now that ez-link cards replaced it, it makes calculation of rebates simpler.<br><br>One could also say using the fare cards are cheaper, because nobody knew what price you pressed. But if caught, the penalty is heavy. You end up paying double of what you need. Automatic systems reduces the chances of it, but for those who tries to beat it, is just asking for trouble.</div>

As far as I know, should you refuse to handover the EZ-link card as requested, all the driver can do is get in touch with the operations control centre who will, in turn, deploy a staff/inspector to attend to you (although that's their "official" policy, I've yet to see an incident going to that extreme). That said, even that extreme would beat the idea of having your concession card retained, especially for those who are eligible and have purchased the concessions.<br><br></div>
