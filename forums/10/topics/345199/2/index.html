              <p>You can't have just any tom, dick and harry working on a construction site. Despite the perception of some elite members of our society, construction workers are tradesmen with skills and these cannot be learnt overnight. Same goes for nurses. We use foreign labour because not enough Singaporeans are trained to do these jobs. Someone posted earlier about Singapore being too dependent on external trade and how it has neglected building up internal capacity which I think is relevant in this case.</p>

              <p>Many of the foreign workers in our construction sites are unskilled workers who have been farmers a few weeks before. If people are hungry enough, they can be trained to do a new job.</p>

              <p>Internal Capacity ? Given our small population based , I do not think we can generate that much demand.</p>
              <p>I agree on forging business relationship with other countries. We should not only encourage businees startups but also faciliate  these startups in going into regional. It should be a game field whereby we go out to other countries and take their money into our economy. This game field should not be advantageoous to big companies like singtel with their India investment. Comfort delgro with the UK venture and ownership.</p>
              <p>The economy of the past singapore has done tremendous in getting other countries into investing into Singapore that we have these pillars of support for manufacturing  ( eg . Jurong Island petro refining and storage to downstream petrol chemical , Semicon manufacturing , Solar (REC and Norsun investment ), bio medical manufacturing ( SchringPlough ) etc. </p>
              <p>I will prefer that are more singapore companies (eg. CaptialLand , Keppel but smaller startups) that are able to invest into foreign lands with a return of investment . Our sight should be set on having bases in places out of singapore where opportunities are plenty. One should also know that doing business out of singapore contain much risk , (eg China , where scams are plenty and being a indirect victim of one of them). A good start will be to have influenctial governing bodies in overseas to upkeep the safety of business overseas.</p>

              countries and take their money into our economy. This game field
              should not be advantageoous to big companies like singtel with
              their India investment. Comfort delgro with the UK venture and
              ownership.</p>
              <p>The economy of the past singapore has done tremendous in getting
              other countries into investing into Singapore that we have these
              pillars of support for manufacturing  ( eg . Jurong Island
              petro refining and storage to downstream petrol chemical , Semicon
              manufacturing , Solar (REC and Norsun investment ), bio medical
              manufacturing ( SchringPlough ) etc. </p>
              <p>I will prefer that are more singapore companies (eg. CaptialLand
              , Keppel but smaller startups) that are able to invest into foreign
              lands with a return of investment . Our sight should be set on
              having bases in places out of singapore where opportunities are
              plenty. One should also know that doing business out of singapore
              contain much risk , (eg China , where scams are plenty and being a
              indirect victim of one of them). A good start will be to
              have influenctial governing bodies in overseas to upkeep
              the safety of business overseas.</p>

              <p>Of course, as a growth engine, our population is too small but building up internal capacity will make our economy more robust. It doesn't have to be one or the other, we can do both and anyway, such a small market doesn't really need much internal investments, we just need to choke people less.</p>

              Rejunvenate the domestic economy. Singapore domestic market died many years ago when Singaporeans travelled for leisure, holidays, social, medical, business, incentive, etc out of singapore, and spent almost all their money overseas and invested overseas.
              and in nearby Malaysia, Johore, Batam, Bintan, Bangkok and even in Cambodia, Vietnam.  There are no more provision shops, half the stalls in coffee shops are not taken up, half the shops and offices in shopping centres are empty. There is no demand and domestic consumer spending.  Stop this and put in measures for Singaporeans to spend in Singapore, instead of supporting the Malaysian economy etc

              <p>The problem is that a sudden change demands a sudden response, that is how nature works and i have no reason to doubt it applies to us as well.</p>
              <p>My main worry would be how factions within the PAP will respond if they suddenly saw their power diminished and do not have the capacity to accept it, which most likely they don't. </p>
              <p>If this sudden change of government is to happen, it has better be while LKY is alive. At the very least he would be able to keep things from going out of hand. </p>
              <p>There are a lot of reprecussions and side effects that would result from a sudden change of political power and may not be apparent immediately to the casual observer.</p>
              <p>Just because people chose to take a more pro PAP stance does not neccessarily mean they are blind to the ills of the PAP.</p>
              <p>To me the most desirable outcome is for the opposition to net a GRC or 2 next election, an outcome much like the Malaysian elections. Able to form a bigger minority but not a big majority yet. This would give them a bigger voice in Parliament in favor of the people and give them the neccessary experience to perform better on the next elections, understand better the functioning of the bureaucracy and essentially be better politicians.</p>
              <p>The main reason i dislike CSJ is that he has not shown himself to be a shrew politician and thinks that taking a confrontational stance will solve problems. After being sued so badly, i have no doubt that he's now an extremely bitter man who should not be allowed anywhere near a position of power.</p>

              <p>The main premise of the trade agreements is to cut back on tarrifs to near zero on exports and imports on both sides of the agreement, and the opening of markets. This in turn means that companies involved in the trade benefit from reduced costs.</p>
              <p>However, how does it stimulate more trade? Costs is only one factor in the overall decision matrix. The first question is what we have to offer. The next is what the other side offers. The final is whether we are a large enough market worth caring about. All of the above vary from trade agreement to trade agreement, because for example, in the case of the Singapore-US FTA, the actual benefit is at best mostly limited to the banking sector, because that's the only sector that is most appealing to foreigners. And even so, HK has long benefited from its willingness to open up the gates of its financial sector. We were merely playing catch up. For the India/Singapore FTA, I'm not sure how to quantify that. On one hand, we can go offer services in India, on the other, the legendary Indian byzantine bureaucracy is sure to put a damper on anything.</p>
              <p>In the case of the banking sector, it expanded quite a lot over the
              last 5 years because of government liberalisation. Let's face it, the
              local banks suck monkey balls when compared against their larger
              European and US counterparts. So letting more sophisticated competition in meant that our local banks had to reform considerably to fight back. But note, that banking sector is the main sector that actually saw considerable benefits. Even the telecommunications sector is still dominated by a triad of government linked companies.</p>
              <p>Another thing to note, for companies who have no choice but to deal with middle men, given the small size of our economy and the lack of competition, the benefit is low or neglible. Why? Simple. Just because costs have gone down, does not mean the middle men are willing to cut back on prices. They won't. So the actual tangible benefit is going to be hard to analyse and quantify.</p>

              <p>You have no real idea what an FTA does don't you?</p>
              <p>A very key component of an FTA is the issue of rules of origin. The above <strong>does not work</strong>. Tarrifs are applied to any article that does not originate from Singapore. Simply put, whatever is sold has to be made in Singapore, and sold from Singapore.</p>
