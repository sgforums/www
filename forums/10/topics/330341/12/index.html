              <p><em>And not one sex offender found guilty of rape received a maximum sentence in the five years to mid-2006. <br><br>The

              <p>I WISH to express my concern about the frequency of fights and subsequent police action at Boat Quay.<br> <br> I was there one morning at about 3am when I witnessed a fracas between
              a group of about 10 men and a smaller group of five youngsters outside
              a pub named 12th Element. The bigger group appeared aggressive and was
              about to attack the youngsters when a police patrol car stopped beside
              them. The presence of the police deterred a possible violent clash from
              ensuing and the five youngsters were able to walk away unscathed, while
              being taunted by the larger group.<br> <br> I was surprised the police officers did not alight from their vehicle
              to conduct an identity check or take any action, but continued to drive
              down the lane.<br> <br> However, what I witnessed just 20 minutes later really appalled me.<br> <br> I was outside a pub named Speed Legend and witnessed a man being
              attacked by a group of five men. One of the attackers, a man in his 20s
              with long hair and dressed in black, smashed a beer bottle against the
              victim's head as his friends continued to rain punches and kicks on the
              fallen victim. They were also shouting secret society slogans, even
              though there were many witnesses like myself watching the attack in
              shock and fear.<br> <br> The police and ambulance arrived shortly, and the victim, bleeding
              heavily from the head, was immediately taken to hospital. The
              attackers, however, continued to appear extremely violent and
              aggressive despite being confronted by the police. The attackers were
              interviewed by the police and, after about 10 minutes, were allowed to
              walk away smugly without being arrested.<br> <br> I am sincerely worried and fearful about the brazenness of these gang
              members, and even more so about the actions of the police. No witnesses
              were interviewed and many of the bystanders had left in fear as the
              attackers walked past them. Although I applaud the police for the fast
              response time and much needed presence, I hope they can tell me why no
              action was taken.<br> <br> Oh Kok Tong</p>

Weak exports and falling commodities prices weigh on growth, and analysts said the government needs to take further steps to support the economy on top of last month's US$6.1 billion (S$9.31 billion) fiscal stimulus package.<br><br>In Malaysia and Thailand, demand is hurt by crumbling exports. Thailand's economy is set to shrink 1.5 per cent this year while Malaysia will see a 1.2 per cent contraction.

TNP PICTURE: JONATHAN CHOO <br><br>HE WAS about to take a train seat vacated by a woman when he was pushed to the floor and beaten.<br><br>Why? Poh Yi Hao, 17, says he still doesn't know.<br><br>The beating, he said, lasted about 20 seconds. The junior college student crouched in agony as a man kept punching him.<br><br>The man then sat on the vacated seat. <br><br>Yi Hao said the carriage was full and all the other seats were taken.<br><br>When the train stopped at the next station, Yi Hao managed to stumble out and asked for help from the SMRT staff.<br><br>The incident happened around 3pm on 6 Mar. <br><br>Yi Hao told The New Paper that he was on his way to meet his former secondary schoolmates after school.<br><br>He boarded the train at City Hall MRT station and was supposed to alight at Tanah Merah station. When he entered the train, he noticed a man standing next to him.<br><br>Yi Hao said the man was about 1.73m, had a crew cut and was wearing a long-sleeved black shirt and jeans.<br><br>'He seemed a bit weird,' Yi Hao recalled. 'As he moved towards two of his friends (who were standing near the door), he pushed everyone away and stepped on my feet.' <br><br>Yi Hao then saw a woman get up from her seat, which was in front of where he was standing.<br><br>Just as he was about to sit down, Yi Hao said the man pushed him to the floor.<br><br>'Then he gave me about seven punches to the left side of my head above my ear.'<br><br>Throughout the attack, Yi Hao's assailant did not say a word.<br><br>To shield himself from the blows, Yi Hao said he covered his face with both his hands.<br><br>Ms Angela Foo, 50, another passenger, who saw the attack, told The New Paper in Mandarin: 'The boy was actually very smart (not to retaliate). The attacker was pretty big. You wouldn't want to provoke him.'<br><br>Yi Hao agreed.<br><br>'He was muscular and was fierce when he beat me. I couldn't have subdued him so I just protected myself.'<br><br>Both Yi Hao and Ms Foo said no one else in the carriage went to his aid.<br><br>But Yi Hao does not blame them. He said: 'Most of them were in shock.'<br><br>Ms Foo said that before the incident, Yi Hao's alleged assailant had given up his seat to a pregnant woman, so she was shocked by his sudden change in behaviour.<br><br>Ms Foo added that she was too afraid to intervene during the attack as the man had been carrying a bag, which she feared could have contained weapons.<br><br>Felt giddy <br><br>When the train arrived at Bugis MRT station, Yi Hao, who was feeling giddy from the attack, got off. Ms Foo and her friend followed him to make sure he was okay.<br><br>They reported the incident to the station manager, who told Yi Hao to seek medical treatment and file a police report.<br><br>An SMRT spokesman confirmed that Yi Hao had reported the matter to them.<br><br>She added: 'SMRT advises passengers who are harassed or assaulted during their train journey to report the matter to the train officer immediately by activating the Emergency Communication Button located at the side of the train door.'<br><br>Yi Hao later went to a polyclinic in Bedok to get treatment for his injuries, which he said were not serious.<br><br>He had a bruise on the left side of his head.<br><br>After the incident, he went to the Bedok North Police Centre to make a report. There, he was advised to lodge a magistrate's complaint.<br><br>But what followed was some confusion which led Yi Hao to write to The Straits Times.<br><br>He said: '(The) advice was given despite the fact that I had told the woman police officer that I could identify the man easily and that there were many witnesses to the attack.<br><br>'The police officer's reply was that (his identification) was of no help as (the man's) actual identity was still unknown.<br><br>'The officer added that I should have used the emergency button to stop the train to allow the train staff to detain the assailant.<br><br>'It is absurd that the authorities are unable to investigate an assault in public on a train, and offer little but sympathy over the incident, even if the injuries I suffered were not severe.'<br><br>But a police spokesman, replying to The New Paper, disputed this. <br><br>Joanna Hor Peixin, newsroom intern</div>

                  cent in 2010 as fiscal stimulus kicks in.<br> <br> In contrast, Southeast Asia's biggest economy, Indonesia, is poised
                  to expand by 4 per cent this year, and 5.1 per cent in 2010, as
                  exports contribute only about a third of GDP, making it much less
                  dependent on trade than its neighbours.<br> <br> Still, the growth forecast is well down from a 4.8 per cent
                  estimate in a poll three months ago. Weak exports and falling
                  commodities prices weigh on growth, and analysts said the
                  government needs to take further steps to support the economy on
                  top of last month's US$6.1 billion (S$9.31 billion) fiscal stimulus
                  package.<br> <br> In Malaysia and Thailand, demand is hurt by crumbling exports.
                  Thailand's economy is set to shrink 1.5 per cent this year while
                  Malaysia will see a 1.2 per cent contraction. The poll forecast
                  Malaysia would pick up slightly next year, with GDP growing 2.8 per
                  cent while Thailand is set for a 2.9 per cent expansion in
                  2010.<br> <br> The forecast that the economy will shrink 1.5 per cent this year
                  reverses a 2.8 per cent growth forecast three months ago and an
                  actual 2.6 per cent expansion in 2008.<br> <br> For the Philippines, the poll forecast the economy to expand by
                  just 2.3 per cent this year, lower than a 3.3 per cent growth
                  estimate in a similar poll in December and below government
                  expectations for at least 3.7 per cent growth, as a deepening
                  global recession chokes exports and slows remittance inflows. --

                  beat him. TNP PICTURE: JONATHAN CHOO<br> <br> HE WAS about to take a train seat vacated by a woman when he was
                  pushed to the floor and beaten.<br> <br> Why? Poh Yi Hao, 17, says he still doesn't know.<br> <br> The beating, he said, lasted about 20 seconds. The junior college
                  student crouched in agony as a man kept punching him.<br> <br> The man then sat on the vacated seat.<br> <br> Yi Hao said the carriage was full and all the other seats were
                  taken.<br> <br> When the train stopped at the next station, Yi Hao managed to
                  stumble out and asked for help from the SMRT staff.<br> <br> The incident happened around 3pm on 6 Mar.<br> <br> Yi Hao told The New Paper that he was on his way to meet his former
                  secondary schoolmates after school.<br> <br> He boarded the train at City Hall MRT station and was supposed to
                  alight at Tanah Merah station. When he entered the train, he
                  noticed a man standing next to him.<br> <br> Yi Hao said the man was about 1.73m, had a crew cut and was wearing
                  a long-sleeved black shirt and jeans.<br> <br> 'He seemed a bit weird,' Yi Hao recalled. 'As he moved towards two
                  of his friends (who were standing near the door), he pushed
                  everyone away and stepped on my feet.'<br> <br> Yi Hao then saw a woman get up from her seat, which was in front of
                  where he was standing.<br> <br> Just as he was about to sit down, Yi Hao said the man pushed him to
                  the floor.<br> <br> 'Then he gave me about seven punches to the left side of my head
                  above my ear.'<br> <br> Throughout the attack, Yi Hao's assailant did not say a word.<br> <br> To shield himself from the blows, Yi Hao said he covered his face
                  with both his hands.<br> <br> Ms Angela Foo, 50, another passenger, who saw the attack, told The
                  New Paper in Mandarin: 'The boy was actually very smart (not to
                  retaliate). The attacker was pretty big. You wouldn't want to
                  provoke him.'<br> <br> Yi Hao agreed.<br> <br> 'He was muscular and was fierce when he beat me. I couldn't have
                  subdued him so I just protected myself.'<br> <br> Both Yi Hao and Ms Foo said no one else in the carriage went to his
                  aid.<br> <br> But Yi Hao does not blame them. He said: 'Most of them were in
                  shock.'<br> <br> Ms Foo said that before the incident, Yi Hao's alleged assailant
                  had given up his seat to a pregnant woman, so she was shocked by
                  his sudden change in behaviour.<br> <br> Ms Foo added that she was too afraid to intervene during the attack
                  as the man had been carrying a bag, which she feared could have
                  contained weapons.<br> <br> Felt giddy<br> <br> When the train arrived at Bugis MRT station, Yi Hao, who was
                  feeling giddy from the attack, got off. Ms Foo and her friend
                  followed him to make sure he was okay.<br> <br> They reported the incident to the station manager, who told Yi Hao
                  to seek medical treatment and file a police report.<br> <br> An SMRT spokesman confirmed that Yi Hao had reported the matter to
                  them.<br> <br> She added: 'SMRT advises passengers who are harassed or assaulted
                  during their train journey to report the matter to the train
                  officer immediately by activating the Emergency Communication
                  Button located at the side of the train door.'<br> <br> Yi Hao later went to a polyclinic in Bedok to get treatment for his
                  injuries, which he said were not serious.<br> <br> He had a bruise on the left side of his head.<br> <br> After the incident, he went to the Bedok North Police Centre to
                  make a report. There, he was advised to lodge a magistrate's
                  complaint.<br> <br> But what followed was some confusion which led Yi Hao to write to
                  The Straits Times.<br> <br> He said: '(The) advice was given despite the fact that I had told
                  the woman police officer that I could identify the man easily and
                  that there were many witnesses to the attack.<br> <br> 'The police officer's reply was that (his identification) was of no
                  help as (the man's) actual identity was still unknown.<br> <br> 'The officer added that I should have used the emergency button to
                  stop the train to allow the train staff to detain the
                  assailant.<br> <br> 'It is absurd that the authorities are unable to investigate an
                  assault in public on a train, and offer little but sympathy over
                  the incident, even if the injuries I suffered were not
                  severe.'<br> <br> But a police spokesman, replying to The New Paper, disputed
                  this.<br> <br> Joanna Hor Peixin, newsroom intern</div>

              the past five years. But analysts foresee it rebounding 3.9 per
              cent in 2010 as fiscal stimulus kicks in.<br> <br> In contrast, Southeast Asia's biggest economy, Indonesia, is poised
              to expand by 4 per cent this year, and 5.1 per cent in 2010, as
              exports contribute only about a third of GDP, making it much less
              dependent on trade than its neighbours.<br> <br> Still, the growth forecast is well down from a 4.8 per cent
              estimate in a poll three months ago. Weak exports and falling
              commodities prices weigh on growth, and analysts said the
              government needs to take further steps to support the economy on
              top of last month's US$6.1 billion (S$9.31 billion) fiscal stimulus
              package.<br> <br> In Malaysia and Thailand, demand is hurt by crumbling exports.
              Thailand's economy is set to shrink 1.5 per cent this year while
              Malaysia will see a 1.2 per cent contraction. The poll forecast
              Malaysia would pick up slightly next year, with GDP growing 2.8 per
              cent while Thailand is set for a 2.9 per cent expansion in
              2010.<br> <br> The forecast that the economy will shrink 1.5 per cent this year
              reverses a 2.8 per cent growth forecast three months ago and an
              actual 2.6 per cent expansion in 2008.<br> <br> For the Philippines, the poll forecast the economy to expand by
              just 2.3 per cent this year, lower than a 3.3 per cent growth
              estimate in a similar poll in December and below government
              expectations for at least 3.7 per cent growth, as a deepening
              global recession chokes exports and slows remittance inflows. --
