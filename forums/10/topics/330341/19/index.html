              <p>1) you   <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">     assume</span></span> the
                                      figure of ppl leaving sg. which makes an ass out of u and
                                      me.-----<span style="text-decoration: underline;">answer:no need to assume.Just check the ICA'' No criminal
                                      certificate'' then u know.</span></p>
              <p>2) Thailand. You're obviously just a toad in a well.</p>
              <p>3) As far as education fee is concern, why don't you check it up
                                      yourself, since you're so good at checking up on OZ?
                                      <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">remember to use ratio of pay

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">pay more.How?</span></p>
              <p> ** why should i care about other country's citizens when
                                      at home we're already having problems? Shouldn't my country,
                                      Singapore comes first?</p>
              <p>and lastly, you seems to have missed out on: this post dated

                                      yet playing the number game? Do OZ have workers who don't get their
                                      pay on time? and have protest in their M.O.M(i don't know what it
                                      is called in OZ).?---<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are u sure no such things happen in

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do OZ citizens get priority

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do OZ citizens male citizens need

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OMG?without cheap labours,flag in Istana will be changed
                                      overnight,</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporean men will be killed,women raped and children starved
                                      to death,like during Japanese Occupation.Do u counts on UN or USA
                                      to save our ass?</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do u know every country,medium to very big countries,want to
                                      control</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strait of Singapore.If u control this Strait,u control half of

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Japan,Korea and Taiwan.Why---oil!!So,SG is like a internatioal
                                      police</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">patrolling this Strait,make sure no big country can control thus

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and open to all countries.I think i tell u more in military
                                      Nuts....</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do OZ citizens need to be pwned so
                                      badly by their government telling them that their wages is too high
                                      and thus uncompetitive?-------<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PAP better tell us
                                      earlier.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Or else SG become another GM,super high cost products and no one

              <p>and by the way,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">geylang
                                      in sg is not a very safe place too.(this is lilian 84)<br></span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p>**Do you know that Singapore is artificially increasing her
                                      population via import of foreigners? You've been pwned. Do you know
                                      why? let me show you a example:</p>
              <p>sg population year 2001: 1,000,000    no. of
                                      leavers: 10,000 new citizen: 30,000</p>
              <p>for every 10,000 that leaves singapore, 30,000 more are imported
                                      to replace and increase the populations. Thus, It will appears that
                                      each year, there's lesser and lesser ppl leaving sg. I hope it is
                                      not so complicated for your brain to absorb.----</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do u know their are 2 kinds of FT.1 is those working here who
                                      contribute</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">income tax and in turn create profits tax for SG.another is
                                      those customers here,like students and medicial tourists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One FT family here need to rent a HDB flat to a landed
                                      house.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In turn,it can save a owner from defaulting paying
                                      instalment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One foreign student can increase a HDB family  income</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">by providing Foods and lodging to the student....How come u just

              <p>**Do you know that Singapore is artificially increasing her
                  population via import of foreigners? You've been pwned. Do you know
                  why? let me show you a example:</p>
              <p>sg population year 2001: 1,000,000    no. of
                  leavers: 10,000 new citizen: 30,000</p>
              <p>for every 10,000 that leaves singapore, 30,000 more are imported
                  to replace and increase the populations. Thus, It will appears that
                  each year, there's lesser and lesser ppl leaving sg. I hope it is
                  not so complicated for your brain to absorb.----</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do u know their are 2

                  create profits tax for SG.another is those customers here,like

                                      for letting a teenage rapist go free and declaring the boy's crime
                                      <span style="color: #ff0000;">"an adolescent
                                      error".</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Experienced judge Ro</span>wan
                                      McIndoe found the 16-year-old had sex with a girl without her
                                      consent, but labelled it <span style="color: #ff0000;">"a technical
                                      rape</span>".</p>
              <p>Victims' groups said the decision was offensive, and warned it
                                      sent a confusing message to young men.</p>
              <p>A Supreme Court judge who reviewed the ruling on appeal last
                                      week said the magistrate's words were "at the very least
                                      unfortunate".</p>
              <p>"There is no such thing as a technical rape. Rape is a serious
                                      criminal offence," Justice Beach said.</p>
              <p>He dismissed an appeal by the boy's lawyers and ruled a rape
                                      conviction should stand.</p>
              <p>The sex assault occurred in 2007 when the girl - then 17 -
                                      visited the boy, whom she once went out with for about two
                                      months.</p>
              <p>After watching TV, she got into bed with him and they kissed and
                                      performed other consensual acts until he forced himself on her.</p>
              <p>She gave evidence she told him to stop and get off and said "he
                                      kept having sex with me after I'd said I didn't want to".</p>
              <p>In a police interview tendered to the magistrate, the boy
                                      admitted hearing the girl object. "She said - she did say, 'No',
                                      but like very quietly," he told police.</p>
              <p>Later in the interview, he added: "But like, she didn't push me
                                      off or anything."</p>
              <p>He changed his evidence in court, but Magistrate McIndoe said
                                      the victim was "a most persuasive witness" and accepted her account
                                      of events.</p>
              <p>"And I think there is no doubt the evidence . . . by the
                                      prosecution establishes as fact that there was absence of consent,"
                                      he said.</p>
              <p>Having found the charge proved in March last year, Mr McIndoe
                                      discharged the matter the following day. The court register records
                                      the order as: "Defendant discharged. Other reasons: A technical
                                      rape more an adolescent error . . ."</p>
              <p>The order would likely have stayed hidden behind secrecy laws
                                      shielding Children's Court cases if not for last week's Supreme
                                      Court appeal judgment.</p>
              <p>Victorian Centres Against Sexual Assault convener Karen Hogan
                                      said the magistrate's comments were disappointing.</p>
              <p>"If someone says no, it means no. Rape is rape," she said. "(The
                                      boy) has committed an offence and the judge has said, 'yes, you
                                      have, but we'll ignore it'. What does that say to the victim?"</p>
              <p>National Association of Services Against Sexual Violence chair
                                      Karen Willis said there was no such thing as "a technical
                                      rape".</p>
              <p>"I think the average 16-year-old understands no. It's not an

              <p>You are going to be very dissapointed if you expect constructive discussion from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>lionnoisy has no intention whatsoever, of engaging anybody in constructive discussion, his only objective here is to be as Rah-Rah for Singapore no matter the cost, even if it stems to irrationally finding fault with Australia.</p>
              <p>Why Australia? Because he feels threatened by the fact that Australia is viewed by many Singaporeans as a prime location to migrate to, hence he feels the need to try to feel better about his Rah-Rah feelings about Singapore by trying to "prove" that Australia is a living hell and the people that go there are fools for leaving Singapore, the "best" nation in the world.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately this person does not know anything about the meaning of being a patroit, or a true Singaporean.</p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>
