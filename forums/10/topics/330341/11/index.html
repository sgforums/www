              Prosecutions urgently appeal against the sentence of a 24-year-old man
              who escaped jail <span style="color: #ff0000;">despite pleading guilty to raping a</span> four-year-girl as
              she slept at her grandmother's house.</em></p>
              <p><em>The man, who cannot
              be named, was given a two-year suspended jail term in the District
              Court in Sydney on February 5 after he pleaded guilty to breaking into
              a house at Gulmarrad near Yamba in November 2007 and sexually
              assaulting the girl.</em></p>
              <p><em>Police were called to
              the house on November 22 after the girl's grandmother discovered her
              car had been broken into. When they arrived, the girl told them that a
              man had been inside the house overnight and had sexually assaulted her.
              The man was arrested five days after the attack when police matched him
              to DNA on clothing found at the scene.</em></p>
              <p><em>He was
              charged with sexual assault of a person under the age of 10 as well as
              several other charges including break and enter. The man spent 14
              months in prison awaiting his sentence but walked free after his
              appearance last month.</em></p>
              <p><em>The shadow attorney-general, Greg
              Smith, said the Director of Public Prosecutions should urgently
              consider an appeal and described the sentence as "unbelievable".</em></p>
              <p><em>"It
              seems totally inappropriate for the court to impose such a light
              sentence where the maximum penalty for such an offence is 25 years. An
              explanation is required," he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>Mr Smith said the leniency of the sentence sent a poor message to the community.</em></p>
              <p><em>"The
              community have a right to expect the punishment to fit the crime. Here
              the crime was against a four-year-old child," he said.</em></p>
              <p><em>The
              girl's MP, Steve Cansdell, said he was "angry and disgusted" the man
              had been released. "I have had a crisis meeting with shadow
              attorney-general Greg Smith and he has agreed the NSW Opposition will
              do everything possible to convince the Director of Public Prosecutions
              to appeal this ridiculously lenient sentence.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Crimes
              against children, particularly those of a sexual nature, deserve the
              harshest possible punishment, but instead this animal is out on the
              streets, walking and possibly stalking his next victim."</em></p>
              <p><em>A spokesman for the DPP refused to comment, saying his office was awaiting a transcript of the judgment.</em>''</p>

              with the madam of a Melbourne brothel. The woman took her passport
              and told her she owed $40,000 for her visa and travel costs.</em></p>
              <p><em>Mae's English is broken, but her meaning is clear: she had been
              sold. "I didn't have no choice," she says. "The first day, I was so
              confused. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. The boss
              showed me how to use the room, how to use the condom, and how to
              use KY.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Once the customer came in, he would wait in the waiting room
              and all the girls would have to take turns to come to walk in front
              of him. He would pick anyone and we would go to the room."</em></p>
              <p><em>Mae says she had never seen the inside of a brothel before. For
              the next seven months, it was all she would know. "I could not get
              out of the brothel, even to get fresh air."</em></p>
              <p><em>Mae had to work seven days a week, often 24 hours a day. She
              lived in the brothel, sleeping on the couch or in the "working
              room", if it was free.''</em></p>

              <p><em>''Commander Trevor Carter, who manages police across <span style="color: #ff0000;">Melbourne's west</span>,
              said the rosters did not provide an accurate picture because many
              officers were seconded to special taskforces within the district.</em></p>
              <p><em>But
              the Police Association confirmed there was a chronic shortage of
              officers, saying a study last year revealed the City of Brimbank —which
              includes Sunshine and Keilor Downs — was short 89 police.</em></p>
              <p><em>Residents last night rallied against growing violence in Sunshine, amid fears the shortage could lead to vigilante action.</em></p>
              <p><em>Sunshine
              Residents and Ratepayers' Association spokesman Sean Spencer told the
              angry crowd that the western suburbs had suffered from institutional
              neglect for many years.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Why do we tell our kids to stop
              using public transport? It's because the thugs and gangs of criminals
              now own this area," he said. "Our vote is taken for granted by the
              laziest, least talented members of Parliament, who do nothing for our
              community."</em></p>
              <p><em>The Age this week reported Indian
              businessman Abdullah Rubel was arming himself with a walking stick in
              self-defence, after police took three hours to respond to an assault
              outside his Sunshine store.''</em></p>
