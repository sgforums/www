              <p>good news.crime rates in Vic is dropping!!</p>
              <p>In Victoria of Australia,a state of about 5 million,</p>
              <p>the average crime rate for</p>
              <p>2006/2007 and 2007/2008 is <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">7,256/100,000

              <p>ie (7327 + 7185)/2.</p>
              <p>Compare with Singapore is <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">720/100,000,average for past 2

              <p>That is,crime rate in Vic is 10 times of SG per 100,000

              <p>Australia has more civil liberties compared to Singapore, therefore punishments are not too draconian like Singapore. If Australia wants to have lower crime rates, all they have to do is throw away civil liberties and impose extremely high prison sentences. I doubt you even heard of or understand the term civil liberties.</p>
              <p>Despite Australia's high crime rate, should I choose to emigrate, I will still put Australia high in my list of habitable countries. I can't say the same for you though, given your command of English, I think they will have problems processing your immigration forms. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>There is nowhre in the world with no crime. but rather the
              degree of the crime shows somethign about the society. That aussie
              hater is out to mistwist this news of crime rate. the crime rate
              can be 10x higher, but what crimes being committed?, is not being
              elaborated. It could be theft of property making up most of
              them</p>
              <p>the degree of severity of 10 thefts commited is not equal to 1
              murder, which has a much higher severity.</p>
              <p>Imagine this scenario: A peaceful society or neighbourhood can
              be ruined by just one murder in its vicinity which can cause much
              more mass hysteria and panic than  one isolated incident
              of  theft. At most it will be written off as a one off case
              where someone has been careless wih their property arising in

              <p><br>I thought I explained to you why more Australians leave their country before. They are more educationally qualified compared to Singaporeans, as they have more graduates compared to Singapore. More graduates means more qualify for emigration to other countries. If someone is so ugly like you with no qualifications and only persist in bad mouthing others to make yourself look good, which other country will want you. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seriously, do you qualify for immigrant status in any country?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One factor that affects the eligibility of citizens for migration is educational level. A developed country assesses the suitability of candidates based on educational level, the higher the educational level, the more likely you would be granted citizenship. Another factor could be the amount of wealth that you can bring into their country.</p>
              <p>There could also be other social factors that precludes Asians from migrating to more westernised societies.</p>
              <p>Australia's above Bachelor Degree graduates was 22.7% for 2006, while Singapore's was 13.5% for 2005. There is no question that Australia has more qualified candidates for immigration. Not many people in Singapore qualify for immigration to developed countries.</p>
              <p>There is little doubt that "lionnoisy" could ever satisfy the criteria for immigration status in Australia, hence the vindictiveness of his attitude towards Australia. <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>One thing's for sure, I am just glad I don't live next door to "lionnoisy", for if I were to better him in any aspects, he would start criticising me and my family in front of our neighbours. <img src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I moved to Melbourne from Singapore with my family 11 years ago. Sadly, i have to agree with the statistics here. </p>
              <p>During my 13years in Singapore, I have not once experienced any crimes committed against me or my family and friends.</p>
              <p>Since moving here, my house has been broken into twice, my bro was beaten up and robbed while waiting for a bus, 2 of my friends were robbed at knife point, and as recent as 5 months ago my neighbor was stabbed to DEATH by a group of drunk teenagers.</p>
              <p>Drugs are a common sight here, used syringes litter the streets and i have even been offered drugs while walking on the street.</p>
              <p>I definately feel that Singapore is a MUCH MUCH MUCH safer place than Australia.</p>

              <p>The reasons the table just show selected crimes.</p>
              <p>Then the table shall be renamed</p>
              <p><em><strong>Rate of Selected crimes in Victoria</strong></em></p>
              <p>Do u think so?</p>
              <blockquote>Rates of crime<br>Victoria Police collects a range of statistics on recorded crime that are used to analyse trends (in rates per 100 000 population) for 27 broad offence categories###. These statistics indicate that the total reported crime rate has fallen by 15.3 per cent when compared to the target’s baseline year of 2002-03. Since 2000-01 Victoria’s crime rate has reduced by 23.5 per cent. This report focuses on trends in recorded crime against the person and motor vehicle theft over the last six years.</blockquote>

              <p>I am sad Vic gavaman also wants to cook the books.</p>
              <p>U can says reader Beware and they expect u to read full text!!</p>
              <p>But as a layman u and me,u think the bar charts is the whole picture!!</p>
              <p>u probably wont know there are 27 broad offence categories!!</p>
              <p>To be fair,in the</p>
              <p><em>APPENDIX B – GROWING VICTORIA TOGETHER<br> PROGRESS REPORT,it did mention another category</em></p>
              <p>of crime in rail networks!!</p>
              <p>This is a misleading presentation of crime rate in Vic!!</p>
              <p>So sad.The most highest GDP per capita state in Oz also not</p>
              <p>so honest!!</p>

              <p>I moved to Melbourne from Singapore with my family 11 years ago.
              Sadly, i have to agree with the statistics here. </p>
              <p>During my 13years in Singapore, I have not once experienced any
              crimes committed against me or my family and friends.</p>
              <p>Since moving here, my house has been broken into twice, my bro
              was beaten up and robbed while waiting for a bus, 2 of my friends
              were robbed at knife point, and as recent as 5 months ago my
              neighbor was stabbed to DEATH by a group of drunk teenagers.</p>
              <p>Drugs are a common sight here, used syringes litter the streets
              and i have even been offered drugs while walking on the street.</p>
              <p>I definately feel that Singapore is a MUCH MUCH MUCH safer place
              than Australia.</p>

              <p>I have one simple question for noisy dumb lion.</p>
              <p>You say in your post that Oz people living in Oz know Oz well.</p>
              <p>You don't live in Oz, you were rejected by Oz immigration.</p>
              <p>What experience of Oz gives you the right to make a comment about life in Oz or make a judgment?</p>
              <p>Answer this, don't run away with your bullshit twisted "facts".</p>
