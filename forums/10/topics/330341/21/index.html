              <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, mono;">In 1996, after treatment relapse rates among drug addicts remained above 70 percent. In 1997, those arrested for drug offenses numbered 4750. Reports indicate that drug addiction is disproportionately high among poor, unemployed, Malay males with low education`.
              <p>Drug addiction continues to be a serious problem among the poor and low educated in Singapore despite harsh anti-drugs laws. Persistent drug addicts who have been admitted more than twice to a drugs rehabilitation centre are treated as criminals who may be imprisoned for up to 13 years and caned. The death penalty is mandatory for anyone, over the age of 18, found in possession of more than 15 grams of heroin, 30 grams of morphine or cocaine, or 500 grams of cannabis. It is presumed to be trafficking in drug, unless the contrary can be proved.</p>
              <p>Drug addiction will continue as long as the social conditions pushing it exists when these conditions are alleviated the demand for illicit drugs will surely drop. Society should give the addicts an opportunity to integrate and provide access to decent jobs. Society is, partly, responsible for this unhealthy trend! But it seems drug abusers, those in possession of drugs and minor traffickers, are put to death or imprisoned while those behind the crime escape.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drug addiction: Rational and Humane approach</span> <br>Statistics indicate that out of 340 people executed between 1991 and 2000, 247 had been convicted of drug trafficking. Drug addiction is disproportionately high among young people coming from broken families, the poor and the unemployed with low education - the excluded people of Singapore. Many of those convicted for drug offense and face death penalty are from these social background. We may still wish to turn the face the other way but the death penalty remains with human mistakes and discrimination. This inhumane practice remains a part of our justice system.</p>
              <p>The mandatory death sentence must be removed. The laws have to be changed to permit judicial discretion and fairness for drug cases.</p>
              <p>Under the current practices judges are helpless to do anything about the a disproportional number drug addicts who are young school drop-outs, poor and broken family background. They face heavy sentencing and death.</p>
              <p>At the whim of an overzealous CNB officer or the prosecutor, a drug addict or a "runner" could be serving long term prison sentences or sentence to death for not volunteering to supply information against other suspects.</p>
              <p>Drug addicts are used and abused by both the traffickers and the police. The police do target the drug addicts as incidence of crime is higher among addicts.</p>
              <p>A more rational approach will save more lives. A change in approach to The drug problem is needed. We should remove mandatory capital punishment for simple possession of drugs.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Injustices: Remedies</span></p>
              <p><br>All evidence should be properly disclosed in capital cases - no withholding of evidence - which can lead to wrongful convictions.</p>
              <p><br>All detainees should get a fair look at evidence against them to review and rebut the evidence in the course of due process.</p>
              <p><br>No secret evidence from informers should be used against detainees. The CNB and police should end the practice of using undisclosed evidence against the addicts.</p>
              <p>There is a strong need to challenge evidence based on suggestive interviews, expose biased police investigation, and track down evidence withheld by the prosecution.</p>
              <p>Where miscarriages of justice have occurred and wrongly convicted and executed - the death sentence is too late for an appeal.</p>

              <p><strong>Drug trafficking on the rise in Singapore</strong> </p>
              <p>DESPITE Singapore having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">newly-released figures suggest a growing number of heroin smugglers could be using the country as a transit point. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>In the first nine months of this year, 46kg of heroin has been seized, nearly three times the total for the whole of last year.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The haul has led crime experts to suspect that trafficking has increased.</strong></span> Seizures from previous years indicate that this year's cache is likely far too much to be consumed locally.</p>
              <p>Also, 11kg of this year's haul is the purest grade of the drug, heroin No. 4, which is rarely consumed here. It is injected by addicts and the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) believes that it was not meant for the local market; instead it was likely bound for the United States and Europe.</p>
              <p>While trafficking a mere 15g of heroin can result in a death sentence, experts say some smugglers are drawn to Singapore for its excellent international air connections and, paradoxically, its fearsome approach to drugs.</p>
              <p>The US and European authorities are lulled into assuming that most smugglers would avoid Singapore at all costs, said Dr Thomas Pietschmann, a researcher with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'Flights out of Singapore are, in general, less controlled in the US or in Europe than flights out of Myanmar, Thailand, Afghanistan or Pakistan,' he said.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>This point is conceded by CNB spokesman Agnes Lim. She said that while the strict laws and stiff penalties deter the use of Singapore as a transit point, there are always people 'who are prepared to risk their lives to traffic drugs because of the lure of high profits'.</p>
              <p>More heroin is flooding into Singapore mainly because of last year's bumper opium harvests in the Golden Triangle between Thailand, Laos and Myanmar, as well as in Afghanistan, by far the world's leading producer of the crop.</p>
              <p>Opium is the raw material used in making heroin and the UNODC estimated that Afghanistan churned out 8,200 tonnes of it last year, almost doubling the global output of illegal opium from 2005.</p>
              <p>Indian and Pakistani narcotics officials had warned that more heroin would be heading to South-east Asia and they have been proven correct.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr Pietschmann assumes that drug trafficking in Singapore is rising as the amount of heroin seized has consistently increased - from 6kg in 2006 to 17kg last year and a staggering 46kg in the first nine months of this year. At the same time, there has not been a significant spike in the number of heroin abusers or arrests. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>From January to June, 384 heroin abusers were arrested, only 38 more than in the previous six-month period.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tough on drugs, soft on drug lords</span></strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's tough stand on drug traffickers is at odds with its own economic relationship with a Burmese drug lord, according to Singapore's leading opposition figure, Dr Chee Soon Juan.</p>
              <p> <img src="http://singaporedemocrat.org/csjcnn.jpg" alt="" width="1081" height="802"></p>

              <p>"If the Government really wanted to eradicate or even minimise the problem, it would not be in bed with drug barons holed up and operating freely in Burma," he told a forum in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The forum was held to highlight the plight of Nguyen Tuong Van, the Melbourne man convicted of trafficking heroin who exhausted all his legal options of appeal when in Singapore's President, S. R. Nathan, rejected his appeal for clemency.</p>
              <p>Nguyen was convicted of trafficking 396 grams of heroin, which probably came from Burma's golden triangle, and will be hanged within weeks.</p>
              <p>Singapore's Foreign Minister, George Yeo, last week defended the decision to hang Nguyen, saying "due to the seriousness of the offence and the need to hold firm our national position against drug trafficking, we are unable to change our decision".</p>
              <p>Burma and Singapore have close economic relations. In Burma when you use a Visa credit card, the charge is made in Singapore dollars.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee challenged the Government's right to assume the high moral ground. He cited the Singapore Government Investment Corporation's 1990s investment in the Myanmar Fund, controlled by Lo Hsing Han, one of Burma's most notorious drug lords, through his Asia World Company. Lo's son, Stephen Law, is married to a Singaporean and lives in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The corporation, established in 1981 to manage Singapore's foreign reserves and with a portfolio of more than $US100 billion ($137 billion), describes itself as one of the world's largest fund management companies.</p>
              <p>"Lo Hsing Han, the entire narcotics world knows, is one of the biggest drug lords, producing and trafficking in opium, the precursor to heroin, of which Nguyen Tuong Van has been convicted of trafficking," Dr Chee said.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government refused to comment on the Myanmar Fund investment when the connection was first reported in 1997 by SBS; but when the then prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, was confronted during a US visit later that year he admitted the government had quietly liquidated its investment.</p>
              <p>"Singapore has hundreds of millions invested in Burma. The Myanmar Fund was just a very small portion of it," Dr Chee said. "Where has it gone, to other projects with Lo Hsing Han?" He called on the Government to state clearly that the Burmese military junta was not helping or turning a blind eye to drug trafficking.</p>
              <p>The forum and vigil held for Nguyen in Singapore on Monday night was only the second such event ever held in Singapore. It attracted 100 mainly young people who came to listen and did not want to be quoted for fear of repercussions. They suggested reading blog sites where they posted their views in relative anonymity.</p>
              <p>Dr Chee warned the gathering that police were probably videotaping the event and said their attendance showed "Singaporeans are not heartless, they may be voiceless but they do care about the situation over the death penalty".</p>
