              <p>low.But where is the police who should stop the shots before the

              <p>in the hands of wrong hands.Oz is an island,not connected with
                      third world</p>

              <p>Dear Lionnoisy,</p>
              <p>1) you   <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">     assume</span></span> the figure of ppl leaving sg. which makes an ass out of u and me.</p>
              <p>2) Thailand. You're obviously just a toad in a well.</p>
              <p>3) As far as education fee is concern, why don't you check it up yourself, since you're so good at checking up on OZ? <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">remember to use ratio of pay in sg to uni fee and ratio of pay in aust to uni fee.</span></strong></p>
              <p> ** why should i care about other country's citizens when at home we're already having problems? Shouldn't my country, Singapore comes first?</p>
              <p>and lastly, you seems to have missed out on: this post dated 03/05/2009 5:06am</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you're agreeing with me? but yet playing the number game? Do
                                              OZ have workers who don't get their pay on time? and have protest
                                              in their M.O.M(i don't know what it is called in OZ).?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do OZ citizens need to starve when they're out of Job?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do OZ citizens get priority compared to foreigners?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do OZ citizens male citizens need to spend 2 years of cheap
                                              labours?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do OZ citizens need to be pwned so badly by their government
                                              telling them that their wages is too high and thus
                                              uncompetitive?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">etc etc....</span></p>
              <p>link: <a href="/forums/10/topics/330341?page=16">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/330341?page=16</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and by the way, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">geylang in sg is not a very safe place too. </span></span></strong></p>
              <p>**Do you know that Singapore is artificially increasing her population via import of foreigners? You've been pwned. Do you know why? let me show you a example:</p>
              <p>sg population year 2001: 1,000,000    no. of leavers: 10,000 new citizen: 30,000</p>
              <p>for every 10,000 that leaves singapore, 30,000 more are imported to replace and increase the populations. Thus, It will appears that each year, there's lesser and lesser ppl leaving sg. I hope it is not so complicated for your brain to absorb.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.SG grew much
              faster than Oz</span></strong></p>
              <p>From 1996 to end 2008 ,SG GDP grew abt 85 % bigger,while Oz just
              55%.</p>
              <p>GDP growth is not everythings.But without it,u dunt have too
              much option.</p>
              <p>This may explain why SG can accept 4100 australians from Oz</p>
              <p>and SG have few bucks in foreign reserves!!</p>

              <p>Oz just too shy not to list her own performance here.haha.</p>
              <p>Talking abt GDP,u will laugh SG is in a worse shape than Oz.</p>
              <p>Lets SG GDP drop 10% and Oz remain unchanged,SG still grew</p>
              <p>much faster than Oz in the past 12 years,ie 77% vs 55%!!</p>
              <p>This may expalin why SG GDP per capita currently is <span style="color: #ff0000;">ONE THIRD</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">higher</span> than OZ!!I am happy
              sometimes SG is called emerging</p>

              <p>1) What short-terms performances are you targeting? Are you 100% sure it is SHORT-TERM?</p>
              <p>2) So you're 100% sure that SG grant initially is not meant for Boost? And that Aust grant is a short-term measure?? It will not be long term??? You the Aust government? you can speak up for their policies?</p>
              <p>3) You're contradicting yourself for the no. 2) of your own post.</p>

              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;">THE number of drive-by shootings in NSW has jumped by 81.3 per cent with more than two occurring every week.</strong></p>
              <p>The figure is sure to be a sting to the State Government which has always talked up its law and order credentials. <br> <br> But
              the latest figures from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and
              Research, revealed today, confirm that Sydney is in the grip of a gang
              war. <br> <br> The official figures state that there were 64 instances
              of firearms being discharged into premises over the 12 months to March
              2008. <br> <br> That jumped to 116 in the 12 months to March this year. <br> <br> The biggest jump occurred in the Fairfield/Liverpool areas and the central western Sydney area.</p>
              Overall, the crime rate continues to fall with robbery with a firearm
              down 32.8 per cent; house break and enters down 4.8 per cent; and car
              theft down 11.1 per cent. <br> <br> Possession and use of cocaine rose 63.3 per cent while ecstasy use and possession jumped 72.3 per cent. <br> <br> Bureau
              director Don Weatherburn warned that the drug use rises should be
              viewed with caution "as other more reliable indicators of drug use
              (e.g. hospital admissions, survey data) show no increase in the
              incidence of drug use over the last two years''</div>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/publications/aidr.html">Illicit Drug Data Report</a> also shows a re-emergence of cocaine use in Australia, at a time when
              the nation has the highest per capita use of ecstasy in the world.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/indepth/date/0,,5018883,00.html"><img src="http://www.news.com.au/common/imagedata/0,,6554888,00.jpg" border="0" alt="Drugs scourge in-depth" width="316" height="65"></a></p>
              <p>It comes as ACC chief executive officer John Lawler exclusively told <em>The Courier-Mail</em> that intelligence operations had revealed drug pushers had infiltrated the nation's ports.</p>
              <p>"Intelligence from these operations revealed criminal activity at the majority of ports in Australia," Mr Lawler said.</p>
              <p>"Criminal infiltration in the maritime sector was shown to be
              involved with the importation of illicit commodities, including illicit
              drugs in Australia.</p>
              <p>"We have also identified the presence of organised criminal networks and outlaw motorcycle gangs in the maritime sector."</p>
              <p>The report showed 24,162 people were arrested in Queensland for drug use and supply in 2007-2008.</p>
              <p>The second highest number was in NSW, which recorded 15,933 arrests.</p>
              <p>Arrests are down across Queensland but the ACC said arrests across
              the nation had been broadly the same for the past three years.</p>
              <p>Cannabis continues to be the drug of choice in Queensland, but the
              state still has the highest rates for clandestine drug laboratories,
              which generally produce amphetamine such as speed.</p>
              <p>"The potential hazards relating to the illicit manufacture of drugs,
              such as the use of highly toxic, flammable and explosive substances,
              pose considerable risks to the community," the report said.</p>
              <p> "The number of amphetamine-type stimulants arrests are currently the highest on record and seizures remain high."</p>
              <p>Cocaine use and detection was on the rise, Mr Lawler said.</p>
              <p>"Contrary to popular understanding of the cocaine market, several
              studies have shown that cocaine is used more frequently amongst those
              of lower socio-economic status who usually inject cocaine," he said.</p>
              <p>Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton hit out at the Rudd
              Government for stripping almost $25 million over four years from the
              National Illicit Drug Strategy in May's Budget, and taking money from
              the ACC.</p>
              <p>A spokeswoman for Health Minister Nicola Roxon said $816 million
              over five years would be directed at key frontline services and
              education campaigns.</p>
              <p>Australian Medical Association vice-president Steve Hambleton said money would always be needed for drug awareness.</p>
              <p>And the Queensland Police Service stressed its commitment to tackling dangerous drugs.</p>
              <p>A Canadian national was sentenced to life imprisonment with a
              non-parole period of 22 years in the Supreme Court in Brisbane this
              month for importing $35 million of cocaine – the state's largest
              detected importation and the fifth largest in Australian history.</p>
