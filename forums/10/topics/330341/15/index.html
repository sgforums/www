              such as kneecapping. When criminals from that background moved into
              bikie gangs, those gangs started to do drive-bys too."</em></p>

              premises", which covers drive-bys although it is not restricted to
              them, are available for NSW for the years 1995 to 2005. They show about
              60 annual offences in the early years, rising to a peak of 115 in the
              middle of the decade, followed by a decline. As a possible indication
              of the prevalence of the drive-by in terms of gun crimes, in 2005, when
              the number of "discharge firearm into premises" was 60, the number of

              <p><em>A VICTORIAN council lost its fight to stop two rival bikie gangs
              setting up in the same suburb after police apparently raised no
              objections. </em></p>
              <p><em>The revelation has prompted fresh claims that authorities are not properly confronting outlaw motorcycle groups. </em></p>
              <p><em>Victims of Crime advocate Noel McNamara said that as other states
              introduced anti-bikie laws, Victoria's "slack" approach was an
              invitation for the gangs to move here. </em></p>
              <p><em>The Outlaws - ranked by the FBI as the world's fourth-most powerful
              gang - has claimed Melbourne's southeast as its turf for a decade. </em></p>
              <p><em>The gang won the right to build its<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Pakenham## clu</span>bhouse after the
              Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal overturned Cardinia
              Council's decision in 1999. </em></p>
              <p><em>Rival gang the Rebels - which has been involved in a shooting turf
              war with another gang, the Bandidos - then applied to build its
              clubhouse in the middle of the Outlaws' territory in Pakenham. </em></p>
              <p><em>And after it also was refused a council permit, VCAT again overturned the decision last year. </em></p>
              <p><em>Documents show that when Victoria Police was asked whether a Rebels
              compound should be approved, Pakenham station offered no objection or
              opinion....''</em></p>

              <p>I find it very strange that we openly talk about how drugs are
              available to everyone. To be so open there must be corruption at the
              highest level. I am not looking forward to the day someone sells my
              kids drugs, for the drug sellers sake.</p>

              <p>Oh no bikies are great in Victoria they are in fact protected under the
              Victorian Charter of Human Rights what a fine mess this leglislation
              is. Thanks Mr BRUMBY our police have less rights then ever In fact they
              are subjected to secret hearings where they are forced to give evidence
              or face the sack. But on the other hand it is illegal to target
              individual criminal bikie groups. This state has gone mad. Welcome all
              outlaw bikie groups you are protected in Victoria. Pathetic BRUMBY</p>

              <p>Me went to OZ, and these bikers with big bikes, strong tattooed arms and heavy looking face full of beard are just doing business, they offer to bring me around for A$50 about one hour ++, wow the ride was fantastic, make if feel like a big time biker too, wow!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not wrong for them to ply their business in giving tourists or foreigners like me a pay ride. Also, they are good in guiding places and introduced alots of places to me, a good tour guide. There are also aussie women bikers if one feel shy of guy riding them.</p>
