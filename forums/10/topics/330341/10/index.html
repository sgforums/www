            <div class='col-md body'><p>THE married couple's night out at Zouk turned nasty quickly. <br><br>American Anthony Wildberger, 23, and his Singaporean wife Sheena Poh, 22, claim he was beaten up by the club's bouncers and other clubbers.<br><br>Zouk claims it was Mr Wildberger who struck the first blow.<br><br>The incident happened around 2.45am on 27 Oct.<br><br>Mr Wildberger claimed that he suffered a concussion, his nasal bone was displaced, three teeth were chipped, and there were cuts and bruises on his face.<br><br>The problem started barely 20 minutes after they arrived at the club's Phuture outlet on the second storey.<br><br>Two women approached the couple.<br><br>CONFRONTATION <br><br>Ms Poh said: 'One of them confronted me and said that someone had grabbed her butt. She said her friend identified the person as my husband.<br><br>'But I said that it could be a misunderstanding. The place was so crowded and there were many other Caucasian men there.<br><br>'Besides, my husband was with me all the time. He had one hand holding on to mine, and the other holding his drink.'<br><br>After the confrontation, the couple headed downstairs, where Ms Poh saw the two women again and approached them.<br><br>Ms Poh said: 'I wanted to clear up the misunderstanding, but they refused to talk to me.'<br><br>At this point, the description by the club and the couple of the brawl that ensued differs dramatically.<br><br>The couple claimed a bouncer approached them and shouted at them, accusing him of molesting the woman.<br><br>Next thing, Ms Poh claims, her husband was caught in a brawl.<br><br>CORNERED <br><br>He was cornered by another two men.<br><br>He added: 'I felt the situation was getting tense and that they were going to hit me, so I threw the plastic jug that I was holding on to the floor.<br><br>'Right after that, the bouncer hit me. I knew I had to defend myself so I started throwing punches.<br><br>'When I did, all of a sudden more people came out of nowhere, and they punched me all over my head. Instead of stopping the fight, the bouncers held me and let the other men hit me.'<br><br>It was all over within a few minutes when some security personnel arrived to break up the fight.<br><br>But Zouk's management alleged it was Mr Wildberger who first attacked the security personnel.<br><br>The club's marketing manager, Ms Tracy Phillips, said two women had informed a security guard named Mr Ali that they had been allegedly molested by Mr Wildberger.<br><br>Ms Phillips said: 'Ali went to him and told him to step outside. But before he could even inform his supervisor by walkie-talkie of the matter, he was struck by Mr Wildberger and fell to the ground.'<br><br>After that, a group of people, 'presumably from the molest victims' side', went to Mr Ali's defence, Ms Phillips said.<br><br>Once other security members spotted the commotion, they broke up the fight and did not attack Mr Wildberger, she added.<br><br>CCTV footage that was shown to The New Paper was inconclusive as the fight happened at a blind spot.<br><br>Ms Phillips explained that it is the club's policy to restrain and not to retaliate, and to move the fighting parties out of the club to prevent fights from escalating.<br><br>The CCTV footage showed both parties being escorted outside to separate areas after the fight.<br><br>Ms Poh said she called for the police, and when two policemen arrived later, the women did not want to press charges.<br><br>The couple later left about an hour later in a taxi, and Mr Wildberger stayed in bed for two days before he went to the hospital for treatment.<br><br>He claimed he was paranoid about going out.</p></div>

                      <p>The bomb squad kept crowds of commuters in Chatswood at a
                      distance this morning after fears an ATM could explode because it
                      was full of gas.</p>
                      <p>Less than two hours earlier, robbers blew up three ATMs at
                      different locations in Sydney's south-west.</p>
                      <p>It is believed flammable gas was used to blow up the machines.
                      The method mimics an ATM robbery in North Ryde last week in which
                      nearby shopkeepers believed gas cylinders were used.</p>
                      <p>The technique of blowing up ATMs might have been borrowed from
                      South Africa, where almost 1000 ATMs have been blown up in the past
                      two years.</p>

              most senior judge yesterday slammed the state's chief prosecutor for
              exceeding his role in the criminal justice system.</strong></p>
              <p>Chief Justice Marilyn Warren warned the <a href="http://www.opp.vic.gov.au/">Director of Public Prosecutions</a>, Jeremy Rapke, QC, not to talk to judges directly about criminal cases.</p>
              <p>Chief Justice Warren said any direct approach by the DPP would put
              the independence and impartiality of the criminal justice system at
              risk.</p>
              <p>Her comments were backed by criminal lawyers, but sparked an angry response from crime victims.</p>
              <p>Chief Justice Warren's criticism was prompted by Mr Rapke's
              assertion he was prepared to ring judges who made insensitive comments
              that hurt the families of victims.</p>
              <p>Mr Rapke was reported at the weekend to have said he was not afraid
              to ring a judge who made inappropriate comments and urge him to "think
              next time before you say something".</p>
              <p>Yesterday's response from the chief justice was unusually swift, scathing and direct.</p>
              <p>"The role of the DPP is to prosecute criminal cases, independently,
              not to counsel, supervise or criticise judges in private discussions,"
              Chief Justice Warren said.</p>
              <p>"The community would be justifiably alarmed if that happened.</p>
              <p>"If any party to a case has a concern, the proper action is to inform the head of jurisdiction.</p>
              <p>"I have not been told by Mr Rapke of any concerns about insensitive remarks".</p>
              <p>Chief Justice Warren said defence lawyers were also prevented from speaking directly to a judge about a case.</p>
              <p>"Everything occurs in open court so that justice is open and impartial," she said.</p>
              <p>"The community should be confident that judges strive to hear all
              cases impartially and independently. We take an oath to do that when we
              are appointed. Impartiality and independence lie at the heart of our
              criminal justice system".</p>
              <p>Mr Rapke would not comment yesterday on Chief Justice Warren's statement.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But a crime victims lobby group applauded his willingness to intervene on behalf of victims. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://www.cvsa.asn.au/">Crime Victims Support Association</a> president Noel McNamara said victims were "110 per cent behind Mr Rapke". </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Chief Justice Warren doesn't live in the real world," Mr McNamara said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"There's a cocoon all these judges live in. They think people are
              idiots and don't know what's going on and no one should say anything
              about them or criticise them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"We're behind the DPP all the way. There should be more of it
              (criticism) and more </span>transparency with what goes on in our courts".</p>
              <p>Mr McNamara said he wholeheartedly agreed with Mr Rapke's belief
              some judges had insufficient regard for the feelings of victims.</p>
              <p>"<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I've heard one particular judge wish a rapist well and give him a suspended sentence. </span></span></em></strong>What are we supposed to make of that?"</p>
              <p>Mr Rapke said early this year some judges needed more education on
              how to treat victims with dignity, sensitivity and compassion.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.crimbarvic.org.au/">Criminal Bar Association</a> chairman, John Champion, SC, said his members shared the Chief
              Justice's concerns about the DPP making individual approaches to
              judges.</p>
              <p>"Court proceedings are to be conducted transparently and in open court," Mr Champion said.</p>
              <p>He said there was "a lot being said" about sentencing and the rights
              of victims, but the media was not the appropriate place for the debate.</p>
              <p>"Every party has a role in the debate, but you need to be somewhat
              careful that you're not seen to be applying any pressure to judicial
              officers in any sort of inappropriate way," Mr Champion said.</p>

              <p><strong>FN2000 is dual caliber already in mass production and can use israeli ABM, Mk 47 already use in combat in Afganistan and can use ABM</strong></p>
              <p>So,the next step,among other things,is already done and make worked... Mk 47 Stryker USED in combat and FN2000 is already able to use ABM and in production long before STK ABM.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 72pt; line-height: normal;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.imi-israel.com/SIP_STORAGE/FILES/9/229.jpg"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><img src="http://www.imi-israel.com/SIP_STORAGE/FILES/9/229.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="263"></span></a></span></span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.imi-israel.com/SIP_STORAGE/FILES/9/229.jpg"></a></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>At Eurosatory 2006 IMI is demonstrating the progress of its Multi-Purpose Rifle System (MPRS) with the new ORION customized sight, designed to provide a ready to use, improved lethality system, utilizing standard assault rifles, advanced 40mm air-burst grenades and standard 5.56mm ammunition. Since its first introduction in 2004 the system passed several important milestones. In the coming months it is scheduled to complete type classification for the Israel Defense Forces, supporting squad level weapon systems.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>MPRS uses the new ORION customized fire control and sighting system providing navigation, target acquisition, ranging, ballistic computation, ammunition interface as well as day and night capability in a single, compact 600 gr system. The MPRS can be applied to most assault weapons such as Tavor, M4, SA80, INSAS, FAMAS or any other weapon using a standard Picatiny rail.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>The IMI Air Burst Ammunition is configured as a rifle grenade, a 40mm grenade for M203/AG-36 and other grenade launchers, as well as in non-lethal and intelligence applications variants below.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Embedded in a C3 system based on IMI's Warrior Compact Targetor (WACT), MPRS facilitates advanced sensor to shooter capabilities for small task forces.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Airburst 40 mm ammunition</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>The MPRS enables warfighters to use IMI's new 40mm air-burst grenades, at high precision, facilitating an overhead, "around the corner" or "within a window" fire for effect. When associated with IMI's new time-fused, air-burst 40mm grenades, MPRS uses a built-in communications device to set the grenade's programmable fuze to explode the grenade at the required distance and height above the target or around a corner, to achieve the desired air-burst effect. </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Reconnaissance Grenade (Over the Hill)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>While the 40mm high explosive airburst grenade is primary ammunition for the MPRS, the system will also incorporate other munition types, including non lethal grenades and an expendable camera fitted to a reconnaissance grenade. The grenade is fired through a ballistic trajectory toward the target, transmitting images of the target through its descent. IMI is cooperating with Israel Aircraft Industries MLM division to develop a command and control system which will be based on MPRS elements and establish effective management and control of infantry units. The system will interface with the warfighter's fire control systems, day/night observation systems (such as binoculars and recce grenades) and personal role radios.</span></p>

              <p>Malaysian Nordin Montong, 32, was set upon by two of the three big cats in the enclosure at around noon.</p>
              <p>
              <table border="0" width="200" align="left">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td class="padr8">
              <div id="related" class="vclear"></div>
              </td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              According to eyewitnesses, Mr Nordin, who was seen shouting and flinging items about shortly before the incident, vaulted a low wall and landed in a moat in the enclosure, four metres below.</p>
              <p>Carrying a yellow pail and a broom, he then crossed the 1.75m-deep moat, walked up to a rocky ledge near where the animals were and began agitating them by swinging the broom.</p>
              <p>As two of the tigers approached him, he covered his head with the pail, lay down on the ground, and curled himself into a foetal position, two eyewitnesses, an Australian couple, told police. Their identities were withheld pending investigations.</p>
              <p>In a flash, two of the extremely rare white tigers were on him. One took a swipe at him with its paw - which is about the size of a softball glove - and he began screaming in pain, said another eyewitness, Dutch tourist W. R. de Boer.</p>
              <p>He said many in the crowd of 30 or so onlookers at the enclosure initially thought the intrusion was part of a show.</p>
              <p>But when Mr Nordin began screaming, they reacted with horror.</p>
              <p>'Some were screaming: 'Go away' to the tigers and others were shouting to scare the tigers,' he said.</p>
              <p>The cries alerted zoo staff, and the alarm was raised.</p>
              <p>About 20 keepers arrived within minutes. Some tried to prevent the attack from continuing by throwing brooms and dustbin covers, while the rest ushered the shocked onlookers away.</p>
              <p>Also deployed were two zookeepers armed with rifles and live ammunition, but these were not used, said the zoo's assistant director of zoology, Mr Biswajit Guha.</p>
              <p>Despite the efforts of the keepers, one tiger continued attacking Mr Nordin for several minutes, the zoo said in a statement yesterday.</p>
              <p>It only relented after a door to the tigers' feeding area was opened. The animals retreated to it, leaving the cleaner motionless on the ground.</p>
              <p>Once the tigers were in the feeding area, the door separating it from the rest of the enclosure was closed, and keepers were able to reach the cleaner.</p>
              <p>It was too late, however. Mr Nordin, who hails from Sarawak, had been bitten on the neck and suffered a fractured skull. He died before police arrived.</p>
              <p>His colleagues later told zoo staff that the contract worker, who had been working at the zoo for about 41/2 months, had been behaving strangely minutes before the incident.</p>
              <p>He had thrown his cutters and meal coupons about before telling them in Malay: 'Goodbye, you won't be seeing me again.'</p>
              <p>He then rode off on his bicycle.</p>
              <p>The Australian tourists also said they saw him shouting and throwing some things as he walked by the crocodile exhibit, just 10 minutes from the tiger enclosure.</p>
              <p>Yesterday's incident was the first time a person had been killed by an animal at the zoo since it opened in 1973.</p>
              <p>Before this, the most serious incident occurred in 2001, when Chawang, a bull elephant, gored his keeper of 18 years, Mr Gopal Krishnan.</p>
              <p>The keeper suffered fractured ribs and a punctured lung, and was in hospital for close to two months before he eventually recovered.</p>
              <p>The zoo, which had to stop the tram ride and prevent visitors from entering during the incident, said yesterday that it would close the white tiger exhibit temporarily as a precautionary measure. It did not say how long the closure would last.</p>

              <p>@@@@@@@</p>
              <p>For example,i share in this thread that so many ATM blasts in two days,</p>
              <p>and is counting.....</p>
              <p>Shooting is a way of life in Sydney , NSW.</p>

              <p>NSW 6.9 million and Victoria few millions.</p>
              <p>If u discount to SG population of 4.8 million,the figure is damn high.</p>
              <p>I am still not convinced that a city with frequent shooting is good</p>

              <p>u can use one hand to count no. of cases involved in guns in SG in a year.</p>

              <p>dear lionnoisy,</p>
              <p>Managed to be on a day <span style="color: #000000;">leave in this busy lifestyle on this island. </span><span style="color: #000000;"> I felt compell to specially create this forum account to put things into perspective after staying in OZ for 4 yrs which I enjoyed most.</span></p>
              <p>Studied in sydney for a yr in master degree than moving to melbourne to work for another 3 yrs. Coming back for 2 yrs already after need to take care of aged parents (can bear to see them aged alone).</p>
              <p>I did not encounter any person with guns while I was there. I was able do my daily routine while i was in sydney and melbourne. In fact, I jogged alone in national parks with kargaroons around without much difficulty and no robbery. I also could do my shopping etc without much difficulties. Of course, in any city, there will be questional places which we should avoid particularly late night. I am sure u know where in singapore u should avoid. There are also crimes in S'pore.</p>
              <p>OZ is a wonderful place offering quality life which SG can never offer (e.g. nice weather, open vast land, vast ocean with seagulls flying and waves pounding on cliffs, plants and wildlife). It also offer quiet lifestyle which busy city like SG cannot offer. It also offer security to its citizens (SG door open widely for foreign professionals. Very easy for them to get SG PR). Of course,being small and vulnerable, SG does not have much choice. It cannot dictate cost conscious MNCs about how they recruit their people.</p>
              <p>OK, I better stop here. Better back to preparing my report to submit to work tommorrow. Below is OZ national athem which is very nice as well. Enjoy!</p>

              highly organised structure and strong connections with <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about South American  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=2&amp;as=news&amp;ac=search&amp;q=South%20American">South American </a> cartels. <br><br>But
              in recent years, just about every major organised crime group, from
              bikies to Triads through to Serbian groups, have begun trading in the
              illicit drug - and are even working together. <br><br>Authorities are
              closely monitoring prices as an indicator of the amount of cocaine
              available, with police intelligence suggesting criminals are
              manipulating supply in order to maximise their cut. </em></p>
              <p><em>But the influx of players vying for domination in Australia’s major
              cities, together with an unrelenting flow of the drug through smuggling
              routes, has seen the price of cocaine plummet. <br><br>Despite the
              strong profits, the price of the drug has been slashed by up to 42 per
              cent within a 12-month period, according to the latest figures from the
              Australian Crime Commission (ACC). <br><br>The street-price for a gram of cocaine fell from $350 in <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about New South Wales  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=2&amp;as=news&amp;ac=search&amp;q=New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales </a> and $250 in <a class="media-search-keyword" title="Search for more about South Australia  across the News Network" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&amp;sid=2&amp;as=news&amp;ac=search&amp;q=South%20Australia">South Australia </a> to $200 in both states in the 2006/07 financial year. <br><br>ACC
              chief executive officer Alistair Milroy confirmed the increased number
              of groups entering the trade could be a factor in the price cuts. <br><br>"Organised
              criminal groups employ a range of strategies to deliberately manipulate
              their control over illicit drug markets or to enter new drug markets,"
              Mr Milroy said. <br><br>"This may include aggressive marketing through undercut or reduced prices, or agreements between major players to set prices." <br><br>He also said economic conditions and "perceived market placing" were also factors. <br><br>The NSW Crime Commission has found that the wholesale price plummeted by half during the following year. <br><br>It
              is believed that the price of the drug in Sydney - traditionally the
              nation's biggest cocaine market - has been slowly rising in recent
              months but it is not yet apparent if it is due to a slowdown in supply.
              <br><br>"At the end of the year, the kilogram price of cocaine was
              about half of its peak," the NSW Crime Commission said in its 2007-08
              annual report. <br><br>"The wholesale price remains a good indicator of the quantities available in the market." <br><br>Despite
              huge seizures in recent years, authorities appear to have struggled to
              stem the flow of the drug, as indicated in the falling price. <br><br>A total of 124kg of cocaine was seized by Australian authorities in the 2005/06 financial year.---EOQ</em></p>
