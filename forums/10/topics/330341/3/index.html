              <p>While, I do agree with lionnoisy on the crime rate part. Although i have not live in Oz myself, i have relatives who live there and from the accounts that they gave me, i can conclude that Sg is a much safer place to be in. The most common ones are drug abuse and vandalism while those major crimes and, even theft, is in the miniority side.</p>
              <p>However, there are some points which i disagree. First of all, like what the forumers have all suggested, there is not a single place which is crime free. According to my relative's experience, if you dress appropiately and be humble, chances are you will have a good time in Oz. The Ozians are known to be friendly, socialable people and no one in the right state of mind would go out and commit crimes.</p>
              <p>You must also understand that most crimes are committed by teens rather than organised criminals. So, if you stay out of their way, the chances are they will stay out of yours too. For this part, I would like to share my personal experience in America, which i think could be used in comparision to Oz. When I'm in the states, the people there are more... free i should say, and their culture encourage them to be more open-minded and to protray their views openly. Once, i encountered this group of 3 teens, one of them skateboarded up to me and gave me a push for no reasons. He and his group then skated away laughing like retards.</p>
              <p>What I'm trying to say here is that such crimes are mainly for "fun sake" and not meant to kill you. Crimes are crimes, there is no way it could be approved of in any society, but you must understand that most of them are merely harmless pranks, and that you should not use this to discourage others to migrate to Oz, where the opportunities are limitless.</p>

              <p>Well from my experience Singapore may be safe (but really how hard is it to police an island just 700+km square, but it's hardly crime free...</p>
              <p>Let's see:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Couple robbed by man armed with parang</strong> <br><br><br>A YOUNG couple were trying to find some private time at the Marina Promenade Park (Singapore) when a parang-wielding robber walked up to them and told them to hand over their valuables. <br><br><br>When Mr Razif Hazmi Rahmat's girlfriend, 21, protested, the robber slapped her thigh with the flat of the 60cm blade. <br><br>Speaking to The Straits Times from his flat in Toh Guan Road, Mr Razif, 20, a polytechnic student, said their assailant walked up to them at about 1.30am on Saturday. <br><br>'He threatened to 'hammer' us if we did not comply,' he recalled. <br><br>'He took everything - our bags, handphones, watches and MP3 player - and only gave back our identity cards when we asked for them.' <br><br>The medium-built man wore a black long-sleeved shirt paired with black trackpants. He also wore a black cap. He looked to be in his 40s, was about 1.7m tall and spoke in English, said Mr Razif. <br><br>'But his speech was slurred, like a drug addict's, and I don't think this was the first time he was doing this,' added Mr Razif. <br><br>The robber threatened the couple before he walked off in the direction of Beach Road. <br><br>'He said that if we shouted or screamed for help, he'd come back and slash us,' Mr Razif said. <br><br>The couple fearfully waited until the robber had walked some distance away before fleeing in the opposite direction - towards Marina Square. There, they waited for more than an hour before venturing back to the Promenade Park, near the Kallang River, to get Mr Razif's motorcycle. <br><br>'My girlfriend was in tears, she was so traumatised,'? he said. <br><br>'All I could think of at the time was to stay calm, and getting the whole thing over with by giving him what he wanted, including my ATM PIN number,' said Mr Razif. <br><br>He later found that the robber had managed to withdraw the last $30 in his bank account. <br><br>But he will not step near the area again, he said. 'I think he will strike again and I would not want to go there.'</p>

              POLICE cordoned off a construction site in Clementi yesterday and took blood samples from about 200 foreign workers hours after a woman was sexually assaulted in a nearby park.
              <p>The victim, believed to be a National University of Singapore student in her mid-20s, had been attacked on Wednesday at about 10.40pm.</p>
              <p>It is believed that she was attacked while walking along a footpath in Clementi Woods Park, which is opposite the university campus.</p>
              <p>Although the police would not comment on the nature of the offence, The Straits Times understands that the Special Operations Command (SOC) had been activated. The unit is used to maintain public order and conducts tactical operations, among other things.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, officers descended on the condominium construction site adjacent to the park in West Coast Road at around midnight.</p>
              <p>They gathered the Chinese, Indian and Bangladeshi workers at the on-site canteen, checked their personal documents, passports and work permits, and took blood samples.</p>
              <p>The workers were not told about what had happened at the time.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, a copy of a Shin Min Daily News article which described the assault was pasted on a notice board in the canteen and attracted a number of curious workers.</p>
              <p>According to an office worker at the site, four SOC vehicles and several police cars were there till 8am yesterday.</p>
              <p>The staff member, who did not want to be named, said: 'I didn't know what was going on but I heard that something serious had happened in the park.'</p>
              <p>According to NUS librarian Kho Su Yian, 32, the park was rarely used by the students at the university.</p>
              <p>She said: 'It's usually pretty deserted, except for the occasional jogger. If there are any students, they usually walk in pairs.'</p>
              <p>She takes the 150m-long hilly footpath that runs through the park on her way to and from work.</p>
              <p>It is understood that it is term break for the university now, but students enrolled in special semester classes are due to sit for exams in about two weeks.</p>
              <p>Police say that their investigations are ongoing.</p>

              <p>Basically put lionnoisy is using flawed examples.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a self-contained, closed system for crime and crime supression while the plenty of other cities he quotes are open systems with plenty of space for the criminals to retreat to or to get their logistics and the means for organized crime.</p>
              <p>Also, Singapore is able to spend a lot more money and resources on crime supression and to implement it within the population, this is unlike other nations who have a much bigger space to spread their resources out over. Running away from the law in Victoria running away is a far easier prospect then being trapped on an island like Singapore where the law is never more then 10 minutes away.</p>
              <p>In fact the if you tally all the figures you might need to ask this:</p>
              <p>How come while we can afford to use so much more resources on crime then other nations with much larger spaces and looser systems to contend with...</p>
              <p>We still have such a crime rate?</p>
              <p>Why still got so many parang attacks when the parang attackers can't go more then 10 min away from the police?</p>
              <p>The answer is obvious, but if lionnoisy dares to answer it he would have admitted my point and lost his entire argument... hence he does not dare.</p>

              <p>Crime on the rise in Singapore?</p>
              <p>A trend since 1997...</p>
              <p>MINISTER for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng indicated Tuesday that<a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/sw99/90303sc.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;"> crime rate in Singapore on sharp rise</span></span></a> in 1998 and the outlook for the crime situation this year is "not bright".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his speech to officiate a police workplan seminar, the minister revealed that the crime rate went up by 5.2 percent last year in Singapore and the crime rate rise has reversed a nine-year consecutive fall in the overall crime rate. Latest data published recently by the police shows that there were 48,260 major criminal cases in 1998 in the city state compared with 45,896 cases in the previous year. It also affirmed that the police arrested 33,537 suspects last year, 3248 more over 1997 .</p>
              <p>Wong said that the increase in the crime rate was due in part to a sharp rise in immigration offenses. The crime increase would have been lower at 4.4 percent if immigration offenses are excluded, he noted.</p>
              <p>Taking the increase in total population, Wong said, the increase in the crime rate is just slightly over one percent, rising from 1064 per 100, 000 population in 1998 compared with 1054 in 1997. Citing police arrested some 23,000 illegal immigrants or overstayers last year, Wong said the police have stepped up efforts in all checkpoints including the sea around Singapore in a bid to uncover any illegal immigrants.</p>
              <p>Underlining that reducing the crime rate in the current economic situation has great significance for the island country, Wong said the police is planning tougher enforcement to address the problem. He also called upon the police to push on with organizational development and to be prepared for possible contingencies in the year ahead to deal with problems such as the Y2K problem which may require police assistance or intervention.</p>
              <p>Singapore's crime rate dropped for nine successive years prior to 1998. For 1995 and 1996, the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report considered Singapore's crime situation was the best in the world.</p>

              <br><br>A dangerous terrorist is on the loose, thanks to the incompetence of the Home Team, the ministry set up to make us safe, to protect us from criminals and others intent on doing harm to fellow citizens. The dangerous terrorist is on the loose simply because of a careless guard? An open gate? An ineffective manhunt? The questions lie unanswered for us. <br><br>Do I feel sympathy for the police and ISD as mistakes do happen as in everything? None at all. I feel sympathy for all of us instead because our safety is in jeopardy currently. Despite all the dubious rhetoric about increased security and decreased rights as a trade off in a dangerous world of global terrorism and what not inspired by Bush's speech writers, a crippled terrorist escaped. Bad luck, Murphy's Law, freak accident and wrong place wrong time are valid explanations for events like plane crashes, road accidents etc but not for a terrorist who escaped while taking a piss. Mas Selamat is indeed taking a piss still.<br><br>Yes, the authorities will make a show of an independent inquiry, like they make a show of an independent court case against opposition leaders. Someone will take the blame and whoever it is high or low ranking in the Home Affairs Ministry, we must be mindful that he could just be the scapegoat in the great finger-pointing politically directed musical chairs that will start soon.<br><br>Other criminals have flown the coop before and this dangerous terrorist escaped to paradise. The problem is that his entrance to paradise might be at the unfortunate explosive expense of Singaporeans one day in the future. I pray that day would never come. Again it all began when Mas Selamat decided to take a piss and nobody was watching.<br></div>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">The officers ask them to leave, they make a scene, arrest for disturbing the peace.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">there are thousands of complains directed at the police each year. if they have just cause, they would have filed a complain. the fact that they didn't is a sign that the police was smart to record down everything they did, and made sure their actions was accounted for.</p>

They took me to clubs and paid for all my expenses," says Siti, who never had such attention lavished on her before.<br><br><br><br><br>Her parents divorced when she was six and she lives with her father. A store assistant who works 11 hours a day, he has little time for her. She speaks to her mother, a hawker's assistant who has remarried, on the phone once a week - mainly to extract pocket money.<br><br>Over two years with the gang, Siti loitered at Marsiling and Boon Lay, smoking, picking fights and selling illegal VCDs. She helped keep a lookout for the police, earning up to $200 a day for three hours of work.<br><br><br>"The first time I ran from the police, I was scared. But the second and third time, it felt normal," says the lanky 1.62m-tall teen who has bronze-streaked hair.<br><br>All cashed up, Siti and her gangster friends would book hotel rooms in Geylang and down Ecstasy pills together. The rooms cost around $40 a night and they booked up to five rooms each time.<br><br>"It was very fun. When the music was turned on, all I knew was to dance, dance, dance," she says.<br><br>During gang clashes, her self-worth and status soared, as she was deemed "a good fighter". Once, when a girl provoked a fellow gang member, Siti tore open the girl's shirt, stomped on her chest, then spat at her to show her "hatred".<br><br>She recalls: "The first time I fought, I was "somebody". At home, when I failed my exams, my parents would say: "You're a waste of money." But in my gang, I got a name for myself by fighting well. That's why I kept going back. My friends believed in me."<br><br>But eight months later, Siti got sick of bloody fights and having to flee from the police practically every day. She stopped answering gang members' calls and excused herself from meetings.<br><br>But the gang would not let her off so easily. They issued an ultimatum - she had to have sex with all 15 boys in the gang, one after another, if she wanted to quit. As part of the ritual called "rolling over", they would also videotape her naked body and circulate it among their friends.<br><br>Most of the girls in the gang considered rolling over a "normal practice" and it upset Siti greatly. "Other girls in the gang can give the boys their bodies after knowing them for one or two hours, but I'm not like that," she says.<br><br>So she begged her elder brother, who is 19 and with another gang, to help her leave without paying the penalty. His gang slugged it out with hers - and won. Siti's gang let her off the hook and agreed to "settle any future unhappiness" with her brother.<br><br>Siti, now a private school student, goes to Ain Society, a voluntary welfare organisation which helps youth at risk in Bukit Batok, every day.<br><br>She has found new friends among the other troubled teens there. "We have the same kind of attitude and at first, we didn't like each other. But they're like mirror images of me," she says.<br><br>Last year, Siti obtained three N-level passes as a private candidate and is now taking a course in customer service.<br><br>She is still afraid of running into her ex-gang members and keeps her head down whenever she passes their old hang-outs.<br><br>But she has not looked back on her decision to quit.<br><br>"I regret joining the gang, especially because I made my mother cry. She thought I gave my body to the boys. I thought she didn't love me. But she cried because of me so I felt I needed to change."<br><br></p>

              &gt;CLEANERS are used to picking up after people's dirty habits. But a contract cleaner's day turned gruesome when<br>he picked up parts of a person.<br><br>The  cleaner, known only as Mr Ismail, found three fingers at a Bedok school compound yesterday (August 21, 2008).<br><br>The fingers are believed to have been cut off in a parang attack on an 18-year-old in the area four days earlier.<br>Mr Ismail, who is in his 60s, was cleaning a grass verge within the compound of CHIJ Katong Convent Primary School when he saw the fingers, just before noon.<br><br>School principal Margaret Tan told The New Paper that the verge was beside a gate that opens from the school to the HDB blocks outside. Mr Ismail did not immediately realise that he had found human fingers.<br><br>The school's operations manager, who gave his name only as Mr Ho, said: "Mr Ismail calmly came to the general office and told me he had found something unusual in the grass.When I went to have a look, I saw three<br>human fingers in the grass. I told Mr Ismail to continue his work and called the police."<br><br>Mrs Tan said Mr Ho informed her of the discovery after he called the police. When The New Paper team reached the school around 1pm, we saw three severed fingers on a drain grating close to where Mr Ismail found them.<br>They looked like they were turning brown. They were later covered with a plastic container before being taken away by police for examination.<br><br>It was unlikely that the fingers could be re-attached to the victim's hand because of the likely lapsed time and their rotting state. Attempts to reach Mr Ismail were unsuccessful.<br><br>Most of the students The New Paper spoke to said they were unaware of his find as they were in class at the time.<br><br>The fingers are believed to be from the right hand of Muhammad Raihan Massba, who was attacked by four men with parangs at the void deck of Block 401, Bedok North Avenue 3 at 11.45pm onSunday.<br><br>The attack occurred less than a minute's walk from a fence that surrounds the school. It is not known how the fingers landed behind the fence.<br><br>Muhammad Raihan, 18, is believed to have used his right hand to defend himself when his attackers aimed for his face and severed his fingers. Berita Harian reported that Muhammad Raihan's mother, who did not want to be<br>named, said he and two friends were having dinner at Block 110, Bedok North Road that night.<br><br>She said Muhammad Raihan later received a telephone call from friends and went to Block 401 to meet them. When Muhammad Raihan did not return, his dinner companions went to look for him.<br><br>They found him unconscious and bloodied. She did not know why Muhammad Raihan was attacked. She described him as easy-going, with manyfriends.<br><br>Muhammad Raihan also suffered a fractured jaw from the attack. He was initially taken to Changi General Hospital and warded in its Surgical Intensive Care Unit. He was transferred to Singapore General Hospital yesterday.<br><br>When we visited him there, he was asleep andhis right hand was bandaged.<br><br>Police spokesman Danny Tan said a youth in his late teens was arrested on Wednesday in connection with an incident of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon. He said the youth was charged in court for<br>the offence yesterday.<br></td>

              <p>In the first incident at 4.30pm, four men arrived at Batu 31/2 in Cheras here and attacked M. Mahendran, 35, with a parang. The victim suffered cuts to his head and chest.<br><br>Mahendran was later taken to the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Hospital where he is understood to be in critical condition. <br><br>The suspects also abducted his mother and 8-year-old niece, who had witnessed the attack. The mother and niece were taken on a terror ride before the niece was abandoned at an undisclosed location. <br><br>Fortunately, a passer-by took her to the nearest police station. The mother was later dropped off at the Cheras police station. She was reported to be unharmed and lodged a police report before being reunited with her niece. <br><br>Two hours later at 6.30pm, the same four men are believed to have followed Mahendran's cousin, R. Govindan, 33, while he was on his way back to the Sri Johor flats.<br><br>The men, in a Toyota Camry, rammed the back of Govindan's motorcycle, causing him to fall. They then rushed out of the vehicle and began slashing him with a parang.<br><br>However, when their car stopped abruptly after ramming Govindan's motorcycle, an off-duty police detective following behind on his motorcycle crashed into the suspects' car. <br><br>Upon seeing the brutal attack, he alerted his colleagues before shouting at the suspects to stop their attack.<br><br>When they did not heed his warnings, he was forced to open fire. It is understood one of the suspects was hit in the leg while the other three fled. <br><br>Govindan succumbed to his injuries while the hurt suspect was taken into custody.</p>

              <p>Actually if you look at it, Singaporean criminals are more violent, brutal, and dangerous then those in Australia.</p>
              <p>This is because our parang attacks involve interspecies violence that takes place at close range, hence it requires the attacker to be more brutal and violent as opposed to shooting from a distance.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #990000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Distance as a Psychological Weapon:</span><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Another key factor in overcoming the resistance to killing is distance, which has been partially addressed earlier. The utility of weapons that kill from a distance cannot be truly understood without understanding the psychological enabling aspect of distance, which, simply stated, means that the further away you are the easier it is to kill. Thus, dropping bombs from 20,000 feet or firing artillery from 2 miles away is, psychologically speaking, not at all difficult (and there is no indication of any noncompliance in these situations), but hand-to-hand combat and firing a rifle from 20 feet is very difficult (with high incidence of nonfirers) and from a few feet away it is virtually impossible to stab an opponent. John Keegan's landmark book <em>The Face of Battle</em> makes a comparative study of Agincourt (1415), Waterloo (1815), and the Somme (1916). In his analysis of these three battles spanning over 500 years, Keegan repeatedly notes the amazing absence of bayonet wounds incurred during the massed bayonet attacks at Waterloo and the Somme. At Waterloo Keegan notes that, "There were numbers of sword and lance wounds to be treated and some bayonet wounds, though these had usually been inflicted after the man had already been disabled, there being no evidence of the armies having crossed bayonets at Waterloo." By World War I edged-weapon combat had almost disappeared, and Keegan notes that in the Battle of the Somme, "edged-weapon wounds were a fraction of one per cent of all wounds inflicted in the First World War." Indeed, all evidence indicates that ancient battles were not much more than great shoving matches, until one side or the other fled. This can be observed in the battle record of Alexander the Great, who (according to Ardant du Picq's studies of ancient records) lost a total of approximately 700 men "to the sword" in all his battles put together, and this is simply because Alexander the Great always won, and the actual killing happened only to the losers after the battle (Fig. 1).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">The only thing greater than the resistance to killing at close range is the resistance to being killed at close range. Close-range interpersonal aggression is the universal human phobia, which is why the initiation of midbrain processing is so powerful and intense in these situations. Thus, one limitation to killing at long range is that greater distance results in a reduced psychological effect on the enemy. This manifests itself in the constant thwarting of each new generation of air power advocates and other adherents of sterile, long-range, high-tech warfare and a constant need for close combat troops to defeat an enemy.</span></p>

              <p>A slashing by parang is far more brutal and violent then shooting, as the attack has to reach a certain level of primal instinct and deny your humanity.</p>
              <p>At least when you are shot at you can take cover, but a parang chasing you?</p>
