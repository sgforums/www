              <p>&lt;!-- more than 7 paragraphs --&gt;&lt;!-- story content :
                                      start --&gt;I READ with dismay the article, 'Suicide figures up -
                                      419 deaths last year' (ST, Aug 13).</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I am not surprised at the rising suicide figures
                                      and believe that it will continue to climb in the near future as I
                                      see many people facing difficulty coping with a stressful lifestyle
                                      deprived of much support.</p>
              <p>People belonging to the sandwiched generation especially face
                                      mounting pressures, mainly financial, and if they fail to see a way
                                      out of their problem, may attempt suicide. To them, living is
                                      tortuous and death seems like a permanent relief to all their
                                      problems which is but a myth. They will leave behind loved ones who
                                      not only will miss their presence but also have to live on with
                                      doubts of whether they are the ones at fault.</p>
              <p>It is common knowledge that our population faces mounting work
                                      pressure. Many work long hours and only go home to sleep. Weekends
                                      are also confined to indoor activity as they recuperate from a long
                                      week at work. There is hardly any work-life balance here. Most
                                      people's lives revolve around work.</p>
              <p>As families get smaller, the supportive reach of an extensive
                                      family network is also remote. Many also fail to have time to
                                      establish any meaningful friendships and may miss out on
                                      opportunities to confide their problems in someone. Many who have
                                      problems, especially men, will not seek out counsellors from nearby
                                      neighbourhood family service centres for counselling support,
                                      further compounding the issue.</p>
              <p>A close classmate of mine committed suicide at the tender age of
                                      21. He suffered from an inferiority complex and family members also
                                      failed to understand him. After being discharged from the mental
                                      hospital, he hanged himself outside a church. As his classmates who
                                      helped him along the way, we were devastated and blamed ourselves
                                      for not doing enough to help him.</p>
              <p>&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th para --&gt;I often
                                      questioned the quality of our counsellors in family service centres
                                      (FSCs), having worked in one myself a few years back as a
                                      social-work aide.</p>
              <p>Most workers there are young and trained in social work. It will
                                      be difficult for them to identify with the issues a middle-aged
                                      person is going through and also how he can earn the respect of the
                                      counsellee who is much more seasoned in life.</p>
              <p>FSCs need to deploy properly trained counsellors who are mature
                                      enough to deal with the issues of this critical age group.
                                      Hopefully, this will take some load off the suicide-prevention
                                      group Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) which continues to face
                                      manpower shortages.</p>
              <p>As Singapore progresses, many will also struggle to keep pace in
                                      a modern fast-paced society. Let us offer our shoulder if we see
                                      someone in need of a helping hand. You never know that your kind
                                      words of comfort may dissuade someone from thoughts of ending his
                                      life. It is when we take time to care for one another that we can
                                      say we are a First World nation.</p>

              night.<br> <br> And they confronted a group of five friends gathered there.<br> <br> At first the group of friends were puzzled at the sight of seven men, who
              suddenly appeared in front of them.<br> <br> Then trouble struck.<br> <br> At around 9pm, the men attacked them with the weapons, causing them to scatter
              in different directions.<br> <br> The attackers split up and chased the victims, slashing them viciously with the
              parangs and knives after catching up with them in what appeared to be an
              unprovoked attack.<br> <br> All five victims were later sent to the hospital, where two received outpatient
              treatment and three have been hospitalised since then.<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://carefreeworld.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/pb240080.jpg"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><img border="0" alt="" width="288" height="216"></span></a><br> And it was not the only such attack that night.<br> <br> Over at Tampines at around 8.15pm, an 18-year-old boy was assaulted and
              seriously injured. (See report on facing page).<br> <br> When contacted, police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said they are
              investigating if both incidents are linked.<br> <br> SHAKEN<br> <br> Ahmad (not his real name), 24, was the most seriously injured among the five at
              the Eunos attack, suffering slash wounds on both arms and his head.<br> <br> The other two, who were also warded, suffered slash wounds on their hand and
              stomach respectively.<br> <br> Still looking shaken from the attack, Ahmad told The New Paper yesterday at
              Changi General Hospital (CGH), where he is warded, that it was an unprovoked
              attack.<br> <br> He claimed that he and his group have no enemies nor have they offended anyone.<br> <br> That was why when he first saw the armed, masked men, he thought they were
              going to attack others, not their group.<br> <br> Ahmad said: 'I first saw about seven men, who appeared from behind the walls.
              They were wearing ski masks and each one was carrying either a parang or a
              sword.<br> <br> 'I thought they were looking for others. We had no time to react or run away at
              all before they attacked us.'<br> <br> Ahmad said he and his friends, whose ages range from 17 to 24, fled in
              different directions with the assailants in hot pursuit.<br> <br> Ahmad himself ran to Block 16 where he was pounced upon at the void deck by two
              attackers.<br> <br> He said: 'Then three other men, also wearing ski masks and carrying parangs,
              appeared and also started attacking me.'<br> <br> He tried to protect his head by using his hands to cover it.<br> <br> 'But when I did so, I heard the (hacking) sounds,' he recounted.<br> <br> 'I knew that the parang had hit me.'<br> <br> Ahmad then tried to run into a lift.<br> <br> A middle-aged man was about to exit and was threatened by the attackers.<br> <br> Ahmad said: 'They warned him to get out of the way or they would also chop
              him.'<br> <br> The five attackers then tried to force their way into the lift as Ahmad kept
              kicking them out.<br> <br> He succeeded only after one of them told the gang 'enough' in Malay and they
              left.<br> <br> By then, Ahmad's hands were soaked with blood, with bones visible from the
              wounds.<br> <br> 'I thought I was going to die,' he said. 'If they had managed to enter the
              lift, I think I would have been dead by now.'<br> <br> Taking the lift to the sixth floor, he sought help from a household, whose main
              door was open.<br> <br> 'I told them that I had been attacked by a gang and asked them to help call for
              an ambulance.'<br> <br> The family also helped dress his wounds and gave him drinks.<br> <br> Ahmad said they also kept talking to him because he told them he was going to
              faint. Later, the police and ambulance arrived to take him to hospital.<br> <br> Ahmad's elder sister, 33, said she was distraught to see him badly injured.<br> <br> She said: 'I don't know why they attacked my brother. He isn't the sort to mix
              with bad company.<br> <br> 'I hope the police will step up patrols and also arrest these people soon.'<br> <br> Ahmad is now fearful of returning to Eunos Crescent, the neighbourhood where he
              had lived for nearly 20 years.<br> <br> He moved out of the area five years ago, but would return there almost daily to
              hang out with his childhood friends. He said his family had plans to move back
              there next year because they like the area so much.<br> <br> 'But now, I'm not so sure.'<br> <br> One of his injured friends, who is still warded at CGH, said Ahmad was the
              worst hit.<br> <br> Requesting not to be named, he added: 'We do not know who these guys are and we
              have never offended anyone before.'<br> <br> Police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said that so far, there have been no
              arrests and those injured in both the cases are being interviewed.<br> <br> 'The two cases are being investigated as rioting armed with dangerous weapon,'
              he added.<br> <br> Those convicted of the offence face a jail term of up to seven years and caning<strong><span style="color: red;"></span></strong></span></p>

              a speeding car as it kept swerving to throw you off is something that happens
              only in the movies.<br> <br> For two minutes yesterday afternoon, he did just that.<br> <br> The reason he ended up on the bonnet is even more shocking - it was an argument
              over a scratch.<br> <br> Luckily for Mr Koh, 36, he escaped with only abrasions.<br> <br> The sales executive was walking back to his Toyota Wish which was parked on
              Tembeling Road, near Joo Chiat.<br> <br> He recalled: 'I had just collected a cheque from a client and was walking back
              to my car to drive off for lunch.<br> <br> 'From a distance, I saw a man walking pass the right side of my car.<br> <br> 'I thought I saw him scratching the right passenger door with his car keys.'<br> <br> When Mr Koh reached his car, he found a 15cm scratch on his silver Wish which
              he bought new two years ago.<br> <br> The man who scratched Mr Koh's car got into a black Nissan Cefiro which was
              parked behind Mr Koh's.<br> <br> Both cars were in parallel parking lots.<br> <br> Mr Koh said: 'By the time I reached my car, the man was already trying to get
              out of the parking lot.<br> <br> 'I tapped on the bonnet to get the driver's attention.<br> <br> 'But he kept inching his car forward even though I signalled to him to stop. I
              had to keep stepping back in order not get hit.<br> <br> 'All of a sudden, the driver surged forward and I had no time to react. As a
              result, I slumped forward on the car's bonnet.'<br> <br> The car did not stop and Mr Koh had to hold on to the bonnet so as not to fall
              off.<br> <br> The Nissan drove about 15m towards the junction of Tembeling Road and East
              Coast Road.<br> <br> There, the driver slowed down to make a left turn to get on to East Coast Road.<br> <br> Mr Koh said: 'I kept yelling at the driver to stop. But it was no use. I
              couldn't really see his face because of the glare from the front windscreen.<br> <br> 'The windows were shut, so I don't think he could hear me.'<br> <br> After the Nissan got on to East Coast Road, the driver tried to shake Mr Koh
              off.<br> <br> Mr Koh said: 'He kept swerving left and right after he turned left on to East
              Coast Road.<br> <br> 'I couldn't do anything except to grip the bonnet very tightly and shouted at
              him to stop.<br> <br> 'I remembered turning my head back as he sped on. I saw the back of a lorry and
              the Nissan slowed down to avoid hitting the lorry.'<br> <br> About 200m after getting on to East Coast Road, the Nissan brushed against a
              motorcycle which was travelling on the left lane of the two-lane road.<br> <br> Mr Koh said: 'The driver continued moving ahead even after the Nissan brushed
              against a motorcycle. Then, it turned left towards Still Road.<br> <br> 'After that, I couldn't hang on to the car any more and I fell off the bonnet.'<br> <br> Mr Koh landed on the road and rolled onto the middle lane of Still Road and
              almost got hit by a despatch rider when he rolled into his lane.<br> <br> The despatch rider, Mr Mohd Shahril, 32, thought that an 'object had came into
              his path'.<br> <br> Mr Shahril, who was on Still Road travelling towards Eunos, said: 'I was
              surprised when I found out that the 'object' was actually a man. If I had not
              braked in time, the both of us would surely be hurt.'<br> <br> Mr Koh finally came to a stop near a bus stop.<br> <br> Mr Koh said: 'My chin hit the ground even though I tried to use my arms to
              cushion the fall. It was very painful and I couldn't move.<br> <br> 'Luckily, a motorcyclist came by to help me. Some other people from the bus
              stop also came to help.'<br> <br> Mr Shahril said he does not know who was more crazy - the driver of the fleeing
              car or the man who held on to the bonnet.<br> <br> He said: 'From the corner of my eye, I could see and hear the screeching sound
              the speeding car was making. The driver didn't even slow down as he entered the
              filter lane.<br> <br> 'The driver is crazy because the man could have been dragged under the wheels
              of his car.'<br> <br> Those who had helped Mr Koh took him to the bus stop and called for an
              ambulance. He was taken to Changi General Hospital.<br> <br> Mr Koh suffered abrasions to both his arms and his knees. His left shirt pocket
              was torn and his pants were also torn at the knees.<br> <br> Mr Koh recalled that the driver of the Nissan wore a blue T-shirt with blue
              shorts, but couldn't make out his appearance as he only saw the driver from a
              distance.<br> <br> But Mr Koh said the driver was a short and plump man in his 40s.<br> <br> Mr Koh said: 'Scratching my car was a small matter. I only wanted to talk to
              him about it. But what he did could have cost me my life.'<br> <br> He made a police report at the accident and emergency ward of CGH.<br> <br> Mr Koh's wife, Madam S Chong, 36, said the Nissan driver's behaviour was
              'outrageous'.<br> <br> She was having lunch when her husband called her while he was in the ambulance
              to CGH.<br> <br> Madam Chong said: 'At first, I thought he was joking as my husband likes to
              joke a lot. As he could still talk to me on the phone, I knew he wasn't too
              badly hurt.<br> <br> The Kohs have two children aged 4 and 8.<br> <br> A passer-by gave Mr Koh the licence plate number of the Nissan.<br> <br> He said: 'It all happened so fast that I didn't have time to see the car plate
              number.<br> <br> 'Luckily, there were witnesses who saw what happened.'<br> <br> The police said they were informed of the incident at about 1pm.<br> <br> They are investigating the matter which involves a car driver, a motorcyclist
              and a pedestrian.<br> <br> A similar incident happened on 9 Apr. Mr Alex Lim was driving his girlfriend
              home for dinner, but along Paterson Road, his red Mazda was involved in a minor
              collision with a taxi.<br> <br> Both drivers then parked along Scotts Road and got out of their vehicles. An
              argument followed.<br> <br> Cabby Lee Yuet Kong, who was carrying a passenger at the time, allegedly got
              back into his taxi and tried to drive off.<br> <br> Mr Lim, a finacial adviser, wanting to get Lee's particulars, stood in front of
              the cab, but Lee reportedly drove away, throwing him onto the bonnet.<br> <br> He later allegedly braked abruptly, causing Mr Lim to fall backwards and hit
              his head on the ground.<br> <br> Mr Lim died on 13 May.<br> <br> Lee, a 68-year-old relief driver, has been charged with causing grievous hurt
              with a rash act.</span></p>

              suicide rate: Do something when we see someone in need of a helping hand</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"> &lt;!-- headline one : end --&gt;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">&lt;!-- more than 7 paragraphs --&gt;&lt;!--
              story content : start --&gt;I READ with dismay the article, 'Suicide figures up
              - 419 deaths last year' (ST, Aug 13).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nevertheless, I am not surprised at the
              rising suicide figures and believe that it will continue to climb in the near
              future as I see many people facing difficulty coping with a stressful lifestyle
              deprived of much support.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">People belonging to the sandwiched
              generation especially face mounting pressures, mainly financial, and if they
              fail to see a way out of their problem, may attempt suicide. To them, living is
              tortuous and death seems like a permanent relief to all their problems which is
              but a myth. They will leave behind loved ones who not only will miss their
              presence but also have to live on with doubts of whether they are the ones at
              fault.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is common knowledge that our population
              faces mounting work pressure. Many work long hours and only go home to sleep.
              Weekends are also confined to indoor activity as they recuperate from a long
              week at work. There is hardly any work-life balance here. Most people's lives
              revolve around work.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As families get smaller, the supportive
              reach of an extensive family network is also remote. Many also fail to have
              time to establish any meaningful friendships and may miss out on opportunities
              to confide their problems in someone. Many who have problems, especially men,
              will not seek out counsellors from nearby neighbourhood family service centres
              for counselling support, further compounding the issue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A close classmate of mine committed suicide
              at the tender age of 21. He suffered from an inferiority complex and family
              members also failed to understand him. After being discharged from the mental
              hospital, he hanged himself outside a church. As his classmates who helped him
              along the way, we were devastated and blamed ourselves for not doing enough to
              help him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th
              para --&gt;I often questioned the quality of our counsellors in family service
              centres (FSCs), having worked in one myself a few years back as a social-work
              aide.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Most workers there are young and trained in
              social work. It will be difficult for them to identify with the issues a
              middle-aged person is going through and also how he can earn the respect of the
              counsellee who is much more seasoned in life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">FSCs need to deploy properly trained
              counsellors who are mature enough to deal with the issues of this critical age
              group. Hopefully, this will take some load off the suicide-prevention group
              Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) which continues to face manpower shortages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As Singapore progresses, many will also
              struggle to keep pace in a modern fast-paced society. Let us offer our shoulder
              if we see someone in need of a helping hand. You never know that your kind
              words of comfort may dissuade someone from thoughts of ending his life. It is
              when we take time to care for one another that we can say we are a First World
              nation.</span></p>

              <p>NEIGHBOURS in Block 349 Yishun Avenue 11 heard a loud thud, followed by
              piercing shrieks from several screaming women just after midnight on
              Thursday. Then it all went silent.<br> <br> Several residents who were still up late on Thursday went out of their
              flats to check and saw a woman's body lying near the rubbish chute. She
              was clad in a floral sleeveless top and skin-colour panties.<br> <br> She is believed to have fallen from the kitchen window in her flat.<br> <br> Six floors above in a corner five-room flat, two women were found dead and a third woman was badly mutilated.<br> <br> They were all Chinese but their nationality is not known. The women,
              were believed to be renting the flat and kept mostly to themselves.<br> <br> A 42-year-old man, also a Chinese, and believed to be the assailant,
              was in the flat. He did not put up a struggle when police arrested him.<br> <br> The horror of the mass murders unfolded at around midnight. But few residents knew about it until dawn broke.<br> <br> Mdm Mala, a resident who lives on the fourth floor said she was in her
              master bedroom when she heard a loud thud. She looked out of the window
              and saw a body on the ground floor.<br> <br> With her husband and son, they went down to check. Mdm Mala said the
              dead woman appeared to be plump and in her late 30s or early 40s.<br> <br> 'Moments after the loud thud, I heard several woman shrieking from a
              flat above. And then silence,' she told The Straits Times on Friday
              morning.<br> <br> Another neighbour, who lives on the fifth floor, said her husband was
              playing computer game in his room when he heard a loud thud around
              midnight.<br> <br> Giving her name only as Mrs Loh, she said the woman had fallen from the kitchen window in the flat.<br> <br> Mrs Loh, 30, a housewife, said two of the murdered women were believed to be mother and daughter.<br> <br> 'The mother is tall, slim and appeared to be in her 30s or 40s. The
              younger girl looked like a student. She seemed demure,' she added.<br> <br> Police received a call at about 12.50am from a member of the public informing them of a woman's body at the foot of the block.<br> <br> Police rushed to the scene. Investigators combed the block floor by
              floor and found a blood-stained padlock on the main door of the sixth
              floor unit.<br> <br> They broke down the door and found two dead women and another injured woman inside the flat.<br> <br> The injured woman, with multiple wounds, was rushed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital at 2.45am.<br> <br> Residents said they saw a bloodied body in a stretcher being pushed into an ambulance.<br> <br> The floor outside the murder scene has been cordoned off. A forensic team is still going through the flat.<br> <br> By Amelia Tan and Carolyn Quek</p>

              average daily inmate population had been climbing, hitting 17,697 by
              2002. But then the numbers began to slow down, and last year it hit

              <p>How about their numbers in the police force? And the amount of drugs they haul? Did you consider the ratio of it? Are there any sources to prove that the australian police force only managed to haul less than 5 times the amount of drugs SG's police force can haul? If not, I think that their security force is rather good.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"></span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">FRIDAYS, just before dawn, are hanging days in Singapore. Navarat Maykha, a Thai mother of two small children, awaited her turn as she prayed in her jail cell with her attorney, Peter Fernando, just a few days before her execution. An impoverished and uneducated woman, and also deeply religious, she swore until her death that she was unaware of the heroin that was hidden in the lining of a suitcase given to her by a Nigerian friend.
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <p><em>Singapore - a tiny island nation of 3 million perched at the southern tip of the Asian continent - prides itself on its strict drug laws, which include a mandatory death sentence for anyone caught with as little as half an ounce of heroin.</em></p>
              <p><em>"It's heartbreaking sometimes," said Fernando during a recent interview from his office in Singapore. "If you are an addict, and you are simply sitting at home with more than 15 grams of heroin and you cannot prove with scientific accuracy that a portion of the drugs are for personal use, you will hang." </em></p>
              <p><em>The fiercely authoritarian government micro-manages all aspects of the secretive hangings, as it does everything else in this country. This efficiency allows for the possibility of multiple executions when drug offenders swell the prison. On September 27, 1996, six people were hanged in one morning. Four had been hanged the previous Friday, all for drug trafficking. According to </em><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amnesty International</span></em></a><em>, 1995 - the year Navarat was executed - was a busy year at the gallows in Singapore, when more than fifty people were hanged, the majority for drug offenses.</em></p>
              <p><em>In its March 1997 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, the US State Department said that "the number of drug traffickers hanged in Singapore increased dramatically in the last two years." Amnesty International, also describing a "sharp increase in the number of executions" in a 1997 report, states that those executed are most often small-time addicts and couriers, usually poorly educated and economically vulnerable, "while those who organise and profit from the crimes frequently escape capture and prosecution." </em></p>
              <p><em>But that does not describe the worst of it. The Nation has learned that the highest levels of the Singaporean government, using the New York-based Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan, as a custodial operative, are engaging in joint business ventures with one of the world's most notorious drug lords and with the drug-backed military dictatorship of Burma (Myanmar). This has been confirmed by corporate, government and legal documents from four countries and was contended by high-ranking US narcotics and government officials in private interviews.</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>Dual-track policy</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>ACCORDING to interviews with Singaporean lawyers and US narcotics officials, the heroin found in Singapore comes mostly from Burma, one of the world's largest exporters of the highly profitable drug, with 1996 exports estimated at $1 billion. Since the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) takeover of Burma in 1988, illicit drug exports have more than doubled; French and US satellite surveys have shown an explosion of poppy-growing in areas under the SLORC's direct control. In 1995 the Australian Parliament heard testimony on SLORC protection of the narcotics trade as a matter of policy, "in order to raise government revenue." And a report last year by the US embassy in Rangoon, based on the SLORC's economic data, concluded that exports of opiates "appear to be worth about as much as all legal exports" and that investments in infrastructure and hotels are coming from major opiate-growing and opiate-exporting organisations [see Bernstein and Kean, "People of the Opiate," December 16, 1996].</em></p>
              <p><em>"Drug traffickers who once spent their days leading mule trains down jungle tracks are now leading lights in Burma's new market economy," said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a statement this past July. "We are increasingly concerned that Burma's drug traffickers, with official encouragement, are laundering their profits through Burmese banks and companies - some of which are joint ventures with foreign businesses," she said. It is with the SLORC, and allied organizations, that Singapore's hang-'em-high government is investing so heavily - in such ventures as hotels and infrastructure.</em></p>
              <p><em>This dual-track policy is condoned and encouraged at top levels of the Singaporean regime, including by Lee Kuan Yew, the country's undisputed strongman. Lee, whose antidrug policies are among the strictest in the world, is participating in the country's deepening business relationships with renowned heroin trafficker Lo Hsing Han of Burma and his son and business partner, Steven Law. Their operations in Burma, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the United States are now the focus of an ongoing U.S. government narcotics and money-laundering investigation, The Nation has learned.</em></p>
              <p><em>Lo Hsing Han, a Kokang Chinese from the opium-producing region of Burma's Golden Triangle, was convicted and sentenced to death in 1973 - not for drug trafficking, which had been carried out with the tacit agreement of the state, but for treason. After being released in a 1980 government amnesty, he returned to the Kokang region. As of 1994, Lo controlled the most heavily armed drug-trafficking organization in Southeast Asia. Today he rules with godfather status over a clan of traffickers, and his organisation controls a substantial amount of the world's opium production, according to US narcotics officials. A memo from the Thai government's Office of Narcotics Control Board states that Lo's trafficking activities are augmented through his link to Burma's military intelligence chief, Lieut Gen Khin Nyunt, described as Lo's "supporter." It says that in 1993 Lo was granted the "privilege from Lieut. Gen Khin Nyunt to smuggle heroin from the Kokang Group to Tachilek [on the Thai border] without interception."</em></p>
              <p><em>Lo is chairman of Burma's Asia World Company Limited, managed by his son Law, who has achieved unprecedented success under the current dictatorship. "Law's power and connections are unparalleled," comments one US official. "No other domestic investor in Burma can get an audience with a cabinet member with one phone call. When Law got married, eight cabinet members showed up." Law's multimillion-dollar business ventures seem to win all bidding wars in Burma's development race. (Law was denied a visa to the United States last year. "We have information that leads us to believe he is a trafficker in illicit substances," a US government official told The Nation in explanation.) </em></p>
              <p><strong><em>Business is business </em></strong></p>
              <p><em>WALL Street Journal editors, in the 1997 Index of Economic Freedom, rated Singapore as the most business-friendly country in the world. Unfortunately, that friendliness has been extended to Lo Hsing Han, Steven Law and the narco-dictatorship of Burma. </em></p>
              <p><em>As Tay Thiam Peng, director of foreign operations at Singapore's Trade Development Board, bluntly put it in 1996, when it comes to business, morality takes a back seat to profits. "While the other countries are ignoring Myanmar (Burma), it's a good time for us to go in," Tay stated. "You get better deals, and you're more appreciated... Singapore's position is not to judge them and take a judgmental moral high ground." As Burma's number-one business partner, Singapore now has 53 projects in Burma, which as of January totaled nearly $1.2 billion.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Since 1988...over half of [the investments from] Singapore have been tied to the family of narco-trafficker Lo Hsing Han,'' says Robert Gelbard, former US Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Most of these investments are in joint projects with Lo's family-controlled Asia World Company. Asia World includes a host of subsidiaries and three overseas branches in Singapore. US narcotics officials say that these "overseas branches" are part of the ongoing money-laundering investigation.</em></p>
              <p><em>Asia World's 1996 company profile states that it began as a trader in agricultural and animal feed products but today "has emerged as one of Myanmar's (Burma's) fastest growing and most diversified conglomerates." Burma's largest private-sector enterprise, it has interests in trading, manufacturing, real estate, industrial investment, development, construction, transportation, imports and distribution. Asia World's operations now include the running of a deep-water port in Rangoon, the bus company Leo Express into northern Burma, and a $33 million toll highway from Burma's poppy-growing region to the Chinese border.</em></p>
              <p><em>The combination of the Burmese military's ability to protect shipments and production in the country and Asia World's ability to move product over land and sea completes a perfect marriage of convenience. In addition to these operations, US narcotics officials say that Lo Hsing Han also runs a container business, shipping cargo out of Rangoon from a nondescript container yard the size of a city block. They suspect it of being a drug-shipping operation. Although it is a subsidiary of Asia World, the containerized cargo processing facility has no name, no sign and is not mentioned in Asia World's business profile. According to one official, some of the several hundred containers that have left this yard have gone to Singapore and the United States.</em></p>
              <p><em>In a June telephone interview from his headquarters in Rangoon, Law denied all allegations of drug trafficking. He laughed and said that Asia World operates under government regulations, "so if we do anything against government policy, we cannot do our business," Law said. "That's why concerning your point of any drugs in our city, I can say we haven't [been] involved."</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>The money trail: the Myanmar Fund</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>THE Singapore government, in cooperation with Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, is directly connected to key business ventures of drug kingpin Lo through an investment group called the Myanmar Fund. The fund, which provides investors "with long term capital appreciation from direct or indirect investments in Myanmar (Burma)," is registered as a tax-free fund in Jersey, Channel Islands, according to documents provided to the Irish Stock Exchange. </em></p>
              <p><em>Singapore's largest government-controlled financial institution - the </em><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/gic1203.htm"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government of Singapore Investment Corporation </span></em></a><em>(GIC) - is listed in the documents along with Morgan Guaranty Trust Bank (a J.P. Morgan subsidiary separate from the Trust Company) as a core shareholder in the Myanmar Fund. A September 1996 GIC business profile from the Registry of Companies and Businesses in Singapore shows that high-level </em></p>
              <p><em>Singaporean politicians are officers and directors of the GIC, including senior minister Lee Kuan Yew; his son, deputy prime minister Brig Gen Lee Hsien Loong; and finance minister Dr Richard Hu. As a core shareholder, the GIC helps determine how the fund's money is invested in Burma. Jean Tan, a spokesperson for the Singaporean embassy in Washington, confirmed in a June interview that the GIC holds a 21.5 percent share of the Myanmar Fund. As of last November, this investment was worth $10 million, according to the Singaporean government. </em></p>
              <p><em>The Myanmar Fund owns 25 percent of an Asia World subsidiary, Asia World Industries. In fact, the Myanmar Fund's 1997 first-quarter report features two pictures of Asia World factories on its cover. The Myanmar Fund has also heavily invested in a number of luxury hotels in Burma, including Rangoon's Traders and Shangri-La. The Asia World business profile describes the Traders and Shangri-La hotels as major investment projects for Lo Hsing Han's company. It says that the Shangri-La Hotel (and surrounding apartments and offices) will be "the biggest of all" Asia World's investments, with "$200 million...in appropriation of the project."</em></p>
              <p><em>In an official press release last November, the Singapore government stated that its investments in the Myanmar Fund were "completely open and above board" and that its investments in both the two luxury hotels and Asia World were "straightforward investments in bona fide commercial projects." However, the fund's operations are hardly straightforward and open. The operations of the GIC itself are effectively a state secret. The government company is not required to file annual reports or report to parliament. It has no public accountability, even though it uses public moneys for its investments. Furthermore, according to fund documents, in late 1994 - only weeks after being listed on the Irish Stock Exchange - the GIC's shares disappeared from the stock exchange register and were re-registered under the name of Ince &amp; Co. The Singaporean government acknowledged in November that Morgan Guaranty Trust Company is the custodian for the GIC securities, and that Ince &amp; Co. was set up by Morgan to hold the shares in its custody. </em></p>
              <p><em>Morgan Guaranty Trust Bank, investing yet other funds on behalf of clients, is the largest core shareholder (followed by the GIC) of the Myanmar Fund at 42 percent, according to a fund report. This means that together, the Singaporean regime's GIC and Morgan Guaranty Trust Bank have been in control of 63 percent of the Myanmar Fund and its co-investments with the corporation chaired by drug baron Lo Hsing Han. (The GIC shares re-listed as Ince &amp; Co have shifted hands once again. In a February document obtained by The Nation, the fund reported transfer of the Ince &amp; Co. shares to another company, Hare &amp; Co. In telephone interviews, spokesmen for the Myanmar Fund, the GIC and Morgan Guaranty refused to provide information about the identity or purpose of the new custodial company.)</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>Dining with the devil</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>SINGAPORE'S dealings with Lo Hsing Han and Steven Law continue to expand unabated. Singapore's GIC investment in the Myanmar Fund increased by 4.3 percent in 1996. In Rangoon, the Traders Hotel celebrated its official opening last November. At the opening ceremony, attended by Singapore's Ambassador and graced with an ap-pearance by Lo himself, the presiding SLORC minister publicly thanked both Steven Law and the government of Singapore for paving the road for a smooth business partnership. "I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the government of Singapore," he said, "without whose support and encouragement there would be very few Singaporean businessmen in our country."</em></p>
              <p><em>Since then, ground has been broken on the construction of Sinmardev, a new, $207 million industrial park and port on the outskirts of Rangoon. A Singaporean consortium is the leader in a joint venture with the SLORC, the Myanmar Fund, Lo's family company and a slew of international shareholders. The Myanmar Fund holds a 10 percent interest in Sinmardev. Singaporean entrepreneur Albert Hong, head of Sinmardev, described the project as the largest foreign investment in Burma outside the energy field. </em></p>
              <p><em>"Singapore is more involved with Lo than any other country, because that's basically where Steven Law is functioning out of when he's not in Burma," observes a US narcotics official. </em></p>
              <p><em>Singapore's rulers continue to deny any wrongdoing in connection with their relationship to Asia World. "It is fairly far-fetched, trying to link the Singaporean government and drug traffickers," said embassy spokesperson Jean Tan.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Nonsense," says Singapore's former solicitor general </em><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/seow.htm"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Francis Seow,</span></em></a><em> now a research fellow at the East Asian Legal Studies Program of Harvard Law School. The former close associate of Lee Kuan Yew says he knows "through personal experience" that Lee micro-manages every aspect of Singaporean political, economic and social policy.</em></p>
              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/chee.htm"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr Chee Soon Juan,</span></em></a><em> secretary general of the Singapore Democratic Party and a leader of Singapore's political opposition, was labeled a traitor for raising the drug issue in Singapore. "Drug peddlers are routinely hanged in Singapore for carrying heroin," wrote Chee, in a rare and courageous act of public protest in response to a documentary that aired on Australian television last year, Singapore Sling. "And where are all these drugs coming from? Drug lords like Lo Hsing Han are the big-time pushers aided by the SLORC generals." "Is this not hypocrisy at its worst?" he asked.</em></p>
              <p><em>"The Singapore government knows it's having dinner with the devil, and sharing a very short spoon," says Seow. "And it is a terrible double standard. Drug moneys are being laundered apparently by the same drug lords who supply the heroin for which small-time drug dealers are hanged. We are reaping profits as Burma's biggest investor, but we're being paid with blood money." </em></p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The Nation (US) November 24, 1997.<br>Letter: Jean Tan, Singapore Embassy, Washington, USA<br>The Singapore government's response again confirms the fact that the government, through the GIC and the Myanmar Fund, was doing business with legendary drug trafficker Lo Hsing Han of Burma. Indeed, the rush in August to shut down the Myanmar Fund--only one aspect of a complicated web of investments with Lo and Burma's narco-dictatorship--is a clear indication that something is very wrong. (As we noted in our article, Lo and his company Asia World are under investigation by narcotics officials in several countries.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beyond this, Jean Tan's specific criticisms do not address the substance of our article. Nowhere did we say that the GIC's use of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. as a custodian was "sinister or secret." The newsworthy point is that a major US financial institution had business ties to a known heroin dealer.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Tan's assertion that the GIC was merely a "passive investor" is belied by the fund's own documents, one of which says that the GIC is a "core shareholder" and as such has a representative on the investment committee of the fund. "The committee will determine whether investment proposals are viable and whether they should be approved for investment by the Fund" says the 1994 document. (As manager of the GIC since 1991, Eddie Taw Cheng Kong was the GIC representative on the fund investment committee until very recently. Taw was sentenced in May to nine years in jail and a $2.4 million fine for accepting bribes from companies whose shares were purchased by the GIC.)</p>
              <p>Tan's statement on Dr Chee Soon Juan's refusal to set up a commission is misleading. Dr Chee was not a member of parliament and thus would have been excluded from the commission. His colleagues in parliament were afraid of lawsuits and other repercussions. Dr Chee had already been the target of a government defamation suit and was forced to sell his house and borrow heavily to avoid bankruptcy. Amnesty International says that Singapore's leaders are systematically "resorting to defamation suits as a politically-motivated tactic to silence critical views and curb opposition activity."</p>
              <p>Chee still had the courage to speak out, but his questions (in a letter to the prime minister and the Straits Times) remain unanswered by the ruling elite: Is Lo Hsing Han allowed to move freely in and out of Singapore, for example? Has the government investigated the background of Lo's son Steven Law, who has been denied a US visa on suspicion of drug trafficking? Will the government state clearly that Burma's junta is not helping or turning a blind eye to drug trafficking?</p>
              <p>Although the Myanmar Fund is now undergoing liquidation, these investments represented only a small part of Singapore's total investment in Burma. The US government has reported that more than half Singapore's $1 billion-plus investment in Burma is tied to Lo Hsing Han and his family.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Drug problems still in Singapore, not talked about in local media:</strong></span></p>
              <p><a title="Permanent Link: Party Drugs A Hit With Wealthy In Singapore" rel="bookmark" href="http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/2007/12/10/party-drugs-a-hit-with-wealthy-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Party Drugs A Hit With Wealthy In Singapore</strong></span></a></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Dec 10 (Reuters) - It is Friday night. Ling, a bank analyst in Armani heels, pops a small, blue pill into her mouth and dances to the thumping beat. Later she heads to a house party with her friends where they snort cocaine off tabletops.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s party drug scene used to be the domain of high-flying foreign bankers and other expatriates who would take ecstasy and snort cocaine in defiance of the city state’s drug laws which, with a mandatory death sentence for drug trafficking, are among the toughest in the world. But these days, the drug scene for foreigners is not as pronounced as among well-to-do locals in a country which has the world’s fastest-growing number of high net worth individuals, totalling some 67,000 in 2006.</p>
              <p>And fast cars and fancy clothes are not the only things young, hip and rich Singaporeans want to buy.</p>
              <p>“In general, you go for ‘trippy’ drugs, drugs that make you feel good as well as make you dance harder,” said a student from a wealthy family, who declined to be identified.</p>
              <p>With one gram of methamphetamine costing S$300, it is an expensive habit that not everyone can feed.</p>
              <p>Singaporean authorities say drug use is low, but anecdotal evidence tells of the emergence of an underground party drug scene mostly at night clubs frequented by the wealthy.</p>
              <p>Singapore is Asia’s second-richest country, with a 2006 GDP per capita of $29,000, on a par with Italy and Spain. The booming economy, driven by manufacturing and financial services, has made the city-state a playground for the rich.</p>
              <p>And with money to throw around, some of these rich Singaporeans are spending it on drugs smuggled from neighbouring Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
              <p>They are taking a big risk.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, anyone caught carrying more than 15 grams of heroin, 30 grams of cocaine, 500 grams of cannabis or 250 grams of methamphetamines faces a mandatory death sentence by hanging.</p>
              <p>Penalties for consumption are also strict, including up to 10 years in jail, a S$20,000 fine, or both.</p>
              <p>“There are definitely a lot of people doing drugs in the party scene, but it doesn’t get reported because there’s no way to really catch them since the circle is closed,” said bank analyst Ling, who would only give her first name.</p>
              <p><strong>Drugs and Gangs</strong></p>
              <p>With its borders closely monitored by vigilant authorities, it is not clear how drugs enter Singapore. But former gang members say some drugs are brought in on row boats from nearby Indonesian islands, or are smuggled along the causeway separating Singapore from Malaysia.</p>
              <p>“Don’t think it’s elaborate trucks with hidden compartments - sometimes the drugs are just in a motorcycle front basket and driven through,” said Jonathan, who spent 7 years as a gang member before entering a drug rehabilitation program.</p>
              <p>According to Singapore’s Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) figures, 1,127 drug users were arrested in 2006 compared to 793 in 2005. Forty-nine percent of those arrested took drugs such as ecstasy, ketamine and Nimetazepam.</p>
              <p>In 2004, the CNB carried out a raid which exposed a glitzy underground drug scene. The cocaine drug bust saw 23 people arrested, including the former editor of high-society magazine Singapore Tatler, an award-winning French chef and an oil broker.</p>
              <p>Three of those arrested jumped bail and left the country. They are still wanted by the Singapore police and Interpol. Nigel Simmonds, the editor of Singapore Tatler, was jailed for two years.</p>
              <p>“Every couple of years, they (the police) go out and get people so everyone is way too scared to do drugs,” said a British lawyer, who declined to be named. “The drugs of choice here (for foreigners) really are women and alcohol.”</p>
              <p>The city-state, which executed <a href="http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/6am-on-26-jan-2007/"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">two Africans</span></strong></a> and <a href="http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/2006/12/02/marking-the-anniversary-of-a-hanging-in-singapore/"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">an Australian</span></strong></a> in recent years, has faced pressure from rights groups and governments to end its mandatory death penalty for drug smuggling.</p>
              <p>Singapore <a href="http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/2007/12/03/singapores-strong-pro-death-penalty-stand-at-un-leaves-many-angered/"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">defends its position</span></strong></a> by saying it needs tough laws to deter drug traffickers. But some believe the death penalty is ineffective as a deterrence against drug smuggling.</p>
              <p>“When you hang a drug courier, you are only killing the small fry. The kingpins are the ones you don’t see,” said Sinapan Samydorai of rights group <a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">Think Centre</span></strong></a>.</p>
              <p>According to Amnesty International, about 400 people have been sentenced to death in Singapore since 1991, most of them for drug trafficking. This gives Singapore the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/report/info/ASA36/001/2004"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">highest execution rate per capita in the world</span></strong></a>, the human-rights group said.</p>
              <p>But tough laws are still not enough to stop some drug users. “It’s the same as having unprotected sex. You do it because it feels better. But if you get caught it’s the worst high ever,” said the wealthy student who declined to be named.</p>
