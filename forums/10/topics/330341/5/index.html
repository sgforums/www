              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Singapore's Dirty Little Secret? An Australian is shocked by the treatment of maids in Singapore:</strong></span></p>
              <div class="post hentry"><a name="8231178884466440282"></a><blockquote>
              <h3 class="post-title entry-title"><a href="http://sammizheng.blogspot.com/">Maid Abuse - No Longer A Dirty Little Secret</a></h3>
              <div>There are so many stories circulating the internet, of disregard for basic human rights, people suffering and abuse by authority. But the most recent reports of maid abuse in Singapore has left my heart aching for the victim.<br><br>According to staistics from the Ministry of Manpower, the number of substantiated maid abuse cases handled by the police dropped from 157 cases in 1997 to 68 last year. Now we need to find ways to eradicate this dirty little secret forever.<br><br>In the most recent and disgusting episode, 18-year-old mother of one, Nur Rizan Mohd Sazali was yesterday jailed for 26 months - 12 months for forcibly extracting the two teeth of, and another 14 months for pouring boiling wax on the maid. She has been dubbed by the press as "The Dentist".<br><br>The maid from Indonesia was accused of stealing from her employers. Although she kept protesting her innocence, 29-year old Ms Badingah was thought to be lying. This resulted in the ad-hoc dentistry, which saw her lose two of her front teeth, by the teenage mother wielding a pair of pliers.<br><br>Ms Badingah's employer, 25-year old Elsa Elyana Said, forcibly held the maid's head and forced her mouth open while the extraction took place.<br><br>Elsa pleaded guilty to punching the maid and assisting in the torture. She will be sentenced on Oct 16. She lived with Nur Rizan, as well as the teenager's mother and brother, in a flat in Jalan Minyak, off Chin Swee Road.<br><br>The series of abuse and torture that Ms Badingah endured at the hands of these four sadists, took place between June 2 and July 26 last year.<br><br>20-year old Muhammad Iz'aan was jailed for six weeks after having pleaded guilty to caning Ms Badingah. He is Nur Rizan's brother.<br><br>Muhammad Iz'aan caned the maid in a very bizarre torturous kind of punishment. She had been ordered to stand facing the door for a whole night with one leg off the ground and holding her ears. Every time that she dropped her leg, she was caned. The reason for this punishment is still unknown.<br><br>38-year old Maselly Abdul Aziz is the mother of the two convicted. She pleaded guilty, but had her pleae rejected, because she had initially claimed that all the accusations were lies.<br><br>According to public prosecutors, the abuse started just three months after Elsa 'borrowed' Ms Badingah from her mother's apartment to work in the Jalan Minyak household.<br><br>In another incident, the four accused had accused the maid of stealing their money and other small valuables. After Ms Badingah denied stealing their cellphones, Nur Rizan and her brother ordered her to take off her blouse. They then tied up her wrists with a bathrobe sash, and then Nur Rizan poured hot liquid wax from a candle over her back and head.<br><br>Ms Badingah, who had serious and extensive injuries, feared her abusers so much and for her life, that at one time, she actually jumped out of the kitchen window of the second-storey apartment and ran for her life.<br><br>Finally, the Defence lawyer said his clients were extremely remorseful for their actions. He said the case had brought immense shame to the family - well, doh... <strong>it's a little late for remorse now, isn't it?? </strong></div>

              <p>YET another family has been hauled to court for maid abuse.</p>
              <p>On Monday, an 18-year-old girl, together with her mother and mum's friend, was accused of pulling out two front teeth of Indonesian maid Badingah at a flat in Jalan Minyak off Chin Swee Road.</p>
              <p>Nur Rizan Mohd Sazali, who does administration work, is said to have done this with the help of the maid's employer, Elsa Elyana Said, 24, and at the instigation of her mother, Maselly Abdul Aziz, 37, unemployed.</p>
              <p>
              
              Her elder brother, Muhammad Iz'aan, 19, a waiter, faces one charge each of maid abuse and wrongful restraint.</p>
              <p>Nur Rizan is also accused of using an iron rod and cane to hit the back of Ms Badingah, pouring hot wax onto her head, and restraining her by tying the victim's hands with a bath robe.</p>
              <p>Maselly allegedly used an iron rod to hit Ms Badingah on the head, abetted Nur Rizan to cause grievous hurt to her in the teeth incident, poured hot water onto the maid's private part, and threatened to kill her if she did not return the money.</p>
              <p>The last charge also states that she was holding onto two knives when she made the threat on July 26 last year.</p>
              <p>Elsa is alleged to have punched Ms Badingah on her cheeks; helped Nur Rizan by holding onto Ms Badingah's head to restrain her movement while her teeth were being extracted; and tied her up with a bath robe.</p>
              <p>Muhammad Iz'aan's charges are for using a cane to hit the victim on the back and tying up her hands with a bath robe.</p>
              <p>The alleged offences took place between June 2 and July 26 last year.</p>
              <p>Two weeks ago, another family comprising a couple and the woman's mother were accused of between three and 32 charges of abusing their Indonesian maid.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Loke Phooi Ling, 37, is accused of 32 charges while her husband, bank executive Stanley Kuah Kian Chong, 37, faces three counts.</p>
              <p>Her mother, Teng Chen Lian, 66, allegedly slapped, kicked, knocked the head of the 23-year-old maid and poked her neck with a pair of chopsticks between May and July last year.</p>
              <p>In Monday's case, Mr S. S. Dhillon appeared for the four, and said he had just been briefed.</p>
              <p>District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan set bail at $10,000 each and ordered that their passports be impounded.</p>
              <p>A pre-trial conference will be held on March 27.</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hundreds of millions of cash smuggled to Singapore daily</span></h1>
              <p class="info"><strong>The Jakarta Post</strong> Â  | Â Wed, 09/17/2008 6:44 PMÂ  | Â National</p>
              <p>Cash worth hundreds of millions of rupiah is being smuggled to Singapor daily, the Indonesian Navy said during a raid in Batam on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Based on the confession of the two perpetratos detained Wednesday, Batam naval base commander Col. Muhammad Faisal said, cash smuggling to Singapore had been carried out daily over the past three years.</p>
              <p>The two, identified as Yong Peng and Toni, were caught red- handed carrying a combined of Rp 686 million (US$72,800) on board a ferry headed for Singapore. The immigration law says travelers are not allowed to carry more than Rp 100 million outside the country.</p>
              <p>"They admitted that the money was supposed to be delivered to someone in Singapore," Faizal told reporters.</p>
              <p>Faizal said navy investigators were still acquiring more information from the two detainees as they suspected that such practice was also being carried out by many other smuggler groups.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">EIA reports <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"smuggler friendly climate" of Singapore threatens</span> efforts of the United States to protect its borders from environmentally harmful substances.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The nongovernmental Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) caused a stir at the meeting with its revelation of elaborate CFC smuggling operations spanning three continents and including Singapore, South Africa, and the United States.</p>
              <p>The report, entitled âLost in Transit â Global CFC Smuggling Trends and the Need for Faster Phase Outâ is based on undercover investigations by EIA personnel. It reveals the global nature of the illegal trade and exposes CFC smuggling operations coordinated by Singaporean dealers who seek to deceive U.S. authorities and dump illegal CFCs on the American market.</p>
              <p>The EIA report shows how Singaporean companies offer to sell CFCs to the United States, mislead the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and engineer elaborate international trading schemes to avoid U.S. enforcement efforts.</p>
              <p>EIA campaigner Alexander von Bismarck says, âOver the last decade, the United States has been working hard and effectively to stop the illegal import of these dangerous chemicals. <strong>Our investigations suggest that these efforts are now threatened by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sophisticated smuggling operations in Singapore and other transit countries.â</span></strong></p>
              <p>EIA undercover investigators met with Singaporean businesses involved in such illegal practices and revealed the role which transit countries play in this trade by facilitating the diversion of CFCs onto the black market.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore and other transit points in the illegal CFC trade such as Dubai do not sufficiently control or monitor the movement of CFCs through their ports, and companies are able to operate illicit trading schemes with minimal interference. One particular company, Leempeng Enterprise Pte Ltd offered EIA investigators a shipment of CFCs complete with false paperwork and offered to conceal the goods behind uncontrolled chemicals to avoid detection.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>In May, President George W. Bush signed a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore, which the U.S. Congress ratified in September. The EIA report suggests that the smuggler friendly climate of Singapore threatens the efforts of the United States to protect its borders from environmentally harmful substances.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Family of four hauled to court for maid abuse &lt;!-- TITLE : end--&gt;</span>&lt;!-- &lt;br&gt;&lt;font class="bodytext"&gt;18-year-old girl, her mother and mum's friend accused of pulling out front teeth of Indonesian maid. -ST&lt;/font&gt; --&gt; <img src="http://sgforums.com/a1media/site/common/blank.gif" alt="" width="1" height="2"> Elena Chong Mon, Mar 10, 2008<br>The Straits Times</strong></p>
              <p>YET another family has been hauled to court for maid abuse.</p>
              <p>On Monday, an 18-year-old girl, together with her mother and mum's friend, was accused of pulling out two front teeth of Indonesian maid Badingah at a flat in Jalan Minyak off Chin Swee Road.</p>
              <p>Nur Rizan Mohd Sazali, who does administration work, is said to have done this with the help of the maid's employer, Elsa Elyana Said, 24, and at the instigation of her mother, Maselly Abdul Aziz, 37, unemployed.</p>
              <p>Her elder brother, Muhammad Iz'aan, 19, a waiter, faces one charge each of maid abuse and wrongful restraint.</p>
              <p>Nur Rizan is also accused of using an iron rod and cane to hit the back of Ms Badingah, pouring hot wax onto her head, and restraining her by tying the victim's hands with a bath robe.</p>
              <p>Maselly allegedly used an iron rod to hit Ms Badingah on the head, abetted Nur Rizan to cause grievous hurt to her in the teeth incident, poured hot water onto the maid's private part, and threatened to kill her if she did not return the money.</p>
              <p>The last charge also states that she was holding onto two knives when she made the threat on July 26 last year.</p>
              <p>Elsa is alleged to have punched Ms Badingah on her cheeks; helped Nur Rizan by holding onto Ms Badingah's head to restrain her movement while her teeth were being extracted; and tied her up with a bath robe.</p>
              <p>Muhammad Iz'aan's charges are for using a cane to hit the victim on the back and tying up her hands with a bath robe.</p>
              <p>The alleged offences took place between June 2 and July 26 last year.</p>
              <p>Two weeks ago, another family comprising a couple and the woman's mother were accused of between three and 32 charges of abusing their Indonesian maid.</p>
              <p>Malaysian Loke Phooi Ling, 37, is accused of 32 charges while her husband, bank executive Stanley Kuah Kian Chong, 37, faces three counts.</p>
              <p>Her mother, Teng Chen Lian, 66, allegedly slapped, kicked, knocked the head of the 23-year-old maid and poked her neck with a pair of chopsticks between May and July last year.</p>
              <p>In Monday's case, Mr S. S. Dhillon appeared for the four, and said he had just been briefed.</p>
              <p>District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan set bail at $10,000 each and ordered that their passports be impounded.</p>
              <p>A pre-trial conference will be held on March 27.</p>

They were wearing ski masks and each one was carrying either a parang or a sword.<br><br>'I thought they were looking for others. We had no time to react or run away at all before they attacked us.'<br><br>Ahmad said he and his friends, whose ages range from 17 to 24, fled in different directions with the assailants in hot pursuit.<br><br>Ahmad himself ran to Block 16 where he was pounced upon at the void deck by two attackers.<br><br>He said: 'Then three other men, also wearing ski masks and carrying parangs, appeared and also started attacking me.'<br><br>He tried to protect his head by using his hands to cover it.<br><br>'But when I did so, I heard the (hacking) sounds,' he recounted.<br><br>'I knew that the parang had hit me.'<br><br>Ahmad then tried to run into a lift.<br><br>A middle-aged man was about to exit and was threatened by the attackers.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'They warned him to get out of the way or they would also chop him.'<br><br>The five attackers then tried to force their way into the lift as Ahmad kept kicking them out.<br><br>He succeeded only after one of them told the gang 'enough' in Malay and they left.<br><br>By then, Ahmad's hands were soaked with blood, with bones visible from the wounds.<br><br>'I thought I was going to die,' he said. 'If they had managed to enter the lift, I think I would have been dead by now.'<br><br>Taking the lift to the sixth floor, he sought help from a household, whose main door was open.<br><br>'I told them that I had been attacked by a gang and asked them to help call for an ambulance.'<br><br>The family also helped dress his wounds and gave him drinks.<br><br>Ahmad said they also kept talking to him because he told them he was going to faint. Later, the police and ambulance arrived to take him to hospital.<br><br>Ahmad's elder sister, 33, said she was distraught to see him badly injured.<br><br>She said: 'I don't know why they attacked my brother. He isn't the sort to mix with bad company.<br><br>'I hope the police will step up patrols and also arrest these people soon.'<br><br>Ahmad is now fearful of returning to Eunos Crescent, the neighbourhood where he had lived for nearly 20 years.<br><br>He moved out of the area five years ago, but would return there almost daily to hang out with his childhood friends. He said his family had plans to move back there next year because they like the area so much.<br><br>'But now, I'm not so sure.'<br><br>One of his injured friends, who is still warded at CGH, said Ahmad was the worst hit.<br><br>Requesting not to be named, he added: 'We do not know who these guys are and we have never offended anyone before.'<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said that so far, there have been no arrests and those injured in both the cases are being interviewed.<br><br>'The two cases are being investigated as rioting armed with dangerous weapon,' he added.<br><br>Those convicted of the offence face a jail term of up to seven years and caning</p></div>

              <h2 id="stand-first"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Acclaimed film dubbed a threat to Singapore's national security</span></h2>
              <p></p>
              <div id="content">
              <ul class="article-attributes no-pic">
              <li class="byline"><a id="historylink-byline" class="sendbyline" style="cursor: pointer;"></a></li>
              </ul>
              <div id="article-wrapper">With his spiky hair, infectious bonhomie and casual dress sense, the 27-year-old Singaporean film-maker Royston Tan is not obvious as a threat to national security.
              <p>He has more than two dozen awards and his debut feature film, 15, last year became the first movie from Singapore to compete at the Venice film festival.</p>
              <p>"15 is the best Singaporean work for the last few years," said Philip Cheah, director of the Singapore international film festival, of the drama about a teenage gang of misfits struggling to survive in the abandoned underbelly of the city state's supposedly squeaky-clean society.</p>
              <p>But Singapore's police, reflecting the government's obsession with social order and national stability, dubbed the film a threat to national security.</p>
              <p>Much of 15, which is cast with real teenage gang members, has no discernible plot, due partly to the fact that one of the stars was arrested for stabbing another gang member halfway through filming. It is a no-holds-barred, fly-on-the-wall part-documentary, part-drama of their unconventional lifestyle.</p>
              <p>One "actor" repeatedly slashes his wrists with a box cutter, another forces a condom packed with drugs down his throat to smuggle overseas, two pierce each others' faces to insert studs and one squirms as he gets a rudimentary tattoo.</p>
              <p>"The act of inflicting pain on themselves is like a form of rebellion," Tan said. "I think I do have a responsibility [to intervene] but I have a greater responsibility to tell the audience how they lead their lives.</p>
              <p>"You know that shows a very real side of their lives and there's a growing number of kids like this."</p>
              <p>Police statistics confirm this. Crimes committed by children aged seven to 15 rose 56% in Singapore in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, while youth crime in 2002 was 55% higher than in 2001.</p>
              <p>But Singaporeans have no need to learn about this niche of their society in such a graphic way and through a vehicle with no moral message, according to the authorities - even though the Singapore Film Council funded 25% of 15's S$200,000 (Â£68,000) production costs.</p>
              <p>"The police were concerned about scenes which featured real-life gang chants which had resulted in gang fights when they were sung in public places," said a spokeswoman for the Media Development Authority, which oversees censorship. "The film also named actual secret societies and their operational grounds which the police felt would serve to promote and give prominence to these gangs."</p>
              <p>The censorship board reportedly wanted only one cut before approving 15's release in Singapore, a brief shot of a 17cm (7in) penis, while the police insisted on 26 further deletions. After four months of deliberations 15 was released with about 10 of its 100 minutes expunged, but with an 18 rating and not in suburban cinemas.</p>
              <p>Tan had prepared a version for Singapore with the penis and a few other shots deleted but was not prepared for the scale of the controversy. But he says he is unable to discuss the way his film was treated.</p>
              <p>"I've been advised not to talk about censorship, that we should move on," he said, admitting only that one of the stars, Shaun Tan (no relation), had told him police had interrogated him.</p>
              <p>"Shaun [told me he] was threatened to be stripped and have cold water poured over him if he didn't give the answers they wanted," he said. "It's strange I haven't been questioned. I offered myself but they didn't want to speak to me."</p>
              <p>The police declined to comment on this allegation.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans' desire to see 15 was unambiguously demonstrated on the only occasion it was shown uncensored, at the Singapore international film festival. "The 1,002 tickets sold out in less than a day, breaking the record for the festival," Tan said.</p>
              <p>But perhaps 15's greatest accolade was not winning the international film critics' award at the festival, but the authorities' response.</p>
              <p>Last month the national crime prevention council and police released their own 90-minute feature about gang life and the consequences of teenage recidivism, After School.</p>
              <p>"We were told this film was made to correct the image of Singapore that 15 did not give," Tan said. "They said 15 is an extreme film while their film brings out the right consequences of crime.</p>
              <p>"That's the biggest compliment that somebody could ever give me."</p>
              <p>The executive director of the crime prevention council, Lee Chee Chiew, denies this, saying he has never seen 15 and cannot comment on any comparison.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman, Acting Superintendent Ang Poon Seng, said the decision to make a film was merely "to harness the power of movies and their widespread popularity among teenagers" and had nothing to do with 15.</p>
              <p>The two films' styles are undoubtedly very different and After School is laced with such moralising soundbites as: "There's nothing to lose, just walk away"; "The police are so powerful they can target anyone"; "How can he survive if he has a criminal record?"; and "The things that come free are actually the most expensive."</p>
              <p>"The films differ in terms of treatment and messaging," the Media Development Authority spokeswoman said.</p>
              <p>"After School is about love and the importance of family bonding, and carries a clear anti-crime message. 15 focuses on secret societies and teen gangs, and has no clear moral message."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large; color: #ff0000;">Gang violence by girls on the rise </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #008000; font-family: Courier New;">They dress, fight and commit crimes very much like male <br><br></span></em></strong>GIRL gangs are making a comeback, with an attitude and aggression that bear an unsettling resemblance to boy gangs.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>They dress like the boys, they fight like boys, even the crimes they commit are what the boy gangs are notorious for: rioting, robbing and extorting money, all offences which carry jail sentences.</p>
              <p>One of the five detectives interviewed for this report, offered this snapshot of today's girl thugs: "In the past, girls broke the law in such areas as unlawful assembly, fights over men, and in staring incidents at public places such as discos.</p>
              <p>"Now, they are doing what boy gangs do: breaking into cars to steal, threatening people and demanding money from schoolmates and neighbours."</p>
              <p>Official figures show a disturbing rise in teenage girls committing extortions, robberies and other crimes.</p>
              <p>In the first six months of this year, girls were involved in: 16 robberies, up from five last year; 25 thefts, up from 21; 236 shoplifting cases, up from 188, and 15 extortion cases, up from 10. In 1996, there were no reports of girls involved in extortion cases.</p>
              <p>A total of 310 girls were arrested in the first six months of this year, compared with 273 in the first half of last year.</p>
              <p>The detectives said that the pace picked up last September. They now make two to three arrests a week. Before, one a week was about average. Most of these girl gangsters are between 13 and 17 years old, although the police have come across girls as young as 10.</p>
              <p>Police officers have sometimes mistaken them for boys because of their "short hair, men's shirt, trousers and Doc Martens shoes".</p>
              <p>And when they fight, it is with a vengeance.</p>
              <p>"Before, the girls would scratch and pull each other's hair. Now, they punch, kick and scratch their victims with sharp objects such as small knives. In some cases, they attack with stiletto-heeled shoes, leaving a bloody mess."</p>
              <p>Compared with their forerunners, the Butterfly and Rose gangs of the early Sixties, the gangs today give themselves "cutesy" names like: Xiao Ding Dang (Little Doraemon, a Japanese cartoon character) and Xiao Tian Tian (Little Candy, another Japanese cartoon character).</p>
              <p>They operate in gangs with between 15 and 20 members. Membership comes easy too: Initiation rituals are not required. There's no need to make offerings to Guan Kong (the Chinese God of War), for example. They just wear the same shoes, coloured wrist bands or sport similar tattoos.</p>
              <p>Girl gangs often pick on neighbours or schoolmates.</p>
              <p>Said a detective: "They would extort money from other girls, after accusing them of staring or spreading rumours about them."</p>
              <p>Counsellors who have dealt with these girls say the lack of parental control and attention is the main cause of this rising tide of thuggery.</p>
              <p>Most of the girls are from homes with a history of family abuse or where the parents have marital problems.</p>
              <p>Their parents tend to shrug off the misdeeds, and often ask the police to let the girls off because "they're just kids", the detectives said.</p>
              <p>Even after the girls are convicted and sent to homes or placed on probation, many parents refuse to see that their child is developing into a full-fledged criminal.</p>
              <p>Counsellor Lindy Ong, 35, who has set up a support group in a church for parents with problem teens, said: "Some just leave their kids with us and expect us to perform miracles. They don't even turn up for counselling sessions."</p>
              <p>In a research bulletin issued by the Subordinate Courts, a court official said: "If the young person's undesirable values and erroneous methods of solving her problems are not corrected early, there will be dire consequences."</p>

              <td id="subContent">ONE in four secondary school children is a victim of bullying, a recent Singapore Children's Society survey has found.<br><br>Of the 519 students questioned by the society, 129 said they had been bullied. And, even more worryingly, several of those who have been bullied go on to become bullies themselves.<br><br>Of the 129 victims, the survey found, 37 were also bullies. Of these, 10 said they became bullies because they were bullied before. <br><br>Said Ms Tan Bee Joo, head of the society's Bukit Merah Centre: "In these cases, the victims don't know where to vent their frustrations. They feel that they don't have to be kind to others since other people are being unkind to them. This is worrying because it becomes a vicious circle."<br><br>Penny (not her real name) is one example of victim turned bully. Three years ago, when she was in Secondary 2, she was a victim of school bullying and dealt with her feelings of anger and powerlessness by terrorising others.<br><br>In Penny's case, she wanted others to feel her pain. For a year, the bully in her class threw her books out of the window, hurled vulgarities at her, and once kicked her chair so hard that she fell forward and bruised her chin.<br><br>To compensate, she would throw her juniors' bags into the school pond. It was, she said, her way of 'feeling in control'.<br><br>The survey was conducted in March and the respondents were picked randomly from private and HDB estates islandwide.<br><br>During the door-to-door visits, they were asked, among other things, how they were bullied and how they felt about it. The poll defined bullying as a hurtful behaviour repeated at least twice a month.<br><br>The two most common forms of bullying were verbal. Half (50.4 per cent) of the victims had vulgar language used on them and slightly more than a third (34.9 per cent) were called names that hurt their feelings. The spreading of negative rumours about the victim was the third most common experience (29.5 per cent).<br><br>Said Ms Tan: "Although the impact of physical bullying is greater, we cannot underestimate the effect of verbal abuses. Bullying usually starts small and, if you don't curb it then, it may become a big problem later."<br><br>Bullied children are usually perceived to be meek and submissive, but interestingly, more than a third of the victims surveyed (37.2 per cent) said they took revenge on the bully.<br><br>What the victims should do, said Ms Tan, is to tell their teachers and parents, instead of suffer in silence or seek revenge. She said the bullies themselves also need to get help to stop their behaviour, as past studies have shown that they are more likely to get into trouble when they grow up.<br><br>Ms Tan also recommended that schools adopt an anti-bullying policy spelling out the boundaries of unacceptable behaviour and the punishment.<br><br>But some educators, such as Kheng Cheng School vice-principal Thia Ang Hua, felt that it is better to impart the right values.<br><br>"Rules can always be broken and they only apply to a child's school life. But values such as respecting and being kind to each other are virtues that they can live by throughout their life," said Mr Thia.<br><br>The survey was carried out with the society's Bully Free Week campaign to spread the message against bullying through exhibits, videos and games.<br><br>"Although the impact of physical bullying is greater, we cannot underestimate the effect of verbal abuses. Bullying usually starts small and, if you don't curb it then, it may become a big problem later." <br><em>- MS TAN BEE JOO, head of the Singapore Children's Society's Bukit Merah Centre</em><br><br>Bullies' common tactics

              <p>Singapore - More complaints of cyberbullying are emerging from youngsters in Singapore than any other country except the United States, an international safety group said in a report on Monday.<br><br>Wired Safety, which has volunteers in 76 countries, told The Straits Times it has received about 230 complaints from the city-state since 2002, with more than 80 logged so far this year.<br><br>As a proportion of population, executive director Parry Aftab said Singapore has far more cases than anyone would have expected.<br><br>These range from insults and pornography sent through email, Internet chatrooms and discussion forums to hi-tech offences such as hacking into victims' accounts.<br><br>The complaints are less serious than those in the US, where death threats are included, she said.<br><br>Singapore launched an anti-bullying week on Monday to wipe out the ominous trend.<br><br>Wired Safety also receives complaints from Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong.<br><br>A separate survey of 1 100 teenagers here by an Internet safety group found one in three, usually girls, received frightening email.<br><br>About one in four had been "harassed, upset, bothered, threatened or embarrassed while chatting online in the past six months", the survey said.<br><br>"Cyberbullying is usually malicious and should not be confused with one-off pranks," said Angeline Khoo, with the National Institute of Education. - Sapa-dpa</p>

              <p>Not all Singaporean employers are like that. There will always be this few black sheeps. The situation in the Western countries are not that impressive also. Abuses of domestic helpers are more frequent there compared to Singapore.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore is 2nd in cyber-bullying, keep it up, netizens.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img style="width: 387px; height: 283px;" src="http://fc05.deviantart.com/fs23/i/2008/013/5/4/cyber_bullying_by_g4m3thugg.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="348"></p>
              <p>Today, I was reading the newspaper about how netbullying is on the rise in Singapore. How ironic, given that I criticise on this blog nearly everyday, I still find the article shocking.<br><br>Listen, yeah, to this portion about net bullying, it's an example.<br><br><strong>"Victor Cheng, a student from a co-ed school in the west, was a victim of online ostracising; he realised he had been blocked on MSN Messenger by the entire class."</strong><br><br>Needless to say, he felt sad, hurt, blah blah blah, you know, the sad stories we hear over the news to make sure we think twice about posting some comment about some person we find evil on the net.<br><br>But, I think, with regards to this kind of issue, it's more of a two-hands-needed-to-clap thing. If you do not provoke/infuriate/irritate others with your behaviour, comments, or anything, people will just leave you alone. It's only when you are an idiot and do weird stuff, then people will comment.<br><br>Flaming on the net, to me, is a good analogy. You see, normally, flaming is thought to be irrational and often just to hit back at the person one is targeting. But, there is smoke without a fire, and there's no fire without fuel. Who provides the fuel? Most often, in small, minor cases where the perpetrator is not really a "full-time" bully, it is often just commenting, albeit nastily, on the "victim".<br><br>If I could, I would bitch and bitch about the whole world about me. People will come, read this blog and leave, thinking that I'm just some loser, armchair critic. Maybe I am, when it comes to some issues that I wouldn't go round yelling about in public, but for most posts, I feel conviction in the stuff I post.<br><br>And really, for kiddies in Primary 3, what can they possibly do to you to make your life hell? Just tell their parents, simple as that. Parents will scold their children, hey, your life is heaven again.<br><br>And really, cyber-bullying is kinda dumb and foreign to me, since the digital life section puts into perspective 4 forms of cyber bullying.<br><br>1. Hate Email.<br>2. Happy Slapping.<br>3. Ostracising on MSN.<br>4. Disguising identity.</p>

              <div>HANGING on to the bonnet of a speeding car as it kept swerving to throw you off is something that happens only in the movies.<br><br>For two minutes yesterday afternoon, he did just that.<br><br>The reason he ended up on the bonnet is even more shocking - it was an argument over a scratch.<br><br>Luckily for Mr Koh, 36, he escaped with only abrasions.<br><br>The sales executive was walking back to his Toyota Wish which was parked on Tembeling Road, near Joo Chiat.<br><br>He recalled: 'I had just collected a cheque from a client and was walking back to my car to drive off for lunch.<br><br>'From a distance, I saw a man walking pass the right side of my car.<br><br>'I thought I saw him scratching the right passenger door with his car keys.'<br><br>When Mr Koh reached his car, he found a 15cm scratch on his silver Wish which he bought new two years ago.<br><br>The man who scratched Mr Koh's car got into a black Nissan Cefiro which was parked behind Mr Koh's.<br><br>Both cars were in parallel parking lots.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'By the time I reached my car, the man was already trying to get out of the parking lot.<br><br>'I tapped on the bonnet to get the driver's attention.<br><br>'But he kept inching his car forward even though I signalled to him to stop. I had to keep stepping back in order not get hit. <br><br>'All of a sudden, the driver surged forward and I had no time to react. As a result, I slumped forward on the car's bonnet.'<br><br>The car did not stop and Mr Koh had to hold on to the bonnet so as not to fall off.<br><br>The Nissan drove about 15m towards the junction of Tembeling Road and East Coast Road.<br><br>There, the driver slowed down to make a left turn to get on to East Coast Road.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'I kept yelling at the driver to stop. But it was no use. I couldn't really see his face because of the glare from the front windscreen.<br><br>'The windows were shut, so I don't think he could hear me.'<br><br>After the Nissan got on to East Coast Road, the driver tried to shake Mr Koh off.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'He kept swerving left and right after he turned left on to East Coast Road.<br><br>'I couldn't do anything except to grip the bonnet very tightly and shouted at him to stop.<br><br>'I remembered turning my head back as he sped on. I saw the back of a lorry and the Nissan slowed down to avoid hitting the lorry.'<br><br>About 200m after getting on to East Coast Road, the Nissan brushed against a motorcycle which was travelling on the left lane of the two-lane road.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'The driver continued moving ahead even after the Nissan brushed against a motorcycle. Then, it turned left towards Still Road.<br><br>'After that, I couldn't hang on to the car any more and I fell off the bonnet.'<br><br>Mr Koh landed on the road and rolled onto the middle lane of Still Road and almost got hit by a despatch rider when he rolled into his lane.<br><br>The despatch rider, Mr Mohd Shahril, 32, thought that an 'object had came into his path'.<br><br>Mr Shahril, who was on Still Road travelling towards Eunos, said: 'I was surprised when I found out that the 'object' was actually a man. If I had not braked in time, the both of us would surely be hurt.'<br><br>Mr Koh finally came to a stop near a bus stop.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'My chin hit the ground even though I tried to use my arms to cushion the fall. It was very painful and I couldn't move.<br><br>'Luckily, a motorcyclist came by to help me. Some other people from the bus stop also came to help.'<br><br>Mr Shahril said he does not know who was more crazy - the driver of the fleeing car or the man who held on to the bonnet.<br><br>He said: 'From the corner of my eye, I could see and hear the screeching sound the speeding car was making. The driver didn't even slow down as he entered the filter lane.<br><br>'The driver is crazy because the man could have been dragged under the wheels of his car.'<br><br>Those who had helped Mr Koh took him to the bus stop and called for an ambulance. He was taken to Changi General Hospital.<br><br>Mr Koh suffered abrasions to both his arms and his knees. His left shirt pocket was torn and his pants were also torn at the knees.<br><br>Mr Koh recalled that the driver of the Nissan wore a blue T-shirt with blue shorts, but couldn't make out his appearance as he only saw the driver from a distance.<br><br>But Mr Koh said the driver was a short and plump man in his 40s.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'Scratching my car was a small matter. I only wanted to talk to him about it. But what he did could have cost me my life.'<br><br>He made a police report at the accident and emergency ward of CGH.<br><br>Mr Koh's wife, Madam S Chong, 36, said the Nissan driver's behaviour was 'outrageous'.<br><br>She was having lunch when her husband called her while he was in the ambulance to CGH.<br><br>Madam Chong said: 'At first, I thought he was joking as my husband likes to joke a lot. As he could still talk to me on the phone, I knew he wasn't too badly hurt.<br><br>The Kohs have two children aged 4 and 8.<br><br>A passer-by gave Mr Koh the licence plate number of the Nissan.<br><br>He said: 'It all happened so fast that I didn't have time to see the car plate number.<br><br>'Luckily, there were witnesses who saw what happened.'<br><br>The police said they were informed of the incident at about 1pm.<br><br>They are investigating the matter which involves a car driver, a motorcyclist and a pedestrian.<br><br>A similar incident happened on 9 Apr. Mr Alex Lim was driving his girlfriend home for dinner, but along Paterson Road, his red Mazda was involved in a minor collision with a taxi.<br><br>Both drivers then parked along Scotts Road and got out of their vehicles. An argument followed.<br><br>Cabby Lee Yuet Kong, who was carrying a passenger at the time, allegedly got back into his taxi and tried to drive off.<br><br>Mr Lim, a finacial adviser, wanting to get Lee's particulars, stood in front of the cab, but Lee reportedly drove away, throwing him onto the bonnet.<br><br>He later allegedly braked abruptly, causing Mr Lim to fall backwards and hit his head on the ground.<br><br>Mr Lim died on 13 May.<br><br>Lee, a 68-year-old relief driver, has been charged with causing grievous hurt with a rash act.</div>

              <p>While, at least there is some country worst than us. Also, you have forgotten to add that Singaporeans are better able to stand up against such bullying than their Western counterparts. I think by comparing the rate of suicides due to bullying, Singapore have one of the lowest among all the countries.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Alex Lim's car and the taxi had a small collision along Paterson Road on 9 April 2007. A little ahead, at Scotts Road, both of them pulled over as is normal practice, to exchange drivers' identification. An argument broke out and Lee, the taxi driver, refused to provide Lim with his details. He got back into his cab intending to drive off. Lim tried to stop him by positioning himself in front of the taxi.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Lee drove straight into Lim, throwing the latter onto the bonnet. Then he stopped suddenly, throwing Lim forward onto the road. Not only did Lim's girlfriend witness this, apparently so did a passenger in Lee's taxi.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Alex Lim, aged 30, and a financial advisor, has been in a coma since. He's had a part of his brain removed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Â <br>In the early hours of last Monday, just outside a Clarke Quay bar, an off-duty bar manager (from a different bar) was attacked. Eugene Chua was so brutally beaten he died in hospital 2 days later. Exactly who did this and why has not been revealed but the police have arrested 2 persons in connection with the <a name="return2">crime</a>, and are investigating. <a href="/forums/10/topics/#foot2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[2]</span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">By all accounts, Eugene Chua was very much liked. His boss described him as "a small, spunky, affable and hardworking guy", and his premature death at age 32 was deeply mourned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">24 hours prior to that savage incident, six teenagers were attacked by 16 young men near the Esplanade. The six claimed that the fight, which included vulgarities and racial taunts, was unprovoked. One of the six, Chan Voon Ho, aged 17, was so badly beaten that he suffered multiple fractures on his face and <a name="return3">lost nearly all</a> his front teeth.<a href="/forums/10/topics/#foot3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[3]</span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">The police are now looking for the 16 other guys. Whether it will be classified as causing grievous hurt, rioting or some other offence is too early to say.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Then we have stories of schoolgirls engaging in "happy slapping", a form of bullying, where a group gangs up on a victim, strip and beat her and record everything on video to be uploaded onto the internet. Such brazen behaviour, I can hardly imagine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Â <br>For some years now, I have been disturbed by how quickly Singaporeans resort to violence. Bar fights are common, as is road rage, but even if you're nowhere near a bar or on the road, you can still be beaten to pulp just by looking at the wrong person. "Staring" incidents, a marker of immaturity, can escalate into running battles within minutes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Staring comes out of an animalistic instinct, where one party uses his eyes to establish his social rank over the other. The one who turns away first concedes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">In young men, with their testosterone impulses, self-control is already lower than other age groups, but when we stir in low self-esteem, then the challenge is perceived even more acutely. All the more, the staring party, whether initiator or responder, cannot afford to back down. That is why staring incidents leading to fights are typically reported among the less educated or the less economically well-off.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">That being the case, a widening income gap and increasing financial stress for the lower half of society does not bode well at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Road rage, on the other hand, involves the better off and the well-educated too. We sometimes hear of people driving Mercedes Benzes getting into a scuffle after an accident. No social class is immune.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">I just wonder if we are increasingly stressed out. Frustrated with working long hours at the office, or no job at all. Or lousy pay while the bosses award themselves huge bonuses. Congestion and crowding as we go from one place to another. Noise all around us even when we reach home, because the damn town council keeps giving out <a name="return4">getai</a> <a href="/forums/10/topics/#foot4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[4]</span></a> permits....</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Others would put the blame on screen and TV violence. Exactly how media portrayal of violence affects social tendency to violence is not fully established, but it should be no surprise if there is a relationship to some degree. Even indirectly, as in audiences imbibing attitudes regarding fighting for one's sense of honour, or group loyalty right or wrong, can have an effect.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">I have long thought that Singapore over-regulates the depiction of sex and sexuality, and under-regulates the depiction of violence. Sure, people can be influenced by the depiction of sexual lives to adopt different sexual values, but rarely are there victims arising from those new sexual values. On the other hand, violence produces victims, almost by definition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, I see instances where our justice system tends to be too lenient on violence too. In an earlier article <a href="/forums/10/arch_1999/yax-148.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pimp and the cabby</span></a>, I pointed out two court cases that occurred at the same time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">In one, a taxi driver tried to run down a pedestrian. Twice. He was given a sentence of 4 months' imprisonment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">In the other, a pimp was sentenced to 4 years in jail, twelve times longer than the taxi driver, someone whose actions could have killed another person. There was no suggestion that the pimp used coercion of any kind to run his business. His "boys" were willing sellers -- that's typical for male prostitution, unlike female prostitution where the power relationship is often unequal -- and his buyers were willing buyers. In other words, there were really no victims.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Besides the question of whether such a disparity in penalties strikes anyone as reasonable, there is also the question of why the police are devoting resources to chasing after victimless crimes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Yet righting the balance in law enforcement, needed though it is, is certainly not the whole answer. We have to identify and address the social causes. They will be many and complicated. First though, we must understand that violence is a symptom of social breakdown, when people feel hopeless or powerless, or just so frustrated with a zillion other things in their lives, they lose control at a snap.Â  <img src="/forums/10/images/bar_red.gif" border="0" alt="" width="4" height="12" align="bottom"></span></p>
