              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>
              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Note the bad acting, where he pretended to be "excited" and "surprised" about what he wrote himself.</span></p>
              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Alex Lim's car and the taxi had a small collision along Paterson Road on 9 April 2007. A little ahead, at Scotts Road, both of them pulled over as is normal practice, to exchange drivers' identification. An argument broke out and Lee, the taxi driver, refused to provide Lim with his details. He got back into his cab intending to drive off. Lim tried to stop him by positioning himself in front of the taxi.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Lee drove straight into Lim, throwing the latter onto the bonnet. Then he stopped suddenly, throwing Lim forward onto the road. Not only did Lim's girlfriend witness this, apparently so did a passenger in Lee's taxi.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Alex Lim, aged 30, and a financial advisor, has been in a coma since. He's had a part of his brain removed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"> <br>In the early hours of last Monday, just outside a Clarke Quay bar, an off-duty bar manager (from a different bar) was attacked. Eugene Chua was so brutally beaten he died in hospital 2 days later. Exactly who did this and why has not been revealed but the police have arrested 2 persons in connection with the <a id="return2" rel="nofollow" name="return2">crime</a>, and are investigating. <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/#foot2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[2]</span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">By all accounts, Eugene Chua was very much liked. His boss described him as "a small, spunky, affable and hardworking guy", and his premature death at age 32 was deeply mourned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">24 hours prior to that savage incident, six teenagers were attacked by 16 young men near the Esplanade. The six claimed that the fight, which included vulgarities and racial taunts, was unprovoked. One of the six, Chan Voon Ho, aged 17, was so badly beaten that he suffered multiple fractures on his face and <a id="return3" rel="nofollow" name="return3">lost nearly all</a> his front teeth.<a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/#foot3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[3]</span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">The police are now looking for the 16 other guys. Whether it will be classified as causing grievous hurt, rioting or some other offence is too early to say.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Then we have stories of schoolgirls engaging in "happy slapping", a form of bullying, where a group gangs up on a victim, strip and beat her and record everything on video to be uploaded onto the internet. Such brazen behaviour, I can hardly imagine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">* * * * *</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"> <br>For some years now, I have been disturbed by how quickly Singaporeans resort to violence. Bar fights are common, as is road rage, but even if you're nowhere near a bar or on the road, you can still be beaten to pulp just by looking at the wrong person. "Staring" incidents, a marker of immaturity, can escalate into running battles within minutes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Staring comes out of an animalistic instinct, where one party uses his eyes to establish his social rank over the other. The one who turns away first concedes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">In young men, with their testosterone impulses, self-control is already lower than other age groups, but when we stir in low self-esteem, then the challenge is perceived even more acutely. All the more, the staring party, whether initiator or responder, cannot afford to back down. That is why staring incidents leading to fights are typically reported among the less educated or the less economically well-off.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">That being the case, a widening income gap and increasing financial stress for the lower half of society does not bode well at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Road rage, on the other hand, involves the better off and the well-educated too. We sometimes hear of people driving Mercedes Benzes getting into a scuffle after an accident. No social class is immune.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">I just wonder if we are increasingly stressed out. Frustrated with working long hours at the office, or no job at all. Or lousy pay while the bosses award themselves huge bonuses. Congestion and crowding as we go from one place to another. Noise all around us even when we reach home, because the damn town council keeps giving out <a id="return4" rel="nofollow" name="return4">getai</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/#foot4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[4]</span></a> permits....</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Others would put the blame on screen and TV violence. Exactly how media portrayal of violence affects social tendency to violence is not fully established, but it should be no surprise if there is a relationship to some degree. Even indirectly, as in audiences imbibing attitudes regarding fighting for one's sense of honour, or group loyalty right or wrong, can have an effect.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">I have long thought that Singapore over-regulates the depiction of sex and sexuality, and under-regulates the depiction of violence. Sure, people can be influenced by the depiction of sexual lives to adopt different sexual values, but rarely are there victims arising from those new sexual values. On the other hand, violence produces victims, almost by definition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Moreover, I see instances where our justice system tends to be too lenient on violence too. In an earlier article <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/arch_1999/yax-148.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pimp and the cabby</span></a>, I pointed out two court cases that occurred at the same time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">In one, a taxi driver tried to run down a pedestrian. Twice. He was given a sentence of 4 months' imprisonment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">In the other, a pimp was sentenced to 4 years in jail, twelve times longer than the taxi driver, someone whose actions could have killed another person. There was no suggestion that the pimp used coercion of any kind to run his business. His "boys" were willing sellers -- that's typical for male prostitution, unlike female prostitution where the power relationship is often unequal -- and his buyers were willing buyers. In other words, there were really no victims.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Besides the question of whether such a disparity in penalties strikes anyone as reasonable, there is also the question of why the police are devoting resources to chasing after victimless crimes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Yet righting the balance in law enforcement, needed though it is, is certainly not the whole answer. We have to identify and address the social causes. They will be many and complicated. First though, we must understand that violence is a symptom of social breakdown, when people feel hopeless or powerless, or just so frustrated with a zillion other things in their lives, they lose control at a snap.  <img src="/forums/10/images/bar_red.gif" alt="" width="4" height="12"></span></p>

              <p>Singapore's crime rate is low because,</p>
              <p>1) It's a small city, commit any crime there is no place to hide. Unless you are Mas Selamat, you can continue to escape the police indefinitely.</p>
              <p>2) The punishment meted out by the courts is harsh compared to other developed countries. That's why Singapore has one of the highest amount of prisons and prison inmates in the world.</p>
              <p>3) There are cultural and racial differences due to demographics.</p>

              <p>FORMER Home and Away actor <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bryan Wiseman</span> has told of the party culture behind the scenes on the TV soapie.</p>
              <p>The 40-year-old played Dr John Wilson on the Channel 7 show for five
              years until 2003. He said yesterday Jodi Gordon's recent drug scandal
              and Lincoln Lewis' sex tape affair were not isolated events.</p>
              <p>He claimed some actors snorted cocaine and said there was a prevalent party culture behind the scenes of the show.</p>
              <p>"I'm surprised the stories of sex, drugs and alcohol abuse haven't gotten out earlier," Wise<em>man said. </em></p>
              <p><em>"Drugs are common, apart from the older cast. </em></p>
              <p><em>"Generally speaking, the younger cast members come in, they like the party lifestyle and they have drugs offered to them. </em></p>
              <p><em>"I'd go to parties and nightclubs and I didn't ever have to pay for it. </em></p>
              <p><em>"I got addicted to it (cocaine) and it was very hard to come off the stuff. </em></p>
              <p><em>"I<span style="color: #ff0000;">t's part of the culture</span>, and especially if you're a younger cast member, you get caught up in it. </em></p>
              <p><em>"There are no role models. If they're in a series and suddenly shoot
              to fame, they're on the cover of TV Week and whatnot - it's very easy
              to get caught up in all of that. </em></p>
              <p><em>"These guys don't realise that they may come out of the show and never work again. It's commonplace. </em></p>
              <p><em>"Some of the kids would turn up, they hadn't been to bed all night, they didn't know their lines. </em></p>
              <p><em>"They'd say, 'I went out last night, had a few snorts, racked up,
              took some pingers, pills', that sort of stuff. It was very, very openly
              talked about.</em>"</p>
