                  Singapore but drivers are not one of them<br> <br> Apart from not blinking, other things that are missing from most
                  Singapore drivers are: not letting people into, or cross lanes and
                  any knowledge of the meaning of "defensive driving"</p>

                  but I didn't have to use my car horn ONCE. My first day back in
                  Singapore, and I had to use it FOUR TIMES IN ONE HOUR!! So when
                  people in Sydney complain about the drivers on the road, I tell
                  them to be thankful they aren't driving on Singapore

                  pretty much sums up Singapore's drivers.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Violence in Sim Lim Square, unit # 02-76</span></strong></p>
              <hr style="color: #f1fcff;">
              <blockquote>
              <div id="post_message_1292577">I just want to warn everyone to AVOID going to <strong>unit # 02-76 in Sim Lim Square</strong>. They are grotesque scammers that has the tendency to be physically violent to customers. I was one of their unfortunate victims. Their signboad says<strong> 'Evolution Gaming LLP'</strong>, but as I was researching on the net, they apparently regularly change their store name. They used to be called <strong>MH Electronics</strong>, or <strong>Mobile House Electronics</strong>. And a neighbouring store that's unit # 02-72 also used to be 'Evolution Gaming'. They were also called 'Compact Camera'. I've read a lot of complaints from that store too. <br><br>Anyway, here's what happened. My girlfiend and I went to Sim Lim to buy a PSP. I know, it was quite stupid of me to go there for a PSP. It's all over the net that the last place to buy a PSP is in Sim Lim. I went anyway, thinking it's "not gonna happen to me" (i was dead wrong). So we went to different shops to ask for prices. The prices we got were 360, and 340.. complete with all the necessary stuff like battery, 4G card, cable, case, and modification. When we got to <strong>unit # 02-76 (Evolution Gaming LLP)</strong>, they quoted us $308. That was too cheap.. but it was almost 9pm and I was just tired and wanted the PSP. So I said I'll take one. The sales guy was friendly. He's tall, fat, and had a lot of pimples on his face. He took our money and said he'll modify it in front of us. After the so-called modification, he showed the PSP to me... and it was lagging! He said the modification took much of the RAM and it needed an upgrade, and that we had to pay $200! Holy sh*t... and while he was selling the upgrade to me, he kept calling me 'my friend...'. That was just annoying. I said we don't have that kind of money, and we'd like to get our money back. From here, things got ugly. The store owner (tall, skinny, and also had a lot of pimples) started shouting at us, saying just take the PSP, the we're wasting his time, etc. And another guy tried to talk to us,this short little guy with glasses, squeaky voice, introduced as the store manager. He tried to explain about the upgrade. But we've heard enough. We just wanted our money back, and we were not leaving. Finally they said we could have our money back, but since the PSP has already been modified, we should pay the GST (wtf!). After much debate, I just said fine.. if that's what it takes to just leave this place, then ok. So they gave us our money, less gst (that's $21 - not bad, but still hurts). We were so pissed leaving the store. I decided to take a photo of the store premises so I could have a 'souvenir' for the event. Suddenly, this little guy with glasses (store manager, they say) started to slap me in the face! (I'm not sure if it was a slap or a punch.. looked like a punch, felt like a slap) He also shoulted at me with his small squeaky voice. I prepared to hit back, aiming at his small face.. but suddenly I see this tall lanky guy running from the store carrying a metal stool. And the fat pimply guy who tried to sell the PSP also came out running towards us too. The little guy's got backup! So now there's 3 of them, and one of me. I remember thinking, if I fight back, this is going to get ugly for me. But then, the short guy took a plastic chair and continued to hit me, as well as this tall guy with the metal stool! <strong>Unit # 02-76 Evolution Gaming LLP</strong> is situated at the corner of the floor. The beating continued until we reached the escalator. They hit me on the face, the arms, and body. My girlfriend was just shouting 'please stop!'. Suddenly they demanded for me to delete the photo.. i had no choice but to comply. After deleting (they continued to hit me by the way), Sim Lim security came in the scene. The little guy gave me one last hit on the body with his reliable plastic chair. After that, security called the police. The police came to talk to me, then went up to talk to the store owner (tall pimply guy). The guys that attacked me where no longer there (of course). We went to the police station, I gave a statement, they gave me a medical form, we went to the hospital to document the scratches I obtained from the attack. The police said that they were going to launch an investigation about it. <br><br>So now here I am writing about it. The net has got loads of warning stories like this about the scamming happening in Sim Lim. Let this be an additional story about it. I haven't actually read about any violence happening, so I think this is the first. <br><br>Reading up on the net, here's a few more stories/complains about<strong> unit #02-76 / Evolution Gaming LLP</strong> for scamming and bad service. <br><br>This one is when they were still called <strong>Mobile House Electronics Pte Ltd</strong> (signboard MH Electronics): <a href="http://forums.************.com.sg/showthread.php?t=1696186"><span style="color: #89c65d;">http://forums.************.com.sg/sh....php?t=1696186</span></a><br><br>Here's another one about <strong>#02-76</strong> where they have bad attitude: <a href="http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/archive/index.php/t-10687.html"><span style="color: #89c65d;">http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/...p/t-10687.html</span></a><br><br>Here's another one about<strong> Evolution Gamming LLP</strong>: <br><a href="http://imcomplicatedyetsosimple.blogspot.com/2007/12/scammer-from-sim-lim.html"><span style="color: #89c65d;">http://imcomplicatedyetsosimple.blog...m-sim-lim.html</span></a><br><br>And another one for<strong> Evolution Gaming LLP</strong>: <br><a href="http://forums.gameaxis.com/showthread.php?t=1476878&amp;highlight=Sim+lim+square"><span style="color: #89c65d;">http://forums.gameaxis.com/showthrea...Sim+lim+square</span></a><br><br>And another yet one...

              </span></p><hr>
              <p></p>
              <p><br><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">Suicide attempts hit an eight-year-high here last year. 300 such cases referred to hospital doctors last year.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">ROUGHLY one in three people who tried to commit suicide here last year was either a woman or a young girl between the ages of 15 and 24, a study by the National University Hospital has found.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Females made up 118 of the 316 would-be suicide cases seen last year by doctors at NUH, to which most such cases are referred.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Suicide attempts rose steadily over the preceding three years for this group.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Last year, suicide bids hit an eight-year high, according to a study by Professor Kua Ee Heok, head of psychological medicine at the National University of Singapore, NUS research fellow Clarice Hong and former NUH consultant psychiatrist Brian Ho.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although the population has also grown during the same period, the trend among girls and young women is worrying.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The study found that among girls under 19 who had tried to kill themselves, they were most likely to blame relationship problems, boy-girl problems and school stress.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Prof Kua said troubled relationships referred mostly to "quarrels in the family, especially bad parent-child relationships, where there are a lot of quarrels". Boy-girl problems could also result from family problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dr Clarice Hong said that in the Indian community, for example, parental objections to a relationship might provoke a suicide attempt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This was a factor in the Malay and Chinese communities too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Poor emotional resilience could also explain the rising numbers. She said: "The threshold of tolerance for suffering is not as high as before. I was wondering if it could be because of the weaker resilience of younger Singaporeans."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Young people had relationship problems in the past too, she said. "But why did they not take it so badly?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Impulse could be another factor, especially among adolescents. Another explanation could be that the extended family was dying out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Said Prof Kua: "Before, there was always someone around to talk to in a big family -- an aunt, for example. Now, more families live on their own, and a lot of the youngsters are latchkey kids.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">"They don't even talk to neighbours like before."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Due to this lack of communication at home, communication at school became all the more important.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There should be someone that students could talk to, because a suicide attempt was a cry for help.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Said Dr Hong: "In self-help groups in schools, they can learn from each other, or there could be a trained counsellor in school to go to."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">That is why the NUS department of psychological medicine hopes to set up a webpage within the next six months, and make it accessible to students. It will offer tips on dealing with stress, where to turn to for help, relaxation techniques and other information.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Prof Kua said family, teachers and friends were the best people to advise youngsters under stress. "When stress levels are high, teach them what they can do. More serious cases may need medical attention. They should see their general practitioner."</span></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">371 committed suicide last year</span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">THE number of people who succeeded in killing themselves last year came to 371 -- the third highest figure in a 20-year period.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">According to the Singapore Immigration and Registration, 1995 was the year with the highest number taking their own lives -- resulting in 401 suicides.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The second highest peak from 1979 to 1998 came in 1989, when 395 killed themselves. The lowest was in 1981, with 191 self-inflicted deaths. Last year, there were:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li> 
              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">50 suicides in the 50 to 59 age group, the highest in 10 years.</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">22 suicides in the 10 to 19 age group, compared with only nine in 1992.</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">76 suicides in the 20 to 29 age group, compared with a low of 57 in 1993.</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">66 suicides among those aged 30 to 39, nearly 20 fewer than the 85 recorded in 1997.</span> </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p><span>Overall, the trend indicates that not only are more young and elderly people thinking of or attempting suicide, but more are also ending up killing themselves.<br></span></p>

              <h1 id="story_title"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Suicide rate climbs despite good times</span></h1>
              <h2 id="story_byline"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Insight Down South<br>By SEAH CHIANG NEE</span></h2>
              <div id="story_content"><br>
              <p>A SURGING economy and promise of a brighter future have done little to prevent a decline of the city’s social ills, including a worsening suicide rate.</p>
              <p>Not only are there higher rates of divorces, bankruptcies and crime against senior citizens, but in a land awash with jobs and better pay, the number of people killing themselves has surged.</p>
              <p>The government reported 419 cases last year, or at least one suicide every day, compared to 346 in 2003.</p>
              <p>This was a jump of 21 per cent and is one of the highest in its post-independence history. It is the fourth straight rise in as many years. More people die from suicide than in accidents.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, too, is the profile of the suicidal.</p>
              <p>The Singaporeans who strived to end it all ranged from teenagers to grandfathers.</p>
              <p>But the largest group was men who were in the 40s, mostly made up of the 1965 independence generation. This rising trend is worrying the authorities.</p>
              <p>The other large group was women aged 50 and older. For every death there were seven attempted suicides.</p>
              <p>The gloomy statistics came shortly after Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had said that Singapore was in a “golden period”, referring to its prosperity during the past two years.</p>
              <p>For rich countries to register higher suicide rates than poorer ones is not a surprise by itself.</p>
              <p>Singapore isn’t doing too badly when compared to Japan and several advanced Western nations whose rates, despite better welfare help, are faring worse.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s leaders, however, have placed a higher emphasis on economic expansion over almost everything else on the basis that once you have achieved wealth, other problems can be resolved.</p>
              <p>For many years, it had worked well in a simpler world, but less so in today’s harsher competitive environment that frowns on welfarism.</p>
              <p>More jobs are eradicated; more businesses get restructured and life becomes more uncertain.</p>
              <p>Between 2000 and 2004, 1,723 people committed suicide or about 345 cases a year.</p>
              <p>The Samaritans, which operates a 24-hour distress hotline, handles some 135 calls a day from desperate people unable to resolve their problems.</p>
              <p>The number of calls has risen from 43,255 in 2005 to 49,025 in the past year with one in seven considered to be suicide risks.</p>
              <p>In perspective, Singapore hasn’t done badly against the developed world.</p>
              <p>In 2003, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Singapore had a suicide rate of 18 per 100,000 people (12 male and 6 female) and ranked 52nd of 100 countries surveyed.</p>
              <p>It was, however, ahead of more advanced nations like Japan (51 per 100,000), Belgium (40), Switzerland (37), France (35), Denmark (29) and Australia (26).</p>
              <p>Sadly, it is not just about statistics. Each abandoned life has its own tortured tale of sufferings that are not always about money - although financial stress remains a top cause.</p>
              <p>Overwhelming debts, neglect, family break-ups and poor health are some of the factors that push people to end their lives.</p>
              <p>For the younger set, it is mainly over broken love or inability to cope with their studies or broken homes.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s rapid success is achieved with a price. Life is a rat race for people who are at the bottom of the ladder.</p>
              <p>For a family man in his 40s who has been retrenched as a result of restructuring, it could be a fearful experience. Unlike other advanced countries, there is no unemployment help.</p>
              <p>“In Malaysia or Indonesia, when a person loses his job, he could go to the countryside and live off the land,” said a social worker. “Here there is no countryside to live off.”</p>
              <p>One of the saddest cases happened last year when an odd jobs labourer in his 40s killed himself by jumping in front of a speeding MRT train at Jurong.</p>
              <p>He had been unemployed for four months, relying on his wife’s S$500 monthly income to feed his family of four (with two teenage sons).</p>
              <p>As bills mounted to $1,000, the hapless man promised his wife he would look for the money.</p>
              <p>One night he gave $9 to his younger son and told him before leaving for his appointment with death, “Daddy is leaving for work, you have to look after mummy, you all have to take care.”</p>
              <p>At a time when Singapore was basking in prosperity, his tale stirred the very soul of the nation and public donations – amounting to S$500,000 - poured in for the bereaved family.</p>
              <p>“This speedy response shows that it is the people who are compassionate to its needs of their fellow beings rather than the government,” one letter writer said.</p>
              <p>Over the past year, the mass transit has become an avenue for committing suicide.</p>
              <p>Four took place within a period of six weeks last year-end with two of them video taped by witnesses and posted on YouTube.</p>
              <p>Why is the suicide rate higher in Singapore than a country like, say, Thailand when life is reported to be so much more comfortable?</p>
              <p>One explanation lies in the psyche of Singaporeans, who tend to be harder striving, less tolerant of failures and overly materialistic.</p>
              <p>As a result of high-pressured living, the economic growth hasn’t spread happiness to all hard-pressed Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Many citizens do not have enough retirement savings and have been advised to work beyond 65 years to survive in this expensive city.</p>

              <td class="georgia11 padcell8" colspan="2">I READ with dismay the article, 'Suicide figures up - 419 deaths last year' (ST, Aug 13).
              <p>Nevertheless, I am not surprised at the rising suicide figures and believe that it will continue to climb in the near future as I see many people facing difficulty coping with a stressful lifestyle deprived of much support.</p>
              <p>People belonging to the sandwiched generation especially face mounting pressures, mainly financial, and if they fail to see a way out of their problem, may attempt suicide. To them, living is tortuous and death seems like a permanent relief to all their problems which is but a myth. They will leave behind loved ones who not only will miss their presence but also have to live on with doubts of whether they are the ones at fault.</p>
              <p>It is common knowledge that our population faces mounting work pressure. Many work long hours and only go home to sleep. Weekends are also confined to indoor activity as they recuperate from a long week at work. There is hardly any work-life balance here. Most people's lives revolve around work.</p>
              <p>As families get smaller, the supportive reach of an extensive family network is also remote. Many also fail to have time to establish any meaningful friendships and may miss out on opportunities to confide their problems in someone. Many who have problems, especially men, will not seek out counsellors from nearby neighbourhood family service centres for counselling support, further compounding the issue.</p>
              <p>A close classmate of mine committed suicide at the tender age of 21. He suffered from an inferiority complex and family members also failed to understand him. After being discharged from the mental hospital, he hanged himself outside a church. As his classmates who helped him along the way, we were devastated and blamed ourselves for not doing enough to help him.</p>
              <p>I often questioned the quality of our counsellors in family service centres (FSCs), having worked in one myself a few years back as a social-work aide.</p>
              <p>Most workers there are young and trained in social work. It will be difficult for them to identify with the issues a middle-aged person is going through and also how he can earn the respect of the counsellee who is much more seasoned in life.</p>
              <p>FSCs need to deploy properly trained counsellors who are mature enough to deal with the issues of this critical age group. Hopefully, this will take some load off the suicide-prevention group Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) which continues to face manpower shortages.</p>
              <p>As Singapore progresses, many will also struggle to keep pace in a modern fast-paced society. Let us offer our shoulder if we see someone in need of a helping hand. You never know that your kind words of comfort may dissuade someone from thoughts of ending his life. It is when we take time to care for one another that we can say we are a First World nation.</p>

                  schools - operates in this manner by increasing its fees by 100 per
                  cent. (Letter to ST forum)<br> <br> Sept 13: Employers to buy medical insurance for foreign workers.

                  Instead of highlighting the hawkers, the 157th should do a survey
                  on rent increases, because rent represents a significant portion of
                  the total business costs. It should also cover the period of time
                  commencing from last year end till now, since a lot of land lords
                  (e.g. SMRT, JTC) increased the rent after the GST announcement in
                  November. 157th, please stop using smokescreens or scapegoats for

                  (RM7.70). Condensed milk, bubble tea and Campbell soup have become

The service was disrupted for seven hours but it was restored in stages and was fully functional again by 2.30pm the same day.

              <blockquote>
              <div>I just want to warn everyone to AVOID going to <strong>unit # 02-76 in Sim Lim Square</strong>. They are grotesque scammers that has the tendency to be physically violent to customers. I was one of their unfortunate victims. Their signboad says <strong>'Evolution Gaming LLP'</strong>, but as I was researching on the net, they apparently regularly change their store name. They used to be called <strong>MH Electronics</strong>, or <strong>Mobile House Electronics</strong>. And a neighbouring store that's unit # 02-72 also used to be 'Evolution Gaming'. They were also called 'Compact Camera'. I've read a lot of complaints from that store too.<br><br>Anyway, here's what happened. My girlfiend and I went to Sim Lim to buy a PSP. I know, it was quite stupid of me to go there for a PSP. It's all over the net that the last place to buy a PSP is in Sim Lim. I went anyway, thinking it's "not gonna happen to me" (i was dead wrong). So we went to different shops to ask for prices. The prices we got were 360, and 340.. complete with all the necessary stuff like battery, 4G card, cable, case, and modification. When we got to <strong>unit # 02-76 (Evolution Gaming LLP)</strong>, they quoted us $308. That was too cheap.. but it was almost 9pm and I was just tired and wanted the PSP. So I said I'll take one. The sales guy was friendly. He's tall, fat, and had a lot of pimples on his face. He took our money and said he'll modify it in front of us. After the so-called modification, he showed the PSP to me... and it was lagging! He said the modification took much of the RAM and it needed an upgrade, and that we had to pay $200! Holy sh*t... and while he was selling the upgrade to me, he kept calling me 'my friend...'. That was just annoying. I said we don't have that kind of money, and we'd like to get our money back. From here, things got ugly. The store owner (tall, skinny, and also had a lot of pimples) started shouting at us, saying just take the PSP, the we're wasting his time, etc. And another guy tried to talk to us,this short little guy with glasses, squeaky voice, introduced as the store manager. He tried to explain about the upgrade. But we've heard enough. We just wanted our money back, and we were not leaving. Finally they said we could have our money back, but since the PSP has already been modified, we should pay the GST (wtf!). After much debate, I just said fine.. if that's what it takes to just leave this place, then ok. So they gave us our money, less gst (that's $21 - not bad, but still hurts). We were so pissed leaving the store. I decided to take a photo of the store premises so I could have a 'souvenir' for the event. Suddenly, this little guy with glasses (store manager, they say) started to slap me in the face! (I'm not sure if it was a slap or a punch.. looked like a punch, felt like a slap) He also shoulted at me with his small squeaky voice. I prepared to hit back, aiming at his small face.. but suddenly I see this tall lanky guy running from the store carrying a metal stool. And the fat pimply guy who tried to sell the PSP also came out running towards us too. The little guy's got backup! So now there's 3 of them, and one of me. I remember thinking, if I fight back, this is going to get ugly for me. But then, the short guy took a plastic chair and continued to hit me, as well as this tall guy with the metal stool! <strong>Unit # 02-76 Evolution Gaming LLP</strong> is situated at the corner of the floor. The beating continued until we reached the escalator. They hit me on the face, the arms, and body. My girlfriend was just shouting 'please stop!'. Suddenly they demanded for me to delete the photo.. i had no choice but to comply. After deleting (they continued to hit me by the way), Sim Lim security came in the scene. The little guy gave me one last hit on the body with his reliable plastic chair. After that, security called the police. The police came to talk to me, then went up to talk to the store owner (tall pimply guy). The guys that attacked me where no longer there (of course). We went to the police station, I gave a statement, they gave me a medical form, we went to the hospital to document the scratches I obtained from the attack. The police said that they were going to launch an investigation about it.<br><br>So now here I am writing about it. The net has got loads of warning stories like this about the scamming happening in Sim Lim. Let this be an additional story about it. I haven't actually read about any violence happening, so I think this is the first.<br><br>Reading up on the net, here's a few more stories/complains about <strong>unit #02-76 / Evolution Gaming LLP</strong> for scamming and bad service.<br><br>This one is when they were still called <strong>Mobile House Electronics Pte Ltd</strong> (signboard MH Electronics): <a rel="nofollow" href="http://forums.************.com.sg/showthread.php?t=1696186"><span style="color: #89c65d;">http://forums.************.com.sg/sh....php?t=1696186</span></a><br><br>Here's another one about <strong>#02-76</strong> where they have bad attitude: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/archive/index.php/t-10687.html"><span style="color: #89c65d;">http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/...p/t-10687.html</span></a><br><br>Here's another one about <strong>Evolution Gamming LLP</strong>:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://imcomplicatedyetsosimple.blogspot.com/2007/12/scammer-from-sim-lim.html"><span style="color: #89c65d;">http://imcomplicatedyetsosimple.blog...m-sim-lim.html</span></a><br><br>And another one for <strong>Evolution Gaming LLP</strong>:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://forums.gameaxis.com/showthread.php?t=1476878&amp;amp;highlight=Sim+lim+square"><span style="color: #89c65d;">http://forums.gameaxis.com/showthrea...Sim+lim+square</span></a><br><br>And another yet one...

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Singapore's Dirty Little Secret? An Australian is shocked by the treatment of maids in Singapore:</strong></span></p>
              <div><a rel="nofollow" name="8231178884466440282"></a><blockquote>
              <h3><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sammizheng.blogspot.com/">Maid Abuse - No Longer A Dirty Little Secret</a></h3>
              <div>There are so many stories circulating the internet, of disregard for basic human rights, people suffering and abuse by authority. But the most recent reports of maid abuse in Singapore has left my heart aching for the victim.<br><br>According to staistics from the Ministry of Manpower, the number of substantiated maid abuse cases handled by the police dropped from 157 cases in 1997 to 68 last year. Now we need to find ways to eradicate this dirty little secret forever.<br><br>In the most recent and disgusting episode, 18-year-old mother of one, Nur Rizan Mohd Sazali was yesterday jailed for 26 months - 12 months for forcibly extracting the two teeth of, and another 14 months for pouring boiling wax on the maid. She has been dubbed by the press as "The Dentist".<br><br>The maid from Indonesia was accused of stealing from her employers. Although she kept protesting her innocence, 29-year old Ms Badingah was thought to be lying. This resulted in the ad-hoc dentistry, which saw her lose two of her front teeth, by the teenage mother wielding a pair of pliers.<br><br>Ms Badingah's employer, 25-year old Elsa Elyana Said, forcibly held the maid's head and forced her mouth open while the extraction took place.<br><br>Elsa pleaded guilty to punching the maid and assisting in the torture. She will be sentenced on Oct 16. She lived with Nur Rizan, as well as the teenager's mother and brother, in a flat in Jalan Minyak, off Chin Swee Road.<br><br>The series of abuse and torture that Ms Badingah endured at the hands of these four sadists, took place between June 2 and July 26 last year.<br><br>20-year old Muhammad Iz'aan was jailed for six weeks after having pleaded guilty to caning Ms Badingah. He is Nur Rizan's brother.<br><br>Muhammad Iz'aan caned the maid in a very bizarre torturous kind of punishment. She had been ordered to stand facing the door for a whole night with one leg off the ground and holding her ears. Every time that she dropped her leg, she was caned. The reason for this punishment is still unknown.<br><br>38-year old Maselly Abdul Aziz is the mother of the two convicted. She pleaded guilty, but had her pleae rejected, because she had initially claimed that all the accusations were lies.<br><br>According to public prosecutors, the abuse started just three months after Elsa 'borrowed' Ms Badingah from her mother's apartment to work in the Jalan Minyak household.<br><br>In another incident, the four accused had accused the maid of stealing their money and other small valuables. After Ms Badingah denied stealing their cellphones, Nur Rizan and her brother ordered her to take off her blouse. They then tied up her wrists with a bathrobe sash, and then Nur Rizan poured hot liquid wax from a candle over her back and head.<br><br>Ms Badingah, who had serious and extensive injuries, feared her abusers so much and for her life, that at one time, she actually jumped out of the kitchen window of the second-storey apartment and ran for her life.<br><br>Finally, the Defence lawyer said his clients were extremely remorseful for their actions. He said the case had brought immense shame to the family - well, doh... <strong>it's a little late for remorse now, isn't it??</strong></div>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">EIA reports <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"smuggler friendly climate" of Singapore threatens</span> efforts of the United States to protect its borders from environmentally harmful substances.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The nongovernmental Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) caused a stir at the meeting with its revelation of elaborate CFC smuggling operations spanning three continents and including Singapore, South Africa, and the United States.</p>
              <p>The report, entitled “Lost in Transit – Global CFC Smuggling Trends and the Need for Faster Phase Out” is based on undercover investigations by EIA personnel. It reveals the global nature of the illegal trade and exposes CFC smuggling operations coordinated by Singaporean dealers who seek to deceive U.S. authorities and dump illegal CFCs on the American market.</p>
              <p>The EIA report shows how Singaporean companies offer to sell CFCs to the United States, mislead the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and engineer elaborate international trading schemes to avoid U.S. enforcement efforts.</p>
              <p>EIA campaigner Alexander von Bismarck says, “Over the last decade, the United States has been working hard and effectively to stop the illegal import of these dangerous chemicals. <strong>Our investigations suggest that these efforts are now threatened by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sophisticated smuggling operations in Singapore and other transit countries.”</span></strong></p>
              <p>EIA undercover investigators met with Singaporean businesses involved in such illegal practices and revealed the role which transit countries play in this trade by facilitating the diversion of CFCs onto the black market.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore and other transit points in the illegal CFC trade such as Dubai do not sufficiently control or monitor the movement of CFCs through their ports, and companies are able to operate illicit trading schemes with minimal interference. One particular company, Leempeng Enterprise Pte Ltd offered EIA investigators a shipment of CFCs complete with false paperwork and offered to conceal the goods behind uncontrolled chemicals to avoid detection.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>In May, President George W. Bush signed a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore, which the U.S. Congress ratified in September. The EIA report suggests that the smuggler friendly climate of Singapore threatens the efforts of the United States to protect its borders from environmentally harmful substances.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large; color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Gang violence by girls on the rise</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #008000; font-family: Courier New;">They dress, fight and commit crimes very much like male<br><br></span></em></strong>GIRL gangs are making a comeback, with an attitude and aggression that bear an unsettling resemblance to boy gangs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They dress like the boys, they fight like boys, even the crimes they commit are what the boy gangs are notorious for: rioting, robbing and extorting money, all offences which carry jail sentences.</p>
              <p>One of the five detectives interviewed for this report, offered this snapshot of today's girl thugs: "In the past, girls broke the law in such areas as unlawful assembly, fights over men, and in staring incidents at public places such as discos.</p>
              <p>"Now, they are doing what boy gangs do: breaking into cars to steal, threatening people and demanding money from schoolmates and neighbours."</p>
              <p>Official figures show a disturbing rise in teenage girls committing extortions, robberies and other crimes.</p>
              <p>In the first six months of this year, girls were involved in: 16 robberies, up from five last year; 25 thefts, up from 21; 236 shoplifting cases, up from 188, and 15 extortion cases, up from 10. In 1996, there were no reports of girls involved in extortion cases.</p>
              <p>A total of 310 girls were arrested in the first six months of this year, compared with 273 in the first half of last year.</p>
              <p>The detectives said that the pace picked up last September. They now make two to three arrests a week. Before, one a week was about average. Most of these girl gangsters are between 13 and 17 years old, although the police have come across girls as young as 10.</p>
              <p>Police officers have sometimes mistaken them for boys because of their "short hair, men's shirt, trousers and Doc Martens shoes".</p>
              <p>And when they fight, it is with a vengeance.</p>
              <p>"Before, the girls would scratch and pull each other's hair. Now, they punch, kick and scratch their victims with sharp objects such as small knives. In some cases, they attack with stiletto-heeled shoes, leaving a bloody mess."</p>
              <p>Compared with their forerunners, the Butterfly and Rose gangs of the early Sixties, the gangs today give themselves "cutesy" names like: Xiao Ding Dang (Little Doraemon, a Japanese cartoon character) and Xiao Tian Tian (Little Candy, another Japanese cartoon character).</p>
              <p>They operate in gangs with between 15 and 20 members. Membership comes easy too: Initiation rituals are not required. There's no need to make offerings to Guan Kong (the Chinese God of War), for example. They just wear the same shoes, coloured wrist bands or sport similar tattoos.</p>
              <p>Girl gangs often pick on neighbours or schoolmates.</p>
              <p>Said a detective: "They would extort money from other girls, after accusing them of staring or spreading rumours about them."</p>
              <p>Counsellors who have dealt with these girls say the lack of parental control and attention is the main cause of this rising tide of thuggery.</p>
              <p>Most of the girls are from homes with a history of family abuse or where the parents have marital problems.</p>
              <p>Their parents tend to shrug off the misdeeds, and often ask the police to let the girls off because "they're just kids", the detectives said.</p>
              <p>Even after the girls are convicted and sent to homes or placed on probation, many parents refuse to see that their child is developing into a full-fledged criminal.</p>
              <p>Counsellor Lindy Ong, 35, who has set up a support group in a church for parents with problem teens, said: "Some just leave their kids with us and expect us to perform miracles. They don't even turn up for counselling sessions."</p>
              <p>In a research bulletin issued by the Subordinate Courts, a court official said: "If the young person's undesirable values and erroneous methods of solving her problems are not corrected early, there will be dire consequences."</p>

              <div><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Terror Road Rage Case in Singapore</span></strong></div>
              <div>HANGING on to the bonnet of a speeding car as it kept swerving to throw you off is something that happens only in the movies.<br><br>For two minutes yesterday afternoon, he did just that.<br><br>The reason he ended up on the bonnet is even more shocking - it was an argument over a scratch.<br><br>Luckily for Mr Koh, 36, he escaped with only abrasions.<br><br>The sales executive was walking back to his Toyota Wish which was parked on Tembeling Road, near Joo Chiat.<br><br>He recalled: 'I had just collected a cheque from a client and was walking back to my car to drive off for lunch.<br><br>'From a distance, I saw a man walking pass the right side of my car.<br><br>'I thought I saw him scratching the right passenger door with his car keys.'<br><br>When Mr Koh reached his car, he found a 15cm scratch on his silver Wish which he bought new two years ago.<br><br>The man who scratched Mr Koh's car got into a black Nissan Cefiro which was parked behind Mr Koh's.<br><br>Both cars were in parallel parking lots.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'By the time I reached my car, the man was already trying to get out of the parking lot.<br><br>'I tapped on the bonnet to get the driver's attention.<br><br>'But he kept inching his car forward even though I signalled to him to stop. I had to keep stepping back in order not get hit.<br><br>'All of a sudden, the driver surged forward and I had no time to react. As a result, I slumped forward on the car's bonnet.'<br><br>The car did not stop and Mr Koh had to hold on to the bonnet so as not to fall off.<br><br>The Nissan drove about 15m towards the junction of Tembeling Road and East Coast Road.<br><br>There, the driver slowed down to make a left turn to get on to East Coast Road.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'I kept yelling at the driver to stop. But it was no use. I couldn't really see his face because of the glare from the front windscreen.<br><br>'The windows were shut, so I don't think he could hear me.'<br><br>After the Nissan got on to East Coast Road, the driver tried to shake Mr Koh off.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'He kept swerving left and right after he turned left on to East Coast Road.<br><br>'I couldn't do anything except to grip the bonnet very tightly and shouted at him to stop.<br><br>'I remembered turning my head back as he sped on. I saw the back of a lorry and the Nissan slowed down to avoid hitting the lorry.'<br><br>About 200m after getting on to East Coast Road, the Nissan brushed against a motorcycle which was travelling on the left lane of the two-lane road.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'The driver continued moving ahead even after the Nissan brushed against a motorcycle. Then, it turned left towards Still Road.<br><br>'After that, I couldn't hang on to the car any more and I fell off the bonnet.'<br><br>Mr Koh landed on the road and rolled onto the middle lane of Still Road and almost got hit by a despatch rider when he rolled into his lane.<br><br>The despatch rider, Mr Mohd Shahril, 32, thought that an 'object had came into his path'.<br><br>Mr Shahril, who was on Still Road travelling towards Eunos, said: 'I was surprised when I found out that the 'object' was actually a man. If I had not braked in time, the both of us would surely be hurt.'<br><br>Mr Koh finally came to a stop near a bus stop.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'My chin hit the ground even though I tried to use my arms to cushion the fall. It was very painful and I couldn't move.<br><br>'Luckily, a motorcyclist came by to help me. Some other people from the bus stop also came to help.'<br><br>Mr Shahril said he does not know who was more crazy - the driver of the fleeing car or the man who held on to the bonnet.<br><br>He said: 'From the corner of my eye, I could see and hear the screeching sound the speeding car was making. The driver didn't even slow down as he entered the filter lane.<br><br>'The driver is crazy because the man could have been dragged under the wheels of his car.'<br><br>Those who had helped Mr Koh took him to the bus stop and called for an ambulance. He was taken to Changi General Hospital.<br><br>Mr Koh suffered abrasions to both his arms and his knees. His left shirt pocket was torn and his pants were also torn at the knees.<br><br>Mr Koh recalled that the driver of the Nissan wore a blue T-shirt with blue shorts, but couldn't make out his appearance as he only saw the driver from a distance.<br><br>But Mr Koh said the driver was a short and plump man in his 40s.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'Scratching my car was a small matter. I only wanted to talk to him about it. But what he did could have cost me my life.'<br><br>He made a police report at the accident and emergency ward of CGH.<br><br>Mr Koh's wife, Madam S Chong, 36, said the Nissan driver's behaviour was 'outrageous'.<br><br>She was having lunch when her husband called her while he was in the ambulance to CGH.<br><br>Madam Chong said: 'At first, I thought he was joking as my husband likes to joke a lot. As he could still talk to me on the phone, I knew he wasn't too badly hurt.<br><br>The Kohs have two children aged 4 and 8.<br><br>A passer-by gave Mr Koh the licence plate number of the Nissan.<br><br>He said: 'It all happened so fast that I didn't have time to see the car plate number.<br><br>'Luckily, there were witnesses who saw what happened.'<br><br>The police said they were informed of the incident at about 1pm.<br><br>They are investigating the matter which involves a car driver, a motorcyclist and a pedestrian.<br><br>A similar incident happened on 9 Apr. Mr Alex Lim was driving his girlfriend home for dinner, but along Paterson Road, his red Mazda was involved in a minor collision with a taxi.<br><br>Both drivers then parked along Scotts Road and got out of their vehicles. An argument followed.<br><br>Cabby Lee Yuet Kong, who was carrying a passenger at the time, allegedly got back into his taxi and tried to drive off.<br><br>Mr Lim, a finacial adviser, wanting to get Lee's particulars, stood in front of the cab, but Lee reportedly drove away, throwing him onto the bonnet.<br><br>He later allegedly braked abruptly, causing Mr Lim to fall backwards and hit his head on the ground.<br><br>Mr Lim died on 13 May.<br><br>Lee, a 68-year-old relief driver, has been charged with causing grievous hurt with a rash act.</div>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Alex Lim's car and the taxi had a small collision along Paterson Road on 9 April 2007. A little ahead, at Scotts Road, both of them pulled over as is normal practice, to exchange drivers' identification. An argument broke out and Lee, the taxi driver, refused to provide Lim with his details. He got back into his cab intending to drive off. Lim tried to stop him by positioning himself in front of the taxi.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Lee drove straight into Lim, throwing the latter onto the bonnet. Then he stopped suddenly, throwing Lim forward onto the road. Not only did Lim's girlfriend witness this, apparently so did a passenger in Lee's taxi.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Alex Lim, aged 30, and a financial advisor, has been in a coma since. He's had a part of his brain removed.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> <br>In the early hours of last Monday, just outside a Clarke Quay bar, an off-duty bar manager (from a different bar) was attacked. Eugene Chua was so brutally beaten he died in hospital 2 days later. Exactly who did this and why has not been revealed but the police have arrested 2 persons in connection with the </span><a id="return2" rel="nofollow" name="return2"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">crime</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;">, and are investigating. </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#foot2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">[2]</span></span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">By all accounts, Eugene Chua was very much liked. His boss described him as "a small, spunky, affable and hardworking guy", and his premature death at age 32 was deeply mourned.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">24 hours prior to that savage incident, six teenagers were attacked by 16 young men near the Esplanade. The six claimed that the fight, which included vulgarities and racial taunts, was unprovoked. One of the six, Chan Voon Ho, aged 17, was so badly beaten that he suffered multiple fractures on his face and </span><a id="return3" rel="nofollow" name="return3"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">lost nearly all</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> his front teeth.</span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#foot3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">[3]</span></span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The police are now looking for the 16 other guys. Whether it will be classified as causing grievous hurt, rioting or some other offence is too early to say.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Then we have stories of schoolgirls engaging in "happy slapping", a form of bullying, where a group gangs up on a victim, strip and beat her and record everything on video to be uploaded onto the internet. Such brazen behaviour, I can hardly imagine.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">* * * * *</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> <br>For some years now, I have been disturbed by how quickly Singaporeans resort to violence. Bar fights are common, as is road rage, but even if you're nowhere near a bar or on the road, you can still be beaten to pulp just by looking at the wrong person. "Staring" incidents, a marker of immaturity, can escalate into running battles within minutes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Staring comes out of an animalistic instinct, where one party uses his eyes to establish his social rank over the other. The one who turns away first concedes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In young men, with their testosterone impulses, self-control is already lower than other age groups, but when we stir in low self-esteem, then the challenge is perceived even more acutely. All the more, the staring party, whether initiator or responder, cannot afford to back down. That is why staring incidents leading to fights are typically reported among the less educated or the less economically well-off.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">That being the case, a widening income gap and increasing financial stress for the lower half of society does not bode well at all.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Road rage, on the other hand, involves the better off and the well-educated too. We sometimes hear of people driving Mercedes Benzes getting into a scuffle after an accident. No social class is immune.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">I just wonder if we are increasingly stressed out. Frustrated with working long hours at the office, or no job at all. Or lousy pay while the bosses award themselves huge bonuses. Congestion and crowding as we go from one place to another. Noise all around us even when we reach home, because the damn town council keeps giving out </span><a id="return4" rel="nofollow" name="return4"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">getai</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#foot4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">[4]</span></span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> permits....</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Others would put the blame on screen and TV violence. Exactly how media portrayal of violence affects social tendency to violence is not fully established, but it should be no surprise if there is a relationship to some degree. Even indirectly, as in audiences imbibing attitudes regarding fighting for one's sense of honour, or group loyalty right or wrong, can have an effect.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">I have long thought that Singapore over-regulates the depiction of sex and sexuality, and under-regulates the depiction of violence. Sure, people can be influenced by the depiction of sexual lives to adopt different sexual values, but rarely are there victims arising from those new sexual values. On the other hand, violence produces victims, almost by definition.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Moreover, I see instances where our justice system tends to be too lenient on violence too. In an earlier article </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/arch_1999/yax-148.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The pimp and the cabby</span></span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;">, I pointed out two court cases that occurred at the same time.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In one, a taxi driver tried to run down a pedestrian. Twice. He was given a sentence of 4 months' imprisonment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In the other, a pimp was sentenced to 4 years in jail, twelve times longer than the taxi driver, someone whose actions could have killed another person. There was no suggestion that the pimp used coercion of any kind to run his business. His "boys" were willing sellers -- that's typical for male prostitution, unlike female prostitution where the power relationship is often unequal -- and his buyers were willing buyers. In other words, there were really no victims.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Besides the question of whether such a disparity in penalties strikes anyone as reasonable, there is also the question of why the police are devoting resources to chasing after victimless crimes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Yet righting the balance in law enforcement, needed though it is, is certainly not the whole answer. We have to identify and address the social causes. They will be many and complicated. First though, we must understand that violence is a symptom of social breakdown, when people feel hopeless or powerless, or just so frustrated with a zillion other things in their lives, they lose control at a snap.  <img src="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/images/bar_red.gif" alt="" width="4" height="12"></span></span></p>

              <div><br>
              <p>A SURGING economy and promise of a brighter future have done
                                      little to prevent a decline of the city’s social ills, including a
                                      worsening suicide rate.</p>
              <p>Not only are there higher rates of divorces, bankruptcies and
                                      crime against senior citizens, but in a land awash with jobs and
                                      better pay, the number of people killing themselves has surged.</p>
              <p>The government reported 419 cases last year, or at least one
                                      suicide every day, compared to 346 in 2003.</p>
              <p>This was a jump of 21 per cent and is one of the highest in its
                                      post-independence history. It is the fourth straight rise in as
                                      many years. More people die from suicide than in accidents.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, too, is the profile of the suicidal.</p>
              <p>The Singaporeans who strived to end it all ranged from teenagers
                                      to grandfathers.</p>
              <p>But the largest group was men who were in the 40s, mostly made
                                      up of the 1965 independence generation. This rising trend is
                                      worrying the authorities.</p>
              <p>The other large group was women aged 50 and older. For every
                                      death there were seven attempted suicides.</p>
              <p>The gloomy statistics came shortly after Minister Mentor Lee
                                      Kuan Yew had said that Singapore was in a “golden period”,
                                      referring to its prosperity during the past two years.</p>
              <p>For rich countries to register higher suicide rates than poorer
                                      ones is not a surprise by itself.</p>
              <p>Singapore isn’t doing too badly when compared to Japan and
                                      several advanced Western nations whose rates, despite better
                                      welfare help, are faring worse.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s leaders, however, have placed a higher emphasis on
                                      economic expansion over almost everything else on the basis that
                                      once you have achieved wealth, other problems can be resolved.</p>
              <p>For many years, it had worked well in a simpler world, but less
                                      so in today’s harsher competitive environment that frowns on
                                      welfarism.</p>
              <p>More jobs are eradicated; more businesses get restructured and
                                      life becomes more uncertain.</p>
              <p>Between 2000 and 2004, 1,723 people committed suicide or about
                                      345 cases a year.</p>
              <p>The Samaritans, which operates a 24-hour distress hotline,
                                      handles some 135 calls a day from desperate people unable to
                                      resolve their problems.</p>
              <p>The number of calls has risen from 43,255 in 2005 to 49,025 in
                                      the past year with one in seven considered to be suicide risks.</p>
              <p>In perspective, Singapore hasn’t done badly against the
                                      developed world.</p>
              <p>In 2003, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Singapore had
                                      a suicide rate of 18 per 100,000 people (12 male and 6 female) and
                                      ranked 52nd of 100 countries surveyed.</p>
              <p>It was, however, ahead of more advanced nations like Japan (51
                                      per 100,000), Belgium (40), Switzerland (37), France (35), Denmark
                                      (29) and Australia (26).</p>
              <p>Sadly, it is not just about statistics. Each abandoned life has
                                      its own tortured tale of sufferings that are not always about money
                                      - although financial stress remains a top cause.</p>
              <p>Overwhelming debts, neglect, family break-ups and poor health
                                      are some of the factors that push people to end their lives.</p>
              <p>For the younger set, it is mainly over broken love or inability
                                      to cope with their studies or broken homes.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s rapid success is achieved with a price. Life is a
                                      rat race for people who are at the bottom of the ladder.</p>
              <p>For a family man in his 40s who has been retrenched as a result
                                      of restructuring, it could be a fearful experience. Unlike other
                                      advanced countries, there is no unemployment help.</p>
              <p>“In Malaysia or Indonesia, when a person loses his job, he could
                                      go to the countryside and live off the land,” said a social worker.
                                      “Here there is no countryside to live off.”</p>
              <p>One of the saddest cases happened last year when an odd jobs
                                      labourer in his 40s killed himself by jumping in front of a
                                      speeding MRT train at Jurong.</p>
              <p>He had been unemployed for four months, relying on his wife’s
                                      S$500 monthly income to feed his family of four (with two teenage
                                      sons).</p>
              <p>As bills mounted to $1,000, the hapless man promised his wife he
                                      would look for the money.</p>
              <p>One night he gave $9 to his younger son and told him before
                                      leaving for his appointment with death, “Daddy is leaving for work,
                                      you have to look after mummy, you all have to take care.”</p>
              <p>At a time when Singapore was basking in prosperity, his tale
                                      stirred the very soul of the nation and public donations –
                                      amounting to S$500,000 - poured in for the bereaved family.</p>
              <p>“This speedy response shows that it is the people who are
                                      compassionate to its needs of their fellow beings rather than the
                                      government,” one letter writer said.</p>
              <p>Over the past year, the mass transit has become an avenue for
                                      committing suicide.</p>
              <p>Four took place within a period of six weeks last year-end with
                                      two of them video taped by witnesses and posted on YouTube.</p>
              <p>Why is the suicide rate higher in Singapore than a country like,
                                      say, Thailand when life is reported to be so much more
                                      comfortable?</p>
              <p>One explanation lies in the psyche of Singaporeans, who tend to
                                      be harder striving, less tolerant of failures and overly
                                      materialistic.</p>
              <p>As a result of high-pressured living, the economic growth hasn’t
                                      spread happiness to all hard-pressed Singaporeans.</p>

                                      been advised to work beyond 65 years to survive in this expensive
                                      city.</p>
