              <p>ah, but your online person intrigues me.</p>
              <p>for a regular contributor to this forum even i do consider that
              this forum is nothing worth more to read than a Strait Times
              newspaper, your persistent and constant contributions on any news
              that protrayed Oz in a bad light is something that left me
              wondering about your motivation and perhaps, hidden anguish that is
              eating you up from within.</p>
              <p>Get proper and competent advices. take to a counsellor if
              possible (see number below). i know it is hard especially for
              a middle age man like you to work in sg and support your family,
              and perhaps self-dillusion is an avenue for you to pacify yourself,
              channelling your frustration into this forum from your failed
              emigration attempt, which you did mention that u HAD obtained an Oz
              immigration form before.</p>
