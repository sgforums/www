              <p>So you're agreeing with me? but yet playing the number game? Do OZ have workers who don't get their pay on time? and have protest in their M.O.M(i don't know what it is called in OZ).?</p>
              <p>Do OZ citizens need to starve when they're out of Job?</p>
              <p>Do OZ citizens get priority compared to foreigners?</p>
              <p>Do OZ citizens male citizens need to spend 2 years of cheap labours?</p>
              <p>Do OZ citizens need to be pwned so badly by their government telling them that their wages is too high and thus uncompetitive?</p>
              <p>etc etc....</p>

              "kid gloves" treatment of sex criminals has come under consistent fire
              from crime victim advocates, who say notorious offenders have been
              given soft treatment, including: <br><br>DAVID Leslie Sims, the rapist
              chef, who walked from court after being convicted of breaking into a
              Melbourne woman's home and raping her twice. <br><br>PEDOPHILE
              Catholic school principal Marist Brother Gerard Joseph McNamara, 67,
              was spared jail for sexually abusing seven male pupils aged 11 to 14 in
              the early 1970s. <br><br>KEITH George Ryrie, who was sentenced to hang
              for raping and killing a girl, 5, in 1966, but whose sentence was
              commuted to 50 years, then a 26-year minimum, and who has been back in
              the community since 1993. <br><br>SERIAL rapist William Craig Forde,
              whose victims include a mother he raped 22 times, was given an
              indefinite sentence to be reviewed in 17 years. <br><br>Rape has a
              25-year maximum jail sentence, sexual penetration of a child aged 10 to
              16 under the offender's care has a 15-year maximum, and offences while
              not in offenders' care have a 10-year maximum. <br><br>But for the five years to 2005-06, the most anyone has received for rape as a principal offence was 20 years. <br><br>And 12 per cent of those, or 21 convicted rapists over the period, received no jail time. <br><br>The average jail time for rapists given a custodial sentence was five years - or one-fifth of the maximum sentence. <br><br>The average sentence given for pedophilia offences was also one-fifth or less of the maximum. </em></p>

              climbed sharply. Police had to deal a total of 4000 cases in the
              first 3 months of this year. But don't worry our Home Affairs
              Minister has come up with a brilliant solution to reduce the number
              of cases our police have to handle:<br> <br>
              <div><em>"The ministry will also consider <strong>making</strong> <strong>borrowing from loansharks an offence</strong>."</em></div>
              <div><em>- DPM Wong Kan Seng.[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Crime/Story/A1Story20090417-135750.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></em></div>
              <div><em>"This would be good news for us. If the police arrest
              those who borrow, they won't dare to report us when we harass
              them," - Loanshark who welcomes the move[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Free/Story/STIStory_214945.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">,</span></div>
              <div>If you still don't understand how brilliant this solution is,
              let me explain. The police has to handle so many cases of
              loansharking because the victims go to the police for help. By
              criminalising borrowing from loansharks, the victims of loanshark
              harassment now cannot go to the police for help because they
              themselves will be arrested for borrowing from the loansharks. The
              police will see a sharp drop in the number of cases and the govt
              can say the problem is solved! Briliant! Bravo! Now victims of
              loansharks have to suffer quietly. This will free up vast amounts
              of resources - there will be more police to handle those pesky
              opposition members and peaceful protestors who break our new our
              public order laws. I thought sending our old folks to JB was the
              best idea for the year -I was wrong.... this one is a lot more
              brilliant!</div>

              <p>hmm... filming an illegal event is criminalized, borrowing money
              from illegal loansharks may be made a criminal offense.. What's
              next? Maybe they'll penalize victims from rape, theft, murder.. etc
              in future.</p>

              <p>I liken this to "blaming female rape victims for dressing

              to dress sexily.</p>

              <p>Why not extend this superb idea to all cases?<br> <br> Make everyone who makes a police report post a bond of $10k. It
              will be returned to the victim only when the perpetrator has been
              found guilty by the courts.<br> <br> A more brilliant solution is to charge a fee for using law
              enforcement services. Want that robber caught? Pay $3k to the
              police. Want loanshark caught? Pay $5k. Can pay by CPF and
              installments also.<br> <br> These solutions will reduce the official crime rates and make
              Singapore the safest city in the world!</p>

              problems.<br> <br> Because the people and opposition are brilliant to give them this

              <p>Dr Ong Seh Hong who borrowed 60K (the equivalent of an annual
              pay of an ordinary Singaporean) from Ming Yi. He probably delayed
              the payment to the hospital until he knew he has been exposed by
              Ming Yi.<br> <br> Bravo of Ming Yi to drag this greedy PAP MP into the dirt. He knew
              that the PAP wants to take over his hospital organization to
              service the lucrative healthcare tourism (same reason for Khaw to
              want to kick old Singaporeans out to JB).<br> <br> Ming Yi should do the next best thing: to declare himself as a
              loanshark who cannot say 'NO' and kill this greedy MP Ong once and
              for all.</p>

              e.g. buy air-con, buy handphone, go french cuisine holidays.<br> <br> therefore to help us save money, they make it illegal to borrow
              lor. oso help police save some work.<br> <br> watch out for 154th spin on why sinkies borrow money fr loan

              <p>i have a good idea.<br> <br> reduce the workload and most importantly make big money by imposing
              a service fee for calling the police. they can then employ more
              staffs to collect the fees; a brillant win-win idea, yes?</p>

              <p>Making borrowing from loanshark illegal, I see.<br> <br> What a clever way to free PAP from its responsibility to the
              society without finding out why more and more are resorting to this
              type of credit.<br> <br> Better solution for Wong Kan Seng is since loansharks are doing a
              roaring business, lets beat them to it ... just like PAP beats
              illegal 4D operators hands down.<br> <br> Well if you don't remember, in the 70's illegal 4D operators were
              rampant and PAP constantly raided them. Then a brilliant idea came
              to PAP, lets create state-run 4Ds betting franchises.<br> <br> Now you can see them all around. And PAP and some critics are
              worried the IRs will bring a gambling scourge to Singapore.<br> <br> Open ya eyes! For that matter, these 4D outlets partly or even
              largely explain why loanshark business is booming in
              Singapore.<br> <br> So you see that's how PAP "resolved" the betting problem by making
              it legal, hehe. No wonder it is praised around the world for being
              such a great government.<br> <br> So I am sure PAP with its brilliant advisers will come up with
              something like that.<br> <br> The news already reported that permits have been issued to high
              interest money lenders when formerly such permits were
              refused.<br> <br> PAP just have to impose a high licence fee or even get DBS into the
              same act to reap from this business and thus PAP will also have
              "resolved" this loanshark problem.<br> <br> Hey in the US it was such high-interest loans through credit cards
              that did their economy in; here PAP might well think otherwise.</p>

              <p>Simple but yet brilliant analysis by lucky ! lol<br> <br> And perhaps PM,MM and SM should pool their wealth and start a
              scheme that provides loans to PAP MPs and grass-roots supporters.
              Their combined wealth should be more than 200M $ ! The other multi
              Million $ ministers can also contribute to make loans available to
              all PAP members. Such loans should be interest-free, repayable over
              20 to 30 years and of course whilst serving party interests.<br> This is a lot better than having PAP members borrowing from monks
              or loansharks which is not good for PAP's image and it is perfectly
              LEEgal. lol</p>

              <p>Whether or not it is a good idea depends on the composition of
              borrowers. Are they mostly irresponsible spenders/gamblers or
              genuinely needy people?<br> <br> If it is the former, then I support criminalizing borrowers. As for
              the needy, once they borrow from loan sharks, it is very unlikely
              they will be able to repay. In fact, I would imagine the debt will
              grow because of the ridiculous interest rates (correct me if I am
              wrong). So, this source of borrowing should not be encouraged in
              order to prevent them from falling further into the pit.<br> <br> However, for the needy, criminalizing them is no fair because loan
              sharks are probably their last resort.<br> <br> So, if there is a way to separate the irresponsible ones from the
              needy, it would be great. Also, more thought has to go into how to
              prevent the needy from borrowing from loan sharks or helping them
              repay the sum.<br> <br> As for existing borrowers, if it is possible, maybe they can decide
              on a cutting-off date, so only those who borrow after the
              implementation will be charged.<br> <br> The only concern I have is that loan sharks may resort to trickery
              to trap people into borrowing because they have to keep their
              income channel alive.</p>

              <p><strong>I actually support the idea of making borrowing from
              loansharks an offense</strong>Just recently, a neighbour of mine
              had his window poured with red paint. He claimed he lost his IC and
              it was used to make an illegal loan with the loansharks.<br> <br> What have we here in this senario?<br> <br> 1. Vandalism<br> 2. People not relating to the borrower suffering from the
              consequences<br> 3. People related to the borrower suffering from the
              consequences<br> <br> If I'm in charge of passing this law, I'll pass it instantly
              without blinking an eye.<br> <br> About people suffering in silence? They are already suffering
              whether or not they report to the police.<br> <br> How about preventing more people in the future suffering in
              silence?</p>

              <p>there must be plenty of money to be made in the loansharking
              business.<br> <br> then it is more reason for this greedy govt to catch these

              to Inland Revenue Dept.<br> afterall these buggers are the ones who are cash rich, right

              <p>In the US, there's all kind of money lending/borrowing business,
              such as payday loan. Just that in Singapore, the credit market's so
              tightly controlled that avenues for credit do not flourish
              aboveground, and you have to go underground sometimes, in times of
              need.<br> <br> Parka wants to criminalize PAP MP Dr Ong Seh Hong without blinking
              his eye. He's on the same boat as me.</p>

              <p>Maybe MHA did not do enough research before releasing this
              news.<br> <br> Drawing a decision tree will help to know possible decision that
              will be made by the people who is directly or indirectly
              involved.<br> <br> This policy, I think it will make matter worse.<br> For example, if I am in deep shit and need money, what would I do?
              Borrow first then decide what to do next.<br> <br> Next, if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on me.
              I believe my family will not report loan sharks cases to the police
              because I will get into trouble. What’s next? Suffer in
              silence.(Just think that most families won’t want their members to
              put in jail.)<br> <br> Lucky, by now the loan sharks must be celebrating!! There is no way
              or hardly a way the police can track them down without the
              borrower's family reporting it.<br> The loan sharks will just have to pick on the right family. I think
              this is obvious.<br> <br> Lesser number of loan sharks case might just be an illusion. The
              number of loan sharks might increase. The only difference is, the
              cases are not recorded.<br> Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only way
              to solve the problem.<br> Agree totally agree with lucky's post.</p>

              <p>similarly. set up casinos as stumbling blocks for people who
              want to bet for instant riches. but then, how do you deal with
              social problems that may arise from gambling?<br> <br> the authorities have to decide...how to make more money and avoid
              being blamed for social problems<br> <br> make money is still the government chief priority than social well
              being.<br> <br> so same tactics. let people walk into these places of temptations.
              enact laws to punish people who failed to contain themselves and
              become social liabilities than use laws to slam them<br> <br> in other words, for money, they'll tempt the people within the
              legal boundaries.<br> <br> what they are saying is: i want to stroke your cock for money. but
              if you cock stand up, i am going to use the laws to cut off your
              cock.</p>

              <p>this reminds me of another recent law from MHA.<br> <br> There's been a rise in contraband cigarettes in singapore. So
              instead of better policing at the borders, they decided to mark
              every single cigarette in Singapore with the duty paid logo.<br> <br> Citizens, well smoking ones, get punished, instead of working
              harder to to catch the smugglers.<br> <br> Now we'll likely go into a slippery slope argument.. if borrowing
              money from loansharks is illegal, then we should then make
              everything that leads to debts illegal too eg addictive gamblers
              should be fined or jailed.<br> <br> or every form of vice in our society should also be made illegal
              like alcoholism.<br> <br> it must be the MHA - the same people who say that ONE person
              gathering can be deemed an illegal gathering.<br> <br> absurd, absolutely absurd.</p>

              <p>Wow, now I can sabotage anyone by scribbling their unit no. on
              the wall "O$P$ #-----", and then call the police saying that this
              person has borrowed from loansharks.<br> <br> So instead of using their precious resources to catch real
              criminals i.e. loansharks, police now have to waste resources
              investigating innocent victims.<br> <br> Maybe this is what they want because sitting ducks borrowers are
              easier to catch than elusive loansharks. They can justify their
              hefty salaries and bonuses by increasing the number of "solved
              cases".</p>

              <p>"...if I am in deep shit and need money, what would I do? Borrow
              first then decide what to do next."<br> <br> That is the most vulnerable state (desperation and panic) for the
              loan sharks to exploit and after that you might regret. Might be
              better for you to be stopped from falling into the pit.<br> <br> "...if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on
              me."<br> <br> The loan sharks will use it to blackmail you to extort more until
              you tak boleh tahan and report yourself.<br> <br> "Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only
              way to solve the problem."<br> <br> Definitely, this should be the priority. I believe making borrowing
              a criminal act in meant to be supplementary.</p>

              <p>LUCKY,<br> <br> This has been happening for a very long time;<br> <br> Under the Act, if the Ministries send you a bill for $XXXXXXXXX
              dollars, you have to prove to them why you didn't owe the money.
              HOW TO?<br> <br> If the Income Tax Department revalue your property, or claim you
              made a few millions last year when you did not, you have to pay
              first and argue later. You have stashed funds?<br> <br> Where to get the money to pay first? borrow from the
              loanshark?<br> <br> If you do not want your organs and skin remove from your temporary
              diabled body, you better opt out.<br> Criteria for confirming brain dead,<br> 1. your pupil does not response to light (temporary lose of
              eyesight pengsa).<br> 2. your fingers does not response to needle pricking (temporary
              paralysis pengsa).<br> 3. 2 doctors confirms you are brain dead (pengsa if some
              politician/millionaire has matching requirements).<br> <br> Where are all the modern equpments?<br> <br> The passport of the Pathetic Singaporean is the only valuable and

              <p>the way i see it: the main reason is to protect innocent pple
              who are harassed by the loansharks when real borrowers clear out of
              the old place. however even with the new law, the loan sharks will
              still continue to harass the new owners what.<br> <br> the question is why polic cannot catch these loan sharks - why are
              they so elusive even when security cameras are installed by the new
              owners? the police shld tell us.<br> <br> the other angle we can do, is for hdb or relevant authorities to
              keep new owners advised of the new hdb address of the real
              borrowers. this transparency is only fair, not just in the case of
              loan shark harrassment. it also helps if there is a hidden defect
              in the unit for which the previous owner is accountable for.<br> <br> if you ask me, the real reason why wks wants this is because of the
              coming ir. they anticipate a lot of social problems, and they
              simply want to wash their hands of it. this is "you die, you
              business" - the same strategy in healthcare, housing and law and
              order.</p>

              <p>I got a better solution lah.<br> <br> Death penalty for loan sharks.<br> <br> Guarantee all the wannabes will be shocked out of the business. The
              die-hards maybe will switch to smuggling drugs since they figure
              both will get death anyway. Pronto, problem solved.</p>

              <p>Actually I don't see what's wrong with making borrowing from
              loansharks an offense. If providing an illegal loan is an offense,
              why shouldn't taking the illegal loan be an offense as well? For
              those people afraid of this new law, here's a simple solution:
              Don't take money from loansharks.</p>

Police had to deal a total of 4000 cases in the first 3 months of this year. But don't worry our Home Affairs Minister has come up with a brilliant solution to reduce the number of cases our police have to handle:<br><br>
              <div><em>"The ministry will also consider <strong>making</strong> <strong>borrowing from loansharks an offence</strong>."</em></div>
              <div><em>- DPM Wong Kan Seng.[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Crime/Story/A1Story20090417-135750.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><em><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></em></div>
              <div><em>"This would be good news for us. If the police arrest those who borrow, they won't dare to report us when we harass them," - Loanshark who welcomes the move[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Free/Story/STIStory_214945.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Link</span></span></a>]</em></div>
              <div><span style="color: #ffffff;">,</span></div>
              <div>If you still don't understand how brilliant this solution is, let me explain. The police has to handle so many cases of loansharking because the victims go to the police for help. By criminalising borrowing from loansharks, the victims of loanshark harassment now cannot go to the police for help because they themselves will be arrested for borrowing from the loansharks. The police will see a sharp drop in the number of cases and the govt can say the problem is solved! Briliant! Bravo! Now victims of loansharks have to suffer quietly. This will free up vast amounts of resources - there will be more police to handle those pesky opposition members and peaceful protestors who break our new our public order laws. I thought sending our old folks to JB was the best idea for the year -I was wrong.... this one is a lot more brilliant!</div>

              <p>hmm... filming an illegal event is criminalized, borrowing money from illegal loansharks may be made a criminal offense.. What's next? Maybe they'll penalize victims from rape, theft, murder.. etc in future.</p>

              <p>Why not extend this superb idea to all cases?<br><br>Make everyone who makes a police report post a bond of $10k. It will be returned to the victim only when the perpetrator has been found guilty by the courts.<br><br>A more brilliant solution is to charge a fee for using law enforcement services. Want that robber caught? Pay $3k to the police. Want loanshark caught? Pay $5k. Can pay by CPF and installments also.<br><br>These solutions will reduce the official crime rates and make Singapore the safest city in the world!</p>

              <p>Dr Ong Seh Hong who borrowed 60K (the equivalent of an annual pay of an ordinary Singaporean) from Ming Yi. He probably delayed the payment to the hospital until he knew he has been exposed by Ming Yi.<br><br>Bravo of Ming Yi to drag this greedy PAP MP into the dirt. He knew that the PAP wants to take over his hospital organization to service the lucrative healthcare tourism (same reason for Khaw to want to kick old Singaporeans out to JB).<br><br>Ming Yi should do the next best thing: to declare himself as a loanshark who cannot say 'NO' and kill this greedy MP Ong once and for all.</p>

              <p>Making borrowing from loanshark illegal, I see.<br><br>What a clever way to free PAP from its responsibility to the society without finding out why more and more are resorting to this type of credit.<br><br>Better solution for Wong Kan Seng is since loansharks are doing a roaring business, lets beat them to it ... just like PAP beats illegal 4D operators hands down.<br><br>Well if you don't remember, in the 70's illegal 4D operators were rampant and PAP constantly raided them. Then a brilliant idea came to PAP, lets create state-run 4Ds betting franchises.<br><br>Now you can see them all around. And PAP and some critics are worried the IRs will bring a gambling scourge to Singapore.<br><br>Open ya eyes! For that matter, these 4D outlets partly or even largely explain why loanshark business is booming in Singapore.<br><br>So you see that's how PAP "resolved" the betting problem by making it legal, hehe. No wonder it is praised around the world for being such a great government.<br><br>So I am sure PAP with its brilliant advisers will come up with something like that.<br><br>The news already reported that permits have been issued to high interest money lenders when formerly such permits were refused.<br><br>PAP just have to impose a high licence fee or even get DBS into the same act to reap from this business and thus PAP will also have "resolved" this loanshark problem.<br><br>Hey in the US it was such high-interest loans through credit cards that did their economy in; here PAP might well think otherwise.</p>

              <p>Simple but yet brilliant analysis by lucky ! lol<br><br>And perhaps PM,MM and SM should pool their wealth and start a scheme that provides loans to PAP MPs and grass-roots supporters. Their combined wealth should be more than 200M $ ! The other multi Million $ ministers can also contribute to make loans available to all PAP members. Such loans should be interest-free, repayable over 20 to 30 years and of course whilst serving party interests.<br>This is a lot better than having PAP members borrowing from monks or loansharks which is not good for PAP's image and it is perfectly LEEgal. lol</p>

              <p>Whether or not it is a good idea depends on the composition of borrowers. Are they mostly irresponsible spenders/gamblers or genuinely needy people?<br><br>If it is the former, then I support criminalizing borrowers. As for the needy, once they borrow from loan sharks, it is very unlikely they will be able to repay. In fact, I would imagine the debt will grow because of the ridiculous interest rates (correct me if I am wrong). So, this source of borrowing should not be encouraged in order to prevent them from falling further into the pit.<br><br>However, for the needy, criminalizing them is no fair because loan sharks are probably their last resort.<br><br>So, if there is a way to separate the irresponsible ones from the needy, it would be great. Also, more thought has to go into how to prevent the needy from borrowing from loan sharks or helping them repay the sum.<br><br>As for existing borrowers, if it is possible, maybe they can decide on a cutting-off date, so only those who borrow after the implementation will be charged.<br><br>The only concern I have is that loan sharks may resort to trickery to trap people into borrowing because they have to keep their income channel alive.</p>

              <p><strong>I actually support the idea of making borrowing from loansharks an offense</strong>Just recently, a neighbour of mine had his window poured with red paint. He claimed he lost his IC and it was used to make an illegal loan with the loansharks.<br><br>What have we here in this senario?<br><br>1. Vandalism<br>2. People not relating to the borrower suffering from the consequences<br>3. People related to the borrower suffering from the consequences<br><br>If I'm in charge of passing this law, I'll pass it instantly without blinking an eye.<br><br>About people suffering in silence?

              <p>Maybe MHA did not do enough research before releasing this news.<br><br>Drawing a decision tree will help to know possible decision that will be made by the people who is directly or indirectly involved.<br><br>This policy, I think it will make matter worse.<br>For example, if I am in deep shit and need money, what would I do? Borrow first then decide what to do next.<br><br>Next, if I do not report my ”crime”, there won’t be any case on me. I believe my family will not report loan sharks cases to the police because I will get into trouble. What’s next? Suffer in silence.(Just think that most families won’t want their members to put in jail.)<br><br>Lucky, by now the loan sharks must be celebrating!! There is no way or hardly a way the police can track them down without the borrower's family reporting it.<br>The loan sharks will just have to pick on the right family. I think this is obvious.<br><br>Lesser number of loan sharks case might just be an illusion. The number of loan sharks might increase. The only difference is, the cases are not recorded.<br>Nail down the loan sharks and eliminate them should be the only way to solve the problem.<br>Agree totally agree with lucky's post.</p>

              <p>this reminds me of another recent law from MHA.<br><br>There's been a rise in contraband cigarettes in singapore. So instead of better policing at the borders, they decided to mark every single cigarette in Singapore with the duty paid logo.<br><br>Citizens, well smoking ones, get punished, instead of working harder to to catch the smugglers.<br><br>Now we'll likely go into a slippery slope argument.. if borrowing money from loansharks is illegal, then we should then make everything that leads to debts illegal too eg addictive gamblers should be fined or jailed.<br><br>or every form of vice in our society should also be made illegal like alcoholism.<br><br>it must be the MHA - the same people who say that ONE person gathering can be deemed an illegal gathering.<br><br>absurd, absolutely absurd.</p>

              <p>the way i see it: the main reason is to protect innocent pple who are harassed by the loansharks when real borrowers clear out of the old place. however even with the new law, the loan sharks will still continue to harass the new owners what.<br><br>the question is why polic cannot catch these loan sharks - why are they so elusive even when security cameras are installed by the new owners? the police shld tell us.<br><br>the other angle we can do, is for hdb or relevant authorities to keep new owners advised of the new hdb address of the real borrowers. this transparency is only fair, not just in the case of loan shark harrassment. it also helps if there is a hidden defect in the unit for which the previous owner is accountable for.<br><br>if you ask me, the real reason why wks wants this is because of the coming ir. they anticipate a lot of social problems, and they simply want to wash their hands of it. this is "you die, you business" - the same strategy in healthcare, housing and law and order.</p>

              <p>Actually I don't see what's wrong with making borrowing from loansharks an offense. If providing an illegal loan is an offense, why shouldn't taking the illegal loan be an offense as well? For those people afraid of this new law, here's a simple solution: Don't take money from loansharks.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Drug problems still in Singapore, not talked about in local media:</strong></span></p>
              <p><a title="Permanent Link: Party Drugs A Hit With Wealthy In&amp;nbsp;Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/2007/12/10/party-drugs-a-hit-with-wealthy-in-singapore/"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Party Drugs A Hit With Wealthy In Singapore</strong></span></a></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Dec 10 (Reuters) - It is Friday night. Ling, a bank analyst in Armani heels, pops a small, blue pill into her mouth and dances to the thumping beat. Later she heads to a house party with her friends where they snort cocaine off tabletops.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s party drug scene used to be the domain of high-flying foreign bankers and other expatriates who would take ecstasy and snort cocaine in defiance of the city state’s drug laws which, with a mandatory death sentence for drug trafficking, are among the toughest in the world. But these days, the drug scene for foreigners is not as pronounced as among well-to-do locals in a country which has the world’s fastest-growing number of high net worth individuals, totalling some 67,000 in 2006.</p>
              <p>And fast cars and fancy clothes are not the only things young, hip and rich Singaporeans want to buy.</p>
              <p>“In general, you go for ‘trippy’ drugs, drugs that make you feel good as well as make you dance harder,” said a student from a wealthy family, who declined to be identified.</p>
              <p>With one gram of methamphetamine costing S$300, it is an expensive habit that not everyone can feed.</p>
              <p>Singaporean authorities say drug use is low, but anecdotal evidence tells of the emergence of an underground party drug scene mostly at night clubs frequented by the wealthy.</p>
              <p>Singapore is Asia’s second-richest country, with a 2006 GDP per capita of $29,000, on a par with Italy and Spain. The booming economy, driven by manufacturing and financial services, has made the city-state a playground for the rich.</p>
              <p>And with money to throw around, some of these rich Singaporeans are spending it on drugs smuggled from neighbouring Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
              <p>They are taking a big risk.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, anyone caught carrying more than 15 grams of heroin, 30 grams of cocaine, 500 grams of cannabis or 250 grams of methamphetamines faces a mandatory death sentence by hanging.</p>
              <p>Penalties for consumption are also strict, including up to 10 years in jail, a S$20,000 fine, or both.</p>
              <p>“There are definitely a lot of people doing drugs in the party scene, but it doesn’t get reported because there’s no way to really catch them since the circle is closed,” said bank analyst Ling, who would only give her first name.</p>
              <p><strong>Drugs and Gangs</strong></p>
              <p>With its borders closely monitored by vigilant authorities, it is not clear how drugs enter Singapore. But former gang members say some drugs are brought in on row boats from nearby Indonesian islands, or are smuggled along the causeway separating Singapore from Malaysia.</p>
              <p>“Don’t think it’s elaborate trucks with hidden compartments - sometimes the drugs are just in a motorcycle front basket and driven through,” said Jonathan, who spent 7 years as a gang member before entering a drug rehabilitation program.</p>
              <p>According to Singapore’s Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) figures, 1,127 drug users were arrested in 2006 compared to 793 in 2005. Forty-nine percent of those arrested took drugs such as ecstasy, ketamine and Nimetazepam.</p>
              <p>In 2004, the CNB carried out a raid which exposed a glitzy underground drug scene. The cocaine drug bust saw 23 people arrested, including the former editor of high-society magazine Singapore Tatler, an award-winning French chef and an oil broker.</p>
              <p>Three of those arrested jumped bail and left the country. They are still wanted by the Singapore police and Interpol. Nigel Simmonds, the editor of Singapore Tatler, was jailed for two years.</p>
              <p>“Every couple of years, they (the police) go out and get people so everyone is way too scared to do drugs,” said a British lawyer, who declined to be named. “The drugs of choice here (for foreigners) really are women and alcohol.”</p>
              <p>The city-state, which executed <a rel="nofollow" href="http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/6am-on-26-jan-2007/"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">two Africans</span></strong></a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/2006/12/02/marking-the-anniversary-of-a-hanging-in-singapore/"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">an Australian</span></strong></a> in recent years, has faced pressure from rights groups and governments to end its mandatory death penalty for drug smuggling.</p>
              <p>Singapore <a rel="nofollow" href="http://pseudonymity.wordpress.com/2007/12/03/singapores-strong-pro-death-penalty-stand-at-un-leaves-many-angered/"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">defends its position</span></strong></a> by saying it needs tough laws to deter drug traffickers. But some believe the death penalty is ineffective as a deterrence against drug smuggling.</p>
              <p>“When you hang a drug courier, you are only killing the small fry. The kingpins are the ones you don’t see,” said Sinapan Samydorai of rights group <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">Think Centre</span></strong></a>.</p>
              <p>According to Amnesty International, about 400 people have been sentenced to death in Singapore since 1991, most of them for drug trafficking. This gives Singapore the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/report/info/ASA36/001/2004"><strong><span style="color: #aa7d39;">highest execution rate per capita in the world</span></strong></a>, the human-rights group said.</p>
              <p>But tough laws are still not enough to stop some drug users. “It’s the same as having unprotected sex. You do it because it feels better. But if you get caught it’s the worst high ever,” said the wealthy student who declined to be named.</p>

(See report on facing page).<br><br>When contacted, police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said they are investigating if both incidents are linked.<br><br>SHAKEN<br><br>Ahmad (not his real name), 24, was the most seriously injured among the five at the Eunos attack, suffering slash wounds on both arms and his head.<br><br>The other two, who were also warded, suffered slash wounds on their hand and stomach respectively.<br><br>Still looking shaken from the attack, Ahmad told The New Paper yesterday at Changi General Hospital (CGH), where he is warded, that it was an unprovoked attack.<br><br>He claimed that he and his group have no enemies nor have they offended anyone.<br><br>That was why when he first saw the armed, masked men, he thought they were going to attack others, not their group.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'I first saw about seven men, who appeared from behind the walls. They were wearing ski masks and each one was carrying either a parang or a sword.<br><br>'I thought they were looking for others. We had no time to react or run away at all before they attacked us.'<br><br>Ahmad said he and his friends, whose ages range from 17 to 24, fled in different directions with the assailants in hot pursuit.<br><br>Ahmad himself ran to Block 16 where he was pounced upon at the void deck by two attackers.<br><br>He said: 'Then three other men, also wearing ski masks and carrying parangs, appeared and also started attacking me.'<br><br>He tried to protect his head by using his hands to cover it.<br><br>'But when I did so, I heard the (hacking) sounds,' he recounted.<br><br>'I knew that the parang had hit me.'<br><br>Ahmad then tried to run into a lift.<br><br>A middle-aged man was about to exit and was threatened by the attackers.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'They warned him to get out of the way or they would also chop him.'<br><br>The five attackers then tried to force their way into the lift as Ahmad kept kicking them out.<br><br>He succeeded only after one of them told the gang 'enough' in Malay and they left.<br><br>By then, Ahmad's hands were soaked with blood, with bones visible from the wounds.<br><br>'I thought I was going to die,' he said. 'If they had managed to enter the lift, I think I would have been dead by now.'<br><br>Taking the lift to the sixth floor, he sought help from a household, whose main door was open.<br><br>'I told them that I had been attacked by a gang and asked them to help call for an ambulance.'<br><br>The family also helped dress his wounds and gave him drinks.<br><br>Ahmad said they also kept talking to him because he told them he was going to faint. Later, the police and ambulance arrived to take him to hospital.<br><br>Ahmad's elder sister, 33, said she was distraught to see him badly injured.<br><br>She said: 'I don't know why they attacked my brother. He isn't the sort to mix with bad company.<br><br>'I hope the police will step up patrols and also arrest these people soon.'<br><br>Ahmad is now fearful of returning to Eunos Crescent, the neighbourhood where he had lived for nearly 20 years.<br><br>He moved out of the area five years ago, but would return there almost daily to hang out with his childhood friends. He said his family had plans to move back there next year because they like the area so much.<br><br>'But now, I'm not so sure.'<br><br>One of his injured friends, who is still warded at CGH, said Ahmad was the worst hit.<br><br>Requesting not to be named, he added: 'We do not know who these guys are and we have never offended anyone before.'<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said that so far, there have been no arrests and those injured in both the cases are being interviewed.<br><br>'The two cases are being investigated as rioting armed with dangerous weapon,' he added.<br><br>Those convicted of the offence face a jail term of up to seven years and caning</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial;">Terror Road Rage Case in Singapore</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">HANGING on to the bonnet of a speeding car as it kept swerving to throw you off is something that happens only in the movies.<br><br>For two minutes yesterday afternoon, he did just that.<br><br>The reason he ended up on the bonnet is even more shocking - it was an argument over a scratch.<br><br>Luckily for Mr Koh, 36, he escaped with only abrasions.<br><br>The sales executive was walking back to his Toyota Wish which was parked on Tembeling Road, near Joo Chiat.<br><br>He recalled: 'I had just collected a cheque from a client and was walking back to my car to drive off for lunch.<br><br>'From a distance, I saw a man walking pass the right side of my car.<br><br>'I thought I saw him scratching the right passenger door with his car keys.'<br><br>When Mr Koh reached his car, he found a 15cm scratch on his silver Wish which he bought new two years ago.<br><br>The man who scratched Mr Koh's car got into a black Nissan Cefiro which was parked behind Mr Koh's.<br><br>Both cars were in parallel parking lots.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'By the time I reached my car, the man was already trying to get out of the parking lot.<br><br>'I tapped on the bonnet to get the driver's attention.<br><br>'But he kept inching his car forward even though I signalled to him to stop. I had to keep stepping back in order not get hit.<br><br>'All of a sudden, the driver surged forward and I had no time to react. As a result, I slumped forward on the car's bonnet.'<br><br>The car did not stop and Mr Koh had to hold on to the bonnet so as not to fall off.<br><br>The Nissan drove about 15m towards the junction of Tembeling Road and East Coast Road.<br><br>There, the driver slowed down to make a left turn to get on to East Coast Road.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'I kept yelling at the driver to stop. But it was no use. I couldn't really see his face because of the glare from the front windscreen.<br><br>'The windows were shut, so I don't think he could hear me.'<br><br>After the Nissan got on to East Coast Road, the driver tried to shake Mr Koh off.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'He kept swerving left and right after he turned left on to East Coast Road.<br><br>'I couldn't do anything except to grip the bonnet very tightly and shouted at him to stop.<br><br>'I remembered turning my head back as he sped on. I saw the back of a lorry and the Nissan slowed down to avoid hitting the lorry.'<br><br>About 200m after getting on to East Coast Road, the Nissan brushed against a motorcycle which was travelling on the left lane of the two-lane road.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'The driver continued moving ahead even after the Nissan brushed against a motorcycle. Then, it turned left towards Still Road.<br><br>'After that, I couldn't hang on to the car any more and I fell off the bonnet.'<br><br>Mr Koh landed on the road and rolled onto the middle lane of Still Road and almost got hit by a despatch rider when he rolled into his lane.<br><br>The despatch rider, Mr Mohd Shahril, 32, thought that an 'object had came into his path'.<br><br>Mr Shahril, who was on Still Road travelling towards Eunos, said: 'I was surprised when I found out that the 'object' was actually a man. If I had not braked in time, the both of us would surely be hurt.'<br><br>Mr Koh finally came to a stop near a bus stop.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'My chin hit the ground even though I tried to use my arms to cushion the fall. It was very painful and I couldn't move.<br><br>'Luckily, a motorcyclist came by to help me. Some other people from the bus stop also came to help.'<br><br>Mr Shahril said he does not know who was more crazy - the driver of the fleeing car or the man who held on to the bonnet.<br><br>He said: 'From the corner of my eye, I could see and hear the screeching sound the speeding car was making. The driver didn't even slow down as he entered the filter lane.<br><br>'The driver is crazy because the man could have been dragged under the wheels of his car.'<br><br>Those who had helped Mr Koh took him to the bus stop and called for an ambulance. He was taken to Changi General Hospital.<br><br>Mr Koh suffered abrasions to both his arms and his knees. His left shirt pocket was torn and his pants were also torn at the knees.<br><br>Mr Koh recalled that the driver of the Nissan wore a blue T-shirt with blue shorts, but couldn't make out his appearance as he only saw the driver from a distance.<br><br>But Mr Koh said the driver was a short and plump man in his 40s.<br><br>Mr Koh said: 'Scratching my car was a small matter. I only wanted to talk to him about it. But what he did could have cost me my life.'<br><br>He made a police report at the accident and emergency ward of CGH.<br><br>Mr Koh's wife, Madam S Chong, 36, said the Nissan driver's behaviour was 'outrageous'.<br><br>She was having lunch when her husband called her while he was in the ambulance to CGH.<br><br>Madam Chong said: 'At first, I thought he was joking as my husband likes to joke a lot. As he could still talk to me on the phone, I knew he wasn't too badly hurt.<br><br>The Kohs have two children aged 4 and 8.<br><br>A passer-by gave Mr Koh the licence plate number of the Nissan.<br><br>He said: 'It all happened so fast that I didn't have time to see the car plate number.<br><br>'Luckily, there were witnesses who saw what happened.'<br><br>The police said they were informed of the incident at about 1pm.<br><br>They are investigating the matter which involves a car driver, a motorcyclist and a pedestrian.<br><br>A similar incident happened on 9 Apr. Mr Alex Lim was driving his girlfriend home for dinner, but along Paterson Road, his red Mazda was involved in a minor collision with a taxi.<br><br>Both drivers then parked along Scotts Road and got out of their vehicles. An argument followed.<br><br>Cabby Lee Yuet Kong, who was carrying a passenger at the time, allegedly got back into his taxi and tried to drive off.<br><br>Mr Lim, a finacial adviser, wanting to get Lee's particulars, stood in front of the cab, but Lee reportedly drove away, throwing him onto the bonnet.<br><br>He later allegedly braked abruptly, causing Mr Lim to fall backwards and hit his head on the ground.<br><br>Mr Lim died on 13 May.<br><br>Lee, a 68-year-old relief driver, has been charged with causing grievous hurt with a rash act.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial;">Rising suicide rate: Do something when we see someone in need of a helping hand</span></strong> <span style="font-family: Arial;">&lt;!-- headline one : end --&gt;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">&lt;!-- more than 7 paragraphs --&gt;&lt;!-- story content : start --&gt;I READ with dismay the article, 'Suicide figures up - 419 deaths last year' (ST, Aug 13).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nevertheless, I am not surprised at the rising suicide figures and believe that it will continue to climb in the near future as I see many people facing difficulty coping with a stressful lifestyle deprived of much support.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">People belonging to the sandwiched generation especially face mounting pressures, mainly financial, and if they fail to see a way out of their problem, may attempt suicide. To them, living is tortuous and death seems like a permanent relief to all their problems which is but a myth. They will leave behind loved ones who not only will miss their presence but also have to live on with doubts of whether they are the ones at fault.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is common knowledge that our population faces mounting work pressure. Many work long hours and only go home to sleep. Weekends are also confined to indoor activity as they recuperate from a long week at work. There is hardly any work-life balance here. Most people's lives revolve around work.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As families get smaller, the supportive reach of an extensive family network is also remote. Many also fail to have time to establish any meaningful friendships and may miss out on opportunities to confide their problems in someone. Many who have problems, especially men, will not seek out counsellors from nearby neighbourhood family service centres for counselling support, further compounding the issue.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A close classmate of mine committed suicide at the tender age of 21. He suffered from an inferiority complex and family members also failed to understand him. After being discharged from the mental hospital, he hanged himself outside a church. As his classmates who helped him along the way, we were devastated and blamed ourselves for not doing enough to help him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th para --&gt;I often questioned the quality of our counsellors in family service centres (FSCs), having worked in one myself a few years back as a social-work aide.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Most workers there are young and trained in social work. It will be difficult for them to identify with the issues a middle-aged person is going through and also how he can earn the respect of the counsellee who is much more seasoned in life.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">FSCs need to deploy properly trained counsellors who are mature enough to deal with the issues of this critical age group. Hopefully, this will take some load off the suicide-prevention group Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) which continues to face manpower shortages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As Singapore progresses, many will also struggle to keep pace in a modern fast-paced society. Let us offer our shoulder if we see someone in need of a helping hand. You never know that your kind words of comfort may dissuade someone from thoughts of ending his life. It is when we take time to care for one another that we can say we are a First World nation.</span></p>
