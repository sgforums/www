A stage where you can't even have a drink in peace in pubs and nightspots because a person could, on the spur of the moment, not like your face and attack you with his group of friends.'<br><br>To the civilian, it's about being able to walk on the streets safely and knowing that our men in blue can protect those who feel they have a right to protection.<br><br>To the police, it's about not stepping outside of the law, and guarding against claims of abuse of power.<br><br>Question is, how does the bully see it?</p></div>

              <div id="post_message_3228989">A RAG-AND-BONE man decided he didn't want illegal gamblers in his neighbourhood.<br><br>So he chided them and threatened to call the police.<br><br>Instead of leaving, the ruffians beat him up, breaking his bones.<br><br>Mr Tan Lak Tee, 43, was attacked twice and his injuries include fractures in his arm, index finger and one of his ribs.<br><br>The attack happened two months ago but Mr Tan, who is single, still feels the pain of his injuries.<br><br>The rag-and-bone man, who mainly deals in scrap metal, claims he has lost weight and his business has been affected. He used to make up to $500 a day before the attack, but now he says he cannot lift anything heavy and his income has fallen. <br><br>The incident happened at 7pm on 15 Jun when Mr Tan was cycling home and saw some men around a table opposite his rented house near Geylang Lorong24.<br><br>Among the gamblers were Tan Chee Kiong, 38, and his two accomplices. The two Tans are not related.<br><br>Said MrTan: 'I was curious and went to have a look. I saw that the men were gambling.<br><br>'One of the men saw me and told me to leave. I then asked the man why I could not watch as the road did not belong to them.<br><br>'When I said that I wanted them to pack up and leave, another gambler uttered vulgarities at me. I told him that I was going to call the police.'<br><br>Mr Tan said he and the gambler then got into an argument.<br><br>'Then, a group of people started attacking me,' he said.<br><br>Mr Tan said that, at first, they were unarmed, but later they got some metal rods and cangkuls to attack him. <br><br>'I took a metal rod from my bicycle and used the rod and my bare hands to fight them off,' said MrTan.<br><br>'They then chased me to my house and tried to get in, but I quickly closed the door and rushed into my room.<br><br>'Soon there was blood on the floor in my room,' Mr Tan said.<br><br>Mr Tan said the attack left him bleeding from his head and his upper body and there was flesh hanging off his left index finger.<br><br>It was Tan who took a metal rod from a dustbin nearby and hit MrTan's right hand before he rushed into his house.<br><br>When Mr Tan thought the coast was clear, he walked out.<br><br>STILL WAITING FOR HIM <br><br>But Tan and the other men were waiting for him, and attacked him again.<br><br>'I fought them off, but they kept on hitting me. I managed to get back into my house and locked the door and gate.<br><br>'The men then ran away,' said MrTan.<br><br>Around 8pm, he called the police and told them about the attack.<br><br>He was then taken by ambulance to Changi General Hospital.<br><br>Later that day, a Malaysian, who witnessed the attack, saw Tan sitting in the back lane of Geylang Lorong22. He called the police and pointed out the suspect.<br><br>Tan was arrested.<br><br>Tan admitted to attacking Mr Tan and implicated his two accomplices.<br><br>But both men had left Singapore and are now on the run. Police gazettes have been issued for their arrest.<br><br>Mr Tan's injuries were extensive. His left index finger, left forearm and right rib were broken, and he had several cuts, including a deep gash on his forehead.<br><br>'The doctors had to put metal screws in my finger and arm,' he said.<br><br>'I was hospitalised for three days and now cannot bend my left index finger or lift heavy things any more.<br><br>'The doctors said I was fortunate that my broken rib did not hit my lung or kidney or I would have died.<br><br>'I still take antibiotics and painkillers, and have to take a laxative for my constipation as my fractured rib makes passing motion painful.'<br><br>Mr Tan's elder sister, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said she was supposed to visit her brother the day he was attacked.<br><br>But, as it was raining that day, she decided to visit him the next day instead.<br><br>'When I arrived at his home at 9am, I saw a trail of blood leading from the road to the front door,' she said.<br><br>'When I opened the door, my brother was gone and there was a pool of blood on the floor of his room.<br><br>'At first, I thought his pet dogs had been fighting, but when I could not find my brother, I called the police.<br><br>'They told me my brother had been in a fight and was in hospital.<br><br>'I put plastic bags over my legs and took nearly an hour to clean all the blood away,' she said.<br><br>At the Subordinate Courts on 10Aug, Tan pleaded guilty to using violence while being a member of an unlawful assembly, and rioting with a deadly weapon.<br><br>District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim sentenced him to 21/2 years' jail and sixstrokes of the cane.<br><br>For rioting with a deadly weapon or any object that could have been used to attack and cause death, Tan could have been jailed for up to seven years and caned.<br><br>He was jailed for four months for theft last year, and for nine months for theft in dwelling in 2005.<br><br>Tan was also jailed for two months in 1992 for drug offences.</div>

(See report on facing page).<br><br>When contacted, police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said they are investigating if both incidents are linked.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">SHAKEN</span></strong> <br><br>Ahmad (not his real name), 24, was the most seriously injured among the five at the Eunos attack, suffering slash wounds on both arms and his head.<br><br>The other two, who were also warded, suffered slash wounds on their hand and stomach respectively.<br><br>Still looking shaken from the attack, Ahmad told The New Paper yesterday at Changi General Hospital (CGH), where he is warded, that it was an unprovoked attack.<br><br>He claimed that he and his group have no enemies nor have they offended anyone.<br><br>That was why when he first saw the armed, masked men, he thought they were going to attack others, not their group.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'I first saw about seven men, who appeared from behind the walls. They were wearing ski masks and each one was carrying either a parang or a sword.<br><br>'I thought they were looking for others. We had no time to react or run away at all before they attacked us.'<br><br>Ahmad said he and his friends, whose ages range from 17 to 24, fled in different directions with the assailants in hot pursuit.<br><br>Ahmad himself ran to Block 16 where he was pounced upon at the void deck by two attackers.<br><br>He said: 'Then three other men, also wearing ski masks and carrying parangs, appeared and also started attacking me.'<br><br>He tried to protect his head by using his hands to cover it.<br><br>'But when I did so, I heard the (hacking) sounds,' he recounted.<br><br>'I knew that the parang had hit me.'<br><br>Ahmad then tried to run into a lift.<br><br>A middle-aged man was about to exit and was threatened by the attackers.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'They warned him to get out of the way or they would also chop him.'<br><br>The five attackers then tried to force their way into the lift as Ahmad kept kicking them out.<br><br>He succeeded only after one of them told the gang 'enough' in Malay and they left.<br><br>By then, Ahmad's hands were soaked with blood, with bones visible from the wounds. <br><br>'I thought I was going to die,' he said. 'If they had managed to enter the lift, I think I would have been dead by now.'<br><br>Taking the lift to the sixth floor, he sought help from a household, whose main door was open.<br><br>'I told them that I had been attacked by a gang and asked them to help call for an ambulance.'<br><br>The family also helped dress his wounds and gave him drinks.<br><br>Ahmad said they also kept talking to him because he told them he was going to faint. Later, the police and ambulance arrived to take him to hospital.<br><br>Ahmad's elder sister, 33, said she was distraught to see him badly injured.<br><br>She said: 'I don't know why they attacked my brother. He isn't the sort to mix with bad company.<br><br>'I hope the police will step up patrols and also arrest these people soon.'<br><br>Ahmad is now fearful of returning to Eunos Crescent, the neighbourhood where he had lived for nearly 20 years.<br><br>He moved out of the area five years ago, but would return there almost daily to hang out with his childhood friends. He said his family had plans to move back there next year because they like the area so much.<br><br>'But now, I'm not so sure.'<br><br>One of his injured friends, who is still warded at CGH, said Ahmad was the worst hit.<br><br>Requesting not to be named, he added: 'We do not know who these guys are and we have never offended anyone before.'<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said that so far, there have been no arrests and those injured in both the cases are being interviewed.<br><br>'The two cases are being investigated as rioting armed with dangerous weapon,' he added.<br><br>Those convicted of the offence face a jail term of up to seven years and caning.<br><br><br>Anyone with information on the incidents can call the police hotline at 1800-2550000.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;">My face was covered with blood</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tampines victim:</span></strong><br><br><br>ONE minute, he was chatting with two friends at the void deck of Block 463, Tampines Street 44.<br><br>The next, student Ash Mohamad Yusof, 17, found himself running for his life from six parang-wielding men.<br><br>The gang soon caught up with him at the void deck of nearby Block 461, after he fell to the ground. There, they attacked and slashed him on his head, shoulder and back.<br><br>Ash claimed that the gang only stopped and fled after he struggled to a nearby police post.<br><br>The incident took place on Friday at around 8.15pm. He was later sent to Changi General Hospital, where he spent two nights.<br><br>Speaking to The New Paper yesterday, the ITE student, who has since been discharged, said he is still clueless about why it happened.<br><br>'I don't know those people and why they attacked me at all,' he said. 'I've not offended anyone or been threatened by anyone recently too.'<br><br>He claimed that he could sense trouble when he saw a group of three men walking past him and his friends at the void deck, less than five minutes before the attack.<br><br>'Somehow I felt that something bad was going to happen.'<br><br>Soon enough, Ash claimed that one of the trio came from behind and punched him on his left cheek. Ash said he threw a punch back and hit the attacker, but he's not sure where the punch landed.<br><br>'I did it in self-defence,' he said. His two friends, both girls, fled to a male friend's flat in the same block. Ash recalled that there was a neighbourhood police post at Block 461 and dashed across to seek help.<br><br>In the rush, he claimed he overshot his destination and ran past the front door. He claimed the police officers didn't notice the commotion.<br><br>Ash claimed that he then tripped at the void deck, at the same block as police post, where the group slashed him repeatedly with the weapons.<br><br>'I thought I would either die that night or I could fight for my life so that I could see my family again.' <br><br>So he picked himself up and struggled back to the police post.<br><br>Then the attackers fled.<br><br>He said: 'When I entered the police post, I told the officers to help me call for an ambulance.'<br><br>Ash said he then waited outside the police post. 'My face and eyes were covered with blood and my T-shirt was soaked in blood too.'<br><br>He said his male friend, who was alerted by the two female friends about the attack, found him at the police post and helped him to stop the bleeding on his head.<br><br>Ash's father, Mr Mohamad Yusof Amat, 53, a security officer, was disappointed that his son did not receive first-aid at the police post.<br><br>He said: 'Shouldn't they have offered to help stop the bleeding?'<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Norbert, however, said that the officer at the police post did offer help and called for an ambulance the moment he saw Ash walking past the post, bleeding from the head.<br><br>'He then quickly obtained information from the injured man to relay to patrol officers to look out for persons connected to the incident,' he added. 'In the meantime, a male friend of the injured person had arrived and used a cloth to stop the bleeding while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.'</div>

But it turns out that Ms Phakhapon may have been murdered. (See report below, left.)<br><br>Her decomposed body was wrapped up in a sarong and a blanket, her ankles bound.<br><br>Her body was bound with a rubber tube, the other end tiesd to a tree.<br><br>State Coroner Ronald Gwee had recorded an open verdict on her death during a hearing this February. It was unclear how she had died.<br><br>Now court papers have shed some light on Ms Phakhaphon's life here.<br><br>She first arrived here in June 2004 and overstayed until July 2005. She was repatriated after her arrest at a hospital a month earlier. She had gone there to treat severe abdominal pain.<br><br><strong>NEW PASSPORT</strong><br><br>But she returned to Singapore in August 2005 with a new passport and a new name - Oraphan Ayasit. She then overstayed until her death.<br><br>After finding her body, the police searched the area where they found her body and found two uninhabited makeshift huts about 500 metres away.<br><br>Another two such huts were found about 1km away, where the police found six Thai nationals. Three were arrested for immigration offences.<br><br>One of those arrested was a Thai woman, Phorntip Saensri, 39, who said she knew Ms Phakhaphon.<br><br>She claimed Ms Phakhaphon lived at the first location, where she provided sexual services to the foreign workers living there.<br><br>Another Thai woman, Nittaya, told police that she had also lived with the dead woman at the forested area.<br><br>Nittaya, who was serving time in jail for an unspecified offence, said she had accompanied Ms Phakhaphon to a clinic in Golden Mile Complex in June 2005.<br><br>There, Ms Phakhaphon was transferred to the Singapore General Hospital, where she stayed until her discharge and arrest one month later.<br><br>Her body may not have been found - if not for the 'help' of mystery callers, court papers said.<br><br>On 20 Feb morning last year, Ms Pennipa Plypetch from the Office of Labour Affairs in the Thai embassy received an anonymous call from a man, who claimed his friend had found a body at Kranji Road.<br><br>Ms Pennipa called the police at 10.30am and they searched the forested area.<br><br>At 2.11pm, an unknown caller called '999' from a public phone booth at 257 Kranji Road to provide directions.<br><br>The caller told the police that the body was inside a canal, about 400 metres from 213 Kranji Road.<br><br>Police found the body within 10 minutes and it was retrieved by Singapore Civil Defence Force officers three hours later.<br><br>Ms Phakhaphon was found clad in a black spaghetti tank top and pink boxer shorts underneath the sarong and blanket.<br><br><strong>MYSTERIOUS CALL TO FAMILY</strong><br><br>Ms Phakhaphon's elder sister, Ms Sukanya, told The New Paper over the phone from Pathum Thani, central Thailand, that she believes her sister could have been murdered.<br><br>Ms Sukanya, 42, said: 'A Thai woman called me on 16 Feb last year from Singapore saying that my sister had died. She said my sister was killed because she found out too much about some illegal trade.'<br><br>Ms Sukanya broke down for five minutes when relating how her sister's body was found by the police.<br><br>She later said through a Thai interpreter: 'We're sisters, yet she had to die in a foreign land, with no family around her to see her for last time.<br><br>'The way she was found was pitiful. It's too much for me to bear.'<br><br>Ms Phakhaphon was buried in lot 249 - with costs borne by the Government - at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery for about a year.<br><br>Her body was exhumed and cremated on 4 Apr. The ashes are expected to be sent to the family today.<br><br>Recalling the time when Ms Phakhaphon returned home two years ago, Ms Sukanya said she noticed that her sister, who had asthma problems when she was young, looked pale and unwell.<br><br>She claimed that her sister wrote in her diary that she had gone to the clinic because she was pregnant and due to deliver a child.<br><br>Ms Sukanya said: 'She wrote that she fainted at the clinic and when she regained consciousness, she found herself at the hospital.<br><br>'And she was told that she had suffered a miscarriage.'<br><br>Ms Sukanya, who has two other brothers, said she didn't know what her sister, who left Thailand without informing the family, was working as in Singapore.<br><br>Neither did she tell Ms Sukanya if she was having problems with anyone in Singapore.<br><br><strong>CLOSURE</strong><br><br>The coroner's inquiry helps to bring some closure to the matter, said Ms Sukanya, who still helps out in the family laundry business.<br><br>But she doesn't intend to tell<br><br>Ms Phakhaphon's two sons, aged 15 and 11, or her mother in her 60s about the inquiry's details.<br><br>Ms Sukanya, who is married with a five-year-old son, said: 'I will treat and raise her sons like my own, with help from my siblings.<br><br>'Despite all that has happened to my sister, I'm relieved that we can at least get her ashes back so her sons can pay respects to her. That is the least we can do for her.'</div></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: large; color: #ff0000; font-family: Courier New;"><strong><em><strong>Gang violence by girls on the rise</strong> </em></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #008000; font-family: Courier New;">They dress, fight and commit crimes very much like male <br><br></span></em></strong>GIRL gangs are making a comeback, with an attitude and aggression that bear an unsettling resemblance to boy gangs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They dress like the boys, they fight like boys, even the crimes they commit are what the boy gangs are notorious for: rioting, robbing and extorting money, all offences which carry jail sentences.</p>
              <p>One of the five detectives interviewed for this report, offered this snapshot of today's girl thugs: "In the past, girls broke the law in such areas as unlawful assembly, fights over men, and in staring incidents at public places such as discos.</p>
              <p>"Now, they are doing what boy gangs do: breaking into cars to steal, threatening people and demanding money from schoolmates and neighbours."</p>
              <p>Official figures show a disturbing rise in teenage girls committing extortions, robberies and other crimes.</p>
              <p>In the first six months of this year, girls were involved in: 16 robberies, up from five last year; 25 thefts, up from 21; 236 shoplifting cases, up from 188, and 15 extortion cases, up from 10. In 1996, there were no reports of girls involved in extortion cases.</p>
              <p>A total of 310 girls were arrested in the first six months of this year, compared with 273 in the first half of last year.</p>
              <p>The detectives said that the pace picked up last September. They now make two to three arrests a week. Before, one a week was about average. Most of these girl gangsters are between 13 and 17 years old, although the police have come across girls as young as 10.</p>
              <p>Police officers have sometimes mistaken them for boys because of their "short hair, men's shirt, trousers and Doc Martens shoes".</p>
              <p>And when they fight, it is with a vengeance.</p>
              <p>"Before, the girls would scratch and pull each other's hair. Now, they punch, kick and scratch their victims with sharp objects such as small knives. In some cases, they attack with stiletto-heeled shoes, leaving a bloody mess."</p>
              <p>Compared with their forerunners, the Butterfly and Rose gangs of the early Sixties, the gangs today give themselves "cutesy" names like: Xiao Ding Dang (Little Doraemon, a Japanese cartoon character) and Xiao Tian Tian (Little Candy, another Japanese cartoon character).</p>
              <p>They operate in gangs with between 15 and 20 members. Membership comes easy too: Initiation rituals are not required. There's no need to make offerings to Guan Kong (the Chinese God of War), for example. They just wear the same shoes, coloured wrist bands or sport similar tattoos.</p>
              <p>Girl gangs often pick on neighbours or schoolmates.</p>
              <p>Said a detective: "They would extort money from other girls, after accusing them of staring or spreading rumours about them."</p>
              <p>Counsellors who have dealt with these girls say the lack of parental control and attention is the main cause of this rising tide of thuggery.</p>
              <p>Most of the girls are from homes with a history of family abuse or where the parents have marital problems.</p>
              <p>Their parents tend to shrug off the misdeeds, and often ask the police to let the girls off because "they're just kids", the detectives said.</p>
              <p>Even after the girls are convicted and sent to homes or placed on probation, many parents refuse to see that their child is developing into a full-fledged criminal.</p>
              <p>Counsellor Lindy Ong, 35, who has set up a support group in a church for parents with problem teens, said: "Some just leave their kids with us and expect us to perform miracles. They don't even turn up for counselling sessions."</p>
              <p>In a research bulletin issued by the Subordinate Courts, a court official said: "If the young person's undesirable values and erroneous methods of solving her problems are not corrected early, there will be dire consequences."</p>

(See report on facing page).<br><br>When contacted, police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said they are investigating if both incidents are linked.<br><br><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">SHAKEN</span></strong><br><br></span>Ahmad (not his real name), 24, was the most seriously injured among the five at the Eunos attack, suffering slash wounds on both arms and his head.<br><br>The other two, who were also warded, suffered slash wounds on their hand and stomach respectively.<br><br>Still looking shaken from the attack, Ahmad told The New Paper yesterday at Changi General Hospital (CGH), where he is warded, that it was an unprovoked attack.<br><br>He claimed that he and his group have no enemies nor have they offended anyone.<br><br>That was why when he first saw the armed, masked men, he thought they were going to attack others, not their group.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'I first saw about seven men, who appeared from behind the walls. They were wearing ski masks and each one was carrying either a parang or a sword.<br><br>'I thought they were looking for others. We had no time to react or run away at all before they attacked us.'<br><br>Ahmad said he and his friends, whose ages range from 17 to 24, fled in different directions with the assailants in hot pursuit.<br><br>Ahmad himself ran to Block 16 where he was pounced upon at the void deck by two attackers.<br><br>He said: 'Then three other men, also wearing ski masks and carrying parangs, appeared and also started attacking me.'<br><br>He tried to protect his head by using his hands to cover it.<br><br>'But when I did so, I heard the (hacking) sounds,' he recounted.<br><br>'I knew that the parang had hit me.'<br><br>Ahmad then tried to run into a lift.<br><br>A middle-aged man was about to exit and was threatened by the attackers.<br><br>Ahmad said: 'They warned him to get out of the way or they would also chop him.'<br><br>The five attackers then tried to force their way into the lift as Ahmad kept kicking them out.<br><br>He succeeded only after one of them told the gang 'enough' in Malay and they left.<br><br>By then, Ahmad's hands were soaked with blood, with bones visible from the wounds.<br><br>'I thought I was going to die,' he said. 'If they had managed to enter the lift, I think I would have been dead by now.'<br><br>Taking the lift to the sixth floor, he sought help from a household, whose main door was open.<br><br>'I told them that I had been attacked by a gang and asked them to help call for an ambulance.'<br><br>The family also helped dress his wounds and gave him drinks.<br><br>Ahmad said they also kept talking to him because he told them he was going to faint. Later, the police and ambulance arrived to take him to hospital.<br><br>Ahmad's elder sister, 33, said she was distraught to see him badly injured.<br><br>She said: 'I don't know why they attacked my brother. He isn't the sort to mix with bad company.<br><br>'I hope the police will step up patrols and also arrest these people soon.'<br><br>Ahmad is now fearful of returning to Eunos Crescent, the neighbourhood where he had lived for nearly 20 years.<br><br>He moved out of the area five years ago, but would return there almost daily to hang out with his childhood friends. He said his family had plans to move back there next year because they like the area so much.<br><br>'But now, I'm not so sure.'<br><br>One of his injured friends, who is still warded at CGH, said Ahmad was the worst hit.<br><br>Requesting not to be named, he added: 'We do not know who these guys are and we have never offended anyone before.'<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Stanley Norbert said that so far, there have been no arrests and those injured in both the cases are being interviewed.<br><br>'The two cases are being investigated as rioting armed with dangerous weapon,' he added.<br><br>Those convicted of the offence face a jail term of up to seven years and caning.<br><br><br>Anyone with information on the incidents can call the police hotline at 1800-2550000.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">My face was covered with blood</span></strong><br><br></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Tampines victim:</span></strong><br><br><br></span>ONE minute, he was chatting with two friends at the void deck of Block 463, Tampines Street 44.<br><br>The next, student Ash Mohamad Yusof, 17, found himself running for his life from six parang-wielding men.<br><br>The gang soon caught up with him at the void deck of nearby Block 461, after he fell to the ground. There, they attacked and slashed him on his head, shoulder and back.<br><br>Ash claimed that the gang only stopped and fled after he struggled to a nearby police post.<br><br>The incident took place on Friday at around 8.15pm. He was later sent to Changi General Hospital, where he spent two nights.<br><br>Speaking to The New Paper yesterday, the ITE student, who has since been discharged, said he is still clueless about why it happened.<br><br>'I don't know those people and why they attacked me at all,' he said. 'I've not offended anyone or been threatened by anyone recently too.'<br><br>He claimed that he could sense trouble when he saw a group of three men walking past him and his friends at the void deck, less than five minutes before the attack.<br><br>'Somehow I felt that something bad was going to happen.'<br><br>Soon enough, Ash claimed that one of the trio came from behind and punched him on his left cheek. Ash said he threw a punch back and hit the attacker, but he's not sure where the punch landed.<br><br>'I did it in self-defence,' he said. His two friends, both girls, fled to a male friend's flat in the same block. Ash recalled that there was a neighbourhood police post at Block 461 and dashed across to seek help.<br><br>In the rush, he claimed he overshot his destination and ran past the front door. He claimed the police officers didn't notice the commotion.<br><br>Ash claimed that he then tripped at the void deck, at the same block as police post, where the group slashed him repeatedly with the weapons.<br><br>'I thought I would either die that night or I could fight for my life so that I could see my family again.'<br><br>So he picked himself up and struggled back to the police post.<br><br>Then the attackers fled.<br><br>He said: 'When I entered the police post, I told the officers to help me call for an ambulance.'<br><br>Ash said he then waited outside the police post. 'My face and eyes were covered with blood and my T-shirt was soaked in blood too.'<br><br>He said his male friend, who was alerted by the two female friends about the attack, found him at the police post and helped him to stop the bleeding on his head.<br><br>Ash's father, Mr Mohamad Yusof Amat, 53, a security officer, was disappointed that his son did not receive first-aid at the police post.<br><br>He said: 'Shouldn't they have offered to help stop the bleeding?'<br><br>Police spokesman ASP Norbert, however, said that the officer at the police post did offer help and called for an ambulance the moment he saw Ash walking past the post, bleeding from the head.<br><br>'He then quickly obtained information from the injured man to relay to patrol officers to look out for persons connected to the incident,' he added. 'In the meantime, a male friend of the injured person had arrived and used a cloth to stop the bleeding while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.'</div></div>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">ROBBERY IN S'PORE STRAIT<br>Pirates target slow barges<br>Four attacks in three months by parang-wielding pirates<br>By Judith Tan, Nov 12, 2008</span></strong></p>
              <p>PIRATES struck early on Monday morning, robbing crew members of a Singapore-registered barge and an Indonesian-registered tugboat of cash and personal belongings.</p>
              <p>This is the fourth time since early September that the robbers, all believed to be from the same gang, have struck near and around the Batu Berhenti beacon along the Strait of Singapore under cover of night.</p>
              <p>At 1.30am on Monday, five marauders armed with parangs boarded the Maju Daya 3, which was sailing north-east of Batu Berhenti.</p>
              <p>The tugboat was towing the sand-filled Marcopolo 188 barge to Batu Ampar in Batam.</p>
              <p>The robbers took cash, mobile phones and watches worth $3,200 before escaping in a wooden boat equipped with an outboard motor.</p>
              <p>The 10 crew members were not hurt and the ship master reported the incident to Singapore's Port Operations Control Centre.</p>
              <p>Eng Lee Shipping, which owns the Marcopolo 188, declined to comment.</p>
              <p>But the stealthy attack resembled three earlier incidents.</p>
              <p>In the first incident, on Sept 8, five masked men armed with parangs and a long knife boarded the Kimtrans Echo, a Singapore-registered tugboat en route to Singapore from Vietnam.</p>
              <p>They made off with $550 in cash, mobile phones, watches and walkie-talkies after tying up the six Indonesian crew members.</p>
              <p>The next two cases occurred on Oct 4 and Oct 31, and involved a Malaysian-registered coaster, Sin Huat, and a Malaysian-registered tanker, Arowana Ranger, respectively.</p>
              <p>Both were travelling from Singapore to Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Mr Nicholas Teo, deputy director of ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre, said tugboats and barges are 'slow- moving, making them easy targets, especially in the dark'.</p>
              <p>ReCAAP is the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia, the first government-to-government agreement to enhance the security of regional waters.</p>
              <p>In a statement to the media yesterday, the organisation said though there was no conclusive evidence, all four attacks appeared to be the work of the same gang as the modes of operation were the same.</p>
              <p>'In all four incidents, the robbers came alongside the ships in their boat during hours of darkness, boarded it while it was under way and escaped with the crew's belongings,' it said.</p>
              <p>Overall, the joint patrols have made the waters in the area much safer.</p>
              <p>Last month, the International Maritime Bureau said pirate attacks in the Malacca Strait were at their lowest in five years, while East Africa's Gulf of Aden has become the most dangerous place in the world to sail, with Somalia-based pirates carrying out 51 attacks in the first nine months of the year.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>NO OTHER RIFLE COME WITH AirBursting,even for crew served</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>What is your answer given all the replies given to that?</p>
              <p>Don't avoid the question, were your right or wrong to say that only STK comes up with air bursting munitions?</p>
              <p>To recap:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The first in the world.</p>

              <p><strong>Mk 47 Stryker ,both not from ST and can using ABM.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>FN2000 is dual caliber already in mass production and can use israeli ABM, Mk 47 already use in combat in Afganistan and can use ABM</strong></p>
              <p>So,the next step,among other things,is already done and make worked... Mk 47 Stryker USED in combat and FN2000 is already able to use ABM and in production long before STK ABM.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>At Eurosatory 2006 IMI is demonstrating the progress of its Multi-Purpose Rifle System (MPRS) with the new ORION customized sight, designed to provide a ready to use, improved lethality system, utilizing standard assault rifles, advanced 40mm air-burst grenades and standard 5.56mm ammunition. Since its first introduction in 2004 the system passed several important milestones. In the coming months it is scheduled to complete type classification for the Israel Defense Forces, supporting squad level weapon systems.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>MPRS uses the new ORION customized fire control and sighting system providing navigation, target acquisition, ranging, ballistic computation, ammunition interface as well as day and night capability in a single, compact 600 gr system. The MPRS can be applied to most assault weapons such as Tavor, M4, SA80, INSAS, FAMAS or any other weapon using a standard Picatiny rail.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>The IMI Air Burst Ammunition is configured as a rifle grenade, a 40mm grenade for M203/AG-36 and other grenade launchers, as well as in non-lethal and intelligence applications variants below.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Embedded in a C3 system based on IMI's Warrior Compact Targetor (WACT), MPRS facilitates advanced sensor to shooter capabilities for small task forces.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Airburst 40 mm ammunition</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>The MPRS enables warfighters to use IMI's new 40mm air-burst grenades, at high precision, facilitating an overhead, "around the corner" or "within a window" fire for effect. When associated with IMI's new time-fused, air-burst 40mm grenades, MPRS uses a built-in communications device to set the grenade's programmable fuze to explode the grenade at the required distance and height above the target or around a corner, to achieve the desired air-burst effect. </span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 108pt; line-height: normal;"><span>While the 40mm high explosive airburst grenade is primary ammunition for the MPRS, the system will also incorporate other munition types, including non lethal grenades and an expendable camera fitted to a reconnaissance grenade. The grenade is fired through a ballistic trajectory toward the target, transmitting images of the target through its descent. IMI is cooperating with Israel Aircraft Industries MLM division to develop a command and control system which will be based on MPRS elements and establish effective management and control of infantry units. The system will interface with the warfighter's fire control systems, day/night observation systems (such as binoculars and recce grenades) and personal role radios.</span></p>
