              <p>SS, are you putting people on, or are you just fucking stupid?  If you're going to commit crimes with a registered handgun, you're just asking to get fucked.  Unfortunately, criminals aren't as moronic as you are, and banning handguns isn't going to do a goddamned thing because what they've got is illegal in the first place.</p>

                      35-year-old man was rushed to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a
                      critical condition after being shot in the head and chest at the
                      address about 10pm (AEST). <br><br>Mr Dannatt said the shooting was not related to a bikie gang dispute and instead was an attempted robbery gone wrong. <br><br>The father of five said he was lying in bed when the gunshot was fired.</p>
              He believed the men were trying to break into the home by smashing
                      the patio window with a rifle before one of them was accidentally shot. </blockquote>

              <p>Singapore is a police state, adopting a "gulity until proven innocent" perception, with much harsher laws on crime. It doesn't take a genius to link that to a lower crime rate. However, every system has its pros and cons, we suffer chronically from a fear of State, we fear saying anything controversial, be it of value or not. More often then not, the state keeps in face archaic criminal laws, which its does not enforce after the execution of the crime, instead it keeps the threat of having the ability to prosecute whenever it deems fit, all this to keep us in fear.

              <p>The "police statenness" of singapore is imo, does not really interefere in your life. Instad of thinking that is something dark and sinister, like most singaporeans do, take it in a positive light. U can help the police to enforce law and order for the country.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>Couple robbed by man armed with parang</strong> <br><br><br>A YOUNG couple were trying to find some private time at the Marina Promenade Park (Singapore) when a parang-wielding robber walked up to them and told them to hand over their valuables. <br><br><br>When Mr Razif Hazmi Rahmat's girlfriend, 21, protested, the robber slapped her thigh with the flat of the 60cm blade. <br><br>Speaking to The Straits Times from his flat in Toh Guan Road, Mr Razif, 20, a polytechnic student, said their assailant walked up to them at about 1.30am on Saturday. <br><br>'He threatened to 'hammer' us if we did not comply,' he recalled. <br><br>'He took everything - our bags, handphones, watches and MP3 player - and only gave back our identity cards when we asked for them.' <br><br>The medium-built man wore a black long-sleeved shirt paired with black trackpants. He also wore a black cap. He looked to be in his 40s, was about 1.7m tall and spoke in English, said Mr Razif. <br><br>'But his speech was slurred, like a drug addict's, and I don't think this was the first time he was doing this,' added Mr Razif. <br><br>The robber threatened the couple before he walked off in the direction of Beach Road. <br><br>'He said that if we shouted or screamed for help, he'd come back and slash us,' Mr Razif said. <br><br>The couple fearfully waited until the robber had walked some distance away before fleeing in the opposite direction - towards Marina Square. There, they waited for more than an hour before venturing back to the Promenade Park, near the Kallang River, to get Mr Razif's motorcycle. <br><br>'My girlfriend was in tears, she was so traumatised,'? he said. <br><br>'All I could think of at the time was to stay calm, and getting the whole thing over with by giving him what he wanted, including my ATM PIN number,' said Mr Razif. <br><br>He later found that the robber had managed to withdraw the last $30 in his bank account. <br><br>But he will not step near the area again, he said. 'I think he will strike again and I would not want to go there.' <br><br>Police are investigating and have appealed for anyone with information to contact 1800-255-0000</p></div>

              <p><img id="media-249614" style="float: left; margin: 0.2em 1.4em 0.7em 0px; border-width: 0px;" src="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/media/00/01/128985483.jpg" alt="1642181905.jpg">He claimed today in the High Court that when he placed his hands around her neck and squeezed, he did not intend to kill his 15-year old stepdaughter. This is the claim of 46-year old bus driver, Ong Pang Siew. He says that the strangling death was not deliberate or intentional and he did not know how much force he had applied. The tragic incident occurred on October 20th last year at Ong's ex-wife's (39-year old, Xiu Yanhong) apartment at Marsiling Drive. Today marked the fifth day of Ong's murder trial, and he was cross-examined by Deputy Public Prosecutor Amarjit Singh. The victim was Pan Hui, was the daughter of Madam Xiu from her first marriage in China. Ong and Xiu were married in 2002 and divorced last year. Together they have a son, who is now aged five. Ong stated that he does not know why he was so agitated nor why he constricted her neck. "At that time, she also raised her voice and told me not to disturb her. I was angry with my ex-wife and a little angry with her as well". Ong went one step further and claimed that he was under the influence of alcohol on the day in question. The prosecuter believes this was a ploy for Ong to assume no responsibility for his actions due to loss of control. The DPP asked Ong if he in fact murdered the girl out of revenge for his ex-wife divorcing him and not allowing him access to their son. Ong vehemently denied this allegation. The case continues with an expert witness to appear on behalf of the defence, who will claim that Ong was suffering from severe depression at the time, and hence reduced his mental responsibility for his killing. Ong sobbed uncontrollably while on the stand. In Hokkien, he was heard to say "I am prepared to accept the death sentence if I really did it intentionally. I went to repair our relationship. I also wanted to ask if she was happy to have received her (Singapore) Identity Card". <img id="media-249615" style="float: right; margin: 0.2em 0px 1.4em 0.7em; border-width: 0px;" src="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/media/00/02/570087475.jpg" alt="1374703801.jpg"> Upon further examination of Ong on the stand, it was revealed that Mdm Xiu had taken their son, Cong He, to her Tanjong Katong shop on the day of the tragedy. Earlier he had missed an appointment to see Cong He at the Marsiling apartment and was angry with Madam Xiu for not calling him and waking him up. After arguing with Xiu on the phone, Ong rode his bike to Block 24 Marsiling Drive to see his stepdaughter. But after he arrived, they also got into an argument. Ong claims this was because he had discovered that his son had been beaten. Ong claimed he was surprised when his stepdaughter raised her voice and "appeared to reach for a knife near her computer". He went on to say that a struggle ensued and that was when he pressed his hands on his stepdaughter’s neck and head and asked her why she and her mother were treating him so badly. Ong said "It was only when the ambulance arrived that I realised I had killed an innocent child. Before that, my stepdaughter was motionless and that was when I called my ex-wife to say she had forced me to kill her daughter". He claims that he did not know that the girl was dead and thought she had only passed out. If found guilty on the charge of murder, Ong will face the death penalty. <em><a href="http://www.aussiepete.com/2008/10/strangled-his-stepdaughter-guilty-or.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Article from Aussie Pete</span></span></a></em></p>

              <p><strong>In the following article, which was published in The New Paper, a local Singaporean newspaper, on Nov 7 2007, you get to read for yourself the horrific facts about the way in which some criminals attack others. This article was written by Kor Kian Beng.<br></strong><br><br>'They came out of nowhere'</p>
              <p>THE parang attack ended as swiftly as it had begun.</p>
              <p>In less than five minutes, the attackers had fled the scene after pouncing on a group of seven friends.</p>
              <p>The silence was telling too. It was as if the gang of around eight male attackers was focused on just slashing their victims.</p>
              <p>One victim said the attackers were so quiet that all he could hear was the sounds of parangs slicing their bodies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the ferocity of the attack was never in doubt.</p>
              <p>It left two victims lying in a pool of their own blood.</p>
              <p>One had his left hand nearly chopped off - he "could feel it dangling".</p>
              <p>Another victim managed to flee the scene, but not before getting a deep cut that stretched from his right ear to his mouth.</p>
              <p>A fourth man and the three women who were with them escaped unharmed.</p>
              <p>All three victims, men in their mid-20s, survived the vicious attack, which happened outside Liang Court shopping complex near Clarke Quay at about 4am on Sunday.</p>
              <p>It was the latest in a string of similar horrific incidents.</p>
              <p>The trio, who are colleagues at a pest control company, and their family members declined to be identified when The New Paper spoke to them in hospital.</p>
              <p>All three victims claimed the attack had been unprovoked and that neither they nor their friends had offended anyone recently.</p>
              <p>They also insisted they had not stepped on anyone's toes while partying at the nearby Ministry of Sound (MOS) on Saturday night, shortly before they were attacked.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other knife and blade attacks on victims in Singapore in 2007</span><br></span></p>
              <ul class="noindent">
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bar manager Eugene Chua, 31, beaten up after leaving a pub at Clarke Quay on 23 Apr. He died two days later. Three women and two men have been jailed for the attack. </span></li>

              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;">On the same day, a 17-year-old was attacked by six parang-wielding men at the void deck of Block 463, Tampines Street 44. He suffered injuries on head, back and shoulder. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #ff0000;">An 18-year-old attacked by three parang-wielding men near Block 159, Tampines Street 12 on 15 Jun. He suffered hand injuries. </span></li>

              </strong></p><div id="post_message_2902486"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">IT'S an issue that divides the protectors and those who wish to be protected.</span><br><br>To the police, the law is clear. If an offence is non-seizable, they can't make an arrest. Their hands are tied by the law.<br><br>But for the civilian, it is confusing, frustrating, and at times, infuriating.<br><br>His logic, governed by emotions, is simple: If a person gets beaten up, his assailant should be detained for questioning, arrested, investigated and possibly prosecuted.<br><br>The New Paper reported that Mr Kelvin Lee was punched in the face by a stranger last Wednesday. The blow knocked out four of his teeth and left him with a bloodied mouth.<br><br>Yet, his alleged attacker was not arrested initially because the police had classified the case under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Penal Code.<br><br>This is a non-seizable offence, meaning no immediate arrest. <br><br>Non-seizable offences require a magistrate's authorisation before the police can make an arrest or exercise full powers of investigation.<br><br>But if the police assess that the case is of significant public concern, the investigating officer (IO) will apply for an order to investigate, especially if the victim is young, infirm, elderly or disabled.<br><br>The police have since told Mr Lee that the police would be investigating the case and that he need not lodge a magistrate's complaint.<br><br>But in any reasonable person's book, Mr Lee's injuries may be seen as grievous hurt.<br><br>This was the gist of the letters received.<br><br>Voluntarily causing grievous hurt comes under Section 325, a seizable offence, which empowers the police to arrest the culprit.<br><br>So why did the police not classify Mr Lee's case under Section 325?<br><br>Lawyer Nakoorsha Abdul Kadir points to the categories of injuries listed under the section.<br><br>In the Penal Code, a person who causes 'hurt' is defined as someone who causes 'bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person'. <br><br>But only the following injuries are classified as grievous hurt: castration, permanent damage to either eye, ear or limb/joint, permanent disfiguration of the head or face, or fracture/dislocation of a bone.<br><br>Grievous hurt is also said to have taken place if the victim's life was put in danger, or if he, as a result of the assault, was in severe pain or unable to go about his daily activities for 20 days.<br><br>Mr Nakoorsha said: 'Technically, (Mr Lee's injuries) may not fall into any of the categories.<br><br>'But the police can always upgrade his case to a seizable one (if they later find the assault was more serious).'<br><br>Former police officer Luke Lee, who is now a criminal lawyer , said the police may have their own 'internal guidelines' for Section 323 cases.<br><br>'When I was with the police, we used them to determine how the case should be treated and how far the investigations should go.'<br><br>ALLEGATION<br><br>He declined to disclose the guidelines.<br><br>'But the case should be investigated anyway as there was an allegation of a racist remark,' he said.<br><br>The victim had said his alleged attacker accused him of making a racist remark, which he denied.<br><br>Another former cop, Mr Lionel De Souza, felt the police had 'failed to exercise initiative and prudence'.<br><br>He said he would have arrested<br><br>Mr Lee's alleged assailant.<br><br>'(Mr Lee) was reported to be bleeding from the mouth. To a reasonable man, his injury could be serious,' the private investigator noted.<br><br>'In such a situation, I would, as the IO, classify the case as voluntarily causing grievous hurt, for the purpose of investigation.'<br><br>But, he said that after questioning the assailant and formally charging him under Section 325, he would release him on police bail till Mr Lee's detailed medical report is out.<br><br>'If the report shows his injuries don't fall under any of the categories of grievous hurt, I'd then amend the charge to voluntarily causing hurt.'<br><br>There is another dimension to the issue: The possibility of the police abusing their power if they're allowed to make arrests in all cases.<br><br>It's a matter of exercising discretion, Mr De Souza argued.<br><br>'Police investigators are vested with investigation powers under the Criminal Procedure Code, and they should exercise due diligence and discretion when investigating cases similar to Mr Lee's,' he said.<br><br>The police also do not want people to make indiscriminate reports or to use it as a malicious tool.<br><br>Mr Nakoorsha noted: 'There's a good reason why the police can't just arrest anyone. If (the law allows them to), it will be abused.'<br><br>And he feels victims of assault should not underestimate the power of a magistrate's complaint.<br><br>It's a simple process, he said - go to the court, fill up a form and submit the necessary documents. The magistrate will decide on the same day if the case warrants further investigation.<br><br>'It's a fast and efficient process, and it's free. As long as you show you have grounds for a case, the magistrate will direct the police to investigate.'<br><br>Last year, 3,659 magistrate's complaints were filed, according to a report in The Straits Times last month. Of these, 32 per cent concerned alleged assaults, making it the most common grievance brought before a magistrate. <br><br>If a criminal charge can't stick, the victim can take the culprit to court in a civil suit.<br><br>But that involves a lot more work - and money. The victim has to hire a lawyer, get witnesses and go through other legal procedures. And the burden of proof is on him, Mr Nakoorsha said.<br><br>But while there's legal recourse for victims, the bigger question is: Will the perception that the police lack bite or are reluctant to make an arrest embolden the violent?<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">This becomes more pertinent in the light of recent violence reported in schools and in nightspots.<br><br>Would school bullies now get the signal that it's okay to bash the weak?<br><br>Readers who reacted to the report on Mr Lee's attack raised concerns that there could be a growing disregard for authority.</span><br><br></strong></div><strong>
