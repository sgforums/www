              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large; color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: small;">Gang violence by girls on the rise</span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #008000; font-family: Courier New;">They dress, fight and commit crimes very much like male<br><br></span></em></strong>GIRL gangs are making a comeback, with an attitude and aggression that bear an unsettling resemblance to boy gangs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They dress like the boys, they fight like boys, even the crimes they commit are what the boy gangs are notorious for: rioting, robbing and extorting money, all offences which carry jail sentences.</p>
              <p>One of the five detectives interviewed for this report, offered this snapshot of today's girl thugs: "In the past, girls broke the law in such areas as unlawful assembly, fights over men, and in staring incidents at public places such as discos.</p>
              <p>"Now, they are doing what boy gangs do: breaking into cars to steal, threatening people and demanding money from schoolmates and neighbours."</p>
              <p>Official figures show a disturbing rise in teenage girls committing extortions, robberies and other crimes.</p>
              <p>In the first six months of this year, girls were involved in: 16 robberies, up from five last year; 25 thefts, up from 21; 236 shoplifting cases, up from 188, and 15 extortion cases, up from 10. In 1996, there were no reports of girls involved in extortion cases.</p>
              <p>A total of 310 girls were arrested in the first six months of this year, compared with 273 in the first half of last year.</p>
              <p>The detectives said that the pace picked up last September. They now make two to three arrests a week. Before, one a week was about average. Most of these girl gangsters are between 13 and 17 years old, although the police have come across girls as young as 10.</p>
              <p>Police officers have sometimes mistaken them for boys because of their "short hair, men's shirt, trousers and Doc Martens shoes".</p>
              <p>And when they fight, it is with a vengeance.</p>
              <p>"Before, the girls would scratch and pull each other's hair. Now, they punch, kick and scratch their victims with sharp objects such as small knives. In some cases, they attack with stiletto-heeled shoes, leaving a bloody mess."</p>
              <p>Compared with their forerunners, the Butterfly and Rose gangs of the early Sixties, the gangs today give themselves "cutesy" names like: Xiao Ding Dang (Little Doraemon, a Japanese cartoon character) and Xiao Tian Tian (Little Candy, another Japanese cartoon character).</p>
              <p>They operate in gangs with between 15 and 20 members. Membership comes easy too: Initiation rituals are not required. There's no need to make offerings to Guan Kong (the Chinese God of War), for example. They just wear the same shoes, coloured wrist bands or sport similar tattoos.</p>
              <p>Girl gangs often pick on neighbours or schoolmates.</p>
              <p>Said a detective: "They would extort money from other girls, after accusing them of staring or spreading rumours about them."</p>
              <p>Counsellors who have dealt with these girls say the lack of parental control and attention is the main cause of this rising tide of thuggery.</p>
              <p>Most of the girls are from homes with a history of family abuse or where the parents have marital problems.</p>
              <p>Their parents tend to shrug off the misdeeds, and often ask the police to let the girls off because "they're just kids", the detectives said.</p>
              <p>Even after the girls are convicted and sent to homes or placed on probation, many parents refuse to see that their child is developing into a full-fledged criminal.</p>
              <p>Counsellor Lindy Ong, 35, who has set up a support group in a church for parents with problem teens, said: "Some just leave their kids with us and expect us to perform miracles. They don't even turn up for counselling sessions."</p>
              <p>In a research bulletin issued by the Subordinate Courts, a court official said: "If the young person's undesirable values and erroneous methods of solving her problems are not corrected early, there will be dire consequences."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Alex Lim's car and the taxi had a small collision along Paterson Road on 9 April 2007. A little ahead, at Scotts Road, both of them pulled over as is normal practice, to exchange drivers' identification. An argument broke out and Lee, the taxi driver, refused to provide Lim with his details. He got back into his cab intending to drive off. Lim tried to stop him by positioning himself in front of the taxi.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Lee drove straight into Lim, throwing the latter onto the bonnet. Then he stopped suddenly, throwing Lim forward onto the road. Not only did Lim's girlfriend witness this, apparently so did a passenger in Lee's taxi.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Alex Lim, aged 30, and a financial advisor, has been in a coma since. He's had a part of his brain removed.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">* * * * *</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> <br>In the early hours of last Monday, just outside a Clarke Quay bar, an off-duty bar manager (from a different bar) was attacked. Eugene Chua was so brutally beaten he died in hospital 2 days later. Exactly who did this and why has not been revealed but the police have arrested 2 persons in connection with the</span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span><a id="return2" rel="nofollow" name="return2"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">crime</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;">, and are investigating.</span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#foot2"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">[2]</span></span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">By all accounts, Eugene Chua was very much liked. His boss described him as "a small, spunky, affable and hardworking guy", and his premature death at age 32 was deeply mourned.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">24 hours prior to that savage incident, six teenagers were attacked by 16 young men near the Esplanade. The six claimed that the fight, which included vulgarities and racial taunts, was unprovoked. One of the six, Chan Voon Ho, aged 17, was so badly beaten that he suffered multiple fractures on his face and</span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span><a id="return3" rel="nofollow" name="return3"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">lost nearly all</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> <span style="font-size: xx-small;">his front teeth.</span></span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#foot3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">[3]</span></span></a></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The police are now looking for the 16 other guys. Whether it will be classified as causing grievous hurt, rioting or some other offence is too early to say.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Then we have stories of schoolgirls engaging in "happy slapping", a form of bullying, where a group gangs up on a victim, strip and beat her and record everything on video to be uploaded onto the internet. Such brazen behaviour, I can hardly imagine.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">* * * * *</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> <br>For some years now, I have been disturbed by how quickly Singaporeans resort to violence. Bar fights are common, as is road rage, but even if you're nowhere near a bar or on the road, you can still be beaten to pulp just by looking at the wrong person. "Staring" incidents, a marker of immaturity, can escalate into running battles within minutes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Staring comes out of an animalistic instinct, where one party uses his eyes to establish his social rank over the other. The one who turns away first concedes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In young men, with their testosterone impulses, self-control is already lower than other age groups, but when we stir in low self-esteem, then the challenge is perceived even more acutely. All the more, the staring party, whether initiator or responder, cannot afford to back down. That is why staring incidents leading to fights are typically reported among the less educated or the less economically well-off.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">That being the case, a widening income gap and increasing financial stress for the lower half of society does not bode well at all.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Road rage, on the other hand, involves the better off and the well-educated too. We sometimes hear of people driving Mercedes Benzes getting into a scuffle after an accident. No social class is immune.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">I just wonder if we are increasingly stressed out. Frustrated with working long hours at the office, or no job at all. Or lousy pay while the bosses award themselves huge bonuses. Congestion and crowding as we go from one place to another. Noise all around us even when we reach home, because the damn town council keeps giving out</span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span><a id="return4" rel="nofollow" name="return4"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">getai</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/#foot4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">[4]</span></span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> <span style="font-size: xx-small;">permits....</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Others would put the blame on screen and TV violence. Exactly how media portrayal of violence affects social tendency to violence is not fully established, but it should be no surprise if there is a relationship to some degree. Even indirectly, as in audiences imbibing attitudes regarding fighting for one's sense of honour, or group loyalty right or wrong, can have an effect.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">I have long thought that Singapore over-regulates the depiction of sex and sexuality, and under-regulates the depiction of violence. Sure, people can be influenced by the depiction of sexual lives to adopt different sexual values, but rarely are there victims arising from those new sexual values. On the other hand, violence produces victims, almost by definition.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Moreover, I see instances where our justice system tends to be too lenient on violence too. In an earlier article</span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/arch_1999/yax-148.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The pimp and the cabby</span></span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;">, I pointed out two court cases that occurred at the same time.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In one, a taxi driver tried to run down a pedestrian. Twice. He was given a sentence of 4 months' imprisonment.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In the other, a pimp was sentenced to 4 years in jail, twelve times longer than the taxi driver, someone whose actions could have killed another person. There was no suggestion that the pimp used coercion of any kind to run his business. His "boys" were willing sellers -- that's typical for male prostitution, unlike female prostitution where the power relationship is often unequal -- and his buyers were willing buyers. In other words, there were really no victims.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Besides the question of whether such a disparity in penalties strikes anyone as reasonable, there is also the question of why the police are devoting resources to chasing after victimless crimes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Yet righting the balance in law enforcement, needed though it is, is certainly not the whole answer. We have to identify and address the social causes. They will be many and complicated. First though, we must understand that violence is a symptom of social breakdown, when people feel hopeless or powerless, or just so frustrated with a zillion other things in their lives, they lose control at a snap.  <img src="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/images/bar_red.gif" alt="" width="4" height="12"></span></span></p>

              <p>****** Glad that you agreed that 2 years is a waste of time.
              However, you still don't get me, do you? The suggestion that you've
              suggested, theoritically is great! But you'll not get a chance to
              study. Go serve army and you'll know why I said that.</p>
              <p>******* YOU DO NOT SET THE PRIORITY IN ARMY!!!! YOUR SUPERIOR
              SET IT FOR YOU!!!! Their Priority is your Priority, your Priority
              is not a Priority! Get it?</p>
              <p>******** How sure are you that this is not happening or
              happening??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before i start nailing you, please think before you reply me. I
              enjoy constructive discussion, but not rubbish.</p>
