              <div>Jason, before you venture to advise me on how to solve my problems, i think that you have to answer a few questions:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>1) Since the mods do not get  paid, why are they so <span><span><span>enthusiastic about performing their duties?</span></span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span><span><span>2) I am not the only person who posted the so called nonsenses on SG forum, so why are the mods 'training their guns' on me? Is it because what i am doing hurts the vested interests of some individuals severely?</span></span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span><span><span>3)It is with regards to your mod greengoblin. during his debate with parn, he claims that he follows the instructions of you and fireice, but unfortunately, his conduct is in no way suggesting that he is following instructions. Instead, he seems to be following his own initiatives!</span></span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span><span><span>As for the possible reasons, i don't wish to speculate, so it is up to you to explain publicly in SG forum as why this is the case!</span></span></span></div>
              <div> </div>

              <p>If you enter into this SgForums, you are already a guest in this place - even if you are a paid guest it does not qualify you from not adhering to the house rules.</p>
              <p>It is immaterial if you agree with the Moderators who have been appointed to ensure that guidelines are followed - for obvious reasons.</p>
              <p>If you disagree with the House Rules, you can always pack up and leave.</p>
              <p>Why will you wish to defy the simple courtesy that have been extended to you with your repeated vandalism of good conduct and common sense ?</p>
              <p>Does your repeated attempts at imposing your will serve any purpose but to simply make yourself look like a spoilt brat insisting on having things your way ?</p>
              <p>Try conducting yourself at any hotel, so what if you are a paid guest ?</p>
              <p>Your unruly conduct will have you thrown out without any refund.</p>
              <p>There are more then ways to nab you then you can imagine - don't be too smug that you cannot be reached by the operators of SgForums.</p>
              <p>You will be a joke when your name get splashed as front page news when Jason expose you and bring you to court for your persistent acts of electronic vandalism.</p>
              <p>Bottom line is - stop being a *cb* jerk and nurture your sore *cb* somewhere - learn to grow up and accept disappointments.</p>

              <p>Was he not satisfied with the reasons given for the deletion, or was none given ?</p>
              <p>Even if he is not satisfied with the status quo, he remains a guest in this SgForums and should have at least respected the presence of others in this Forum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does a guest set fire to the place as he is dissatisfied with the treatment given ?</p>
              <p>If he cannot accept the house rules, he should simply pack up and leave, why make a jerk of himself and jerk at others too ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>His attitude is typical of an immature and self-centered Singapore kid, who never learn to grow up, and will expect everything to go his way or there will be no way for anyone else to go.</p>
              <p>Has this not been the common news headlines reported over the last five years.</p>
              <p>There was the male supervisor, who cannot reconcile himself with the fact that his relationship with a girl is over, and is determined to prevent the girl from having a life with anyone else by killing the girl and chopping her body into multiple parts for disposal around Singapore ?</p>
              <p>Then there was the young man - in his early 20s, who was heart broken from a failed relationship due to his insufferable possessive nature, and will stalk his dream girl with such persistence that he became a nuisance with his threatening behavior.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are symptoms of psychological disorder, and shows a clear lack of self-control and a dysfunction in handling disappointments.</p>
              <p>The choice in referring himself as "knnbccb" - in the acronym that takes the 'Hokkien' curse - is already indicative of the sick vengeful nature in the weak human traits of the person behind the nick.</p>
