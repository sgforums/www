            <div class='col-md body'>1. Remove the temasek Holdings frm it's various monopolies<br><br>2. Auction away MediaCorp and its radio division, break up their TV monopoly, and a full audit of their staff and of its accounts. Their govt entity will be removed completely- meaning it will no longer enjoy any special privilges<br><br>3. Starhub's monopoly status of the cable TV industry will also be removed. Now foreign and local cable TV companies will be able to compete in the local cable TV industry for customers. End effect: lower costs and more choices for consumers.<br><br>4. SPH's monopoly of the press will be removed and it's govt entity will be revoked forever. Some of their holdings will also be up for audition and their accounts, staff and various other depts will be held for auditing to see which parts are still viable and which are not.<br><br>5. Reform the ISA laws so that it will not be open to abuse by politicans anymore. No more shall the ISA be used to jail so-called political opponents and instead a case by case basis shall be consider to see if the people held under the newly reformed ISA needs a lawyer and the normal rights that any normal criminals have or not.<br><br>6. Defamation suits will have a cap on the amt of damages a person can sue and it specifically applies to the political lawsuits.<br><br>7. Sack Ho Ching from her current position. She doesn't deserve to be head of Temasek Holdings at all. Off she goes and I wun be shedding tears at all.<br><br>8. Dissolve GIC and shift whatever roles that they used to do back to Finance ministry and MAS. Some of the various assets that they hold overseas will face another huge audit and those found to be unprofitable will be sold off without any questions.<br><br>9. Increase taxes for rich people and give tax cuts to the middle class and lower income classes so as to spur more spending by the middle class &amp; lower income families on everyday goods- which means the economy will benefit.<br><br>10. Reform the CPF system- it needs that and more.<br><br>11. No longer claim that a HDB flat is always an asset- especially if it was bought based on bank loans or the CPF. Because if the loan hasn't been paid, then the HDB flat is no longer an asset but a liability. Upgrading, as a program will also be reviewed as a whole.<br><br>12. With a new private sector, no longer dominated by Temasek Holdings, foreign companies will be further encouraged to come back and re-build their assets in Singapore. Lower taxes will be given to those who come back and generally a new corporate culture will be encouraged so that creative people will be encouraged to come back.<br><br>13. Civil servants, as a whole, will face a review and another audit. And the system will be reformed to reduce red tape and inefficiency as well. Any civil servant found to be lazying around and not doing anything will be liable to face the sack in the quickest time possible.<br><br>14. S'pore will join and sign the Human Rights convention, which affirms that S'pore will respect the individual human rights that is given to the people of Singapore and as such, the state will not be able, under law to violate any S'porean- even if he has committed a crime and is currently jailed.<br><br>15. Foreign policy will not be touched totally but a new approach is certainly needed.<br><br>16. With a free press, media and other as such, Parliament will pass an anti-monopolistic law which will ensure that no company will dominate an industry till the point it dictates the policy without any consideration for the ordinary consumer. if a company does that, or attempts to, lawsuits by its competitors will be ready to challenge that said company. In addition, any other existing GLCs which survive the culling, will not be given any special rights by the govt whatsoever. From now on, they will be very much on their own.<br><br>17. Make it manatory to have a salary cap on how much a minister, a prime minister, a Member of Parliament and a civil servant can draw per month. Bonus schemes will also be reviewed and revised. And there will be no special and useless positions created for anyone anymore. This means the post of Senior Minister and Minister Mentor will be dissolved and no longer be able to be re-created forever.<br><br>18. Also newspapers, TV and magazines will be allowed to print pretty much what they want- except for perhaps hardcore pornography, racial hatrad etc without any fear of defamation or whatever else similar to that.<br><br>19. And also, from that point, no one who is related to any politician will be able to become Temasek Holding's CEO and President. It will be a rule that only people from the private sector will be suitable enough to apply for that job.<br><br>20. Finally, a new policy direction when it comes to sports in S'pore, NS and also other various related manners.</div>

Remove the temasek Holdings frm it's various monopolies<br><br>2. Auction away MediaCorp and its radio division, break up their TV monopoly, and a full audit of their staff and of its accounts. Their govt entity will be removed completely- meaning it will no longer enjoy any special privilges<br><br>3. Starhub's monopoly status of the cable TV industry will also be removed. Now foreign and local cable TV companies will be able to compete in the local cable TV industry for customers. End effect: lower costs and more choices for consumers.<br><br>4. SPH's monopoly of the press will be removed and it's govt entity will be revoked forever. Some of their holdings will also be up for audition and their accounts, staff and various other depts will be held for auditing to see which parts are still viable and which are not.<br><br>5. Reform the ISA laws so that it will not be open to abuse by politicans anymore. No more shall the ISA be used to jail so-called political opponents and instead a case by case basis shall be consider to see if the people held under the newly reformed ISA needs a lawyer and the normal rights that any normal criminals have or not.<br><br>6. Defamation suits will have a cap on the amt of damages a person can sue and it specifically applies to the political lawsuits.<br><br>7. Sack Ho Ching from her current position. She doesn't deserve to be head of Temasek Holdings at all. Off she goes and I wun be shedding tears at all.<br><br>8. Dissolve GIC and shift whatever roles that they used to do back to Finance ministry and MAS. Some of the various assets that they hold overseas will face another huge audit and those found to be unprofitable will be sold off without any questions.<br><br>9. Increase taxes for rich people and give tax cuts to the middle class and lower income classes so as to spur more spending by the middle class &amp; lower income families on everyday goods- which means the economy will benefit.<br><br>10. Reform the CPF system- it needs that and more.<br><br>11. No longer claim that a HDB flat is always an asset- especially if it was bought based on bank loans or the CPF. Because if the loan hasn't been paid, then the HDB flat is no longer an asset but a liability. Upgrading, as a program will also be reviewed as a whole.<br><br>12. With a new private sector, no longer dominated by Temasek Holdings, foreign companies will be further encouraged to come back and re-build their assets in Singapore. Lower taxes will be given to those who come back and generally a new corporate culture will be encouraged so that creative people will be encouraged to come back.<br><br>13. Civil servants, as a whole, will face a review and another audit. And the system will be reformed to reduce red tape and inefficiency as well. Any civil servant found to be lazying around and not doing anything will be liable to face the sack in the quickest time possible.<br><br>14. S'pore will join and sign the Human Rights convention, which affirms that S'pore will respect the individual human rights that is given to the people of Singapore and as such, the state will not be able, under law to violate any S'porean- even if he has committed a crime and is currently jailed.<br><br>15. Foreign policy will not be touched totally but a new approach is certainly needed.<br><br>16. With a free press, media and other as such, Parliament will pass an anti-monopolistic law which will ensure that no company will dominate an industry till the point it dictates the policy without any consideration for the ordinary consumer. if a company does that, or attempts to, lawsuits by its competitors will be ready to challenge that said company. In addition, any other existing GLCs which survive the culling, will not be given any special rights by the govt whatsoever. From now on, they will be very much on their own.<br><br>17. Make it manatory to have a salary cap on how much a minister, a prime minister, a Member of Parliament and a civil servant can draw per month. Bonus schemes will also be reviewed and revised. And there will be no special and useless positions created for anyone anymore. This means the post of Senior Minister and Minister Mentor will be dissolved and no longer be able to be re-created forever.<br><br>18. Also newspapers, TV and magazines will be allowed to print pretty much what they want- except for perhaps hardcore pornography, racial hatrad etc without any fear of defamation or whatever else similar to that.<br><br>19. And also, from that point, no one who is related to any politician will be able to become Temasek Holding's CEO and President. It will be a rule that only people from the private sector will be suitable enough to apply for that job.<br><br>20. Finally, a new policy direction when it comes to sports in S'pore, NS and also other various related manners. </div></blockquote>Bravo!!!<br><br>Your point no. 9 is what I'm looking at.  These will help a lot a lot for middle income to the lower income where it will create good economy and a little prosperity among the retailing business and good cash flow for among lower income people.  Rather than most of the money are being stucked elsewhere or with the Pap members.  Shit government!!!<br><br>Recently, I have work extra to supplement my household expenses, education for my three children, water and electrical bills, medical, school transportation, food, garments, tuitions, personal expenses and transportation, telephone bills, property tax, tV licence, monthly conservancy chargers and bunch of bills.<br><br>I have to redesign my working life, I sought a nightshift job working 7:30 to 8:00am.  Carrying and stacking heavy stuff 18 to 20 kgs percarton of total 624 cartons every night.  I got home at 9:30am washing up and sleep unitl 12:30pm and get to work for another job again at 1:30pm to 5:30pm.<br>Man....is this going to be my life in singapore???<br><br>Every end of each month, I have no money left for saving!!!<br><br>Sometimes, I imagine of getting one of the minister to experience my working life and see what is his reaction.  Although, I may not well educated like other people or as lucky as others.  But do you think that I deserve this sort<br>of working life just to support my family???  How far and how long can I stay fit to continuing working like that???  Freaking government, idiot, blood suckers, hyprocrite, tyrant, bastard.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The point is the system only runs for the benefit of the PAP. Whether the people likes it or not, the PAP will continue to run the system in this manner because it's a huge cash cow for them.<br><br>And also because of the constant 40 years of non stop rule, there is no system of checks and balances to make sure there is no abuse of the principle system.<br><br>The PAP of course, has corrupted the election system for its own benefit and with a monopolistic control over the press, it's inevitable that the PAP is able to get away with it 99.99% all the time. The people of course are blinded by their blind faith in the PAP and they don't realise it or they ignored it completely.<br><br>The way we are going now, we are already slipping to an abyss that we can't get out off.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. I also think that Singapore is not exploited fully Singapore's status as an international Finance Centre.<br><br>I would explore ways to develop singapore International Financial Services Industry. Similarly so, Singapore's attempt to attract foreign law firms into Operating in Singapore has been an abysmal failure. I woiuld look into that too.<br><br>Years ago singapore mentioned that it wanted to be THE centre for Maritime Law in Asia. I'm not sure that has happened yet so i would also look into that.<br><br>Joining the Human Rights Convention is a good idea but without more, it is useless.

            <div class='col-md body'>Many of the points stated are indeed very good. Yes the govt shouldn't be involved in  businesses and should give the media a free hand. Of course the ministers pay should be brought down to a more realistic level.<br><br>Another point I would like to add is: the ruling party and the govt should run independent of each other. This will ensure that the ruling party couldn't use the state apparutus to control the people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lwflee,<br><br>Your posts seem strangely out of sync with the rest; like a voice in the wilderness!! The original post is too broad ranging to provide focus. I think your points are more focussed on the economy and about shifting our economy towards the services sector.<br><br>IMO, the most important element for success is quality of expertise, be it in finance, tourism, legal, consultancy, medical, education, entertainment, etc. (in any case, it is probably true for most enterprises). To be frank, I don't believe our domestic pool of talent is sufficient in quality and numbers to compete with players in North America and Europe.  We would need to attract top talents to come and set up shop and to strengthen local service enterprises. We should also leverage upon our knowledge of the region and build niche markets.<br><br>The authorities are probably doing the right things with various incentives, regulatory framework, promotions and foreign partnerships. However, as with earlier phase of industrialisation, I expect the GLCs will eventually dominate the scene. One could also expect more government service establishments to be eventually privatised and seize the opportunities. Pearlie has suggested the authorities should leave the businesses entirely to the private sector. I rather suspect we do not have sufficient pool of talent in the private sector to make it happen.<br><br>I sympathise with the complaints of some of the other posters about coping with rising costs. Unfortunately, this is an inevitable consequence of economic growth. The government has to deal with the social issue of growing disparity in income and dissatisfaction. More has to be done to ensure the fruits of economic success are also shared by the vast majority of middle and lower income Sporeans.</div>
