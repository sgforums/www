Obviously you "don't speak for all women", only those like you which realistically are few.<br><br><blockquote><br>And let me ask you, smart lass, WHICH is more important - YOUR sense of security or our COUNTRY's? without the guys slogging their butts off in NS, do you think you can sit in the office comfortably with your colleague lending you a shoulder to cry on?<br><br></blockquote>Ay, hallo. I'm a guy. The language you talk is typical of someone kanna brainwashed for being in the army for too long.<br><br>Just call me smart guy  - you can call yourself "smart lass". Of course the country's sense of security is more important than personal sense of security but in reality do the majority of girls at age 18 sense that way? Do girls at 18 while sitting comfortably in office or sipping coffee at Starbucks have a real sense of what the guys go through in NS even when the guys tell them?<br>Come on - most girls don't have a clue to even sayang the guy. "Oh is it", a few nods and next.  Most girls don't give a shit about what the guys go through in NS. Most girls give a damn about how cute the guy is especially an<br>expat. "NS? What is it ah?"<br><br><blockquote><br><br>the guys doing NS aren't having it good either. i know! of cos i know as i was an ex-regular. before you start even claiming that the guys don't understand girls, and demanding that sg do away with NS, START UNDERSTANDING YOUR GUYS!!! how sure are you that other girls with proper brains can't see guys are usually better after NS? just because girls who don't appreciate guys said so?<br><br></blockquote>Ah....it's only when you see and go through it can you UNDERSTAND and APPRECIATE  the guys. Tell me, how many girls are like you, an ex-regular?<br>Pathetically few. How many girls are not like you? Plenty. Let's be real about the majority than minority's view.<br><br><blockquote><br>YOU GIRLS OUT THERE BETTER LEARN HOW TO APPRECIATE our NS GUYS!! give them the necessary support and concern because that will still be what you are going to do after marriage. no? in future if their jobs take them overseas, that'll give you another 'good reason' to divorce?<br><br></blockquote>How can they learn to appreciate NS guys when they don't see and experience it? Merely telling them mostly fall on deaf ears.<br>It never runs deep. How can they appreciate something that doesn't run deep in them? When modern girls (esp@1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> have needs and they are not getting it, it's good-bye most of the time.<br><br>After so much talk, let's not forget the topic - is NS the cause of lotsa breakups and heartaches? Imo, yes! And I'm not kidding. It's definitely a problem and frankly, no one in the "office" recognises it. They're still enrooted in the "we need NS" mindset.<br><br>Should (the current form of) NS be done away? What should be done to NS?...are topics for another day.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know if you guys are going to see this as relevant but 18 and 19 is a pretty tender age, agreed. Army can be alittle alienating to girls coz guys come out with like a whole new language. Some girls enjoy sharing the experience with the guys, esp if they are from the same college and share the same group of guy/gal schoolmates who meet up during the weekends. This helps hold quite a number of relationships together. But some fall along the wayside.<br><br>The other testing period of time is when the girls have completed, say, their U and start their working life while the guy's in the U.  Working life is a whole new ball game. The girls earn their own money, meet older, more worldly guys who are possibly able to show them a whole different side of life. More tests for couples as they experience different things at different times in their lives.<br><br>Even if the r/s passes these two critical stages, there will be couples who part after as long as 10 to 15 years together bec they've drifted apart even without being aware of it.  So at the end of the day, I guess you can just conclude that any r/s has to be worked at and it just can't simply be put down to NS being the cause of alot of breakups and heartaches. It can be one of the many causes but not THE cause.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first my apologies for mistaking u as a girl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ha ha i didn't notice u r 'macJOE'. and don't bash me man! i'm friendly fire if you haven't notice.. i'm speaking up for ns guys ok!!<br><br>okz now,<br><br>most women i know aren't bimbos (want me to intro? keke), so yes, i am speaking for the non-bimbos. if you or your friends are the type who go after girls with looks but no decent brains, then yes, NS is ONE of the causes of break-ups.<br><br>but do you agree with me that most good looking girls won't hang around waiting for guys? why would they when they can have any other guy?<br><br>if you agree with me, then, be it NS or overseas trip, bimbos just won't stay around waiting for you (unless you are RICH by default!).<br><br>of cos, there are always faithful bimbos, albeit in the minority. if you find someone like that, you are damn lucky!!<br><br>what makes you think i'm being brainwashed? i signed on cos i have NO choice. I hate it that's why i left after 6 years (hand in hand with a guy who can't  stand bimbos! lucky me! lol!).<br><br>but no matter how much i hate it, i see the benefits of NS. i have seen batches of batches of NS guys who enlisted and ORD. MOST, if not all, changed for the better. they became more responsible and more committed. Guys with gfs learn how to treasure them when they booked out as <span style="font-style: italic;">Absence makes the heart grows fonder</span>. (note: for bimbos, it's <span style="font-style: italic;">Out of sight, out of mind!</span>)<br><br>they also learn stuff that could not be learnt out there, like integrity and flexibility. and most importantly, NS guys attained the skills of 'covering his backside' when they ORD. now.. tell me those skills aren't useful once you start working!<br><br>I agree with you. most 18 year-old girls have NO idea what NS is all about except for the few like me and those who have elder brothers. why? like you said, they don't understand, that's why they don't appreciate!<br><br>now.. if your gf thinks NS is just like another NPCC or NCC field camps.. where guys sit around a bonfire and sing at night or march a few steps with rifles and have good food to eat, good beds to sleep in... blah blah.. then MAKE HER UNDERSTAND so that she can APPRECIATE YOU!<br><br>many girls aren't interested in NS because when they ask their newly-botak bfs... "oh so how is NS?"... those bloody guys will brush it off by saying ...'arghh.. NS is so stupid.. damn bo liao.. a waste of time... etc etc'.. so don't put all the blame on the girls when guys 'devalued' their own 'machoness as a soldier'. oh yeah.. and don't forget those guys who make love with their beds and TV after they book out.<br><br>So, show your gf your cuts and scratches! (you want her to sayang you right??) , exaggerate your machoness a bit! (tell her you did 100 pushups when you actually did only 10..they won't know!), tell her how siong the exercises and night training are! (even if it's not), tell her the food sucks! (this is true anyway!), describe in gross details the sadistic nature of your instructors! wake her up on sunday morning for mcdonald's breakfast (after 5bx + 2.4!).<br><br>you get tekan in camps, your gf doesn't sayang you, then tekan your gf man! make the 5bx so siong that she won't have enough energy left for the rest of the week... ok lah.. i'm digressing..<br><br>but my point ==&gt; SHARE with them! Make them feel that they are a part of your NS.<br><br>NS can be managed. like the others said, it's now reduced to just 2 yrs, and you can book out often, you can use your hp to fonesex..erm.. chat.. with your gf.. not very different from any relationship out there. it is bullshit if a couple has to SEE each other everyday and to be together everyday in order to 'grow' the relationship.<br><br>if the girl expects you there EVERY TIME she needs you.. i think you are better off in NS with your buddies than be stuck to a SuPerGlue (another form of SPG) for life!!<br><br>oh yeah.. all guys who have went through NS will have ICT.. so it won't be long for her to dump 'the colleague who lent her a shoulder'.. unless that colleague is a bangalee FT or chow ang moh!<br><br>sidenote: You just got jilted by your gf because of NS izzit?<br><br></div>
