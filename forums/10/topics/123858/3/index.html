But then again, if gers are enlisted, the quality of our SAF will dropped drastically.. ha ha! not forgetting women are naturally petty creatures, more probs will surface if forced to live, eat, %%$*, sleep together for extended period of time.</blockquote>I think they are already drafting plans for gers NS. I think i'm offending all<br>women here IF i say the guys can't wait for that to happen.<br><br><blockquote> perhaps if NS starts enlisting gers, our population will be boosted.. cos girls will be busy getting themselves pregnant so that they can be excused from NS! ha ha.. *somebody up there please consider my suggestion hor!*<br></blockquote>Sure lah. Guys and gers dom, cookhouse, showers, etc are just next door<br>if not shared. Land constraint mah.<br><br><blockquote> if girls have to do NS, then guys should also lah.. how would you like it if in future there is an invasion or something, you wife in FBO told you "YOU TAKE THE KIDS OUT NOW!! I WILL COVER YOU!!" .. knn... funny right?</blockquote>If gers do NS and the guys aren't, foul play strikes and cries will be so<br>massive that they'll have no choice but to rope the guys in also to appease<br>and have peace. If it's just gers NS, i'd be the first to abandon ship coz the<br>the thought of a ger forces will motivate the invaders to invade...and<br>capture every ger soldier. Ger in army uniform with button off (cos of hot<br>weather), boots, leather will send the invaders in drooling to capture,<br>copulate and populate.<br><br>But it's the guys who are doing NS and the gers saying NS belongs to guys,<br>not gers then the enemy will still invade and capture the gers after<br>disposing all the guy soldiers. A bit harder now.<br><br>Of course I don't even like an invasion. But if the situation ever arise, I'd like<br>my wife to be able to give the enemy a flying kick in his crotch followed by a<br>karate chop and taekwondo throw on the left and taekwondo throw, karate<br>chop to the right....even after the enemy killed me and go after my sexy wife<br>(if I have at that time). Now that's a deterrent. Invade to get the ultimate<br>deadly prize that can render their most precious manhood tool physically<br>defective sure doesn't sound like a good idea to invade. kekekekekeke!<br><br>But seriously, I'd rather have heavy missiles pointing at the enemy's<br>homeland than deploy our own human forces to fend off enemies. Humans<br>(especially husband, wife, children, grandfather, grandmother) once<br>expended are never replaceable overnight. Missiles once expended can be<br>bought from US the very next day.<br><br>See the shortcomings of our current NS?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
