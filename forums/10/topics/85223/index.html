            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Lately, I was made aware of two troubling instances where MPs intervened in favour of defiant students. Briefly outlining the two cases:<br><br>The first involved a student who has a history of defiance. Throughout the year, she already accumulated numerous defiantce and violent offenses but she finally crossed the line and assaulted a female teacher, leaving marks on the teacherÂ’s body. She was punished and made to promise, together with her parents that she would leave the school if she broke another rule. Less than a week later, her friend and her cornered a younger girl and repeatedly slapped her in full view of the school. After being caught, she still threatened to beat that girl up after school. She was asked to leave.<br><br>The next was a student who repeatedly played truant. Sometimes disappearing for weeks. Even his parents did not know where he went. When he was in school, he assaulted another student. For exams, his teachers had to call him every morning to remind him but still he missed half of his papers. Sent for counseling, he defaulted all sessions but two. Finally, he was asked to leave.<br><br>So what did they do? They went to see their MPs, who ruled in their favour and wrote helpful letters on their behalves. What troubles me is this:<br><br>1.	Do the MPs know what kind of students they are helping?<br><br>Inevitably, when parents see the MP, they would not portray the offences of their children in full detail. IsnÂ’t it prudent and wise for MPs to check with the school first? I heard from friends that in such cases, the schools were labeled as being Â“uncompassionateÂ” and the offenders as Â“victimsÂ”. The school was neither consulted nor had its records on the students examined before a decision was made in favour of the offender.<br><br>2.	What does the MPs action imply?<br><br>Since the MPs do not check the background of the student with the school before he/she dole out Â‘compassionÂ’, does it imply that the MPs do not trust or give due credibility to the school? DonÂ’t they realize that schools do not remove students without very good reasons? By siding with these recalcitrant children, the MPs had given these students a reason to be bolder because they know that the school canÂ’t touch them because they have their MPÂ’s backing. Does it sound far-fetch that children would see it that way? Those who have any association with todayÂ’s youths and parents know that it not unlikely at all. A schoolÂ’s authority is severely undermined when MPs try to intervene in its discipline decisions.<br><br>3.	What about the welfare of the rest of the students?<br><br>These students, as mentioned posed a threat to the other students who really want to learn. While I agree that compassion is an ingredient of education, so is discipline. Compassion should be extended to repentant students, not those who do not cherish their opportunity to learn and those who posed a threat to other students. Without discipline, a school cannot teach. It also could not ensure the safety of its students. I wonder what would an MP do if a parent would appeal to the MP to pressure a school to remove a bully? Probably it would be shunted back to the school as an Â‘internalÂ’ matter.<br><br>Schools could try all they want to keep the discipline, ensure learning and good upbringing but its efforts are defeated because students and parents know they could bring a greater authority to bear on the school to get their way.<br><br>Any reason why a parent would want to rein in his children's behavior in school if he knows that the school can be overruled?<br><br>What do you think will happen to our youths?<br><br>Would we go the way of Japan?<br><br>Thoughts and comments please.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The letters from what I know is written to MOE. And then MOE leans on the school to reinstate the kids. I am not sure whether the principal has the final say or not, but with so many bigwigs leaning on him, i doubt they can fight it. Just look at the Nanchiau incident, MOE will rather side a liar who dared to kick up a public fuss over a man who gave them more than 20 years of his life. What more do you think MOE will do when it is an MP who comes barking at them?<br><br>perhaps those who know of similar cases could share how it actually goes. i'm sure its not isolated to the 2 cases i know of.</div>

It is just a letter of appeal. But normally, with such a letter of appeal, the school will just relent. After all, you don't want the MP to look bad and 'powerless'. Especially if the MP is your school's patron.<br><br>The school principal is given autonomy to decide on expulsion and such. MOE seldom directly countermands the school principal...but if your supervisor asks you to 'give him some face', would you ? Especially as he's the one who decides if you get your superscale the next year ? Sometimes you don't need to over-ride to get things done.<br><br>There are many things happening around us that occurs out of black and white laws and rules. Welcome to the real world, buddy.</div>
