            <div class='col-md body'>In general i think personally that there's is nothing much relevance that you can attained in national service...ARMY in partiular that woul;d be of much relevance to the real world.I think it's more of being conforming to guidlines so outdated and unneccesarry and of course taking up our youth away.<br>Yes,the time we spent could have been better used to study for a degree,get a better paying job and doing much more other creative activities...making full use of ourselves.cAN'T BELIEVED THAT SOMEWHERE IN OUR nsf LIVES there would be a time or another where pple like the regulars would be lecturing u to be "spending and making full use of your army life"Try saying that to themselves with a mer 3 digit pay to your pocket every month and drooling the actual thoughts that you could have been making more money outside to mee your needs...<br><br>Sleeping in the army...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA.....if army is all abuiot sleeping more than anything else...oh God..would any sensible person after graduating from a polytechnic or Alevels,take this as a job..getting paid 3 digit salaries for just sleeping mmuch of the time....yeah that would be a good break from the years of studying spent before enlisting...wake up la...when are our girls ever going to grow up sometimes......<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,<br><br>NS could be beneficial, depending on our superiors.<br>But it will certainly NOT be if we have:<br><br>1) Miserable superiors who haven't even gone for basic management courses.<br>2) Miserly superiors who make life difficult for NSFs by introducing all sorts of stupid rules that's as senseless as the people who introduced them.<br>3) Superiors who backstab and thus destroy the cohesiveness in the unit.<br><br>Ain't happening for you? Well, these situations are well alive and kicking in my unit. Not only that, they're starting to mutate beyond our control.<br><br>I think we would generally be satisfed if we were working under compentent superiors. People who know how to motivate and show concern for NSFs. Some units operate as if there were only 6 SAF core values. Even 2 years can seem like 2 days, if you are working under the right superiors. Or it can seem like 20 years.<br><br>That's besides the fact that we have to live through the monotony of regimentalism for 2 freaking years! It may be true that NS prepares us for the aftermath, but it also must be true that if I had to choose between 2 regimental jobs that pay me $350 and $3500 respectively, I'd be happier to put up with the rules for a more substantial pay. Which is sadly, not the case in NS. Sometimes, my unit's NSFs are told to report at a particular place by 7am. Usually, this place would be in Tuas, since we manage NSmen who have their in-camp training there. Some of us live as far away as Pasir Ris, and there's no way we could have gotten there even if buses came with ten wheels. Not mentioning those who own vehicles, the only way the rest of us can get to Tuas by 7am is to take a cab. A one-way trip would easily cost $20 if we are living in the East. However, standing SAF directives are such that we can only make transport claims if we are travelling from camp to camp. Fantastic, isn't it? We earn less than what an illegal immigrant from China would have earned in a month here, and yet we're expected to be so generous.<br><br>Never mind if we had to go through this crap for people who appreciated our work, who even bothered about our welfare. However, the sad truth is that many superiors in SAF only bother about their careers. They expect NSFs to do the sh*t they don't want to do and to tie up their loose ends for them. When they've attained whatever they wanted to attain, we do not get a pay rise or other benefits. All we get are more rules and more sh*t from them. Ungrateful? Well, maybe we could look on the brighter side... maybe it's because they haven't any management credentials, that's all.<br><br>Hey I better not talk too much more, if I already am. Who knows, maybe they installed spy cameras in my room. And by the way, insubordination is not equal to NSF being rude to superiors. It is equal to NSF stating facts that face-seeking superiors cannot accept.<br><br>Have a pleasant day ahead <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

What's more, even as a reservist, one still has to apply for an exit permit even to visit Johor. Just compare and contrast this with Schengen member states. A Frenchman can travel from one end of EU to the other without passing through a Customs checkpoint. In short, it is easier to leave France than leave Singapore.</div>
