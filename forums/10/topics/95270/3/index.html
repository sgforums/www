So itsn't that what you want?<br>And one more thing, just curious lah, instead of planning to travel round the world to those remote places and help the people there, why don't you help out in orphanages and old age homes locally? They are really in need for volunteers.<br>If you really want to help somebody, saying that national service impedes you is pure rubbish. I have friends who volunteer everytime they book out. It is just whether you are willing to do it or not.</div></blockquote>true,it's the time left after performing that upon bk out.Without NS,it would have been easier to be left with much more time to help even more than what hecould possibly do.NS does a service to you to mature you and givs you the experience on life??think again..talk to pple from liberal countries and you would notice the youhs grows up solid without the intervention of the govt like ours and of course without any self professing credits ple would try to get..like our dear SAF</div>
