When combined with the power to have a negative impact on those discriminated against in this way, racial persecution has been the source of extreme hardship for particular minorities, considered as aliens within particular societies.<br><br>The United Nations uses a definition of racist discrimination, laid out in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and adopted in 1965:<br><br>"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life."<br><br>Assuming that every individual's character can be adequately determined by racial or ethnic stereotypes is race prejudice, and giving or withholding privileges based on such stereotypes is racial discrimination. The term racism is sometimes used to mean a strong and persistent bias towards these activities<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism</a><br><br></div>
