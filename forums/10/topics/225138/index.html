Singapore has to remain an education hub and a place of choice for people around the region as well as from further afield like from China, India.<br><br>It's a calibrated exercise. We don't want to jack up fees by very large sums all at once but we have to start making a clearer differentiation." --Education Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.<br><br>In order to "start making a clearer differentiation" while "remain an education hub and a place of choice for people around the region" (I presume it means jacking up education cost for foreigners while keeping it low, to keep it affordable for them), does that means more subsidies for foreigners?<br><br>So we will see more %age of bursaries given to foreigners?</div>
