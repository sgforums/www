From what I see, Iraq has nuclear capability, and will not hesitate to use it. With that, and the fact that Saddam's regime is under the "axis of evil", it is all right that US attacks iraq to disarm them of that capability and overthrow Saddam. Who cares if their army is weak? All the better for everyone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun exactly support war, but I hope Saddam will be exterminated. You never know when he might decide to attack the world if we dun stop him in time.<br><br>But, I'm afraid it will turn out to be like Afghanistan's case. So many innocent victims killed because US miss-cue... Also, so what if they got rid of Taliban? They din find Osama(root of the prob)...<br><br>If US is going to war this time. They have to make sure they do a good job. Get rid of the big bad guy and dun harm the innocent folks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[i] i think many people think that US is  bullying a weaker country. But for me, i think that the war is fair. IRAQ is also counted as threatening. They have Mass Destruction weapons that is stronger than anything.<br>Even better than US new weapons. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  So they are equal . But if not for the case of the both world trade center  fall, the america would not attack iraq as iraq is closely connected to osama.[/b]</div>
