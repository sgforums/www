              <h1>When will “spin”ster Dr Chua spin another story for us again ?</h1>
              <p><strong>By Eugene Yeo</strong></p>
              <p>Wherever you go these days, be it the kopitiams, markets, internet
              cafes, restaurants or pubs, the topic of the day will invariably turn
              to the castastrophic losses suffered by our SWFs, Temasek and GIC,
              which at last count, is over SGD $100 billion dollars.</p>
              <p>Tongues have been wagging on how the government manage to lose a
              bulk of our reserves and still remain eerily silent on the matter.
              Massive protests would have erupted in other countries as illustrated
              by Iceland. The calm and quietude on the surface seem too surreal to be
              true.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The issue was not debated in Parliament. The country’s leaders have
              not issued any public statements to allay public concerns. Neither has
              the press published any reports on it.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Speaking at a dinner celebrating Standard Chartered Bank’s 150th
              anniversary in Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has called on
              foreign banks to take a long-term view in their investment in
              Singapore. There was no mention on the “long term” investments of
              Temasek and GIC which are now in limbo.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The state media has been busy painting a rosy picture of how the
              various state agencies are doing their utmost to help Singaporeans tide
              through the storm, the latest being the Public Transport Council’s
              “kind gesture” to reduce the transport fare by 2 cents.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Is the PAP really ignorant of the endless rumblings on the ground
              which is whipping up a frenzy in both the internet chatrooms and the
              HDB heartlands ? Has it really lost touch with the people ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps Prime Minister Lee doesn’t feel the need to explain his
              wife’s investment decision to lesser mortals like us which is after all
              deemed as a private matter between both of them to be settled in the
              confines of their bedroom. Or according to his warped logic,
              Singaporeans have accepted the SWFs’ losses heartily because there were
              no protests outside Parliament House.</p>
              <p>Even during the Mas Selamat fiasco last year, opposition MP Low Thia
              Kiang manage to put up a half-baked wayang in Parliament when he
              appeared to be stunned by PM Lee’s direct question to him if he felt
              that Wong Kan Seng should resign. Low is nowhere to be seen too at this
              critical juncture where leadership from the opposition is solely needed
              and missed. (I forgot Low doesn’t regard himself as an “opposition” MP,
              he yearns to be a constructive “watchdog” of the PAP).</p>
              <p>Will the matter simply go away if the authorities continue to put up
              the facade that nothing has happened ? In the absence of official news
              release, half-truths, rumors and lies are spreading like wildfire in
              the populace which will eventually erode public trust and confidence in
              the government.</p>
              <p>The PAP should be astute enough to realize the long-term
              repercussions for keeping mum on their latest blunder now. Like in the
              past, the Chua sisters will always intervene just in time to save their
              skin.</p>
              <p>So when will Dr Chua, our psycho-psychiatrist who has the uncanny
              ability of diagnosing personality disorders in opposition figures from
              afar without even examining them spin another fairy tale for us again ?
              Do not be deceived by her reticence so far for it is probably a
              delaying tactic to wait for the public fury to subside first before she
              start concocting her potent “red pill” to mislead the crowd again.</p>
              <p>I reckon she will use some if not all of the following:</p>
              <p>1. Quote figures from other SWFs such as the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi
              which have lost more money than us to put “things into perspective” so
              as to exonerate Temasek and GIC from their dismal, if not disastrous
              performance.</p>
              <p>2. Solicit the views of some authoritative figures in the banking
              industry to defend the SWFs’ investment decisions on the usual pretext
              that they were sound at that time and nobody was able to predict the
              extent of the financial turmoil then.</p>
              <p>3. Release selective figures from Temasek and GIC to defend its
              track records of generating annual returns and that they had merely
              lost what they had earned through “prudent management” over the last
              few years.</p>
              <p>4. Interview some grassroots leaders for them to express
              their evergreen confidence and trust in the government to create the
              false impression that the people are genuinely behind them.</p>
              <p>5. When all else fails, resort to the usual “ku3 lou4 ji4″ by
              tugging at Singaporeans’ heart chords with the gentle reminder yet
              again that Singapore will not be where it is today without our
              godfather Lee Kuan Yew. (YUCKS !!!)</p>
              <p>Rest assured we will be seeing a repeat of the Mas Selamat wayang
              kulit in which PM Lee “disappeared” for almost two weeks before
              slamming Low Thia Kiang in Parliament only after his father had spoken
              out on the matter. A few days later, Chua Lee Hoong wrote a “let’s move
              on” article to tie up the loose ends.</p>
              <p>Will Low Thia Kiang serve as the “punching bag” again to make PM Lee
              look good ? Will another wayang COI filled by the henchment of
              PAP be called eventually to appease Singaporeans?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unless Singaporeans start to make themselves heard in the
              public arena such as a protest at Hong Lim Park drawing the attention
              of the international media, the PAP will never take us seriously and
              all our online grouses will remain forever, in the words of one
              Rear-Admiral, “unhelpful comments”.</strong></span></p>
