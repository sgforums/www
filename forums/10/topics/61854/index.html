He graduated from Shanghai's Fudan University, obtained his Master's from the CAS Institute of Semi-Conductors and his doctorate from Drexel University in Philadelphia.<br><br>After returning from the US, he started a number of IT-related companies.<br><br>In 1991, he was named CAS vice-president responsible for research in IT-related dual-use technology. Since then, he has worked closely with the PLA's General Armaments Department.<br><br>Given his meteoric rise, it is an even bet he will eventually head the department and become a key PLA player.<br><br>Straits Time: 14 November 2003<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,219806,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,219806,00.html?</a><br></div>
