            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">21st Century...Same Poor Prostitutes</span>....</strong><br><br>Some of you in the media reads this forum. Of this I am sure. In the course of the just-concluded General Elections, I have seen some of you in action. Lee Ching Wern, T Rajah, Ken Kwek, Sue-Ann Chia, Peh Shing Huei, Aaron Low, Derrick Paulo....<br><br>From what I have observed, you guys are the same ordinary people as us - with a job to do. I have also seen you guys keepng late nights, braving the unpredictable weather. I applaud you for your endurance.<br><br>I have also read your reports.<br><br>Some are fair, some are certainly not. Most are skewed. I know this because I was there for every rally - The Workers' Party rallies. I have to say that the reports were not comprehensive and most of the time, the WP's main points were either ignored or played down.<br><br>There is talk going around that some of you have threatened to quit the last few days of the elections because of the self-censorship that was employed by your 'higher-ups'. I do not know how true that is.<br><br>You yourselves have seen the opposition members in action - you have followed them in their walkabouts, seen them braving the weather, day and night, trying their whole-soul best in getting their message across to the electorate.<br><br>Certainly, you would agree with me that the WP's candidates are not 'people whose integrity are questionable', nor are they 'donkeys', nor 'liars', nor 'wayang' people.<br><br>You know this because you too were there at the rallies - you heard what the candidates have said. You have had personal one-to-one interviews with them. You know that they have tried to accomodate every one of your requests.<br><br>You know that they are honest, credible, hardworking singaporeans whose only purpose in standing for elections is to better the lives of their fellow singaporeans.<br><br>Yet, why do you allow your media to go on a campaign of distortion, censorship, and misrepresentation?<br><br>The WP has fought this GE with dignity, respect - for their opponents and themselves) - and a huge amount of focus on the issues.<br><br>The WP did not resort to name-callings, threats of lawsuits, condescending attitudes towards their opponents.<br><br>On the other hand, the PAP had found it necessary to name-call ('donkeys', 'wayang', 'liars', 'questionable integrity', etc..) The PAP had shown an absence of respect for their opponents, their campaign was focussed on character assasination.<br><br>Why then did you in the media allow yourselves to be the tools in this vile, vulgar and despicable campaign of the PAP?<br><br>You, the journalists on the ground, may not be responsible for what we read in the media reports on tv and in print. But that does not mean that you can't stand up for what is right and what is true.<br><br>If you can't stand up for that, at least stand up for what is professional.<br><br>For, are you not professionals? Does not integrity of your profession mean anything to you? What then of common basic decency to treat your fellow Singaporean - even is he/she is an opposition member - with basic fairness?<br><br>This GE therefore is not just about how the PAP ran a vindictive campaign. It also showed all Singaporeans the kind of media that is without doubt, among the worst in the world.<br><br>Truly, a 3rd world, 3rd-rated media.<br><br>I am shamed of you guys. I truly am. In helping out with the WP, I have seen the immense struggle and obstacles that they face. One of which is to overcome media bias.<br><br>I am ashamed also because in Singapore, being good, honest, and caring of your fellow Singaporeans is not enough. One has to be able to play politics too.<br><br>BUT I am immensely proud of the way the Workers' Party ran and conducted their campaign. In this, they stand head and shoulders above all the other parties - especially and even above the PAP.<br><br>I sincerely hope that you guys in the media will take some time out and think about it. Search your conscience.<br><br>All we are trying to do is to make singapore a better place.<br><br>Do not paint us as criminals.<br><br>We love Singapore as much as you do.<br><br>Indeed, the fact that we are standing forth and risk everything perhaps shows that we love Singapore MORE than you.<br><br>It is unfortunate that the label "Poor Prostitutes" which the  late David Marshall first coined for the local media, still applies.<br><br>And here we are in the 21st century.<br><br>It is once said that 'Singaporeans deserve the media that they get'. I would say then that the media deserves the label that they get too.<br><br>And after observing the media in this GE, most Singaporeans agree.<br><br>Contributed by Peasant_MoNkEy.<br></div>
