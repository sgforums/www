            <div class='col-md body'>WASHINGTON - The subprime mortgage crisis is not likely to end anytime soon -- and could create losses of between $50 billion and $100 billion, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee today.<br><br>"Rising delinquencies and foreclosures are creating personal, economic and social distress for many homeowners and communties," he said, "problems that likely will get worse before the get better."<br><br>And, he noted, "the credit losses associated with subprime have come to light and they are fairly significant.<br><br>"Some estimates are in the order of between $50 and $100 billion of losses associated with subprime credit products."<br><br>Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., found some hope in the Fed's newly aggressive attitude toward lenders, as well as fresh efforts to get more and better information to consumers.<br><br>He said he was "pleased" that Bernanke was taking some steps, but added "I want to see more action."<br><br>So did others.<br><br>"We're deeply concerned that the sub-prime problem is not going to just be contained so easily, but could deeply spread and have some repercussions out there," said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, top Republican on the committee.<br><br>Bernanke, though, would not provide much solace.<br><br>"There are clearly going to be significant financial losses associated with the faults and delinquincies on these mortgages," he said. "As a result, the credit quality of [many products] that include in them substantial amounts of subprime mortgage papers is being downgraded."<br><br>The Fed has been moving quickly to address possible unfair and deceptive practices by lenders, and held a hearing last month to discuss pre-payment penalties, the use of escrow accounts for taxes and insurance and other issues.<br><br>Other reviews are underway, as Bernanke Thursday proposed changes that would "address concerns about mortgage loan advertisements and solicitations that may be incomplete or misleading."<br><br>And, Bernanke said, those rules would "provide mortgage disclosures more quickly, so that consumers can get the information they need when it is most useful to them."<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.courant.com/business/hcu-subprime0719,0,4480607.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.courant.com/business/hcu-subprime0719,0,4480607.story</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>with regards to the topic title: "Will there be another Financial Crisis?" my observation is that when everyone is expecting it, it won't happen for the simple reason that people are expecting it and taking preventive measures.<br><br>Sure, there will be fall outs but not to the extent of a full blown FINANCIAL CRISIS.<br><br>Individual crisis, definitely. Only the individuals (or individual countries, individual companies) can prevent it, like making sure that their cash flow will not be affected so badly by the fall out until it brings them to their knees.<br><br>What you can do is ensure that your personal debt level is affordable and can withstand reasonable shocks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Ask the cat.  If it knows who is to die next, perhaps it can tell whether this stock market crash is a crisis to come or not.<br><br>NEW YORK (AFP) - He is a two-year-old cat and looks innocent enough. But at the nursing home where he lives in the US state of Rhode Island, Oscar has developed a reputation as an angel of death.<br><br>Since being adopted as a kitten by staff at the advanced dementia unit of Providence's Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Oscar has revealed a rather morbid tendency to pick which patient is going to die next.<br><br>According to David Dosa, a geriatrician at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Oscar makes regular rounds, looking in on patients and giving them a quick sniff, before either moving on or settling down for a cuddle.<br><br>So accurate have his predictions been, that as soon as the white and tabby harbinger of death curls up with one of the patients, staff immediately start summoning family and clergy to the soon-to-be deathbed.<br><br>"No one dies on the third floor unless Oscar pays a visit and stays awhile," Dosa wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.<br><br>"His mere presence at the bedside is viewed by physicians and nursing home staff as an almost absolute indicator of impending death, allowing staff members to adequately notify families," he added.<br><br>"Thus far, he has presided over the deaths of more than 25 residents."<br><br>Dosa did not offer any explanation for Oscar's uncanny powers of prognostication, which patients were not yet believed to have spotted.</div>
