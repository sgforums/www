            <div class='col-md body'>129745.1<br><br>Today lunch time i order chicken rice, this stall owner is so good.<br><br>Normally his chicken rice is $2.50 per plate.  He subsidized me $0.50 from the market rate and charge me only $2.00.<br><br>Next time must patronise more since the stall owner is such a caring person.<br><br>He also ask me to vote him as best chicken rice every 5 year if i want to continue to enjoy the subsidy.  He will give out free chicken rice before the voting.  If he wins the award, there might be some Adjustment to the pricing but dont worry, you will still be<br><br>Yeah, I also patronize the same chicken rice stall that you do. And I agree with you, he really is very caring. In fact, he is so caring I think we should call him an ELITE amongst all the caring chicken rice stall owners.<br><br>Recently our caring chicken rice stall owner implemented a new policy. Every time we buy chicken rice from him, there will be a stranger from another land who will come and sit beside us and help us eat our serving of chicken rice. The stall owner said we cannot possibly finish all the chicken rice on our own, so a foreigner must come and help us finish it. The stall owner said we should be grateful to the foreigner for helping us eat our chicken rice even though we paid the full amount for it and the foreigner paid nothing.<br><br>The foreigners are very good indeed. In order to reward them well, all foreigners will queue up in front of us during peak hours, and they will always be served first. Also, local customers like us will have to help the stall owner perform Stall Service by helping to clean the freshly slaughtered chickens and washing the dishes after use. The Stall Service will be implemented for all local customers above the age of 18, and will last till they are 21. In addition, all local customers have to serve 2 to 3 weeks of Stall Service every year until they reach the age of 40 or so. Of course, the foreigners who eat our chicken rice for free don't need to perform Stall Service.<br><br>I love our chicken rice stall owner! And will sure vote him the Best chicken rice stall owner every 5 years!<br><br>The chicken rice stall owner is also very creative; he keeps his customers happy with a deal - you can buy a 'permanent' seat for a subsidized price. Well, it is not actually permanent but just a 99-year lease, a minor technicality as the customer still owns the seat during his life time.<br><br>Customers are willing to buy seats coz the stall owner claim that the seat is heavily subsidized. You see a seat is always a hot item on busy days, thus by the creative calculations of the stall owner, worth alot of $$$. If you own a seat, you will always have a seat even on busy days. Imagine, you don't need to stand around to wait on busy days. For that convenience, you pay a subsidized price because you are a loyal customer.<br><br>Why would anyone want to go to another chicken rice stall owner when there is such an efficient and creative one?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually hor, if I remember correctly, I voted for him as best chicken rice in 1994 (or 95, cannot remember) when a keling vendor turned up with power assistants. But he said one of the keling assistants was chauvinist cos the assistant only sold white chicken and not roast chicken as well. So I gong gong voted for him mah. What to do, even though I went to a world class university, that does not mean I have a world class blain.<br><br>Anyway, can you imagine my shock in 2001 (or izzit 2002) when there were no tender and I did not get to vote? Turned out that even though my subsidized seat did not move physically, it was now part of another Great Relak Corner. strange leh.<br><br>Anyway, for some reason, the Great Relak Corner other vendor also wan in 2006. But by then, I decided not to eat chicken rice leow. Anything but chicken for me. The problem now is my subsidized seat how?<br><br>Today lunch time i order chicken rice, this stall owner is so good.<br><br>Normally his chicken rice is $2.50 per plate.  He subsidized me $0.50 from the market rate and charge me only $2.00.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br><strong>Sorry dumbo, your calculation is wonky. The market price for chicken rice a la Mandarin is $20 + + +.<br><br>The hawker is subsidising or giving you discount of at least $20. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></strong><br><br><strong>What about yellow chicken from ? What if you breed it with white cockerel? Will it make good chicken rice?<br><br>What much will be subsidised?</strong><br><br>Even though i bought one seat, i still have to pay other monthly charges for that seat. Still i am considered one of the lucky ones to be able to buy a seat cos according to the owner it is heavily subsidized.<br><br>But now i am working my arse off to pay for this seat!!!<br><br>Main thing is that it is affordable, even it takes you 30 years to pay it.<br><br>Juz spoke to the chicken rice seller.  He said if he worked in a 10 star restaurant, he could charge $2,000 per plate.  So u're right lah, the market price is $25 and it's heavily subsidised at $2.50.<br><br>Actually hor you must take your hat off to them.<br><br>They have a fantastic marketing strategy.<br><br>They tell you that chicken rice is an important staple food and we must have enough people willing to sell chicken rice. Cos not every good cook or talent may want to sell chicken rice. So there must be some support to the price structure. but from what i understand whenever people want to open chicken rice stall, they will point fingers and criticise and also try to find ways to make it difficult for other stalls to open.<br><br>And one of the sales line is that - "we do this business not for money but so that all of you can have chicken rice during lunchtime."<br><br>Another sales line - They will tell you the cock and bull story about how sometimes chicken rice in the hotels and restaurants can cost S$25 a plate and we ought to be grateful to have chicken rice for S$2/-.<br><br>One other sales line - To give you a little more chilli would have to raise price to cover costs.<br><br>the last time i knew they gave me some old cucumber as garnish and said that it was the special for the day and it would make the rice taste better. And charged me 30cents for it. The problem was - i did not ask for the cucumber!<br></div>

He told me to consider the rest in the queue and thats the reason why he adopts balloting. I told him that I earn very little and 50% of my income goes to food and as its hard earned and I am paying for it, I should be able to make a choice. He told go and hire my own chef.<br><br>My parents are ever so grateful that he adopts balloting and they are very happy as they aleast get to eat something.<br><br>He's indeed lucky.  Last time I said sorry when he raised his voice after I pointed out to him that he made a mistake with my order and he wanted me to explain why I said he made a mistake.  He said he even got cctv to back him up.<br><br></div>
