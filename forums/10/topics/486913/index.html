So the real reason why people get married and have kids is to get leave from work to enjoy themselves (free bonus $$$ (next paragraph)) ???!!!<br><br>Kids of unwed moms are also INELIGIBLE for 'Baby Bonus Cash Gift and Child Development Account': so the 'child development account' is a reward to the parents: can use for 2nd honeymoon is it???!!! Likewise, the baby bonus cash is a reward to married couples for having unprotected sex and the proof of it???!!!<br><br>Also, unwed moms are ineligible to claim 'handicapped child relief' or even 'qualifying child relief': how then are handicapped kids of unwed moms expected to receive the best care possible for their handicapped???!!: I believe that the PAP thinks either that all foetuses of unwed moms should be aborted or should suffer ostracism and neglect so severe to the extent that they wish daily that they would have died even <strong>before</strong> they were born.<br><br>I think CCS in this regard is a joke and probably just another rubber stamp minister who simply graduated from being a rubber-stamping, coat-tails, walkovers GRC MP.<br><br>Indeed, in the land of Lee dynasty, some people are MORE EQUAL than others, as for the pledge we said daily in primary school:<em> "a democratic society based on justice and equality"</em>: was that all just grandstanding / subterfuge? What is the truth?<br><br>To deprive a child of priority in the queue for luxuaries one thing, to deprive a child of bare necessities simply shows what a mean hearted person Minister Chan Chun Seng is. Shame on you Minister, U have deprived a generation of Singaporean kids of the barest of necessities and the handicapped ones will also surely curse U should they suffer/ actually die.<br><br><br><br><a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/children-get-same-benefits-whether-mothers-are-married-or-not-msf?singlepage=true">Children get same benefits, whether mothers are married or not: MSF | TODAYonline</a><br>
