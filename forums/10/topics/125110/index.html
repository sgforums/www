A swallow does not make a summer. The denial or justification sydrome seems quite persistent. With every justification put on shows there will again be delays to solutions of real problems to cause yet more sufferings of many affected.<br><br>The old ways and outdated tax-and-recover governance are overwhelmingly  used as easy way of creating surpluses without much creativity. The acclaimed remaking of past pro-foreign economic model is taking a long time to show any results.<br><br>Go survey and interview objectively to see how are the domestic sector benefitting from any overall master entrepreneurial plan or master economic strategy. They are suffering greatly.<br><br>Most of the 20 problems of autocracy as posted in "Definition of True Democracy" e.g. high costs of living and loss of economic competitiveness due to lack of promotion of local domestic sector of the economy are not yet solved or receiving any particular attention. So I can agree only with half of your statement - government is now trying something. The major problems and great hardship are denied or overwhelmed by the media with slanted reporting. The few lucky ones are those working within the circle or networks registered for ongoing opportunities or getting good deals but these are mostly the GLCs and bigger businesses not the majority.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
