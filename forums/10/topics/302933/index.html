Can Singapore depend on its youth to stay here and take ownership of the country, our ever-complaining MPs lament in Parliament.<br><br>Actually I wonder why young Singaporeans are being singled out in particular. After all, Singaporeans in just about every age group are emigrating. This <a href="http://www.littlespeck.com/content/people/CTrendsPeople-050130.htm" rel="nofollow">article</a>, written in 2005, cites various sources and tells us that:<br>* Every year, 6,000 to 7,000 Singaporeans leave to settle down overseas, including many professionals. This is 15% of today's annual births, probably the highest proportion in the world.<br><br>* One survey has put Singapore's average outflow at 26.11 migrants per 1,000 citizens, the second highest in the world - next only to East Timor (51.07).<br><br>* Nearly half of all Singaporeans do not think they need to be a resident to be emotionally rooted to the country.<br><br>* Six out of 10 undergraduates said they wanted to go abroad to live or work mostly for better economic and job prospects, and enjoy a higher quality of life with less stress.<br><br>* An ACNielsen poll showed 21% of Singaporeans, mainly professionals, were considering emigration, half opting for Australia and New Zealand.<br><br>* Between 100,000 and 150,000 Singaporeans are studying, working or in business in foreign countries; leaders fear that many of them will not return.<br>On a separate note, I do not really believe that the government is really concerned about the high emigration rate, as long as it is able to continue attracting sufficient numbers of foreigners to Singapore.</div>
