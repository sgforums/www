It suggests that a majority believe tax cuts would be affordable if public services were genuinely reformed, but they have little faith that any party could achieve this.<br><br>The results suggest that Cameron could be missing an Â“open goalÂ” by failing to capitalise on the desire for tax cuts.<br><br>The poll found that a large majority of people Â— 81% against 9% Â— supported a Â“significantÂ” increase in the Â£32,000 threshold for the 40% tax band, which would take more people on middling incomes out of that bracket.<br><br>The detailed market research, carried out by ICM on behalf of the TaxpayersÂ’ Alliance (TPA), an independent political lobbying group, comes as some modernising MPs are beginning to argue for a break with the current taboo over tax.<br><br>Labour, under Tony Blair and the chancellor Gordon Brown, has shied away from income tax rises, fearing they would frighten middle-class voters. Cameron, whose party has traditionally supported lower taxes, has sought to change that perception amid Labour accusations that the Tories will cut spending on vital public services.<br><br>Last week Stephen Byers, the former Labour minister, argued for the abolition of inheritance tax. He said that the levy of 40% on estates worth more than Â£285,000 was a Â“penalty for hard work, thrift and enterpriseÂ”. This weekend George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, responded by advocating the abolition of stamp duty on shares to Â“repair the damageÂ” done by LabourÂ’s raid on pension funds. The Tories say the move would increase the average pension fund by Â£8,000.<br><br>CameronÂ’s Tories have sided with Labour policy on economic stability and investment in public services before tax cuts, but the poll shows that a majority of the public still want governments to take less out of their wage packets.<br>The key finding of the study, in which 1,000 people were interviewed, is that people hold the political parties and the system in contempt and are strongly attracted to the prospect of real change.<br><br>It found that emigration is a possibility for more than one in five people. Asked if they had thought about moving abroad, 16% said they had given it<br>Â“serious thoughtÂ” and a further 6% said they planned to do so.<br><br>The poll will be a further blow to Blair, who returned from his three-week Caribbean holiday this weekend to more speculation about his future.<br>Tessa Jowell, one of his most loyal cabinet ministers, admitted yesterday that his plans to step down as leader were creating Â“a sense of uncertaintyÂ” within the Labour party. Geoff Hoon, the Europe minister, acknowledged that the government had been going through Â“problemsÂ” and people were beginning to see Cameron as a serious alternative.<br><br>Downing Street sought to shore up BlairÂ’s position after the defection of 37 Labour members from the Derby constituency of Margaret Beckett, the foreign secretary, to the Liberal Democrats in protest at his failure to condemn Israeli military action in Lebanon. An unusual statement from No 10 insisted the prime minister was Â“convinced that his government has the experience and authority to meet these challengesÂ”.<br><br>TodayÂ’s poll results suggest there is little belief that the current political system can fix peopleÂ’s problems and show strong support for tax cuts. It shows 76% of people favour lowering the basic rate of income tax. People also agreed by about three to one Â— 56% to 17% Â— that reforming public services would allow tax cuts without reducing spending on vital services, although many doubted this would happen.<br><br>The ToriesÂ’ unwillingness to argue for lower taxes has, according to the TPA, Â“left an open goalÂ” for other parties.<br><br>There were majorities in favour of Â“significantÂ” increases of personal allowances and for raising the threshold for inheritance tax or abolishing it.<br><br>Worryingly for Cameron, 36% of people did not back his stance that cutting taxes could threaten economic stability.<br><br>The TPA, which has 15,000 members, believes politicians are failing to recognise a genuine desire for tax cuts among the public. Matthew Elliott, its chief executive, said: Â“The partiesÂ’ conventional wisdom about public opinion is wrong. The parties are all wrongly committed to the status quo of high taxes and massive power for MPs. The public rightly donÂ’t believe them and want change.<br><br>Â“They want large tax cuts and serious reform to get MPs out of managing services and to get non-MPs, who know what theyÂ’re doing, into government.Â”<br><br>The poll shows strong disillusionment with the main political parties. Only 24% of people identify with the Labour party, 17% with the Tories and 9% with the Liberal Democrats. Four out of 10 people do not identify with any party.<br><br>When asked to choose between Brown, BlairÂ’s likely successor, and Cameron, the public is divided with 38% favouring each man.<br><br>ICM interviewed 1,000 people between July 31 and August 2.

Not surprising, due to years of assumption that our growth prospect lies with offering incentives to MNCs or foreign firms, our ministers have neglected promoting growths of our own capabilities. They have been barking up the wrong trees.<br><br>The real economic restructuring will happen only when we have good knowledgeable ministers who know how to create value-adding industries consistently to encourage our own companies to grow in those directions.<br><br>Taiwan did this successfully in the early years from the 1960s when they sent large number of good students to acquire IT knowledge and holistically win them back with real job offers found among Taiwan's own domestic industries and finally through that holistic restructuring Taiwan enjoyed good growths in computer and IT which made Taiwan the leading semi-conductor and Computer manufacturers in the world.<br><br>Of course Taiwan today might well have forgotten such success formula.<br><br>We do not yet have any ministers who are knowledgeable or passionate in wanting to create value-adding jobs or technology start-ups. Japan after the world holistically applied knowledge application in all fields resulting in surge in their industrializations for many years.<br><br>Today we are still stuck in the old policy of attracting investors with money or tax incentives which are no longer the effective solution as in the beginning.<br><br>There ought to be wholesome supportive knowledge-based industries in order to attract good value-adding foreign companies to locate and stay on here. Again due to past one-tracked policy only aimed at winning investments with incentives and monies such restructuring as Taiwan or Japan have done in the past did not happen for many years for such lack of direction and strategies.<br><br>Without creating or bringing up good capable companies in various field we are flogging the dead horse now. Not only will good companies not establish here, our good overseas graduates will also not come back to serve us.<br><br>There will be high degree of migration of our best graduates to best companies overseas for many years to come due to shortsightedness of our own top-down government.<br></div>

              <p>MM Lee admitted his policies worked in 70 % polices.</p>
              <p><strong>Ngiam Tong Dow is correct like saying HDB built in sea front,near bungalow area etc expensive locations.</strong></p>
              <p>But there wae more urgent need to house million of people in 1960!!Remember PAP took 3 years to build some 20,000 public housing units,while the Great UK colonial gavamen took some 30 years to build 23,000!!!</p>

              <p>In 1950 and 1960,it is a uphill task to make sure there were foods on the table EVERYDAY for EVERY family.</p>

              <p>Some of u just take it for granted that u should have a mwal to eat,computer to play.....</p>
              <p>2.LKY admitted wrong to let a oil company in Pasir Panjiang sea front.But what to do?Under the serious unemployment era,SG need MNC ,or even SME to create jobs.</p>
              <p>LKY never said he was perfect.</p>
              <p>SG bargaining power was weak then.</p>

              <p>one of my acquaints went thru' lots of difficulties to emigrate to perth, wife's relatives keep psychoing her to come back to sg, so the man was very obedient to the wife, packed up and went back to sg.</p>
              <p>what the relatives do? nothing. the man has to re-establish himself in sg selling electronics goods. he has two kids, one past over 12 years old and no longer eligible to move overseas unless he is prepared to pay S$75,000 bond to the govt.</p>
              <p>can they move back to perth? No. the condition of oz immigration has changed and they cant qualify.</p>
              <p>Did they regret the decision? yes!</p>
              <p>Did the wife's relatives achieve their goal of dragging the couple back into the drowning pool? yup, pretty much so. They got them back to sg becoz of their envy and jealously.</p>

              <p>So many young executives zooming in bimmers, porsche and merc....so how many of those people actually borrowed money for the status symbol ? </p>
              <p>In Australia, a merc can cost around 40k to 150k (for the SLK series). You see second hands, third hands and a few first hands around. Go to germany and you will see crap loads of mercedes benz. In Sweden, crap loads of volvos.</p>
              <p>Not really a status symbol around Australia plus most people prefer SUVs because they are better for long distance and terrain drives.  Humvees  are more of the status symbol in Australia.</p>
              <p>I think I prefer to keep my property in Australia. Stay around in Australia and do what I like to do while earning my money.</p>
