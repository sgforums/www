In the US, they are still arguing about the changes needed in Social Security. So, the judgement on whether it's a 'positive' development is still unclear.

In my opinion, it's probably best not to use CPF as an instrument for wealth distribution and rely instead on other instruments such as Charities or grassroot help such as Mendaki and so-on.
