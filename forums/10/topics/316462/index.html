                                    Dream. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br> May 3, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">HOW 
                                    are Singaporeans, South-East Asia’s wealthiest people, 
                                    coping with the city-state’s worst inflation in 26 
                                    years?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">On the 
                                    streets and in homes, skyrocketing prices are shaping up 
                                    into a terrible nightmare that is eating into their income, 
                                    their savings and even their confidence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Hardly 
                                    a week passes without news of one price rise or another, 
                                    with each increase seemingly begetting another. And on the 
                                    horizon is the prospect of a deep global recession.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">For 
                                    a generation, with inflation generally hovering around 2%, 
                                    Singaporeans have never experienced this sort of crazy price 
                                    increases.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Kindergartens 
                                    run by the ruling People’s Action Party were the latest 
                                    to raise fees (by 30%-100%), joining schools and universities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Earlier, 
                                    cinemas increased the price of a ticket by 50 cents and 
                                    S$1, making movies a luxury item for many Singaporeans. 
                                    A weekend outing for a family of four now costs between 
                                    S$40 and S$43.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singapore’s 
                                    annual inflation rate was at 6.7% in March, the highest 
                                    since 1982, a figure more than double that of Malaysia – 
                                    and higher than those of Hong Kong and Australia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Rice 
                                    and petrol prices at the pump – as well as the cost 
                                    of driving on the road – have gone up beyond recognition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If you 
                                    can name it, whether a product or a service, it’s 
                                    likely that they’ve raised the price – electricity, 
                                    milk, coffee and sugar down to the cost of postage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Living 
                                    in a small island, which has to import its food, oil and 
                                    natural resources has put Singaporeans these days in a spot, 
                                    worse than for most others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    middle class (average monthly income: S$2,800) and the low-income 
                                    are taking it on the chin. In some ways, the Singaporean 
                                    Dream is being blurred.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Inflation 
                                    is, however, not entirely imported. In fact, government 
                                    policies have a great deal to do with it since it raised 
                                    the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 5% to 7% last July.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In quick 
                                    order, it also raised the cost of services – from 
                                    buses, MRT and taxis to hospitals and schools.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Drivers 
                                    are now charged more often and more regularly when they 
                                    drive on certain road at peak hours.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    ill-timed GST increase was the trigger point, but it wasn’t 
                                    the main reason.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    two biggest factors that pushed up inflation are:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>* 
                                    A strong overheating</strong> economy that grew by 7% annually 
                                    for the past four years; and,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong>* 
                                    An open door immigration </strong>(the highest inflow rate 
                                    in the world) that brought in a million foreigners and pushed 
                                    the population to about 4.7 million.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    republic is paying a high price for becoming a global city 
                                    of fine living comparable to the likes of Paris, New York 
                                    or Tokyo.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It has 
                                    created something more than high inflation: A permanent 
                                    high-cost structure – from property to taxi fares 
                                    and restaurants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">To be 
                                    a London or a Brussels would mean having to live with their 
                                    high costs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">People 
                                    are responding in different ways. I know of several young 
                                    graduates who have just started working, moving back to 
                                    live with their parents to save on expenses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Mr and 
                                    Mrs Singapore are going out or eating out less, buying fewer 
                                    luxuries, including cars, and reducing the use of taxis. 
                                    There are social costs to all these.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“My 
                                    wife and I no longer go out very often on weekends. Every 
                                    time we do so, we feel the pinch,” said a young salesman 
                                    who had just got married. “Having children? Not now. 
                                    We can hardly feed ourselves.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Nine 
                                    in 10 people polled by the Sunday Times now find Singapore 
                                    an expensive place to live in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">While 
                                    eating at a food court recently, I sat next to a couple 
                                    in their 20s sharing a lunch – a plate of <em>mee 
                                    goreng</em> (fried noodle) and one bottle of orange squash.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">On another 
                                    time, I saw a Bangladesh worker lunching with just a can 
                                    of black coffee and a large loaf of plain bread.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">For 
                                    some like Janice Tan, 35, who works at a travel agency, 
                                    the soaring prices have forced members of her family to 
                                    shower only once a day to cut down their water bill.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">She 
                                    told a reporter that water (which is also dearer) used to 
                                    rinse vegetables is also now recycled to flush the toilet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Except 
                                    for the ultra-rich, the impact of the sharp price increases 
                                    has cut across social classes in one of Asia’s wealthiest 
                                    nations,” wrote a foreign correspondent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Charities 
                                    are offering free food to the needy – a page from 
                                    America’s soup kitchens – and the queues are 
                                    getting longer. More people are also approaching community 
                                    bodies for help to make ends meet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A government 
                                    website is listing food stalls that offer S$2 meals. The 
                                    most popular dish that I know of: Vegetable economical <em>mee 
                                    hoon</em> at S$1.60).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    government has just dished out cash averaging S$1,000-S$2,000 
                                    (as well as top-ups in mandatory savings) to each family, 
                                    depending on its size, age and poverty level.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    complaints are loudest from the middle class, with some 
                                    people questioning whether Singapore is still a good place 
                                    to live in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Inflation 
                                    has made them worried about savings, family life and old 
                                    age.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Aret 
                                    says “it’s not a place for dreamers”. 
                                    Another added that after 10 years of struggling, “I 
                                    am very tired and stressed”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But 
                                    others are more optimistic, believing the problems are largely 
                                    global, and as the world picks itself up, so will Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">To those 
                                    who say Singapore is not a good place to live in, he said:
