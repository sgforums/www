              <p><br>We live in  Singapore and there is definitely nothing wrong to engage in any discussion on local issues that affect our life rather than be indifferent to what is happening and affect life in Singapore.   There are people who take this as something negative and do name calling "losers",, "sheep", "anti-PAP" and you name it.</p>
              <p>The ruling party of course hope that nobody at all voice out any negative issues concerning them, but this is fat hope really.   WE are not robots, we are human with brain, flesh, feelings, intellect, freedom . .   .   .</p>

              <p>Well yeah you yourself said that it is difficult to uproot your whole family and bring them to live in an entirely new place, never to return again... You just don't sever ties with Singapore without some amount of hesitation... There is a lot that we love about this country, just that there are some problems too.</p>
              <p>Uprooting them only to bring them back is even worse, would have made the decision seemingly a waste of time.</p>

              <p>The ability to speak English.. only makes your life easier in a English speaking country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it does not means you are able to integrate into their culture just because you speak their language.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It has more to do with your behavior.. your beliefs.. your ability to accept and become part of their culture. And most importantly, their acceptance of the difference in you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many immigrant in western country who do not speak the language.. yet they live and thrived like many who do.</p>
