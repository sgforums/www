So unless you live on a fat pay cheque, first timers will start their life with a HDB flat, which HDB has claimed are built on a subsidy.<br><br>This urban myth has been dispelled in a letter to the forum when it was clarified that the flats were in fact sold at a '<strong><span style="color: red;">discount</span></strong>' and not at a '<span style="color: darkblue;"><strong>subsidy</strong></span>', a fact which HDB utterly failed to rebutt.<br><br>HDB had the opportunity to publish the building and infrastructure costs to prove to residents the supposed 'subsidy' on two counts, once when challenged by the oppposition during the last elections (this was directed solely at Mah Bow Tan) and again when the letter to the ST forum was published.<br><br>On both occasions, they chose instead to deny the public access to the figures; this served only to reinforce the FACT that HDB flats are sold at a 'discount'.<br><br>Is it any wonder why malcontent over ministerial double pay rise is widespread?

            <div class='col-md body'>how many of you had seen the crash of 97-98? ask your parents or senior relatives, they will know...<br><br>the current euphoria of property snatch up is somewhat a reflection of what had happened in the mid 90s. people tot of buying $400k executive or 5A hdb flat in old estates with hope of getting rich. my friend was a property agent and he was seduced by all these properties and bought several units and landed properties.  Then the asian financial crisis came, and blood were spilled in the stock, job and property markets. many folks lost their jobs and there was a record number of people going bankrupt. my property agent friend suffered great loss and had no choice but to be declared bankrupt, suffered terribly in his relationship with his wife, poverty and joblessness.<br><br>i knew this neighbour, both are averagely low income earner but wife wanted posh executive hdb flat. compelled husband to buy at $400k but later realised that the repayment loan for the flat was just beyond their means, end up quarrelling daily and finally divorced. husband begged wife not to leave but wife refused to take heed. I could hear how he cried when the wife lead their children away.<br><br>i hope people can take heed and reflect on the past, dont buy beyond one's capability or else end up like them.<br><br></div>
