Thus, if a couple buys the most expensive flat at City View @ Boon Keng at just over $700,000, they face the prospect of paying more than $2,000 in monthly instalments based on a 90-per-cent loan over 30 years. They would also have to fork out cash on top of their CPF contributions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>$750k hdb flat is yesterday news.. someone just paid $890k for a HDB flat!!<br><br>THE brief for the property agent was simple: Find an HDB flat with great views and near an MRT station. Top floors only - and, it appears, never mind the price.<br><br>Two intense days of door-knocking and a record $890,000 later, the buyer has his dream home - and the most expensive Housing Board flat in the country.<br><br>For his money, he gets a spacious 21st-storey executive flat in Queenstown, with expansive views towards Sentosa and leafy Mount Faber on one side and Queenstown Stadium on the other.<br><br>The 13-year-old flat in Block 150, Mei Ling Street, is just a few minutes away from Queenstown MRT via a sheltered walkway, and a swimming complex is just around the corner.<br><br>The owners, Mr David Ho Khoi Seng, 72, and wife Judy, 64, had paid just over $300,000 for the 1,614 sq ft flat, which has four bedrooms, a living room and a study, in 1992.<br><br>Mr Ho, who runs a stationery shop, said he had no intention of selling when PropNex agent David See and his son came knocking last Thursday.<br><br>The couple tried to deter the buyers - believed to be an elderly couple who own private property - by asking for what they felt was a ridiculous $900,000.<br><br>'We thought $900,000 was too high a price for anyone, but the buyers seemed pretty desperate to find a suitable flat,' said Mr Ho.<br><br>Mr See, 47, said he roped in his 20-year-old son Wilson for the quest to give him some work experience before he starts university later this year.<br><br>But knocking on doors, he said, is something he would only do for 'genuine buyers'.<br><br>'It was a challenge. It's not easy to get people to sell high-floor units at this time,' he added.<br><br>Demand had sent HDB resale prices up 17.4 per cent last year, the highest in a decade, but executive flats in coveted districts near the central city like Queenstown and Bukit Merah have been extra hot.<br><br>The old record for an HDB flat was $780,000 - also for an executive flat in Mei Ling Street - achieved last November.<br><br>Five other such flats in Mei Ling Street changed hands between November and December, ranging in price from $728,000 to $765,000.<br><br>Median resale prices of executive flats in Queenstown hit $719,000 between July and September last year, a jump from $609,000 in the previous quarter. This type of flat in Queenstown commanded $120,000 in cash over their valuation in the same period.<br><br>A five-roomer in Kim Tian Place in nearby Bukit Merah changed hands for $720,000 last June.<br><br>With prices of resale HDB flats expected to climb further, the latest deal has prompted some people to ask when a public housing unit will cross the $1 million mark.<br><br>Agents reckon that is a way off yet.<br><br>Mr See thinks his record deal was more a reflection of the buyers' eagerness, rather than market sentiment.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Ho and his wife will live with their 35-year-old son in his Siglap terrace house until they find a suitable home.<br><br>When they move, Mr Ho will have to give up a pastime of his: Watching S-League football matches at Queenstown Stadium from the balcony of his Mei Ling Street flat's master bedroom.</div>
