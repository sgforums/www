You can't bring that money to the graveyard to use anyway.<br><br>Some others might also think like this: If you are only buying 1 piece of property to stay, you don't really lose much. You sold your previous home at a more expensive price, but buy a new one at an expensive price too.

To survive and get rich in Singapore is not difficult.  always remember the golden rule "Buy Low Sell High".  stick to this rule on every major financial decision and you will realize your wealth.<br><br>Ask yourself which is the cheapest and highest rental yield possible in Singapore?  Go for it.<br><br>Financing your purchase of this cheapest and highest rental yield asset:  do what people call "carry trade" ie borrow at lower interest rates and invest at higher interest rates.<br><br>after a few years, you are loaded with money.<br><br></div>
