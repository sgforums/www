We blame the government because we cannot afford a LCD TV and have to buy a CRT instead? We blame the government because we cannot drive a Porsche and have to buy a Cherry QQ instead?<br><br>Of cos I think a 750K flat is obscene! I cannot afford that and most probably will not consider that. But there is always another cheaper option right?
