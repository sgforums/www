A $10-million Community Integration Fund paid for by taxpayers was set up lately to help the newcomers “integrate” into Singapore society.<br><br>However, when asked by MP Dr Lily Neo a few years ago to ensure three meals a day for Singaporeans on Public Assistance (PA), Dr Vivian retorted:<br><br>“How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?”<br><br>While other countries like Australia and Canada require prospective migrants to pass an English proficiency test, the Singapore government will give provide language classes for the immigrants for free.<br><br>PAP MP Halimah Yacob raised the idea of a citizenship test which was described by Dr Vivian as an “interesting and quite sensible suggestion”.<br><br>Dr Vivian said one of the best ways to plug newcomers into the community though is to get them to volunteer in grassroots organizations like Residents Committees (RC) and Citizens Consultative Committees (CCC) under the ambit of the People’s Association (PA).<br><br>Grassroots organizations are quasi-government organizations which are firmly controlled by the ruling party.<br><br>The Chairman of the People’s Association is none other than Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong himself.<br><br>Grassroots volunteers are often mobilized to organize PAP events which includes campaigning during the elections.<br><br>The ruling party has opened the floodgates in a desperate bid to boost Singapore’s declining birth rates via immigration.<br><br>There were over 20,000 new citizens and 90,000 PRs in 2008.<br><br>The increasing number of new citizens will form a powerful voting bloc to keep the PAP in power for the next few decades or so since they tend to support the incumbent government.<br><br>Despite rising resentment and frustration on the ground at the relentless influx of foreigners, the ruling party is adamant that immigration is essential to the future of Singapore.<br><br>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong mused publicly whether to allow immigrant “enclaves” to emerge in the HDB heartlands.<br><br>MM Lee Kuan Yew urged Singaporeans to bear with the “tide” of foreigners which has now become a “flood”.<br><br>Singapore’s ruling party controls all state institutions and organs such as the police and media.<br><br>The weak and feeble opposition is no challenge to its hegemony and it is almost impossible to vote them out of power.<br><br>Unlike earlier immigrants from Malaysia and Hong Kong, the latest immigrants from China and India show little willingness to integrate into Singapore society and prefer to mix among themselves.<br><br>Citizens now made up only 64 per cent of Singapore’s 5-million population. The percentage of citizens born in Singapore will probably decrease to less than 50 per cent if the current immigration rates continue unabated.<br><br>Singaporeans may soon find themselves a minority in their own country and have to take up language classes to “re-integrate” into a new Singapore dominated by foreigners.<br><br>Source: The Temasek Review</div>
