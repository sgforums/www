Even the 4 new LPD would find it difficult to bring ALL of them back quickly!!!<br><br>I reckon ST should convert them to SP artillery, mating the chassis with the FH-2000 gun, or convert them into superb APCs like the Pumas in Israel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

But if you look at it from another angle, it can mean that since this is a public domain, whatever 'sensitive' information contributed by unknown people cannot be taken seriously right? We can take it as a form of discussion by patriotic Singaporeans who are intrested in the defence of our country. I am open to all sensible and mature posts.

Those who are serving, or had served are bound by the OSA.<br><br>The Internet give most a false sense of security. For your info, there is no such thing as anonymous or unknown. Packets can be traced, users can be tracked if deemed necessary.<br><br>This is an open forum, and thus we must be even more aware of how we post. There is no way of proving who a person is who he claims. E.g. No spy or foreign intelligence gonna announce whom they are..declare they are out for intelligence info...and pose questions......Even if they are not....how do one ensure they are cleared for the info being dicussed?<br><br>Thus I really dun believe in your theory that info submitted by "unknown" is not to be taken seriously. Loose talk sink ships.<br><br>I believe we all welcome dicussion on topics that are in open domain...if something is announced not yet by SAF, best keep it that way. No offense...just my two cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like most other MBTs, the role of the Tempests would probably be to slug it out in direct frontal combat with enemy armor. Since the Tempests are not very mobile compared to our other armored assets, especially since our combat engineers are not that well equipped for MLC60 vs MLC30, they will likely not be used in the attack. I think that they would be used to defend against attacking armor columns by engaging them head on. Therefore, they will be used as a rearguard or vanguard force, to prevent any enemy armored thrust from dividing our forces or penetrating to our rear areas. I believe that they were originally purchased in case potential aggressors decided to match our armored capability, which they have so far failed to do. MBTs are primarily anti-armor weapons, and until potential aggressors have significant armor capability (which may be very soon), they will not be very useful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It have come to my knowledge that the Tempests is know to fire side by side with the AMX-13SM1 in Ex Wallaby in Australia. Could this cooperation between two types of platforms be part of the van or rearguard that dkhoo have mentioned earlier?<br>Secondly, can anyone tell me what are the types of ammunition used by these MBTs.Is it similar to that of the SM1, other than the difference in calibre itself?<br>Thirdly, what about the weight of these monsters? Does the soft and muddy terrain in and around Singapore suit them? I don't think that the bridges in Redland is suitable as well.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe the tempest are more suited to be used for the defense of singapore.Like the tiger in ww2, the tempest posses a frontal armour of 152mm so, it could be used as some kind of a wall of fire.<br><br>On the other hand , it could be used as siege tanks for occupied cities.<br><br>About the amx 13 fighting side by side with the tempest,yes it is possible.The tempest is extensively upgraded,Taking the specifications of the S'hot -the modernised isreali centurion,its top speed is also about 60km/h with an upgraded105mm gun (the L7)so fighting along side with the amx13 is not a prob.<br>It could use its gun as a longrange support for the amx13.</div>

It could be the Leopard tank if ADF is participating in the Wallaby exercise - but I really doubt so.<br><br>Well, as far as I understand, most SAF centurions are still based in Taiwan. There is no reason to bring it back to Singapore and to Australia for the exercise, but it is also not impossible or unprobable.<br><br>As for the amout of upgrade, well, I read from the Military Technology magazine (I still have the copy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Vol XVI Issue 7 - 1992) that the Centurions Mk.3/7 were actually bought from India, and upgraded by ST Engg (it was called Singapore Automotive Engineering then) with Israeli fit out including the M68 105 mm rifled bore main gun, Elbit Computers (tank fire control system) and Urdan (turret cupola modifications and add-on armour). The engine should also be the same as the Israeli ones which only give about a max of 48 km/h on paved roads.  Not that hot huh.<br><br>I think its time the Centurions (Tempest) should be replaced by another MBT (I would go for the upgrade Leopard 1A5 or the Swedish CV90-120). Alternatively, upgrade the Centurions to a similar standards as the South African Olifant 2 (Mk.2) standard <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> <a href="http://www.mainbattletanks.czweb.org/Tanks/eolifan2.htm" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://www.mainbattletanks.czweb.org/Tanks/olifant2.jpg"></a><br><br></div>
