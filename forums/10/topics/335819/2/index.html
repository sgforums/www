              <p>FW is ok. But too much FT a bit not too good. U got substance, they also might have substance. They demand less than u cos they no need pay for expensive houses, and with currency rates, 1000 sing dollars can perhaps feed their parents for 2-3 months but we cant really do it here.</p>
              <p>It is not that competition is not good. But too much FTs upset the balance and the competitions become unfair with the disadvantages we have and their advantages.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents</p>

              <p>Oh, the situation with or without the foreigners, the cost of living will still rocket up as it shown today, but with foreigners, the business peoples will earn more thru less cost of wages and govt can tax more from both corporate profit taxes and levies of foreigners, I still believe that without foreigners, we can built our own house, road and economy.

              <p>Hard to say leh...</p>
              <p>I think the stigma of the jobs is more closely related to the amount of analytical brainpower and the amount of self-sacrifice required.</p>
              <p>For example, a researcher is better compensated than a road builder because he has to possess and use much more analytical power.</p>
              <p>Or, a person painting/doing makeup for the dead so that they go into the coffins looking better, does not use much more analytical skills as compared to the road builder, but is paid much more because it is something that most people do not want to do, and the painter might be at risk of diseases.</p>
              <p>By pay, I meant amount per hour.</p>

              <p><br>Ya, in states, very skill jobs are consider professional, however in here, ah neh, ah beng also can do, so the profession was badly tarnish. I still remember last time when i was younger, my dad got engaged contractor to renovate my house, Singapoean skill workers, they gave better qualities in their work and certainly more productive. Really delighted the customer like me Dad.</p>

              <p>Recently we renovate our house front gate, the boss came with some bangalas and started work, once started, the boss is nowhere to be seen, the bangalas also blur blur, anyhow cement it with no skill at all, most of them concentrate on me and my indo maid rather than work. Damn, what a shody work!!</p>

              <p>this shanmugam is not the first to say to talk about to  welcome foreign workers.   PAP's ministers are taking turns to say the same.   Seems they are all parrots.</p>
              <p>Looks like they are speaking from the same script.   Over pay them by millions yet produce substandard performance.    Like reading the same poem.    Shame on you, PAP!</p>
              <p>Usually foreign workers come from third world countries whereby the living costs is much lowers there.  So they gain more by working here.  With the currecy conversion they earn much more than their fellow citizens in their countries and so it benefit them.   This is not the case in Singapore.</p>

              <p>I think the stigma of the jobs is more closely related to the amount of analytical brainpower and the amount of self-sacrifice required.</p>
              <p>For example, a researcher is better compensated than a road builder because he has to possess and use much more analytical power.</p>
              <p>Or, a person painting/doing makeup for the dead so that they go into the coffins looking better, does not use much more analytical skills as compared to the road builder, but is paid much more because it is something that most people do not want to do, and the painter might be at risk of diseases.</p>

              <p>That's why I gave one more condition: self-sacrifice. The miner puts his life at risk to mine; explosions are quite common in mining.</p>

              <p>After starting work, I find that plumbers (or any other such small service industry) can actually start their own plumbing company (clone of their current company) with ease, doing the same job they were doing all along, yet owning a company and earning more.</p>
              <p>Whereas for a uni lecturer, or an engineer in an MNC, it's an herculean task to mimic their current workplace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many places where the system is flawed... i.e. being a migrant/global country is good in attracting talent, but we locals have actually little homeground advantage when seeking employment (when competing with foreigners)... If you seek for employment, you will forever be at the mercy of employers who will prefer to employ cheaper, yet equally effective, labour in the form of foreigners...</p>
