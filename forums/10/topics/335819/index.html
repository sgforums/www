              <p><br>Oh, the situation with or without the foreigners, the cost of living will still rocket up as it shown today, but with foreigners, the business peoples will earn more thru less cost of wages and govt can tax more from both corporate profit taxes and levies of foreigners, I still believe that without foreigners, we can built our own house, road and economy. But it will be a big lost to both the business peoples and the govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I comparing the 2 groups of a foreigner and singaporean is to tell you why singaporeans took up construction or shipyard jobs, because the pay cannot sustain a singaporean basic needs here, a high cost society.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Having a massive influx of foreigners mindlessless is a cop-out. It is the easy way out at the expense of the common man.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The reason why Singaporeans will not do certain jobs is because the pay is too low. The "low pay" is high for the foreigners because in their countries, the cost of living is very low (and worth their while to work here, save and send the savings home.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The difficult but more honorable way is to either pay wages that will attract Singaporeans to do the work or lower the cost of living so that it is worth the while for Singaporeans to do the job at such "relatively low" wages.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">With dishonorable despots in power looking after their own pockets, they will not consider the honorable alternatives and will insist on their way and then sell the propaganda.</span></span></p>

              <p><br> Oh, the situation with or without the foreigners, the cost of
              living will still rocket up as it shown today, but with foreigners,
              the business peoples will earn more thru less cost of
              wages and govt can tax more from both corporate profit taxes

              <p>I comparing the 2 groups of a foreigner and singaporean is to
              tell you why singaporeans took up construction or shipyard jobs,

                              What we Singaporeans cannot take is Fts taking jobs easily filled up by us Singaporeans, t they come in and deflate our pay. Is that meritocracy?</p>

              <p>Yes, sg has been using many foreign workers to build the HDB and roads, but does this mean singaporeans are not ok with this? I think most do not mind and welcome these workers to do these jobs as most are educated to do office types of jobs. So , for this aspect I fail to understand why would people feel that way.</p>
              <p>The news said some singaporeans feel that sg could do with less foreign workers. First, we need to understand that foreign workers is a super set consisting of laborers and office type workers.</p>
              <p>I think most singaporeans concerns are the office type workers.</p>
              <p>compare these 2 same skilled and experienced resumes:<br>1. singaporean - asking price $2000 also but unfortunately need to cost in the HDB installment, electricity huge hike, ERP, children’s education (to study overseas must get 1st class honors else future how? so need save up for them) and medicals and insurance and eca costs, and ERP, Parking, Car installment, car is for family use to also fetch grandmother and father and mother and grandfather and uncles and aunties (asians very close to family), hikes of all types. Also, if they happen to be alloted changi flat, and work is at tuas, of course the no choice but to reject the work lor , for some. some still take up. some more got family, need to come home and take care baby and house.</p>
              <p>2. 3rd world foreigner - asking price $2000. they go back retire lor. willing to accept all employer conditions. If work in Jurong, they rent flat there. If work in Changi, the ditto. distance no issue. Endless supply of young people usually singles. they come home to rented flat, no family to take care, can work longer.</p>
              <p>so how? which would the boss whose bottomline is profit, choose?</p>
              <p>is the sg’reans’ concerns unfounded?</p>
              <p>I hope singaporeans and leaders come up with a REAL solution to meet this labor cost issue.</p>
              <p>1st world citizens and 1st world cost of living that is going up and up vs 3rd world employees coming here for better life.</p>
              <p>lets be clear, the concerns are real and not that some people want to have less foreign workers for no real and valid reasons. And I see nothing wrong that the citizens raise their concerns. This is so that the nation builders can come up a solution to address this long existing problem. I hope and expect them to try hard enough and resolve this issue. So, yes the people are concerned. This means a solution is required. Please give a solution.</p>
              <p>suggestions:<br>1. jobs to be created for skills that singaporeans have. attract companies requires skills which singaporeans have. If more companies come in requiring skills sg'reans don't have, of course singaporeans cannot occupy the created-in-singapore job. Even if they re-train (and thus become greenhorn), companies would prefer foreigners already with the experience.</p>
              <p>2. employers to get more tax rebates for each singaporean hired.</p>
              <p>3. hire foreigners to help come up the required solutions.</p>
              <p>4. cut waste and lower tax.</p>
              <p>I know, talk is cheap. So, lets all be reminded.</p>
              <p>just my 1 cent.</p>

              <p>Ahhhh... you see...low cost labor does not equals lower property sale price.</p>

              <p>The pricing is not based on profit margin on actual cost.</p>

              <p>It is based on market price. Market price = how much a buyer is willing to pay.</p>

              <p>So when the cost of building goes down.. it just means the builder pockets more profit....because they are still selling at market price.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore... there is really no good reason for any builder to hire more expensive local labor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> So you see ?.... property prices is based on demand and supply.</p>

              <p>Pardon me if I am wrong.</p>
              <p>I believe strongly that there is a correlation not an equality between low labour cost and housing price.</p>
              <p>Because total cost price is lower when using cheap foriegn labours. Compared to the case of using local and more expensive labourers, the cost price is therefore higher.</p>
              <p>Like developer X uses FW but developer Y uses more expensive local workers. Both are building on the same area and same type of housing. I.e assuming all factors are kept constant but the use of the type of workers. Both are also up to safety standard as well, I am sure Y will have a hard time competing with X.</p>
              <p>The use of FW not only ensures a better profits, It also give an edge over those using a more expensive labour.</p>
              <p>So the initial selling price would most probably be higher with cost of labour force as A factor.</p>
              <p>I am not saying labour cost is THE factor, but rather a factor. There are many factors like locations, etc etc.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I never heard of any foreign labourer hiring HDB flats nor demand <span style="color: #000080;">normal mainstream type of housing</span>. So I dont think foreign labourers can affect the demand for normal housing much.</p>
              <p>If u are saying it is the better off FTs, I would agree with u.</p>

              <p>2. 3rd world foreigner - asking price $2000. they go back retire
              lor. willing to accept all employer conditions. If work in Jurong,
              they rent flat there. If work in Changi, the ditto. distance no
              issue. Endless supply of young people usually singles. they come
              home to rented flat, no family to take care, can work longer.</p>
              <p>so how? which would the boss whose bottomline is profit,
              choose?</p>
              <p>is the sg’reans’ concerns unfounded?</p>
              <p>I hope singaporeans and leaders come up with a REAL solution to
              meet this labor cost issue.</p>
              <p>1st world citizens and 1st world cost of living that is going up
              and up vs 3rd world employees coming here for better life.</p>
              <p>lets be clear, the concerns are real and not that some people
              want to have less foreign workers for no real and valid reasons.
              And I see nothing wrong that the citizens raise their concerns.
              This is so that the nation builders can come up a solution to
              address this long existing problem. I hope and expect them to try
              hard enough and resolve this issue. So, yes the people are
              concerned. This means a solution is required. Please give a
              solution.</p>
              <p>suggestions:<br> 1. jobs to be created for skills that singaporeans have. attract
              companies requires skills which singaporeans have. If more
              companies come in requiring skills sg'reans don't have, of course
              singaporeans cannot occupy the created-in-singapore job. Even if
              they re-train (and thus become greenhorn), companies would prefer
              foreigners already with the experience.</p>
              <p>2. employers to get more tax rebates for each singaporean
              hired.</p>
              <p>3. hire foreigners to help come up the required solutions.</p>
              <p>4. cut waste and lower tax.</p>
              <p>I know, talk is cheap. So, lets all be reminded.</p>
              <p>just my 1 cent.</p>
