              <p>in one of my previous jobs,  a lady customer told me she'll go out to vote every election just to ensure PAP stays in and she feels singapore would go down if opposition comes into power(she actually said "over my dead body" when opposition was mentioned)  and she's not your depoliticised type of person. actually most of my singaporean customers tend to support PAP strongly, and express that they feel s'pore would do better under PAP.</p>
              <p>the rest of the people i know personally like my friends either don't care, or they want PAP to do better. its very rare for people to actually want an opposition party in the parliament.(though one of my parents is actually strongly against PAP)</p>

              <p>the spirit isn't killed off, if you checked around you can still see a lot of people starting their own businesses and at much younger ages. its just that rising costs have made it much harder to succeed. one guy i know in his twenties "gamble" his savings on his business but he didn't do well cos he couldn't get a halal licence</p>

              I've ever been staying in Australia for 3 years. I wonder how come their road sweepers, construction workers, rubbish collectors, cleaners, cashiers are majority locals and mainly white men? 
              
              And I have not yet come across families with a foreign maid serving them at home, or supermarkets flooded with maids, maids bringing children to school, etc etc. Probably I believe they generally got better employment terms and conditions, shorter work hours and hence got enough time to look after their own kids. I mean a better quality life isn't it?
              
              As for Singapore's high property prices, I believe construction/renovation costs only amounts to a small fraction. Majority of the escalated costs are caused by the developers and investors, esp those who speculate the properties and also land costs. I ever heard of a developer who recently simply buy and sold an office building and made off a tidy profit of more than $120million in just a year! And the end user oftens end up footing the high price.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Agree. I've seen mostly "Ang moh" general workers in Australia. Also their building construction site is quite neat and have much less workers than those in Singapore. I believe the workers are well trained so they can do more and have more initiative vs our FW. For this they are paid more so they can support a family. Sometimes I see a lot of FW at our construction site looking "lost" due to poor training, supervision, etc. I think they should look into how to improve construction industry efficiency so they don't need so many FW that will create social problems here. Maybe we should have a "Ministry of foreign worker/talent" to solve these problems</p></div>
