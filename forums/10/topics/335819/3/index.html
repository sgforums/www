              <p>I know of many singaporeans who are not against FTs in general.</p>

              <p><br>yalor, in heavy industries today, there are 80% FT against 20% Singaporeans, last time was 50-50%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore workers are consider the best for many years under the renowned BERI (Business and Economic Indicator) statistic, we have good racial tolerance and we are willing to teach FT to promote better living standard for them, in the end we not lose our job, our skill are drained out to them. The most scary situation is that Singaporeans are getting old, how can u match a physical young FT worker, and worst, for most of them, their past contribution in teaching FT and supporting the country economy result in them ending in poorer state instead of enjoying the fruit of success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We certainly not against the FT or FW, in fact, we treated them much much better than other countries, and they know it, that is why die die they also want to come here. Free transport to and from work, good environment, insurance coverage, care and share program, geyland, share of concern if get mistreated, safety, healthy, good food, polite local peoples, wide range of lastest electronic and goods to buy, equal opportunity for upgrade of skill and a salary that can match some of their top govt peoples back home. What we are appealing here is to tell the govt, do not forget the foresaken older singaporean who help build the foundation of singapore till what it is today, the govt must come out with a comprehensive plan to provide jobs for singaporeans redesigned for the old, encourage employment of older age workers or talents and provide a good framework in caring of its citizens.</p>
