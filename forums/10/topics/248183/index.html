The PAP always tells us to invite foreigners in our midst with open arms. In this age of globalization, Singapore can't be an island by itself.<br><br>What is wrong with foreigners sharing their views on democracy, freedom of speech, and freedom of association with us? These noble ideals are not something strange but are found in our Constitution and in the national pledge that our children are made to recite everyday.<br><br><strong>It looks like it is alright if foreigners praise the PAP system.</strong> Only a couple of days ago, a foreigner of all places, Finland, wrote a flattering letter in the Straits Times justifying the ministerial salary and agreeing with the PAP that the government in Finland is mediocre. This Finnish guy happens to be the person who assaulted one of our Singaporean women. We do not want such character to pollute our thinking. In fact, he should be sent back to Finland, where he is wanted by the authorities there. We should be more cautious in giving PRs to such people rather than denying these honorable Members of the European Parliament from exchanging views and ideas on parliamentary democracy, which the PAP claims it supports.<br><br>It is the PAP, which seems to be over reliant on foreigners. Even in our National Wages Council, which determines how much our workers ought to be paid, there are foreigners. Council members from Germany, Japan and the US decide the worth of our workers. This is indeed the most disgraceful thing to the sovereignty of our country.<br><br>The PAP frequently organizes seminars and conferences in Singapore, inviting foreigners to speak. So, what is wrong in inviting European and Asian parliamentarians, who had just finished their annual meeting in Jakarta to stopover in Singapore to address us on issues pertaining to democracy?<br><br>The hot topic now is the ministerial multi-million dollar salary. Since Denmark and other European countries came up for mention not so favorably in our Parliament, we thought it would be a good idea for our MEP from Denmark to put the issue in proper perspective. What is wrong with that? Should we not encourage more such interaction? Will it not be good for an "open and inclusive" society that our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong often advises us to be?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fair enough. No foreigners can come to Singapore to interfere with domestic politics.<br>We all know the saying, "Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me," but this statement seems untrue if we really look at the power of speech. Speech can hurt and speech can heal; it can start wars or resolve an argument; it can encourage confidence in a person or destroy self-esteem.<br>The remarks our MM made about Singaporean women becoming maids and Scandinavian government being mediocre are uncalled for.<br>The countries he Â‘referredÂ’ to might take these words as racially charged code words and likely to induce them to become defensive and take Â‘appropriateÂ’ action, in their homeland.<br>There are already talks about Â‘considerationsÂ’ withholding approval of a new EU-Singapore cooperation agreement being negotiated by the two sides.<br>In the Lianhe Zaobao today, some of SingaporeÂ’s second hand dealers of electrical goods<br>are affected by IndonesiaÂ’s import ban of the goods coming from Singapore.<br>These talks and retaliation did not take place in Singapore alright?.<br>Dear MM, see the damage you have done. Pls choose your words carefully.<br>You are so rich that you donÂ’t have to do everything yourself. . Hire a professional speech writer.<br>If things go wrong, at least you can claim Â“I did not say that. I only read what was given to me in a speechÂ”.<br></div>
