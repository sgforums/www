Are they willing to give up their concessions to achieve equality for both races?</div></blockquote>Why are you repeating this topic again. Anyways as a woman , I don't think I am severely lacking compared to men in terms of education or material rewards because I seek to find places that gives me opportunities.  It is up to you to find your opportunities and grab it...instead of complaining that men are better off.<br><br>If women get abused , they have the right to launch a complaint. However it is difficult to get the victims to do so as it could be due to long term psychological trauma, fear for their lives and fear of being octracised. Read up about "victim blaming".<br><br>In the West , it is the same thing - read more ,girl , you need to. You just happen to hear more about western women in power because they know how to get the media coverage . Yes we know , cordelia rice in USA.....in Singapore , we have  Ho Ching (LHL's wife). There are alot of successful women around - just that they like to keep quiet about it. So what's the difference?<br><br>Culture plays a factor , some conservative families give preference to the boy because the boy carries the "surname" and therefore inherit the responsibility of continuing the family line. Happens in some chinese families. I was just fortunate my father felt that his daughters should have the same opportunities as anyone should have.  If you want to talk about discrimination , you have to look at the individual families and relate it to the social fabric. Some older conservative people, like my paternal grandma , view that it is not worth educating a girl because she is "going to another family ", once she is married.<br><br>So there you go : it is not society that discriminates against women. I rather attribute it to  the sociocultural aspects of individual families.<br><br>You talk about equality :  In the same topic you posted earlier about ns allowances....ok you want the same pay - do ns then , in fact make every girl do national service like in israel  . So that you don't complain about inequalities in pay. Contribute 2 years of your life then to serving the country instead of saying that men should protect us.<br><br>Absolute equality means that you are strong as any man - hence no excuse to say that women are the fairer sex. Absolute equality also mean that if a woman commit a crime that warrants caning.....she gets caned.<br><br>How about being the solebread winner? A househusband anyone? We have a few of those around .<br><br>Not that I am siding with the guys here, but really you make an independent woman like me quite queasy when I read this. I always believe everyone is equal .  How did you think modern women like Cordelia Rice, and Hilary Clinton would be as powerful as men? They worked HARD AT Achieving what they have. They didn't whine about inequalities. I shall include the list in the following post so you can stop whining about inequalities. These women worked hard to get to the positions and some of them are asians.<br><br></div>

It is not common but it happens.<br><br>Breast cancers are more researched because young women can get it and it can be due to familial reasons (mom has ca breast etc). Prostate cancer usually affects males in their late 50s and after. There are research on prostate cancers....you have treatment options  .<br><br>If you want more research done on prostate cancers - you  have to think it through. Pharmaceutical companies make up the main sponsors of research and they do research which is economically beneficient to them. A young person with breast cancer will be more willing to spend on expensive and exclusive treatment and have a higher possibility of being cured. While an 80 year old may not be able to take the drugs due to his medical co-morbidities...really how many 80 year olds , or even 60 year olds,have no past history of any major medical histories.<br><br>Men's department - men's fashion ...really would most men wear any color at all ? Even pink? Or outrageous dresses? Men's clothing usually consists of pants/trousers/jeans and shirts/tshirt  of a macho type color . Accessories , belt , ties, bow ties, cuff links........Well most men anyways.....we have to exclude cross dressers.  There are men's department....they all look the same...shirts/jackets/ pants.....more shirts , more jackets , more pants...same color ....similar patterns. If you want to blame it on discrimination....I say blame it on the fashion designers and guys who do not want to experiment with fashions</div>
