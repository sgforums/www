It is not common but it happens.<br><br>Breast cancers are more researched because young women can get it and it can be due to familial reasons (mom has ca breast etc). Prostate cancer usually affects males in their late 50s and after.

Pharmaceutical companies make up the main sponsors of research and they do research which is economically beneficient to them. A young person with breast cancer will be more willing to spend on expensive and exclusive treatment and have a higher possibility of being cured. While an 80 year old may not be able to take the drugs due to his medical co-morbidities...really how many 80 year olds , or even 60 year olds,have no past history of any major medical histories.<br><br>Men's department - men's fashion ...really would most men wear any color at all ? Even pink? Or outrageous dresses? Men's clothing usually consists of pants/trousers/jeans and shirts/tshirt  of a macho type color . Accessories , belt , ties, bow ties, cuff links........Well most men anyways.....we have to exclude cross dressers.  There are men's department....they all look the same...shirts/jackets/ pants.....more shirts , more jackets , more pants...same color ....similar patterns.

"be a man!" which is odd, because an hour ago they were complaining, "men don't express their feelings." =S<br>p3 - those women who go into the corporate world have a higher level of stress, and are dying faster, than their domestic counterparts =) and yeap, pregnancy is a killer for employers.<br>p4 - umm.. you can always lodge a complaint against those harrassers =)<br>and btw, in case you are one of those types, if you wear something that exposes bits of your body, you are annoying the guys. so you can't complain if they annoy you back.<br>"i can wear what i want."<br>"well, i can call you as i see you."<br>and what negating factors?<br>in fact, with women in jobs, men are more in deep shit.<br>offend a woman, and she will use the law to protect herself, and get the guy fired. even if he is innocent. its the stupid laws fault, but women should not abuse the power. unfortunately, its a trend...<br>face it, women can always cry rape.<br>and frame a guy for it.<br>and even if she loses the case,<br>no one will arrest her.<br>many young girls realise this.<br>and abuse it.<br>just to ruin some guys life.<br>all because he did not agree with her narrow point of view.<br>you think harrassment is bad?<br>try going to jail for something you did not do!<br>oh yeah, and the courts actually make sure the identity of the accuser is not revealed.<br>meaning she can try the same thing on another innocent guy.<br>=)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hrm can't paste quote <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>anyways apollo861 . Work dressing must be appropriate . If the person doesn't dress appropriately , tell her to dress more appropriate the next time and do it professionally. I do that to some of my "underdressed" staff members .  You can't just use "I can call you as I see you" in general - it is opening a pandora's box. It is as though" you see a kid with down syndrome and  call him a retard , and it is right" type of statement .<br><br>Individuals must be held for their actions , not the general lot of society. However in cases of rape, for every women who cries wolf , there are real rape victims around. It is an ethical argument which can go on and on and on. If there is a law enacted to protect men against false accusations,  now rape is hard to prove enough because of the consent involved. What if a true rapist gets acquited because of a lack of evidence - won't he turn around and get the victim in trouble?  Saying that , as much as I hate rapists , I despise women who cry wolf because they are the ones who destroy the REAL rape victims.<br><br>Not all rapes can be proven but that doesn't mean it didn't happen .  You really have to show me the stats of rising trends in crying wolf.  Rape is a heinous crime , doesn't matter if it happens to children or women or sometimes even men.  Psychological impacts of rape are damning .<br><br>Negating factors  are plenty for women. Physiologically we are  disadvantaged - we get pregnant. Culturally some women are disadvantaged by the mindsets of a conservative individuals : to these individuals women belong at home not at work. Traditionally women are the homemakers and childcarers. When a child is sick , it's mostly the mother who looks after the child . If she is working....she needs to take leave ...employers don't really like people taking leave other than annual leave.<br>You also cannot deny there are some employers who discriminate against women.<br><br>We can't generalise it to everyone in society . Some women can be one of the worse creatures on earth but that doesn't mean all women are . Some men are the worse asses on earth but that doesn't mean all men are. For every  individual example that is quoted - there will always be an opposing example.<br><br>My stance remains in general ,singaporean women are not being discriminated against by the whole society. We can continue arguing who is worse off by using individual or assumed examples but it doesn't prove anything at all. There are some individuals who are responsible for creating the impression there is some sort of discrimination in society  - yes . However  every individual is responsible for seizing opportunities and advancing beyond their perceived potential ,regardless of race, class , gender. They can meet their aspirations if they try hard enough, men or women.<br></div>
