Lack of financial education or we simply need to release from stress? Our youths are typically eating out in cafe and restaurant on regular basis as well..</p>

              <p>Hi Yang,</p>
              <p>I believe this is why many school programmes include financial literacy as a compulsory activity for students of all ages so that they appreciate the importance of financial planning at an early age. When I was serving National Service, my boss used to tell me that he makes a habit of saving at least $500 a month. This money is not for insurance premiums, loans, child education funds, travel, but rather, for a rainy day.</p>
              <p>Oh yes.. I do agree that youths have a lot of allowance these days.. perhaps attributed to parents with increased disposible income.</p>

              Well apart from debts due to lifestyle - certain essentials in life for the youth of today, which you can't hold off for too long, can easily put them into a credit crisis - a wedding, buying a car, a home, or raising their children. 
              
              Buying a car and having a large piece of land for a home in Australia is an average purchase for the average citizen.
              
              In Singapore its a luxury.

              <p>I agree that youth's spending habits are increasingly scary compared to my time. Back in the days, we could not even afford to eat out after school of during the weekends. The most for me was hawker centers. There is enough financial courses around but the problem is that it is not inculcated into the school system. If it was, teachers can constantly remind their students about the benefits of knowing your finance.</p>
              <p>Well if only they can apply this theory "Enjoy now, Pay later" to their jobs. Every thing would be much more fulfilling too. The problem with the society now is that almost 80% of the students that graduate, be it from ITE, Poly or universities, dont know what they want in life. Their internships are not relevant to their studies and thus after graduation they are still lost ducks, waddling around, eating what floats pass them.</p>
              <p>Which results in them not loving what they do in life. If they can identify what they like early and enjoy what they do in future, they would not be so money driven which gives them the "Pay later" attitude. There needs to be a system that matches their skills and jobs automatically. I know butlerfactory.com a online marketplace for jobs, is one that does it with no charges to the students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are there any such platforms or companies that helps students identify their skills before releasing them into the working society? Kindly share please =)</p>

              <p>well said. But we cannot expect the teachings to come from schools. the right attitude should be inculcated at HOME, by the parents. From young if the children learn to spend money knowing that their parents would pay the debt later, they will spend money the same way when they grow up, not sure who pay the bills for them.</p>
              <p>I have come to realise that One whole generation of parents have succeeded in feeding, housing and providing for their children, but failed miserably in educating, teaching and giving a proper up bringing. Sad.</p>
