If the company is unprofitable they have to retrench to survive. You dun expect the union to force loss-making companies to keep its workers do you. What the union can is to help retrenched workers find new jobs in other sectors.<br><br>The work of job-creation belongs to the PAP govt. The second part of your post Out-of-POint liao.

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, the union's role is to ensure that workers are not unfairly exploited. By that it can mean either unreasonable low salary or unreasonable firing or retrenchment of worker. As Singapore is a mature economy, these things seldom happen now.<br><br>One thing that we need to be catious about is not to push the above principal to the extreme, where instead of the employee being exploited, the employer becomes the victim. In a ideal environment, all parties should gain from the employee-employer relationship, where the employee gets to earn a living with a reasonable pay for his effort and the employer gets a profit from running the business.<br><br>Currently, the business environment works in such a way that companies generally do not fire any one when they are still profitable, even when some workers are unproductive. And when the company goes into reds (usually during crisis), they frantically find ways to cut cost. Usually this means retrechment since labour is usually the biggest cost for most companies. For the union, they do not have good reason to stop that since if the company goes bust, all workers are affected rather than just those who are retreched. Alternatively, everyone gets a pay cut. This was done in some companies during the crisis period, which is usually more humane.<br><br>The above scenario really leaves us little choice during crisis. This creates a very unhealthy situation of having the market being swarm by high unemployment during this period, making it difficult for those who are retreched to find another job.<br><br>Ideally, I think firing of unproductive worker should take place during even good years. The benefits are (1) They can find another job easily since it is in a good year; (2) They learn earlier in their working life that they are unproductive and needs retraining and not after they get comfortable. Then in the bad years, the company should just cut the salary of workers to get by those years, keeping all workers and getting themselves ready for the good years to come. This way, the impact of bad economy is shared equally by all rather than hitting it hard on the unproductive workers who were never told that they need retraining, until the economy goes bad.<br><br>Just my view of how things should really work. The problem now is that unions and companies do not tell unproductive worker they need to improve themselves until it is too late and in a situation where these unproductive worker has no alternative employment.</div>

When recruiting new members, we always tell them, dun be a free loader, the more ppl to join the stronger the union, dun let others fight the battle for you.<br><br>If the crime rate in SG is rising, is it the problem of the police or the firefighters ?

Earn so much and still always complain they earn not enough. And it has happen in so many airlines that these pilots are willing to go on strike just for their own sake, allowing the airline to lose millions of dollars EVERYDAY just to get more $$ for themselves.<br><br>Below is a famous quote from United Airline pilot union when United Airline tries to negotiate with their pilot union telling them not to kill the golden goose which lays the egg. At that time, united airline has already filed for bankruptcy protection (Chapter 11).<br><br>"We don't want to kill the golden goose. We just want to choke it by the neck until it gives us every last egg." - united airline pilot union.</div>
