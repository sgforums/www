            <div class='col-md body'>if pilot go on strike then sg economy will collapse? maybe its true, i suggest all industry worker not to join any union because, if you ask for pay increase, someone will throw u out of the company and maybe out of the country. in that case what the point of joining union. esp the power of our union only lie in the hands of few.<br>for TSPSG case, i think he is PAP men so i am not surprise if u wana call lawyer for small issue like this topi . what happen if the country progress and left hehind are the lower skill ppl then wat the benefits to them. no one need to see the same picture of the govt, afterall, what concern them is simply bread and butter and some protection from the union.<br>as for my question which u cant answer, why our union leader need to wear 2 hats and how to balance between role of union leader and PAP member. is it necessary?<br><br>yes we need foreign investor. but that doesnt mean we can have a stronger labour movement. one that is strong negotiator and not simply see the same picture of the government. like i say before, which country which has strong labour union has a bad economy in the country, such as korean, japan, HK, australia. maybe they dont depend on foreign investment that much for some, but we can find a better balance. afterall, if company only consider spore as a investment hub because we have poor labour movement, singapore can only be exploited.<br><br>TPSG, im not in union but i concern about it. even i not in politics but i care about singapore. i participate in this topic to raise my point of concern in some area. that why a third voice like us is important because our view are unbias.<br>since when have i critise our union leader?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 I never say if pilot goes on strike SG economy will collaspe but other sectors like logistic will be affected more people might be retrench as a result.<br><br>2 A strike by them will have long term repercussion as it will effect investor confidence.<br><br>3 If a trouble maker wants to destroy the company and make everyone lose their jobs I will kick him out anytime.<br><br>3 You have no sense of humor.<br><br>4 I am not PAP.<br><br>5 Talk is cheap. If you want to change things do something about it.<br><br>6 You critise the whole union not an individual.<br><br>My points are based on facts.
