            <div class='col-md body'>Net postings now fall under Election Act<br>By Lee U-Wen, TODAY<br><br>From now on, the gloves have to stay on. For the bloggers, that is.<br><br>Now that the election writ has been issued, the Parliamentary Elections Act automatically comes into effect. The Act Â— last amended in August 2001 before the previous General Election Â— regulates campaigning via the Internet and mobile text messaging during the election period.<br><br>What this means is that all political parties and individuals not registered with the Media Development Authority (MDA) are not allowed to indulge in anything that can be construed as campaigning Â— until the elections are over.<br><br>A random check of 10 local blogs yesterday Â— most of which have had political postings in the past Â— did not feature any fresh election-related posts after it was announced that President S R Nathan had dissolved Parliament.<br><br>Forums, on the other hand, were abuzz with activity soon after the news broke. Among those who posted their views online, most said they were eagerly looking forward to Polling Day, which has now been confirmed for May 6.<br><br>Others wanted to know where the nomination centres would be, and whether they would be eligible to vote.<br><br>The Government, which has reiterated that it has constantly adopted "a light touch" where the Internet is concerned, said it has made registration a requirement as this promotes accountability and ensures personal responsibility for comments made online.<br><br>Aside from blogs, it was clarified in Parliament earlier this month that the streaming of explicit political content through podcasts and videocasts during the election period is prohibited under the Election Advertising Regulations.<br><br>Explaining the Government's stand, Information, Communications and the Arts Minister Lee Boon Yang recently said in The Straits Times that these forms of broadcast have "a greater impact" because of the nature of the medium, and hence, "the greater power to influence". - TODAY/az<br></div>
