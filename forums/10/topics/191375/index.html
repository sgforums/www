            <div class='col-md body'>I think he is quite right in most aspects except that GE 2006 is not a convincing win for PAP. In fact it is the most embrassing win for LHL.<br><br>Exiled dissident Tan Wah Piow on Singapore elections<br><br>Singapore: New regime, old authority?<br>Yong Kai Ping and Kuek Ser Kuang Keng<br>Malaysiakini<br>May 6, 06<br><br>Is Singapore opening up under the new administration of Lee Hsien Loong? Are the new casinos a sign of greater freedom? Will the Singapore elections promise any breakthrough for democracy in Singapore?<br><br>For one of Singapore's most renowned dissident, Tan Wah Piow, the new regime under Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is experimenting with a slightly more liberal agenda to counter the cynicism among the young, but party politics is still very much under strict control.<br><br>According to Tan, the whole political process in Singapore is so "sterile" that nobody will challenge the state's authority unless the state feels there is a need to loosen up a bit for their own interest.<br><br>"In Singapore, they will give you the basic rights if only when they feel is good for them," Tan told malaysiakini while visiting friends in Kuala Lumpur last week.<br><br>Tan's 'infamy' stems from his student activism heydays at the National University of Singapore (NUS) during the 70s where he was jailed eight months for "inciting riots".<br><br>Fearing for his safety, Tan fled Singapore in 1975 and sought asylum in United Kingdom. Later he was admitted to Oxford and studied law. Currently holding a UK passport, Tan is a leading human rights lawyer in London.<br><br>Tan spoke extensively on Singapore's coming general election which takes place today. The People's Action Party (PAP) was denied a walk-over victory as in previous elections and now having to contest for 47 out of 84 parliamentary seats, an unprecedented event since 1988.<br><br>Q: How do you view the new administration under Lee Hsien Loong?<br><br>A: I don't see anything new in terms of mindset. They have made it illegal to campaign via blogging and text messaging during the elections.<br><br>Lee Hsien Loong tries to look as though he is giving the opposition a fighting chance. But why they need to take that kind of action against Chee Soon Juan (who was bankrupted for defamation by the government and thus not eligible to contest) if they want to show themselves as being democratic?<br><br>The message that you sent to the population is "don't mess around with us." That is the most serious consequence to Singapore's political culture.<br><br>It is reported that Lee Hsien Loong wants to wipe out all the opposition in the coming elections to gain a stronger mandate.<br><br>Goh Chok Tong's lost four seats when he first led PAP into an election. The second time, he lost two. It is not a question of losing the elections, but the percentage of votes obtained. The benchmark Hsien Loong will be judged on is probably Goh's first elections.<br><br>I think he will have to win with less than four opposition seats. However people say that the PAP is now fielding more professionals and they have also implemented the group representation constituencies (GRC) system. To win one (constituency) is already very difficult for the opposition, let alone a GRC.<br><br>Probably what they are most afraid of will be the active cynicism, the attitude of "I don't care, you will get in but I will dissociate with you" among the younger generation.<br><br>You can praise your own regime by whatever way, people just 'switch-off'. It means the justification for nation building is difficult for them. They won't identify with the party and the state, if I have to leave, I will leave (through migration).<br><br>So you think the PAP can't capture the people's attention? But there have been efforts since the 80's to get the people to be involved.<br><br>What they are doing appears to be extremely progressive in getting more public participation. There are a lot of those institutions for the old and young but the underlying motive behind is still the hegemony of one party, which is what distorts the whole process.<br><br>If you challenge the decision of the state, you will be accused of all kinds of things. They will undermine you before you start. The moment they smell that you have the opposition tendency, they will mark you and if you are really an oppositionist, then you will get into serious problems. If you exist as an individual, they can tolerate you as a eccentric, tolerate in the sense that they won't put you in jail. The moment they sense (you are) organising, then you are in deep trouble.<br><br>You don't think the regime is more open now? They are allowing gambling.<br><br>That is the neo-liberal economic philosophy, which needs not necessary involve political liberalism. I hope people are not misinterpreting this.<br><br>They are experimenting a bit of this and that, but that absolute control is undeniable.<br><br>Do you think they are experimenting with political liberalism?<br><br>I can't say they are exactly the same as the Lee Kuan Yew's regime, they are experimenting a slightly more liberal agenda but the party politics is still under very much direct control and monitoring.<br><br>They will never cease using the Internal Security Department (ISD) to monitor the opposition. I think once an instrument of the state is used to monitor the opposition to serve the ruling party, and not for national security, you can't call such a system democratic.<br><br>But why?<br><br>They need to respond to the demand of the younger generation, to address the perception that they (PAP) are intolerant and so on. They need to demonstrate that the government is open-minded and tolerant of dissent.<br><br>I suppose that is why the senior Lee (Kuan Yew) wanted to test the younger generation's disappointment. The (televised) debate among Kuan Yew and the youths ended up as (a debate) on whether it is right to be disrespectful (to Kuan Yew), but that is not the issue.<br><br>So do you still pin the hope on the younger generation?<br><br>I think in every political process, they still need new ideas. The youths seem more distracted and show more concern for materialism than political ideals. Singapore wanted to use, although not overtly, Israel as a model to harden national consensus and the sense of national survival.<br><br>But I think that is a different context because Israel is very different from Singapore in terms of ethnicity, religion and so on. You can't copy the whole model, the idealism and the sense of nationalism, The urgency is not there.<br><br>The whole justification that Singapore can't have democratic space is that you are surrounded, and thus adopting a kind of 'under siege' mentality. You might get some support in the early period but not in this age. I can always pack up and go, then come back to Singapore as a visitor.<br><br>There is definitely a close political culture and historical link between Singapore and Malaysia. It is better for us to emphasise on our common destiny instead of differences. Is it by coincidence that the younger generation did not feel any affinity for Malaysia or is it the consequences of the way the Singapore state handles the relationship. I think Singaporeans will know more about Europe or Australia or those places where the culture is alien compared to Malaysia. We have to ask ourselves, is this healthy? Can Singapore's long term destiny be completely independent from Malaysia?<br><br>You think Malaysians have the same misunderstanding towards Singaporeans?<br><br>If you study in Britain, then you will know how people in the campus look at Singaporeans. There is the impression that they are arrogant, does not have that kind of maturity to understand the differences and disparity; and that they always think they are more sophisticated. In UK campuses, the 'kiasu' mentality is alive and kicking.<br><br>Malaysian Chinese may see Singapore as a heaven for career, and really, Singapore, I must say, is very well managed. (But) that cannot be a justification for the restraints in giving political rights. I think Singapore is effective because it has a powerful state intervention apparatus which is far better than any industrialised country.<br><br>Someone told me that the government is giving more publicity to the opposition. Apparently Lee Hsien Long is trying to appear to have a clean fight so that they can enjoy a more convincing win. And PAP will win convincingly again.<br><br>The whole political process in Singapore is so sterile that nobody will challenge the state's authority unless the state feels there is the need to relax a bit for their interest. In Singapore, they will give you the basic rights if only when they feel is good for them. That's why I can never agree with them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A cosmopolitan and inclusive society is a society which can accommodate different views and alternatives of people including those who disagree with established order like Tan Wah Piow.<br><br>So when Tan Wah Piow said the election is an embarrassment to the government of LHL, it will be for the cosmopolitan society to make due allowance of that view by trying to improve on the past performance.<br><br>Sterile or not is the present order may be a matter of opinion but where such differences exist, the cosmopolitan society will make adjustment by coming up with solutions to make it more vibrant - not by clamping down of Tan Wah Piow and start calling him names.<br><br>The record of LHL will be judged by his ability to stay cosmopolitan in his actions not repeating the past with justification and look-good presentation through the media.

Tan -- a third-year architectural student, and president of the University of Singapore Students Union (USSU) -- was charged, together with two others, with rioting inside the premises of the Pioneer Industries Employees' Union (PIEU), a government-controlled trade union, whose general secretary was Phey Yew Kok, a member of parliament and rising star on the PAP firmament. Phey was also president of the National Trades Union Congress, which has strong symbiotic ties with the PAP government.<br><br>The trial was partisan justice at its ugliest before the ambitious district court judge T.S. Sinnathuray, who kept Tan and his co-accused on a choke-leash. Tan's application for an adjournment to enable his counsel, John Platts-Mills, QC -- who had already been specially admitted to the Singapore bar -- to travel to Singapore for the purpose was twice denied by the trial judge.<br><br><strong>Vital defence witnesses were arrested on the morning of the trial, and deported.</strong><br><br>The defendants claimed the riot within, and damage to, the premises had been fabricated by Phey Yew Kok, but they were not allowed to produce evidence of it at the trial, as indeed other matters they considered crucial to their case.<br><br>Concerned at the judge's selective recordings of the proceedings, Tan applied for the trial to be tape-recorded, which was denied.<br><br>The judge for his part made no bones of what the outcome of the proceedings would be. His periodic ejaculations, <span style="color: red;">"Forget about public interest!", "Forget about justice!", and "Forget about a fair trial!"</span> -- albeit vented in exasperation to Tan's urgent applications or protestations to his rulings -- punctuated the proceedings, setting a leitmotif, which became a grim reality.<br><br>All three accused were found guilty, and convicted. Tan was sentenced to one year's imprisonment, and his co-accused to one month's imprisonment each.<br><br>Shortly afterwards, Sinnathuray was promoted to the high court.<br><br>An Australian Queen's Counsel, Frank Galbally, who observed the trial for the Australian Union of Students, said: "In Australia, the case would be laughed out of court ... the evidence and procedure ... would, in my opinion, have aborted any trial in Australia ... [The three accused] did not get a fair trial. ... In my opinion, it is just a political trial."<br><br>The experience of an English silk in a criminal trial in Singapore provides another perspective. Alun Jones, QC, discharged himself "for the first time in 23 years' practice," describing the judicial proceedings as "a travesty of a trial" and a "perversion of a judicial process." The trial judge displayed a "craven attitude" towards the prosecution. </span></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Immediately after serving his jail sentence, Tan was 'called-up' for National Service, and sent to the Artillery Unit. He probably got additional 'fixxing' attention from the Artillery Unit, which was constantly moving the 120mm Mortars manually on route marches.<br><br>Do we need to guess who was carrying the 120mm Motar Base Plate or the Barrel ?<br><br>Knowing that you will be constantly humiliated and psychologically fixed, will you not AWOL and stay away ?<br><br>During about the same period, and as a 'White Horse' - did LHL even get to carry the bipod for 120mm motar, let alone the barrel or its base plate ?<br><br>Tan Wah Piow was only a NUS Student Union Leader, with youthful enthusiasm to be socially active, to help the industrial workers to understand their Workers' Rights.<br><br>What was the crime that Tan Wah Piow committed to be fixed to such an extent ?<br><br>Incidentally, <a href="http://www.cpib.gov.sg/exhibitionrm/ex_cinvest6pheyyewkok03.htm" rel="nofollow"><strong>Phey Yew Kok</strong></a> later absconded from Singapore Justice after he was discovered for corruption in the development of the Big Splash project at the East Coast Park.<br><br>Surprisingly, this Government spent more money and time to track and persecute Francis Seow than taking any interest in bringing Phey Yew Kok back to Singapore for justice to be executed. </span><br><br></div>

Tan -- a third-year architectural student, and president of the University of Singapore Students Union (USSU) -- was charged, together with two others, with rioting inside the premises of the Pioneer Industries Employees' Union (PIEU), a government-controlled trade union, whose general secretary was Phey Yew Kok, a member of parliament and rising star on the PAP firmament. Phey was also president of the National Trades Union Congress, which has strong symbiotic ties with the PAP government.<br><br>The trial was partisan justice at its ugliest before the ambitious district court judge T.S. Sinnathuray, who kept Tan and his co-accused on a choke-leash. Tan's application for an adjournment to enable his counsel, John Platts-Mills, QC -- who had already been specially admitted to the Singapore bar -- to travel to Singapore for the purpose was twice denied by the trial judge.<br><br>Vital defence witnesses were arrested on the morning of the trial, and deported.<br><br>The defendants claimed the riot within, and damage to, the premises had been fabricated by Phey Yew Kok, but they were not allowed to produce evidence of it at the trial, as indeed other matters they considered crucial to their case.<br><br>Concerned at the judge's selective recordings of the proceedings, Tan applied for the trial to be tape-recorded, which was denied.<br><br>The judge for his part made no bones of what the outcome of the proceedings would be. His periodic ejaculations, "Forget about public interest!", "Forget about justice!", and "Forget about a fair trial!" -- albeit vented in exasperation to Tan's urgent applications or protestations to his rulings -- punctuated the proceedings, setting a leitmotif, which became a grim reality.<br><br>All three accused were found guilty, and convicted. Tan was sentenced to one year's imprisonment, and his co-accused to one month's imprisonment each.<br><br>Shortly afterwards, Sinnathuray was promoted to the high court.<br><br>An Australian Queen's Counsel, Frank Galbally, who observed the trial for the Australian Union of Students, said: "In Australia, the case would be laughed out of court ... the evidence and procedure ... would, in my opinion, have aborted any trial in Australia ... [The three accused] did not get a fair trial. ... In my opinion, it is just a political trial."<br><br>The experience of an English silk in a criminal trial in Singapore provides another perspective. Alun Jones, QC, discharged himself "for the first time in 23 years' practice," describing the judicial proceedings as "a travesty of a trial" and a "perversion of a judicial process." The trial judge displayed a "craven attitude" towards the prosecution.<br><br>Incidentally, <a href="http://www.cpib.gov.sg/exhibitionrm/ex_cinvest6pheyyewkok03.htm" rel="nofollow">[b]Phey Yew Kok</a></strong> later absconded from Singapore Justice after he was discovered for corruption in the development of the Big Splash project at the East Coast Park.<br><br>Surprisingly, this Government spent more money and time to track and persecute Francis Seow than taking any interest in bringing Phey Yew Kok back to Singapore for justice to be executed. [/color]<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>thank you for the input.<br><br>it is smart of Tan to seek political aslyum in UK. If he were to remain here he wont be able to realise his full potential.
