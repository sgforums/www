              <p><em>This week, the gov't mouthpiece replaced "S'pore rejects emission cuts" with "S'pore will do its fair share"</em></p>
              <p><a href="http://bit.ly/38nt7B">The Thursday article</a></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE sent a strong signal on Thursday that it will not be prepared to accept any emissions cuts as part of a global agreement to tackle climate change at an international summit in Copenhagen later this year.</p>
              <p>Speaking to The Straits Times on the sidelines of the 11th Asean Ministerial Meeting on the Environment on Thursday, Minister for the Environment &amp; Water Resources Yaacob Ibrahim said: 'We are not obligated to set targets or reduce emissions, but...we will do our part.'</p>
              <p>'Whatever we do, we cannot compromise our ability to grow. So how we find a balance will be a continuous process.'</p>
              <p>He added that the Government is continually reviewing its targets across all sectors of the economy and assessing how they can be improved.</p>
              <p>Singapore's stance comes despite pressure from countries like Japan and Australia, which have said the Republic should be subjected to firm targets because of high per capita emissions from industries here.</p>
              <p>The other Asean countries - with the exception of Indonesia, which announced reduced emissions targets earlier this month - have adopted a similar position.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_448485.html">Current article</a></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE is committed to ongoing international efforts to tackle the climate change issue and is prepared to play its part if a global agreement is reached, Environment and Water Resources Minister Yaacob Ibrahim said on Friday.</p>
              <p>If climate change is to be addressed effectively, there must be a concerted effort by all countries, he said, in a statement responding to queries from the media on the issue.</p>
              <p>'And to move the process forward, we need a fair global solution that takes into account differences in national circumstances,' he said.</p>
              <p>Dr Yaacob issued his comments from Barcelona, where he is attending the Informal Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change.</p>
              <p>This is being held ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December, where a new global warming treaty is set to be signed.</p>
              <p>He noted on Friday that Singapore is not an AnnexI country and is not obligated to take on economy-wide targets on reducing emissions.</p>
              <p><em>My opinion: The "global solution" is really just a red herring. While the focus is on climate change and the jury is still out on whether that's man-made or who contributes the most, it's linked to other urgent issues. For one, cutting our consumption of natural resources and energy is the obvious one that helps lower emissions and waste. </em></p>
              <p><em>That of courseruns counter to "growth" (which is really just digging our own graves), but I'm disappointed that our leaders don't have the moral courage to rethink the status quo and shelve the current never-ending "growth" targets in favour of a more sustainable model. Taking the backseat though means that there is one less voice to compel the likes of China to follow suit.</em></p>

              <p>Hello, one country effort is not going to save the world, besides, climate changes does not imply totally on emission problem, some scientist said that the world is wobbling, some said that the world naturally change after a few thousand years, some said the world is readjusting itself, some said the ice age or dry era is a natural process of earth evolution.</p>
              <p>In my opinon, everyone is talking about greenhouse effect and drafting out steps to reduce emission and waste, all of them can blah blah black sheep in APEC or World forum etc etc...but who actually do it? Consider those top economy nation of the world that need alots of power to generate their factories and economy, are they taking steps?? if not, do u think a red dot economy state like singapore alone can stop the iceberg from melting?? Now, who live more near to the north??</p>

              <p>it starts with me..</p>
              <p>simple huh?</p>
              <p>as long as the people and not the politicians want to do it, the politicians will be FORCED to do it..</p>
              <p>ultimately, it's the people who actually hold the power... by rejecting the things which aren't very environmentally friendly, we force the corporations to change...</p>
              <p>on the simplest scale, we stop buying bottled water and bring a bottle with us, filling it from the tap (it is safe goddamnit!! don't boil the water!! it's a total waste of time and energy!) we negate the need for plastics, shipping, energy and more...</p>

              <p>In typical fashion of "giving with one hand and taking back with two" - the Singapore Government has made all the right moves in reducing registration fees and rebates on the use of hybrid cars, but it has also quietly made more money from the owners of the hybrid cars throughout the economic life of the cars.</p>
              <p>It does this by having the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://starbamboo.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-is-singapore-discouraging-hybrid-cars/">‘LTA decides to tax hybrid vehicles based on their power output, instead of the engine capacity as for their petrol counterparts’ (*1) </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> <strong>Design an efficient engine that generates more power, and your reward is higher road tax.</strong></p>
              <p>Let’s take a look at an example, say the luxurious and (relatively) fuel-efficient <a href="http://www.aas.com.sg/features/archive/f11069.htm"><span style="color: #909d73;">Lexus RX400h</span></a>.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Engine capacity: 3311cc. 6-month road tax for petrol car of equivalent engine capacity: $1,836 </li>
              <li>Power rating: 268bhp (200kW). 6-month road tax for hybrid RX400h: $2,975 </li>
              </ul>
              <p>That’s a staggering <strong>$2,278 more per year </strong>you have to pay for the privilege of driving an eco-friendly, fuel-efficient hybrid vehicle in Singapore.</p>
