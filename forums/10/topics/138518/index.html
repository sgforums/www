If he did...... why implemented 'STOP AT TWO' policy which LKY formulated in the late <span class="large"><strong>60s</strong></span>. He wanted families to be kept small so that the population won't get out of control and parents will be able to <strong>provide better education for our children</strong>(to add this, must be fair to LKY).  But he failed to foresee the growth of the economy that actually LKY had made a wrong decision which he won't admit.<br><br>Last year in Strait Times on 26 November 2004,  on first page concerning the master of languages.  Freaking government had been promoting bilingual in English and Chinese which resulted most people become half Fcuk in the both languages. Now, reluctantly he admitted that he was wrong  that a person could never master both languages at the same time  (Which he can't achieve, but if he could....hah..hah.... you will see...)<br>But he mentioned....parents are empower to let your children go for more English but less Chinese or more Chinese or less English; by mastering one language whether it will  turn out to be useful or not,  the choice is yours!  <strong>Don't Blame the government.</strong><br><br>I cannot stand the way everytime he talk, very blant and thinks that he's a mighty god.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Strait Times mentioned that LKY brought the English medium into the govt sys, of course LKY is English educated where he knew nothing about chinese or a little in malay.  Great Great Sir Stamford Raffles started that millions years ago not LKY.</div>

Many ppl misjudged the government by saying it is bad and so on...but what choice do we have? we have to keep changing to attract all these foreign investors, to input funds into us.

The rise in fares will be approved once they justified for the rise as the governemnt cant afford to let them go bankrupt. then it will be chaotic just like in the early 60s.<br><br>just sharing, something i learn</div>
