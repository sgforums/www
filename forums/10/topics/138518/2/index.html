This post is certainly significantly objective. Not that I agree with all your points entirely though. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> (for the record, I'm the <span style="font-style: italic;">absolute</span> cynic)<br><br>Firstly, The government is not equal to Singapore; it is merely a subset. What is bad for the govt eg. losing seats in the GE is not necessarily bad for Singaporeans as a whole.<br><br>Secondly, calling forummers immature is not exactly being very objective. I do agree with you that people who post stuff like "LKY"s lackey" or "Scumbag" or whatever are certianly very rude. But I would say - however uncomfortable u may feel - that this is merely an expression, albeit a rather forceful one, of their anger and discontent, although perhaps the mods should open up another forum for venting of such ...err.. violent sentiments.  ANd I might remind you too that whilst there are these people in the anti-PAP camp, there is the same type of people in the pro-PAP camp. And I guess these people have to realize that calling people "traitors" or "useless idiots" just because they oppose government policy is equally as rude and uncouth. Apparently, you seem to ahve given this point oversight.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ANyway, it is too hasty to conclude from this that Singaporeans are not ready to embrace more freedom. What defines readiness anyway? I would say that some have already embraced it.<br><br>Thirdly, go read up on the Shadow Parliament system of the UK. the UK government finances the shadow parliament, and I don't really see that granting teh current UK government any form of political suicide, at least not yet. PAP does have an obligation to ensure the survival of the opposition parties, because it has the obligation to maintain Singapore's Democracy. Without the oppo, there can be no genuine elections, because all the candidates will be from one party - then the elections will just be like Soviet elections. And it is interesting to note that while the oppo have the complement the PAP, there is no obligation of the PAP to complement the oppo. I am really doubtful that the opposition really have no pedigree, and I'm sure there are otehrs who agree.<br><br>Fourthly, I agree with your point on the assets. But of course apart from the assets, the Family certainly indirectly owns more things eg. the press, which is supposed to be a joint-stock company, SIA, which is supposed to be a private company, and PSA. So it stands really true that they must start relinquishing their control, or Singapore might be doomed to stagnation.<br><br>regards,<br>the pikamaster<br></div>

The same can be said for them regarding me. But no matter. What I want to say is this: I'm a brutally honest person. Sometimes I make extremely blunt comments and remarks regarding any kind of issue. It will rub the wrong way with some people. I expect that. But nothing gets people going than the harsh truth.<br><br>The truth hurts but it gets people going. It makes a discussion interesting. A vibrant discussion will come up with new ideas. That's why in overseas companies, such an environment is cultivated. I'm doing my part in trying to have a culture like this in Singapore- to re-vitalise the stale, boring working culture.<br><br>Anyway, I have read a bit of Bill Clinton's  <span style="font-style: italic;">My Life</span> autobiography and I think this message by him can also apply here regarding the PAP. As always, anyone from any political side can discuss this:<br><br>" The Republican burden is their record of denial, evasion and neglect. But our burden is to give people a new choice, rooted in old values, a new choice that is simplem that offers opportunity, demands responsibility, gives citizens more say, provides them responsive government- all because we recognize that we are a community. We are all in this together, and we are going up or down together."<br><br>And then he goes on to elaborate:<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;"> The opportunity agenda meant economic growth through free and fair trade, as well as more investments in new technologies and in world class education and skills. The responsibility agenda required something of all citizens: national service for young people in return for college aid; welfare reforms that required able-bodied parents to work but provided more support for their children; tougher child-support enforcement; more efforts by parents to keep their kids in school; a reinvented government, with less bureaucracy and more choices in child care, public schools, job training, eldery care, neighbourhood policing and the management of public housing.<br><br>The community Agenda requires us to invest more in our millions of poor children<strong>(maybe not applicable to most S'porean families) </strong>, and to reach across the racial divide, to build a politics based on lifting up all Americans, not dividing them against each other[/b]</span><br><br>Discuss.</div>

Why do i say so? Simply because Singapore do have to a less extent, the formulation of a shadow minister post, the NMP or the NCMP in the elections. However how is this viewed among cynical Singaporeans? They reckon that these MPs are nothing but running dogs of the PAP establishment. We cannot validate the authencity of their claim, but this notion is commonly held. Thus what makes you think the PAP government's decision to create a Shadow Cabinet will be widely accepted as a move towards greater democracy? I am sure the majority will feel this is another of the government's attempt to fool the public.<br><br>Secondly, practicality must be exercised. In Singapore's parliament there are currently 94 MPs, in contrast the British parliament have nearly 1000+ members in the House of Lords and the House of Commons. How are we supposed to create a shadow parliament when in the very place, we do not have the manpower to do so? A watered-down version may be suggested(like having only Shadow Ministers for the more important posts), but than again, i do not see how the public will react to a say Shadow Minister of Defense. You being the absolute cynic, knows better than i do on what general reactions we will receive.<br><br>I believe the most imporant factor here would be the level of readiness among Singaporeans. Yes, you may feel that you are ready and mature enough to vote. Yet i believe majority of Singaporeans are not, we are pocurante in every aspect of life. We have developed, in a colloquial term, a "kiasee" attitude which is present in all Singaporeans, be it rich or poor, educated or not.<br><br>You want democracy? Yes you may. But first we have to get the grounding. You cannot have democracy overnight. Just as Rome wasn't built in a day, we have to take a democractic process step by step. Thus the matter in context now is not whether we have a democractic nation, but rather, are we moving towards democracy?<br><br>I do see positive steps being made towards achieving a responsible, participated nation. For one, the setting up of the Today newspaper. I believe it has achieved what the Straits Times cannot. Look at the news it covers and compare them with the same article being pasted in the Straits Time. I have observed that numerous sensitive articles which normally will not have appeared in the Straits Time have been printed in Today. I will quote a very recent example. The recent loss of an American survillence aircraft in "Western Asia". This was printed lock stock barrell in the Straits Times. But Today included a more( i believe a step towards greater relaxation of censorship) controversial line -"which many analysts believe to refer to the Middle East." Yes, this may seem inconsequential to many of you people. But it IS a positive step taken by the government and we must acknowledge it.<br><br>Again, we take steps forward yet we backtrack. However you don't expect a man to stop smoking overnight, similarly the government will not attempt to transform its image overnight. It is something they won't, and cannot do. Imagine the social backlash if tomorrow the government pardons JBJ? Euphoria will erupt, BUT the public will expect greater steps to be taken immediately. It's like the classic chinese saying "De Chun Jin Chi", everybody wants more. Hence it is in my view, incorrect to liberalise the country overnight. Step by step it must be, no matter how small it is. The Catholic Church is one great example, it too was once a sectarian, dogmatic monolitic organisation which have opposed changes. However with time it has changed, and yet not even completely. Their refusal to admit female cardinals is but one of them. Thus, how can we expect the PAP government, from its authoritarian roots to transform overnight? Not possible.<br><br>The last point i would like to make you may not agree. I for one am no advocate for democracy at its purest. It is impossible for us to achieve pure democracy in a society, an Asian society where we have no slightest inclination of what democracy really means. Instead, we must adapt democracy to suit us. Just like the Chinese adapted socialism, we cannot blindly follow the examples set by democractic predecessors and follow suit. I shudder to think how China will have turned out to be if the reformists in the CCP have not proceed with their non-Soviet lines of policy.<br><br>The Chinese case would be a good comparison for us. The reformists took nearly 50years to accomplish their goal. We too must not rush. I believe many things can only be said in retrospect. Hence decisions taken now can only be evaluated in hindsight. We cannot judge present decisions in a present context. I would not say that our ministers are demi godly who can think so far ahead, but i believe they have the ability and capability to think for the future. Many have criticised the Esplanade, the BioPark ventures as being a waste of money and a white elephant. But i for one, enjoy the Esplanade. It is being host to an increasing smorgasbord of arts. Do indie bands once have a venue to play at? While they do now, the Baybeats concert at Esplanade. Changes are taking place, yet it is slow, and we are impatient.<br><br>Yes there are failures. But without the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, would China have progressed? Similarly, without the Challenger incident, would space travel progress? We must learn from mistakes that is most important. And thus in a bid for democracy, we too must accept that mistakes will be made.<br><br>And that is where we, the People come in. We voice our opinons in a bid to make it heard. At least than, we're doing our part. No matter how insignificant you think it is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your views are respectable, but not inpracticable. For any progress to be made, there must be concrete steps in doing so. If you want to implement candor, honesty and transparency in a business system and culture, then you need to implement it in a good speed but not as slow as you advocate.<br><br>The reason on why I believe we must liberate or die is because competition doesn't wait for one to catch up- or for one to be No.1. Let's face it, it's a huge competitive environment there. If we don't open up our markets and allow SMEs to become a real component of the S'pore economy, then when are we gonna do it?<br><br>The economy is fading, my friend and it's fading fast- faster than you think. While you advocate a slow-and-easy path, others are running way ahead of you. I'm not advocating we start running at 100km/hr when we can barely run up to 80. But still we must continue to push ourselves to start running at 100km/hr...or even better push our limits to run at 110km/hr.<br><br>If we were ahead, I wouldn't mind taking an easier pace. But the fact remains we are getting real behind. And if we want to regain our former position, then we need to stop thinking that "slow is easy and progress inevitable".<br><br>Forget about the PAP. They are no longer gonna care about general Singaporeans. They never change their spots. Reform to the current system will never address the issues because the current system benefits them greatly. If we want a Singapore govt that truly speaks for the people and is elected by the people, then its time to consider a different party that can run the country in the manner that we all want it to be.<br><br>The PAP will be history.<br><br>P.S I think about Jack Welch and I think about the way he managed GE from 1980 to 2001. Of course, change must be implemented in such a way that people in the system will not get disorientated. But still we must maintain a certain speed in the process of change. There's little chance of progress if we are too slow and vice versa. So if we wanna progress, then we must push the limit at a regular basis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I too do not feel that a shadow cabinet is practical in the case of Singapore. But for different reasons.<br><br>The shadow cabinet in the UK exist for the populace to measure and compare political alternatives. With Labor in power, the shadow cabinet of Conservatives gives the electorate an idea of the policies they would have implemented as opposed to those being implemented by the actual government.<br><br>To form a shadow cabinet from the PAP ranks that reports to the PAP leadership is a complete and utter farce, and serves only to distract the people from the fact that Singapore is, and have been a one party system for the last couple of decades.<br><br>To move towards a responsible, participative nation that is politically aware, moves must be made to encourage political debate and the participation of citizens in the electoral process. While the government has been very active in the talking aspect - implemented policies tend to run in the opposite direction.<br><br>Multi-million defamation suits based on flimsy innuendoes. Stat boards slapping down overseas student for daring to criticize it. Political donations act. Political films act. Writers get the smack down from the PM for suggesting thereÂ’s a growing rift in our society. Imaginary, vague OB lines that are scattered like landmines over the landscape of political discourse... the list goes on and on. Actions speak far louder than words - from the actions it seems that our leadership is not truly ready for real political debates.<br><br>On the spectrum of democratic models Singapore is not even anywhere remotely near a pure democracy. In reality we have been a one party state model that have unceasingly used all available tools to perpetuate its existence. The justification offered by the one party, is that it is good - and that the 'simplification' of the political process aids it in its goal of achieving greater prosperity for Singapore.<br><br>At this point of time, I am not quite ready to buy the above line hook and sinker anymore. To me, the greatest need for Singapore now is a political alternative. To Singapore, the creation of a real political alternative is the first true step towards fostering a responsible, participative nation that is politically conscious. After all, what to see/think/talk about if its just one party bullying its way to sure win victory har?<br></div>

I would say give Singapore 10 years, and in the time where we managed to recover, hey the world is now 10 years ahead!</div></blockquote>My revolution is not a violent one. As I said, changes are inevitable. Either we change or we die. I rather that we do change at a constant pace than not change at all.<br><br>My view of change doesn't just address short term issues but also long term issues- in that respect, it will not be sudden and short. Rather, we will have a system, renewed with reforms, based on old values and created by old values that will not only address the current problems at hand, but also takes a long term view of the future ahead of us. More importantly, a transparent business and political system, based on traditional values such as honesty(candor), openess and responsibility will last long enough as long as the right people are appointed at regular intervals to ensure that not only the system remains strong and relevant- it remains efficient and with little cost to the ordinary people on the street.<br><br>I do not trust the PAP to do that. The current system is their cash cow and as long as it remains so, any reform attempt by them will not address the problem on a long term basis. Sure, it may help at the short term but that's never enough. Besides, like I said, any reform attempt will not go deep enough. It only addresses the current illnesses but it will not fully treat the virus fully that has infected our system.<br><br>The only way I feel, is to have good reforms that goes deep enough, not just to address the short term issues, but also address the long term issues that affect the problem. In this respect, the system that the PAP has had created for its sole benefit must be addressed fully and fully given the best medicine it needs. That's why I believe that the Temasek Holdings' empire locally and overseas must be dismantled.<br><br>And I truly believe that, to reduce the inefficiency in our bloated civil system, harsh, tough reforms must be made to ensure it is so. There will be less fat cats in the civil service. There's no way around it- just hard, tough reforms for the civil service.<br><br>If the rich fat cats get sacked, that's because they have their own poor performances to blame for it. When they get sacked, the reasons will be publicly released on why they were sacked. There won't be mumbo-jumbo crap like "I resigned for personal reasons" or "I agreed to resign so as to take care of my family". If they get sacked, then the real reasons will be given. They are hanged publicly.<br><br>Only then, will the public take the government seriously about reform. Reducing the scale of civil servants in public service will reduce the red tape and inefficiency and streamline the burecuracy in the govt. In that respect, I will spare nothing or no-one to reach that goal: reduce the number of layers in government to the absolute minimum.<br><br>I wouldn't mind called "Neutron Tim" for the matter. I just believe that, in order to get back the efficiency, then we must address the heart of the problem. To do that, we must not only consider the short term future, but the long term one as well.</div>

THe governemnt promote huge corporations to set up their HQ over here as we can provide the HR, and hence use Singapore as stepping stone to nearby neighbouring countries.<br><br>And there is the triangle relationship between Singapore, Malaysia and Indo. where Singapore chips in the manpower, resources while the latter provides land. one successful example is the batam island and you guys heard of SUzhou Industry park? heard they even have a small merlion there.<br><br>Do not think that the ministers is staying in their offices, shake leg and count notes? They are now looking forward to such opportinuites in India now, that explain the visits from our ministers to isolated countries. The ministers' wish is that if one day they become successful, they will not forget us and give us a piece of the pie.<br><br>we are talking about globalisation now, our leaders know that we cant survive alone, that is why governemnt is calling us to go out of SG, to venture out, but remain as Singaporean</div>
