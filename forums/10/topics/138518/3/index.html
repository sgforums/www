Much money were spent to see it go to waste. Below are some examples :<br><br>1) Esplanade that merely stood there like to durians.<br>2) Clone merlions that failed to bring in tourist<br>3) Logistic Hub which resulted in plenty of vacant warehouses in Toh Guan and one half complete in Tuas.<br><br>There are many many more examples that lead to the lpublic from loosing their faith in the party.<br></div></blockquote>both 1 and 2 are symbol and identity that represent Singapore. 1 is supposed to be comparable to Sydney opera house while 2 is like statute of liberty. The merlion represent the combination lion of SAng nila Uthama and we as a fishing village.<br><br>3, i not sure about that but i think there must be some reasons,so do you mean we built only when needed?morover the warehouses is built according to supply and demand.It is because at that year, the contractors forsee a demand in warehouses?just like houses?building cant be built overnight, otherwise it will be too late and may disrupt the supply and demand curve. hence the constant supply must be ther to prevent the large fluatation of prices.</div>
