Your team of friends seem to be of the younger age group.<br><br>Don't forget the older generation. They would also be going to the election and they have gone through many elections.  If your party does not appeal to them, excite or convince them, you will not be getting their support. Are your party able to get people of the older generation? Can your party work with people of older generation?<br><br>You have to be mindful that you can field candidates who are cut across racial lines and age groups. In other words, candidates from difference race, social-economic background and generation.<br><br>When every vote counts, the older generation as well as the minority can  forces to reckon with.<br><br>2) Whether you deem your political party as opposition or not that would not be of significance. The PAP would still regard you as opposing their ideas or they would attack or discredit your idea of "opposition but don't want to oppose anything".<br><br>I don't think it is so much as the form of your party but the substance which your political party stands and the PAP govt would try to attack or discredit the values of what you people stands for.<br><br>In any case, the electorate would ask you if "opposition but don't want to oppose anything" than why oppose? How would you and your party preparing to reply them?<br><br>Anyway, brave attempt. We need more people like you guys in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its nice to know that there are people around in Singapore who are willing to take the risk and initiative to do their part in achieving a better life for Singaporeans.<br><br>However, the blog that I have seen makes me doubts the quality and ideas of the political party members.<br><br>The posts on car pooling and cigarettes are not good enough to be implemented in Singapore again. Hence, this does not show any foresight, maturity and original ideas that the team or the blogger is able to come up with. If this new political team is going to go about regaining the laws of Singapore, i think Singapore is only going to go back into the past and not move forward with the rest of the nations around us. In this case, we will most probably end up to where we are again or maybe even better or worse.<br><br>There is this nice spirit in you in thinking of doing your part for society, but do not forget that this comes with a huge amount of foresight, intelligence, leadership skills, persuasion and many other qualities for people to trust and hand their future in the country to you. Try discussing with your team members as to what can be done to improve the living, economic and social conditions in Singapore base on the originality of your group ideas. Of course, the implementation have to be on a long term basis or this new political party might face a very hard time in getting Singaporeans to place their trust and rice bowl in your hands.<br><br></div>

If you were to judge a politician by his blog, who would vote for Foreign Minister George Yeo - his blog is more bland than a 3rd-round teabag...  Anyway, whatever a politician may choose to say in his blog, it's his/her actions that will speak the loudest with the voters.<br><br>I understand that it's a huge responsibility to form a political party. But while I think that SOME political parties should take their job seriously (i.e. to aim to run the country well), I also think that there's room in a democracy for ALL sorts of party, simply because in a democracy, everyone has a right to garner votes for thier viewpoints, no matter how silly they may seem to some. See <a href="http://www.omrlp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.omrlp.com/</a> for a shining example from England.<br><br>I feel that my friends and I have our hearts in the right place: whatever we stand for, our proposed party would want the best for every S'porean, rich or poor. With this level-headedness, our proposed party is prepared to praise the good work of PAP where applicable (unlike most of the opposition parties today), but we are also keen to point out weaknesses when necessary (and suggest viable alternatives).<br><br>Wish us strength!<br></div></blockquote>So would like to share some of your ideas or plans for the future of your party before we wish you strength?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Politics is not about countering or proposing proposal to anyone. Is how you going to help these nation and how you going to help the ppl around you. Oppostion in Singapore fail to do that. They only come out when election comes. They not even ground to earth. There is why there is such thing call grassroot. Politicians have to be responsible of what they do and say, is not that easy. If you can selfless help a country. They will be a good politician</div>

You might not win and for all we know you are not serious. That is OK. Democracy is all-comers. Simply stating your intentions takes guts. For all we know, you could be a P*P rep running around.
