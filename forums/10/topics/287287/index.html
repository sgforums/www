            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Law on unlawful assembly<br><br>This refers to clauses 29 and 30 of the Bill. By clause 29 of the Bill, we are removing the heading Â“Offences Against Public TranquilityÂ” and replacing it with Â“Offences relating to Unlawful AssemblyÂ”. By Clause 30, we will be deleting Â“mischief or trespass or other offenceÂ” and replacing it with Â“to commit any offenceÂ”.<br><br>S 141 has been amended to bring it in line with a recent Court of Appeal case: PP v Tan Meng Khin [1995] 2 SLR 505. Now, an assembly will be unlawful if people intend to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment of 6 mths or more, even if it is peaceful and does not disturb public tranquility. Under our law, a person who organizes a procession or assembly after the police rejection of a permit can be punished with max 6 months jail under the Miscellaneous Offences Act. Hence 5 or more people who gather to do so will become members of an unlawful assembly.<br><br>The decision in Tan Meng KhinÂ’s case overturned another Court of Appeal decision PP v Fo Son Hing one year before that. In the earlier case, the Court of Appeal considered the words of S 141 and determined that it was aimed at gatherings which threatened public tranquility or a breach of the peace, and hence peaceful gatherings would not be punished as unlawful assemblies. In the later case of Tan Meng Khin, the Court of Appeal changed its mind and read S 141 to cover gatherings to commit any offence even if there is no threat to public tranquility.<br><br>Connected with this, offences connected to unlawful assembly show drastic increases in maximum jail terms. Being a member of such an assembly will see stakes rise from a max of 6 months jail to 2 years jail, a 4X increase. Joining an unlawful assembly knowing it has been commanded to disperse, will go up from 2 years to 5 years.<br><br>Sir, we should bear in mind that there are already many laws in place which can punish people who attempt or collaborate with others to commit any offence. The prosecution has enough to choose from to charge groups of people who collaborate to commit crime e.g. abetment, conspiracy, attempt.<br><br>Article 14(1) of the Constitution supposedly enshrines the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms. Although Art 14(2) allows Parliament to set limits to this freedom, it is stated that it should be for the security of Singapore and public order, and no more than that.<br><br>Sir, let us distinguish between gatherings which are violent such as rioting, and those which are peaceful.<br><br>The constant refrain of fearing law and order problems makes a mockery of licensing law Â– why have a law saying a permit is needed, when it is seldom granted? Minister for Law mentioned on Fri that Singapore needed controls as we were a densely populated country. But so is Hongkong.<br><br>As our society continues to evolve, the time is surely ripe for us to allow peaceful outdoor protests as a form of expression. By all means, we can have rules about how, where and when such processions may be held, but wider law reform is needed. S 141 should be restricted to offences which threaten the public peace, and other laws such as the Miscellaneous Offences Act which require permits for peaceful assemblies should be modified.</div>

She speaks with a lot of common sense too and not legal jargon.<br><br>If the state wants to attribute a offence like unlawful assembly it should not just prohibit assembly per se but should reference it an assembly with a common intent to participate in something illegal or crimes. There ought to be a principal act for which such a assembly is undesirable and to be prohibited.<br><br>If the principal act is to call to attention something concerning the government's policies like its involvement with Myanmar military junta or RSAF flying over Myanmar airspace or arm dealings then the principal act is not criminal or illegal or criminal.<br><br>Such an offence like unlawful assembly cannot stand alone as it is meaningless and may give rise to punishing assembly which are harmless or even good for the government like supporting its call to bring about peaceful transition or reconciliation in Myanmar.<br></div>

If prostitution is banned, what happens ?  u know and maybe I know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>the fact is prostitution is immoral to an extent especially to married men.<br><br>But what if to protect people based on this immorality, and ban all prostitution such that anyone caught prostituting will be death with severely like the worse we can see, then what happens? you know and maybe I know too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The Moral of my immoral story is this :<br><br>Freedomization  has to be given for some things.<br><br>Its like basic needs.<br><br>Sex is a basic need.<br><br>DIY can be painful at times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Too much of it hurts the ego and self-esteem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>do a google search to learn more.<br><br>Thus, its clear that while immoral , somethings need to be freedomised.<br><br>while scared of riot, somethings need to be freedomised.<br><br>while kiasi, somethings need to be freedomised.  example, driving car is in itself, be default has inherant risks - its not how good a drive you are. Its how bad a driver the strangers out there can be. right ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thus, should car driving be prohibited since by doing so, no car accidents will happen. so good right?<br><br>Its clear that with IQ and wisdom in handling and managing, freedomised actions can become as normal as driving a car, a plane or a boat.<br><br>Freedomisation - its how good are you in managing it.<br><br>To me, sg is too tiny to be difficult to manage when  u compare with humongous countries like USA. Even then, USA has not collapsed or become inhospitable and has in fact been the inventors of basically everything you know. Of course, not everything but the key word is 'basically everything'.<br><br>May the Freedom be with You!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
