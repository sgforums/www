              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;">Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The New York Times of Sept 11, 2010 has the story "Days of Reflection for a man who defined Singapore". It is an interview with him by the papers' Seth Mydans in Singapore recently. In it, he reflects upon his life in politics, his wife who is bedridden and his feeling progressively weaker with age at 87 and the realization that he will die very soon. <br><br>His general tone appears to be one of some sadness, as he reflects on his actions over the years to keep him in power, actions which he appears not very proud of, but which he claims were necessary. You can sense guilt in his words. <br><br>Dostoevsky, the Russian novelist and philosopher's theory is that conscience is a much powerful force, even more powerful than Hell after life. In his classic novel Crime and Punishment, the main character who does evil is eventually completely overcome by his conscience when he finally confesses his crimes and looks forward to being punished. By his confession he is released from the agony he suffered in his life by his conscience. <br><br>Lee Kuan Yew in this interview is exactly as the criminal in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. The words he uses gives his state of mind away. He asks "So, when is the last leaf falling", meaning when am I going to die? He says "I can feel the gradual decline of energy and vitality". "And I mean generally every year, when you know you are not on the same level as last year." <br><br>He spoke with envy of people who found strength in religion. Since he did not believe in God, he could only say to himself "Life is just like that". <br><br>About life after death he says "What is next, I do not know, nobody has ever come back". He worries how long and in what form his model (Singapore) may endure once he is gone. <br><br>So in order to keep alive as long as he can, he swims, cycles and has a massage. He says "I know if I rest I will slide downhill fast".<br><br>The interview is a long one and finally he confesses. He says "I am not saying that everything I did was right", "but everything I did was for an honorable purpose. I had to do some nasty things, locking fellows up without trial". <br><br>He also says because Singapore has a multi racial society with Chinese Malays and Indians, democracy will not work and there has to be authoritarian rule. (My paraphrase of what he said).<br><br>I agree, Lee Kuan Yew is going to die sooner than he thinks. It is one thing for a man to keep going with exercise in old age because he wants to keep fit. It is quite another when he keeps fit because he is afraid to die, which Lee is. Lee is not keeping fit because he enjoys it, he rather relax, rest and enjoy life, but he cannot. <br><br>He does it(excercising and keepng fit) instead, because he is afraid for his son whom he appointed the Prime Minister. He realises that his son is simply not up to it, no one respects him and the moment he dies, he will be given the boot or even worse. He realises that the biggest mistake he did was to place his son Prime Minister which now hangs around his neck like the Albatross. In order to keep his son alive, he too has to keep alive, he has no choice. So he fights every single minute of the day for his last breath. <br><br>This sort of desperation will kill him, instead of keeping him alive. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">And then he says the illegal actions he took were honorable. That torturing Lim Chin Siong, Said Zahari, Dr. Lim Hock Chew and Chia Thye Poh and jailing them for decades were were "honorable" actions, even though they were not given a trial and there was not a single piece of evidence that they were a threat to the security of the island.</span></span></strong> <br><br>I think here he is having one of those serious attacks of the conscience, which murderers, rapists and burglars face over the years. Sooner or later the guilt of what they have done overcomes them, and they suffer under it, finding a little comfort in confessing their sins to someone, which Lee is doing now with New York Times.<br><br>I will tell Lee Kuan Yew this and now. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">There was no justification whatsoever for what you have done and what you are doing. In the 1960s there was no justification for you to imprison your political foes without trial for decades. None of them were threats to the security of Singapore. If they were any threat, they were threats to you and no one else and in your greed to hold on to power, you misused the law to put these good men away for no rime or reason. You destroyed them, you destroyed their families and their children. These are actions that Hitler did, just as you have done. So please don't call them honorable, you insult the very word. </span></span></strong><br><br>And your talking of the need to have an authoritarian rule simply because Singapore is a multi racial society is simply funny. Today there is no country in the world that is uniform in race, every country both big and small is multi racial. They are not at each other's throats just because of that. And your excuse to have authoritarian rule just because it is a multi racial society is just silly. It is simply an excuse for you to destroy your opponents and cling to power. <br><br>I am glad you put your son as the Prime Minister. You are going to die soon, you will not last. And with your dying, your son will not know which way to turn. And so will your handpicked sycophantic ministers. Singapore will collapse with you and a new and better Singapore will be born like a Phoenix from the sands. It will be a a better place than this, as Darshan Singh Singapore's world famous executioner( Alan Shadrake's book "Once a Jolly Hangman") used to say to his victims just before he slid the noose under their throats. <br><br>And in passing let me tell you this. Despite Singapore's glass towers and high rise buildings, Singapore is a place much worse than the poorer neighbouring countries. In your Singapore, there is no rule of law, no independent press, and in it, there is a King, which is you, whom everyone has to live in fear of. Living a life such as that is far worse than living in the neighbouring countries where at least one can be free. <br><br><em>Gopalan Nair</em></span></div>

What fear? What apathy?</a></h3>
              <div class="post-body" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em;">
              <p>First posted on <a style="color: #e1771e;" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/08/political-fear-and-apathy-what-fear-what-apathy/">The Online Citizen</a>.<br><br><em>Political filmmaker </em><a style="color: #e1771e;" href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/"><em>Martyn See</em></a><em> reviews that historical 2006 televised debate between MM Lee Kuan Yew and the post 65′ers.</em><br><br> <br><br>During the run-up to the 2006 General Elections, Mediacorp’s Channel News Asia aired a 50 minute-long programme entitled “Why My Vote Matters.” It featured a dialogue session between Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and a selected panel of post 65-ers.<br><br>Televised debates with PAP leaders are extremely rare. Older Singaporeans would have to cast their minds back to the mid-1980s when Select Commitee hearings such as the amendments to the Legal Professions Act were beamed into their living rooms. It had reportedly featured the then Law Society President Francis Seow jousting with then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, with cameo appearances by young lawyers Teo Soh Sung and Tang Fong Har. Two years after the programme was aired, Teo and Tang were detained under the ISA for an alleged “Marxist conspiracy” to subvert the Government. Seow was also arrested a year later.<br><br>Throughout the latter half of the 1980s to the mid 1990s, televised political debates did make recurring appearances, most notably with the live Parliamentary proceedings and other Select Commitee enquiries, including a rare face-off on the cost of living, which featured SDP’s Chee Soon Juan versus PAP’s George Yeo. And there was a particular memorable hearing on the Elected Presidency Bill, when a law lecturer named Walter Woon held his own against a panel of ministerial heavyweights including the then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. By the mid-1990s, ‘Live in Parliament’ and other Select Commitee hearings were eased off the air, sporadically appearing only as heavily-edited spots during the nightly news broadcasts.<br><br>It is in this context that the airing of this 2006 debate makes for such a rare milestone event in Singapore’s television history.<br><br>On hindsight, there are questions one would ask of the station’s executive producers and the Prime Minister’s Office. Why did they see the need to conduct such a televised dialogue? Were they hoping to win the young voters over by allowing the octogenarian to remind them of PAP’s accomplishments? Were they hoping that the young post-65ers’ would be so in awe of the MM that they would capitulate? And why entitle the show “Why My Vote Matters” when half the population of this country have not and will probably not be able to vote, given the number of uncontested seats since the 1980s? Add to that, it was Lee Hsien Loong’s first General Elections as the Prime Minister, so why didn’t he take the hot seat instead of his father?<br><br>Presumptions and motives aside, this televised debate makes for compelling viewing, and some startling revelations, chief of which was how the post 65-ers went straight for the jugular and tabled questions on the uneven playing field, particularly of the GRC system, and on occasions even interrupted the MM. Older Singaporeans conditioned to deference towards Lee would have been appalled at such disrespect shown to the ‘founding father’.<br><br>One young post-65er who stood out was journalist Ken Kwek of the Straits Times’ political desk. Kwek had pinned Lee to the ropes on a survey he had done about political fear. But in a reversal of role, Lee shot back, probing Kwek to disclose the names of his sources.<br><br>Having watched this again on Google video, I found several illuminating moments. I leave marked timecodes of them but I’ll leave it to you to make your own conclusions.<br><br><em>(Ken Kwek has since left the Straits Times. He is currently a playwright and had written the screeplay to the local film The Blue Mansion.)<br>————-</em><br><br>1:47 : On why there are many PAP MP’s who have never contested.<br>2:06 : On why “there isn’t much of a fight.”<br>3:55 : On why the need for GRCs. It’s for racial minority representation.<br>4:33 : When pointed out by Ken Kwek that PAP’s minority candidates had indeed won in single seats prior to implementation of GRC system, Lee replied , “That was with the PAP in complete control. That generation voted for the PAP.” There was a pause. Lee seemed unsure of how to continue. But was interrupted by another question. This is probably the biggest Freudian slip by Lee that the GRC system was implemented for a different reason other than for minority represenatation.<br>4.55 : Voting are “basic, visceral, emotional biases.”<br>8:47 : Potong Pasir and Hougang “have to wait at the end of the queue.”<br>8:57 : Lee asks, “Does any government help the opposition to displace itself?”<br>10:05 : On eliminating the opposition.<br>11.10 : On fear of voting against the PAP.<br>12:04 : No level playing field anywhere.<br>12:42 : We can “guess” but we don’t know who voted against us.<br>13:07 : The grilling of Ken Kwek begins here. You name the voters who are afraid.<br>13:26 : I started as a cross-examiner. You name them.<br>13:45 : Kwek : Why should I name them?<br>13:55 : More cross-examination by Lee on Kwek.<br>15:10 : We have said categorically, “The vote is secret.”<br>16:11 : “I allowed my grandchildren to speak back to me but from time to time..I put them down.”<br>17:45 : I built up my base from one single seat in 1959.<br>18:56 : We want a fair media.<br>19:10 : Where is the opposition’s “substance?”<br>22:14: GRCs does the opposition good.<br>23:22 : I’ve never said that the opposition is unnecessary.<br>24:52 : Is the PAP insecure about losing?<br>25:22 : On why the government disallows political podcasts and blogging.<br>27:18 : Emotional attachment to nation via right to vote is an “unfounded thesis.”<br>27:15 : “The fact that we are not challenged is a strong mandate.”<br>32:44 : There is no political apathy.<br>33:35 : The definition of politics equals jobs, home, medicine, education, future.<br>34:40 : In the 50s and 60s, Singapore was “in a state of agitation everyday.”<br>36:50 : Once the PAP goes soft, it will be displaced.<br>36:39 : Our candidates have competence, integrity.<br>38:10 : There is a databank here (points to his head).<br>38:40 : Would you like me to retire from politics?<br>39:56 : Do you not think my son has a mind of his own?<br>41:00 : I’ll be sad if your generation wants me to retire.<br>44:04 : “If I’m arrogant, would I be talking to you?”</p>

              <p>I would said that many peoples have a personnal deep hatre with LKY and his govt, that is personnal, however,  these peoples do not have the gut to face him one to one even tho LKY is in his 80s, this resulted in many insult and grumbling within them thru forum and nets, and in doing so, they wanted to influence the public to join them and be like them, that is very lame. If got gut, get a lawyer and go sue LKY in any court anywhere in this world, as long as it is not the furniture courts.</p>

              <p>In actual fact and i support entirely about this; PAP needs to change its direction from running this country like a business corporation to a real country. </p>
              <p>But how? that is something I do not know and dare not comment. Because running a country is not as easy as playing Warcraft, Command &amp; Conquer or Total War when churning our farmers and troops is easy and sending them to death is just a click of a button. Select and move to enemy base. Burn it to the ground and victory is at hand!</p>
              <p>Unless you have been active in the political scene and understand how the ground works, the top works and how the government works, you can just yell and make noise about how terrible the government is, how much you fear LKY and how much Singapore has been unfair to you; it will be just your perspective and it carries no weight. </p>
              <p>You want change, fight for it, vote them out in the next election but are you ready for the next batch of government? who is ready to hold the helm and run the show? i know i'm not capable and i know no shit about running a government but unless you do, come out, say your piece and convince us you are suitable to be the next Prime Minister. if i am convinced about your vision for Singapore's tomorrow, if i'm convinced about your credentials and lastly if i'm convinced you want the best for Singapore, you can be sure i'll be the first to vote for you.   </p>

              <p>Agreed, that was a remark directed at the wrong person, sorry noveltie^^ should have directed it at Gopalan Nair for being such a loser^^ And Mancha, stop spouting nonsense no one would understand. it makes no sense and it seem rather more like a low-brow remark vulgar enough to prove u have nothing better to argue back about.</p>

              <p>Once upon a time there was a man who ruled Wonderland as a prime minister. then one day, a few of his politicians decided that they could do better. so in the next elections, they campaigned against the prime minister. but alas, they could not get enough support! so what did they do? they decided, or rather maybe unintentionally to accuse the prime minister of embezzlement of the nation's taxes. the result was overwhelming. in an effort to regain his reputation, the prime minister had no choice but to sue these politicians to clean his 'dirtied' name. but even after being punished, these politicians still felt they did the right thing! what was wrong with smearing his reputation? they had the right to do so! so they spread the news, using the court case as they medium, and told everyone how they received an unfair trial, how the minister would soon sue everyone else and used it as a pretext to spread the word that wonderland had a dictator. WHAT did they not include? WHY they were sued in the first place. and what happened? the gullible common folk believed these politicians' claims, and the poor minister had his reputation smeared even more.</p>
