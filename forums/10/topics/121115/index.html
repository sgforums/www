            <div class='col-md body'>actually...theres always this misconception about JC or poly.im from a JC..i didnt regret going to a JC because i did grow up and learn to view world in an entirely different perspective.General paper taught us not to be sterotypical which some singaporeans always do...im aware that poly has critical thinking skills or something along that line..that serves around the same principle as does a general paper.Furthermore,its not exactly true that Poly is slack or any less stress than JC...neither is it true that JC student=nerd=academic=no hands on=loss out in hands on relative to poly/ITE students.What i am trying to comment is that every institution has its own benefits,own pros and cons.The world is always unjust,by the world.Since when has there be equality?At one time the JC grads may be more of 'hot picks' in workplace the other time will be the poly grads or ITE grads.Its just a matter of time.Besides,if one can feel the flare or discrimination educationally just because of "rarely seeing diploma holder" bla bla,thats quite narrow minded,really.I mean,usually institutions go for the most common certificate and draw one's attention to that particular word,such as 'A level' certificate etc.All part of strageties i suppose. Personally,im not a good JC student because im not academically inclined.I do have scholarships cousins and i do feel inferior occassionally but thats really aside the point,in life whats most important is to attain your dream and seek the true meaning of your existence not how others see u or discrimate you-for,discriminators are usually lacking in some sort of sense.lol.don't waste your time on people who discrimate u then<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Cheers.</div>
