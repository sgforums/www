In 1997, the currency's devaluation set off collapses in bonds and stocks from South Korea to Indonesia. Investors said the coup is unlikely to trigger another financial crisis in the region. The country has had 17 coups in the past 60 years.<br><br>``It is a purely domestic political event and when the smoke clears, it may be a good time to buy,'' said Kevin Hebner, global investment strategist at Greenwich, Connecticut-based Third Wave Global Investors LLC, which manages over $400 million.</div>

If it is not a done deal, there should be contractual mechanisms in place to ensure that the deal does not take place due to the occurence of a material adverse change in the country's political situation.  The only thing Temasek should get worried about is the fall in the value of their investment.</div>
