              </div>
              <p><em>Singapore Democrats</em></p>
              <p>The SDP was prevented from distributing
              flyers today at NUS. Mr Michael Ng, Director of the Office of Estate
              and Development, asked leaders of the party not to give away flyers to
              the students.<br> <br> "We have to protect the interests of our students," the official said.<br> <br> "From what?" Dr Chee asked. "Are you running a university or a kindergarten?"</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br> Another official Dr Peck Thian
              Guan, Director of the Office of Safety, Health &amp; Environment,
              chipped in, "It's not only you but we don't allow anyone to distribute
              flyers."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A staff member walking by could not resist taking a dig at the
              officers: "Great job, guys. Thanks so much from keeping us safe!"
              Messrs Ng and Peck could only smile sheepishly.<br> <br> Just then several students wanted to take a picture with Dr Chee. A few asked for autographs.<br> <br> Turning to Mr Ng, Dr Chee said: "The students don't look like they want your protection."<br> <br> Several more students came up and started popping questions to the
              leaders. Mr Gandhi Ambalam, Mr Francis Yong, Mr John Tan, and Ms Chee
              Siok Chin were soon answering students' questions ranging from the
              state of the opposition to the media to the reality of the economy.<br> <br> "I have been to Japan many times," one first-year Engineering student
              said, "and I've never seen seventy- and eighty-year-olds sweeping the
              floor and cleaning tables like in Singapore. It's so sad." He added
              that the University seems to be mass producing graduate robots. <br> <br> Another student from Political Science who had attended the recent
              defamation hearing between Lee Kuan Yew and the SDP, told Ms Chee that
              there was still much fear among students.<br></p>
              <p>A journalism major indicated that she "will never join the <em>Straits Times</em>"
              after she graduated. She probably learned a thing or two in school that
              didn't quite square with the nonsense that was practiced in the state
              newspaper.<br><br> A couple of other students conducted brief interviews with the SDP leaders for the online university newspaper <a href="http://campus-observer.org/">Campus Observer</a>.
              From the repeated line of questions, it was clear that the students
              seemed to be sensitive to the fact that most of their college mates
              were rather uninformed and apathetic about current affairs. Why is this
              so, they asked. <br><br>"That's not hard to figure out," Dr Chee
              explained. "From years of authoritarian rule where students have been
              cowed into silence, we have bred a very unhealthy university culture.
              The sad part is that you are being deprived of the type of cutting edge
              educational experience that your counterparts in the top universities
              elsewhere are getting."<br><br>Turning back to officialdom, Dr Chee said that all the SDP wanted to do was to raise political awareness among the students.</p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p>"Why can't you guys see that education is not just about hitting the
              books, taking exams and getting that degree," he said. "It's also about
              developing one's intellectual and moral character. It's not just about
              producing graduates, but also developing leadership."<br> <br>Dr Peck
              said that he too wanted to see students to think beyond their books. He
              suggested that the SDP write to the student associations and ask them
              to organise events.<br> <br>"I've been down that road before. The university administration will say no and then what?" Dr Chee asked.<br> <br> "Then you come back to me and we'll see what we can work out. You have my word," Dr Peck assured.<br> <br> Dr Chee then asked some of the students to take the lead and organise
              themselves to raise political and social awareness on campus. "In the
              meantime we'll write to some of the student bodies and see if they will
              organise an event," he promised.<br> <br> <br> 11 September 2008<br> <br>Donald Koh<br>President<br> National University of Singapore Students' Union<br>

              </span><br> <br> Dear Sir,<br> <br> My colleagues and I were at NUS today to distribute flyers to raise
              awareness among your fellow students about our nation's politics. <br> <br> We were, however, told by University officials that such an exercise
              was not allowed. They suggested that we write to student organisations
              to see if an event could be organised for us to address and interact
              with students.<br> <br> Being the University's students' union, I
              would like to ask if you would organise an event for this purpose. From
              the reaction of the students today, it seems that there is great
              interest in what we have to say.<br> <br> Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br> <br> Sincerely,<br> <br> Gandhi Ambalam<br> Chairman</p>

              <p>In the United Kingdom, political parties have representation on campus. Students are allowed to open a student society which is affiliated to a particular political party. Such student societies are deemed as university chapters of the political parties. Examples include <em>Labour Student </em>and<em> Socialist Student</em>. On top of the weekly debates on political idealogy, current affairs and heartland issues, there are campus forums and monthly campaigns for raising awareness, raising funds and also to survey fellow students what issue concerns them the most.  <em>The Socialist Student  </em>also runs a popular campaign to call for the scrap of undergraduate tuition fees for EU/UK citizens attending UK universities.</p>
              <p>There are also non-partisan political representation on campus. They usually represent NGOs such as Amnesty International, Pugwash Conference and the United Nations Youth and Student Association (UNYSA). They serve as a platform to engage students to pursue a narrow scope of interest in public policy. Amnesty International advocates for human rights and monitors human rights violation worldwide. Pugwash Conference seeks to raise awareness on the ethical implication of science and technology policies and it is particularly vocal on issues relating to weapons of mass destruction. The UNYSA provides a plural platform to engage foreign affairs with particular emphasis on UN ideals such as the Millenium Development Goals. It also acts as a portal to introduce university students to career opportunities with the United Nations. Although I am Singaporean, I have been fortunate enough to be sponsored to attend UN conferences through the UNYSA (UK) and advocate my interest.</p>
              <p>I should add that the student union is also a popular platform for non-partisan politics. However, issues of interest are strongly linked to student welfare. A successful campaign embarked by the National Union of Students and University of London Union was to introduce substantial student discount for public transport in London. As a result, university students in London are given 30% discount for monthly and annual travel pass. However, the campaign is still going on to further introduce discounts to weekly and daily travel passes. Just like the Socialist Student, the National Union of Students also advocates for the scrapping of undergraduate tuition fees. On top of that, the student union also provides free legal services to union members for issues relating to accomodation (e.g unscrupulous landlord), defamation and libel, unfair treatment by university staff on students.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans at our local universities are missing out a lot.</p>

              <p>Seriously, not being allowed to give out flyers on campus is such bullsh!t.  People give out flyers all the time... </p>
              <p>Funny, I don't see PAP or WP representatives wanting to come to NUS to give talks.  Maybe we can ask for 2 representatives from each party to come to debate about something. I think that would be damn awesome. </p>

              <p>If student life is all about studying, students would definitely miss out ont an all-rounded education. Students should be involved in politics because they are young - it means they would have be alive for at least another 30-40 years to experience the effects of policy implement now. If anyone should be involved in politics, students are not less qualified.</p>
