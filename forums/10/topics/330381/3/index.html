              <p>Is it wise to involve university students in politics?
              Personally, politics for students is just a distraction when they
              should be studying. If we look at protests overseas, a lot involve
              students because</p>
              <ol>
              <li>They are poor (in relative terms) and hence make cheaper
              "pawns" for manipulation</li>
              <li>They are easier to rally, since there are so many students in
              the universities and many student leaders to rally the
              students</li>
              </ol>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since they always have the meet-the-MM/SM/PM sessions annually
              in NUS, maybe the SDP can request for a meet-the-CSJ session and
              call it quits <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">.
              Any other form of propaganda should be discouraged IMO.</p>

              <p><br>i agree. students should start to get involved with politics as soon as they truly understand the term "government". those students who wish to get physically involved with politics should join "youth" organisation like PAP youth or others political groups "youth" to really promote "democracy" in Singapore.</p>
              <p>i think it's time for transparency and real effort. PAP has won elections after elections without much effort for the past 4 decades. i am not saying they did a bad or average job. they did very well. their goal was to make Singapore independent and advanced, technologically, medically and financially. we have succeeded in those aspects but we also have forgotten many.</p>
              <p>for example; we have lost character and integrity. a wise man once told me, "Character is more important and Competence". take Mr. Durai for example. no one ever questioned his ability in managing NKF. he made it very successful, he made it profitable... a charity organisation that could pay millions... in terms of competence, he is excellent. but he lacks character and integrity thus his fall from grace.</p>
              <p>we also hear from neighbours, friends that many young talented men and women have forgotten filial piety. these people are from the higher society, earning tens of thousands of dollars monthly but yet leave their old folks in nursing homes and never visited. my wife worked in Dover Hospice before and i can assure you, many patients were left alone waiting for death. sons and daughters, family and friends do not visit frequently. once a month? that is a blessing. of course there are cases where the children are filial and caring but seriously, how many?</p>
              <p>we are a society that has thrived yet let-down by our own competence. we must start to build a society where character and integrity takes place in our daily lives... this is where politics must come in. it is time for students to get involved... know the in's and out's of politics and challenge themselves if they want to make that change in society and in the lives of Singaporeans. join the political party that you feel can and will make that change for the better.</p>
              <p>we need the political transparency to deal with internal problems that seriously in need to rectify. i have to say that younger generations are forced to pay too much attention to academic excellence that parents neglected the need to teach manners, honesty, consideration to others' feelings and selflessness. we are not a gracious society. you can say it's just a minor issue but when we are not teaching loyalty and understanding, we are sowing the seed for citizens who will betray the country for money and also the need to understand social cohesion among races. 2 young men were arrested for spreading racist remarks on the internet... are we going to let this incident incite into another full blown riot? education in school is not enough, parents have to chip in.</p>
              <p>start political education early. teach the right virtues, the need to care for the nation, fight for the country and sacrifice for our beliefs that is for the best of Singapore.</p>

              <p>...Another aspect of this nineteenth century propaganda system is the
              increasing emphasis upon material desires. If you had the material
              things you wanted --a nice house in the suburbs, a swimming pool, a
              couple of big cars, a place in the country, a motor boat, a trailer to
              take it back and forth--you should be happy and satisfied. Now it's
              endless--a pocket computer, citizens' band radio, whatever you want...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...The second thing that occurs as this goes on is increasing
              remoteness of desires from needs. I've mentioned this. The next thing
              is an increasing confusion between means and ends. The ends are the
              human needs, but if I asked people what these needs are, they can
              hardly tell me. Instead they want the means they have been brainwashed
              to accept, that they think will satisfy their needs.</p>
              <p>But it's perfectly
              obvious that the methods that we have been using are not working. Never
              was any society in human history as rich and as powerful as Western
              Civilization and the United States, and it is not a happy society. Just
              this week, I looked at a book called "The Joyless Economy", by an
              economist, Tibor Scitovsky, who diagrammed some of these things...</p>
              <p>...The other part of this will require you to put these things together to
              some extent. Persons, personalities if you wish, can be made only in
              communities. A community is made up of intimate relationships among
              diverse types of individuals--a kinship group, a local group, a
              neighbourhood, a village, a large family. Without communities, no
              infant will be sufficiently socialized. He may grow up to be forty
              years old, he may have made an extremely good living, he may have
              engendered half a dozen children, but he is still an infant unless he
              has been properly socialized and that occurs in the first four or five
              years of life.</p>
              <p>In our society today, we have attempted to throw the
              whole burden of socializing out population upon the school system, to
              which the individual arrives only at the age of four or five. A few
              years ago they had big programs to take children to school for a few
              hours at age two and three and four, but that will not socialize them.</p>
              <p>The first two years are important. The way a child is treated in the
              first two days is of vital importance. He has to be loved, above all he
              has to be talked to. A state of individuals, such as we have now
              reached in Western Civilization, will not create persons, and the
              atomized individuals who make it up will be motivated by desires which
              do not necessarily reflect needs. Instead of needing other people they
              need a shot of heroin; instead of some kind of religious conviction,
              they have to be with the winning team...</p>
