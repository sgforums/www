            <div class='col-md body'>Condoms arent 100% safe if you dont use them properly, eg using latex condoms with oil based  lubricant, condoms breaking/slipping off etc.<br><br>If you do use them properly, they can prevent the spread of HIV.<br><br>This seems reminiscent of a rumor that was going on that the virus could actually pass through the latex condoms in the catholic community.It is only a rumor,however.<br><br>Look here:http://www.guardian.co.uk/aids/story/0,7369,1059068,00.html<br><br>and by the way,beastiality probably wasnt how HIV was transmitted.Its much more probable that it jumped species through the butchering and consumption of monkey meat<br><br>Heres some other theories:<br><br>http://www.avert.org/origins.htm<br><br>While HIV transmission <strong>in the US</strong> has a significant proportion due to MSM,injection drug use is still pretty large nonetheless.<br><br>Check here:<br><br>http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/stats.htm<br><br>I do not agree that the transmission rates of HIV through anal sex are nessarily higher, why do so many gays have AIDS? It probably because in the first place,when HIV was yet to be discovered,it spread like wildfire in the gay community through unprocted sex.This led to more gays having HIV,which would obviously led to higher transmission rates if they had casual sex. I have no doubt that the same would be true if it had started in the heterosexual community, as regardless of orientation,there would be those who practise unproteced casual sex.<br><br>On another note,theres no such thing as "homosex",straights practise anal sex too.<br><br>(I have always taken the initiative to make sure that my sources are reliable and objective, so please make sure yours is too.)</div>

Thus whether your arse bleeds or not during sex plays a very very minimal factor.<br><br>3) U are also ignorant about how AIDS was believed to have begun.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Salman:</div><div class="quote_body">Perversion started AIDS among human beings.<br><br></div></blockquote>AIDS was believed to have spread from monkeys to humans in Africa, due to the close proximity of the human dwellings to the monkeys' natural habitats.

Unless YOU want to provide some credible proof, I don't see how u can be saying anything other than bullsh|t.<br><br>I would also like to ask u how u want me to show proof of a public view/opinion of the early 90s. This is a general opinion or belief of the public, its not an official policy, or anything like that, so there won't be any physical evidence of this.

Proof please. 1stly all condom makers claim 99.99% efficiency in preventing pregnancies and STDs, IF USED PROPERLY. We know very simply that 0.01% is nothing more than to cover their legal liabilities. Now please show me proof of any medical studies or research papers which proves that even with the proper use of condoms, there is a risk of transmission of STDs.

If you can't, and I won't accept any sort of "proof" from biased "anti-homosexual" groups whose agendas are obviously clear, then you are just bullsh|tting.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Salman:</div><div class="quote_body">Why would a pervert like you want to champion gay rights if you are not a gay? You must at least have gay thoughts or molested by teh same sex as a child or at least cross dress even if you are not a gay.<br>A man must be like a man and a woman must be like a woman! Faggots are simply weirdos and perverts and against nature!<br><br></div></blockquote>u have some serious ignorance and issues i see.<br><br>by denying nature and its creations, u are more of a pervert than anyone here. u have also just insulted very noble people like Lord Mountbatten, Florence Nightingale, Lawrence of Arabia and William Shakespeare, who are shining examples that being homosexual has nothing to do with what sort of person you are. Conversely, being straight doesn't mean u aren't a bigotted jerk.<br><br>by claiming people got AIDS from animal sex, it shows u're both ignorant and biased in your views.<br><br>by being totally heterosexist the way u are, and assuming that every straight person must be bigoted like you or forfeit the claim to be straight, u show that not only are you just totally worse than any KKK members in bigotry, u also have a lot of insecurity in your sexuality.<br><br>I said it once, i will say again:<br><br><strong>one doesn't have to be gay to speak up against stupidity like yours, straight people can and DO speak up against horrible people like you who are only intent on spreading hate so the world conforms to YOUR narrow view of how it should be. If you are one of those idiots who think that no straight person would speak up for gays, you are WRONG. Maybe its time u OPENED your eyes and took a good look around you, beyond your tiny social circle and looked at the world. Whats the point of having eyes if u're going to be STUPID AND BLIND?</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.umanitoba.ca/admin/human_resources/equity/allies/images/erasehate.gif"><br><br>just for your info, psychologists have already established that people who are homophobic are largely so because they are insecure about actually bein straight. in other words, deep inside they think they might be gay. I've never seen anyone who is comfortable and secure being straight have any problems with gay people. to quote an example, Winston Churchill, who is undoubtedly straight and damned macho at that, once had a homosexual liasion with musical comedy star Ivor Novello. Indeed he is so secure in his own sexuality that he is able to experience it and decide that while it was quite an experience, it wasn't his cup of tea. He was never a homophobic. Thats how comfortable and secure in being straight he is.<br><br>its only the ones who are insecure and might be gay who have problems because they think they are being "led astray". so take a good long look at yourself salman. u are probably facing homosexual desires and struggles inside you aren't you? of course u will deny it here, as so many who are insecure about their sexuality will deny publicly. I must say I pity you. Your own insecurity has led to you having a unjustified hatred of homosexuals who have done nothing to you.</div>

Though Fumento throws a lot of statistics around, his argument is contradicted by the continuing spread of AIDS among heterosexuals. "Not a balanced approach.<br><br>Salman,<br><br>your opinions are clearly infulenced by your homophobia,you clearly despise homosexuals. All your posts concerning this issue are not objective.<br><br>whether you think homosexual acts are perversions or not is clearly you own opinion,however imbalanced in may be, it should have no premise in your arguement that "homosex has a higher chance of HIV transmission"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its worse than that. salman automatically assumes anyone who doesn't see it his way, who support gay rights, must be gay themselves. the delicious irony is that, people like him have commonly been proven to be closet gays who are in denial.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>http://www.moh.gov.sg/corp/publications/statistics/hiv.do<br><br>I'd advise everyone to take a look at the above b4 linking AIDS with gays..<br><br>Yes, it's true that people who practice anal sex has a higher chance to contract with HIV. However, everything must be seen in relativity. Using a condom (established brands like durex) will reduce the chances to almost zero. Use water-based lube during penetrations for a smoother entry.<br><br>btw, anal sex is not exclusive in gay circle. In brazil, more than 50% of heterosexual practices anal sex too.<br><br>Further, Africa is currently one of the worst hit area with HIV. However, they have the lowest reported "declaration" of gays. Why?<br><br>To be honest, I see the move as a positive one. To finally pour money in helping the gay comm with anti-AIDS efforts. Since earlier efforts are all targeted at the heteros. However, the comms should have been done much much better.</div>
