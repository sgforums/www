            <div class='col-md body'>Gays take some part of blame in HIV increase!<br><br>"ABOUT 1 in 25 gay men in Singapore is HIV-positive, said Dr Balaji Sadasivan yesterday. Researchers came to that conclusion based on the data gleaned from the anonymous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing clinic at Kelantan Lane.<br><br>However, the Senior Minister of State for Health was quick to point out that the data used to come up with the figure is far from perfect.<br><br>Dr Balaji explained: 'There are many, many questions about this data.<br><br>'Is this representative of all gays? Or is it representative of a sample of gays? We can't answer this question unless we do more detailed studies which may invade into people's privacy.'<br><br>Action for Aids (AFA), a non-governmental organisation which runs the anonymous testing clinic, also has no idea how accurate the figure cited by Dr Balaji may be.<br><br>AFA's programme manager Abdul Hamid Hassan said the figure could be an overestimate, or an underestimate.<br><br>However, the figure here is definitely much lower than in Thailand, where one in four gay men is HIV-positive.<br><br>To prevent a similar scenario here, the Health Ministry has held many dialogues with gay activists and others in the know about gay lifestyles to discuss Aids prevention efforts among gays.<br><br>Dr Balaji added: 'At this point in time, we are very fortunate that gay activists and those interested in the issue are working with us as partners to bring HIV under control.'<br><br>The Health Ministry will work with non-governmental organisations such as the AFA to develop customised Aids education programmes for gays, setting aside about $250,000 for this effort next year."<br><br>Gays practise save sex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HIV/Aids is one of the biggest problems in Africa. So does it mean that Africa is populated by homosexuals?  One of the reasons why HIV/Aids is often associated with homosexuality is that homosexuals were the easiest to point the finger at during the HIV/Aids epidemic in the 80s and 90s. Let's not forget that the world has very powerful churches that can influence how a government runs its country.<br><br>Anyway, let's leave the government to find scapegoats for the issues they can't cope. I think misguided information is the biggest killer of them all, don't you think? If most people think that HIV/Aids is a homosexuality disease, then God saves those hetero people (take note that I mentioned people, not just men) who practices unprotected casual sex.<br><br>Since we are at it, let's change our mindsets about sexual workers. They are not dirty creatures. They are just out there earning a living. They are forced to risk their lives and others when their clients refuse to put on a condom. What's an investment of $4 for a pack of condoms as compared to an incurable disease?<br><br>moddie<br>Singapore Planned Parenthood Youth Committee<br>http://www.sppa.org.sg</div>

So suddenly millions of Africans are gay or had gay sexual encounters.

The stupidity of humans never ceases to amaze me. Asking why gays like men is like asking why straight men like women. Leave aside reproduction as an argument because if it was only for reproduction, then there is no reason to wear a condom for sex, or to have one night stands is it? But noooo these people just want to ignore facts and continue on their own little bigotry. Ignorace. Amazing what it can do.</div>
