But what I mean by "government seems to be promoting outside talents" refers to its general policy to recognise foreign talents quite indiscriminately to the extent of allowing too many jobs to be taken over by foreigners in almost every industry from technical to administrative and professionals.<br><br>When MOM first announced his S-pass schemes to admit foreign workers on some kind of skills or technical expertise, it is more than clear that the flood gate has been open to allow our employers to take in any foreign workers they want too liberally.<br><br>Who will be the victims? I think the victims would be our own technicians, polytechnic and ITE graduates and construction skilled workers who will lose their jobs to foreigners of sometimes lower skills on account of slightly cheaper wages.<br><br>Citizens support the government and pay for ministers' and civil servants' wages in good time and bad. They never try to employer foreign talents to be our ministers or civil servants even though foreign talents in such areas are much cheaper.<br><br>So government by the same token should not just foresake the citizens in bad time and try to open the flood gates to take away their jobs.<br><br>Alternative solutions to our high-cost problems are many e.g. re-designing of jobs to allow administrative and professionals to cover more areas of works which they can handle as being done to cleaners and security guards.<br><br>Don't quickly turn against your own citizens by coming up with all kinds of pro-foreign passes or what-not which may lose controls of proper balance of our citizenship rights and their entitlements to some benefits of using our surplus paid by them in good time to cushion against ill effects of downturns.<br><br>The above-stated more accountable labour policy is what I am asking the government to introduce and not all the pro-foreign passes to allow anyone to take in any foreign workers which are anti-citizenship and anti-people.</div>
