              <p>For u to come from a rich and professional parents, there is a pressure for you to at least match what their achievements are. <br>Even if intelligence is not in the genes, there is certaintly some measures in the nuturing part of the parents that will contribute to their child upbringing. <br>Eg. the experience that the parents has gone through can be passed down to their offspring, whereas form an uneducated parents, there are no such fortunes.</p>
              <p>Street smart is another case, but pure academic performance, I believe a child from an educated parents Does have an edge here.</p>

              <p>Yes, I believe so too.</p>
              <p>Not as in intelligence but in pressure and expectations from parents.</p>
              <p>So, from this point of view, we can say that educated parents would put more pressure on children to perform academically while uneducated parents would put less pressure.</p>
              <p>To say it in even more simple terms, if children is put under more pressure to perform, their chances of doing so improve.</p>

              <p>Bullsh^t. there a lot of factors affecting an individuals IQ. From genes tot he environment the foetus was when in the womb. Clinical studies have shown that children born to mothers who have a tramautic experience during pregnancy pass it on to their children who  tend to have a low EQ. Recent studies shown that a high Iq is useless when an individual has a low EQ.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other factors such as health also affects. Eugenics is horsh^t and its not proven to be true.</p>

              <p>MM Lee is only vocing his opinion. He is not someone who can enact his words into law. We still have a PM to do so, on advise and counsel from MPs and the cabinet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyone is free to voice his/her opinions. We live in a democracy. So to are rebuttals and criticisms of his opinion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT despite all thru the noise and babble he aroused, do analyze what his concerns really are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They are for an intelligent society. He don't need power, he already had it. He don't need wealth, he's too much of it. He only wants our society to have capable leaders for the baby he helped created - Singapore, before he passes on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Billions had been dumped on education over the years and we have yet to create a nobel prize laureate , or booker prize winner, even an olympian to inspire us to greater heights.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He desperately believes and is obsessed that intelligence or capability can be inherited, or nurtured, but ONLY by fellow intelligent beings, with higher odds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a man of science, but yet till today, there is no empirical evidence to suggest such a theory true, for there are too many cases of intelligence being radomly gifted across humanity, of differing backgrounds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only proposal i can offer for the birth of capable leaders is opportunity. A diverse range of people being given opportunity to shine - to be elevated or demoted on his own worth - regardless of his social or bundle of certificates level, just as our forefathers who made Singapore successful had been given.</p>
              <p><br>Even MM Lee's dad and mom were no graduates yet MM Lee went on to Uni and ruled a country, if following his logic on heritage, which is already flawed by his own living evidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To continue on the flawed eugenics line would only divide our society and tear up our social fabric between the have and the have nots, destroying the very equality our forefathers had worked so hard for to bestow upon us, and causing the lower educated or poor to give up even attempts to try at greatness.</p>

              <p>Enough with the LKY death wishes. It isn't happening anytime soon. At least I hope not. I wasn't alive when LKY governed but I don't believe he was advocating eugenics, or a Gattaccan society. He never actually mentioned the word "genes" in the paragraph did he? He said "worry".</p>
              <p>If your spouse does not believe in higher education, and you do, wouldn't you be worried on the side your child chooses?</p>
              <p>I admit that some parents who aren't graduates are firm and supportive on higher education, but, most of the time, they set themselves up as reverse role models; a failure the child must avoid at all costs. How do you think the child will act under those conditions? How do you think the parents must feel?</p>
              <p>A negative emotion, acting as the primary motivation for the child, might very well be effective, but you have got to agree that a child would be far better off with a positive motivation.</p>

              getting a degree doesn't mean that one has high or low iq. rather, it is because of one's financial wellbeing that one can afford to have a degree.
              
              there are many smart non-graduates out there as there are dumb degree holders.
              
              The wealthy are able to afford to send their children to overseas uni regardless of their academic prowness, while the poor may not even be able to afford sending their child to uni, regardless of how cheap the uni tuition fees can be.
              some children from troubled families are forced to drop out from schools before they even reach A levels/ diploma, much less a degree.
              
              i only believe in eugenics to the extent that marrying a down-syndrome spouse will have increased chance of having a retard child. thats the extent of eugenics. 
              
              maybe iq can be inherited, but until further research have proven so, it can not be taken as absolute fact.
              
              most people are restrained from progressing beyond their social level/ obtaining a degree, due to their family backgrounds, not due to genetics.
              
              in the case of getting a US or UK degree, they will first you to provide evidence that you are able to pay for your tuition fees. Applicants who require financial aid will be disadvantaged.
              already, this is a major obstacle for students from lower-income families. unless they receive a scholarship (in which they have to compete with their better-endowed peers), they will be restricted to studying in singapore uni, forever 1 notch below the oxbridge/ overseas graduates. I known quite a few friends who are accepted by cambridge by virtue of their good results, but in the end due to financial constraints, they have to study in NTU. this is a waste of talent.
              
              there are so many promising kids out there who couldn't afford to go overseas for uni education,  while many more relatively underserving people are well-endowed with the conditions from birth, to secure their place at the echelon of society. in fact, DSTA recently revealed that slightly more than 50% of scholarship holder live in HDB flats, when over 90% of the population resides in HDB units.
              there is a gross misrepresentation between the haves and the have-nots. 
              
              it is wealth which is the determinant of whether one would be successful in life, rather than genetics.
              i'm sure that if kids from poorer families are given the same amount of financial and moral support as those rich kids, they would no doubt fare better than the latter in all manners.
