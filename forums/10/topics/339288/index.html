              <p>I was "booked" today  for "not using the traffic crossing" by a traffic cops on a small road where there is no car in sight!<br><br>Firstly, the "offense" occured at the "Woodlands Square" road, if you are familiar with the place, you would  know that it is just a small circular non-main road next to the Woodlands MRT, where the traffic is little  especially at the time of the "offense".<br><br>When i crossed the road, there wasn't any car in sight at all. It is quite ridiculous for one to not cross the  road when it is clearly safe to do so and insist on using the traffic crossing on a small road like this.<br><br>Furthermore, there <strong>ISN'T</strong> any "No Crossing" sign (see picture below for example of what the sign should look like) that indicated that one need to use the traffic crossing at all times, this reminds me of what we know as the <strong>No U-Turn Syndrome (NUTS)</strong><br><br>(This is am example of  no crossing sign)</p>

              <p><br><br>I Quote from Sim Wong Hoo's book i extracted from one web site for your knowledge in case you never heard of it  :<br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">No U-Turn Syndrome (NUTS)<br>"In the US, when there is no sign on the road, it means that you can make a U-turn. When the Authority don't  want people to make U-turns, they will put up signs to tell you not to make U-turns.<br><br>In Singapore, it's the reverse. When there is no sign on the road, you are not allowed to make U-Turns, then  they will put up signs to give you that right.<br><br>The two different systems serve the same purpose - to better manage the traffic. They may look quite similar,  just coming from different direction, but the social repercussions is significant.<br><br>In Singapore, the no U-turn without sign culture permeated every level of our thinking and every segment of our  life. This no U-turn culture has created a way of life that is based on rules. When there is a U-turn sign or  when there is a rule, we can U-turn. When there's no sign, we cannot U-turn. Where is no rule, we canot do  anything. We become paralyzed<br><br>I call this "no-rule=no-do" phenomenon - the "No U-Turn Syndrome" or NUT</span><br><br>End of Quote.<br><br><br>If that is not clear enough, i refer you to the following web url :<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_U-Turn_Syndrome<br><br>I quote :<br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Following that, this analogy is used to explain the red tape he has encountered with hard-nosed bureaucrats,  which in turn stifles the very creativity that the Singaporean government has been trying to promote in the  recent years.<br><br>NUTS is also considered as one of the major criticisms of the rigid Singapore education system, where students  are taught from a young age to obey instructions in an unquestioning manner, in a society where grades and paper  certification are emphasised at the expense of some life skills."</span><br><br>End of quote.<br><br><br>BTW, there were 3 officers waiting near the area just to pounce on any unluckly "offender".<br><br>I am wondering if the resources could be more wisely used for other major offences like speeding, drink driving,  smoking in public places where it is forbidden, alleviate the worsening traffic jams etc<br><br>Isn't it a waste of tax payers' money to even plan to carry out this "operation" for insignificant "offenses" ?</p>
              <p><br>Or is it that government is desparate for $$ now that it has lost quite a sum in investment ?<br></p>
