              <p>The Singapore government is losing support from this group of citizen as many are squeezed by being in the middle class.</p>
              <h1 class="headline">Pressure on Singapore's middle class rising<cite class="byline vcard"></cite></h1>
              <h1 class="headline"><cite class="byline vcard">By <span class="fn">Seah Chiang Nee in Petaling Jaya/The Star</span> | <span class="provider org">Asia News Network</span> – </cite></h1>

              <p>Singapore's P-MET (pronounced Pee-met) - the acronym 
              for Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians, a flourishing 
              group of people who make up 51 per cent of the workforce - is under 
              stress.</p>
              <p>Most are, of course, university graduates or diploma holders, whose 
              numbers and role in society had steadily increased because of strong 
              growth and people's determination to get higher education.</p>
              <p>In turn, it helped to shape Singapore into what it is - a rich, middle-class society.</p>
              <p>The first blow was struck by the demise of the industrial era here as
               well as the emergence of competitive giants like China and India that 
              pushed down wages everywhere.</p>
              <p>Factories were closed or moved overseas and mass retrenchments followed, including executives and managers.</p>
              <p>A series of downturns and recessions added to the toll. In 2008, for 
              example, 43.3 per cent of retrenched Singaporeans were from this group.</p>
              <p>A new shadow now looms. This is the arrival of a small army of 
              hungrier foreign P-METs who are always ready to accept lower wages.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a middle class city. An estimated 70 per cent of 
              citizens consider themselves middle class rather than working class.</p>
              <p>The influx of one million workers in the past 10 years included many 
              poorer paid P-METs from India and the Philippines. Many ended up in 
              finance, computer and multinational corporations, some of them easing 
              out locals.</p>
              <p>The arrivals are a mixed bag. The majority comprises lower-paid workers, but also includes many extremely rich settlers.</p>
              <p>The demographic infusion is continuing but the government, responding
               to public pressure, has recently reduced the number of approvals given 
              out.</p>
              <p>It has eroded bit by bit the Singapore middle-class, already hit by economic changes.</p>
              <p>Another effect of globalisation is the monthly departure of 1,000 
              Singaporeans to settle abroad for better opportunities and a more 
              relaxed lifestyle.</p>
              <p>In the past 10 years, 97,990 Singaporeans (excluding small children),
               had left, the government said. Many are young and well-educated 
              professionals.</p>
              <p>The erosion of the middle class was first noticed three years ago in 
              Japan, and to a lesser extent in Hong Kong and Taiwan before arriving 
              here.</p>
              <p>It was enunciated as the M-shaped society by Japanese strategist 
              Kenichi Ohmae, who noticed that among middle-class workers in Japan only
               a "very few" made it to the rich, while a greater number actually sank 
              to the lower classes.</p>
              <p>For some middle-class Singaporeans, this sounds uncomfortably familiar.</p>
              <p>The gap between rich and poor in Singapore is the second widest in 
              the world, and the government has promised utmost efforts to put it 
              right.</p>
              <p>For the government any weakening of the middle class is bad news.</p>
              <p>Who forms the middle class?</p>
              <p>There is no universally accepted definition, but Singaporeans 
              generally base it on earnings. People who earn S$4,000-S$7,000 
              (RM9,800-RM17,200) are considered middle and upper middle classes.</p>
              <p>Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew once said that any political party
               that wanted to win power in Singapore must win the middle class.</p>
              <p>The mass arrival of foreign professionals into the marketplace is 
              causing the government dearly in public support - as shown in last 
              year's general election.</p>
              <p>Former Director of Internal Security Department (1971-74) Yoong Siew 
              Wah wrote that "Singapore has 30,000 P-METs who have been unemployed for
               quite a long time, and we now have Chinese and Indian immigrants 
              competing ... for the limited employment opportunities".</p>
              <p>What do the unemployed P-METs do? Many work as taxi drivers, property
               agents, insurance agents, financial advisers, remisiers, or tuition 
              teachers, said a surfer.</p>
              <p>In recent years, the Lee Hsien Loong government responded to the 
              furore by cutting down the number of foreign PRs and raising the pay 
              ceiling for foreign professionals.</p>
              <p>He also pledged priority efforts to narrow the income gap between rich and poor.</p>
              <p>Commentator Patrick Loh said: "If you look around, Singaporeans have 
              lost many middle management and higher management jobs to foreigners for
               the past decade.</p>
              <p>"They are still losing these to them. The painful part is losing 
              these jobs to lesser qualified candidates, just because they appear to 
              fit the role better with a cheaper pay package," he added.</p>
              <p>There is another compelling reason why the People's Action party (PAP) wants to keep educated youths employed.</p>
              <p>Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew told accompanying journalists to 
              India years ago that his government would want to avoid his host's 
              plight. Their universities were churning out too many unemployed 
              graduates.</p>
              <p>Recollecting from memory, I gather his rationale being: These 
              unemployed graduates have the knowledge and free time to plan 
              revolutions. They would hang around in coffee shops and talk politics, 
              and soon a revolution brews.</p>
              <p>Recently, an Education Ministry official was reported to have told a 
              US diplomat (source: Wikileaks) that Singapore did not plan to encourage
               more students to study in university, and the campus enrolment rate 
              would stay at 20 per cent-25 per cent.</p>
              <p>I wonder, if this is true, is it connected to concerns about the possibility of unmanageable unemployment among graduates here?</p>
