            <div class='col-md body'>This wat I heard from somebody. Imagine on the road, the road represents any task that have to be done, the drivers on the road represent the Singaporeans. When the drivers wanted to make a U-turn, they've to drive until they see the U-turn sign, then they can make a U-turn. If not, they'll drive on forever, until the end of time.<br><br>The problem with the system in Singapore, is that the majority of the Singaporeans do not take the initiative to do something. They don't make things happen, they only just wait for things to happen. They've to wait for orders, then they can continue the task. If Singapore want to make it far &amp; big, the people really, must break out of this mould.</div>
