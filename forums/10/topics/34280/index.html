            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone knows in October, Dr Mahathir will step down and Mr Badawi will relinquish as PM of Malaysia. What do you think the impact will be between Singapore and Malaysia under his reign? Personally, i think Mr Badawi is a tad low-profile and dun voice out his ideas and i have a feeling ties between SG and Malaysia will improve. Hopefully. What do you guys think?</div>

They probably even thought the Ah-Goh looked more easier to deal with and hence platable for their UMNO seasonally Singapore-bashing tournament.<br>Alas, GCT's Mr. nice-guy image is only an illusion. He even got his Foreign Minister to say very nice things about the Malaysian leadership accountability on 25 Jan Paliament session when those "love" letters where made public.<br><br>Not that GCT isn't a good guy, but sometimes, he has to give bully a "bloodied nose" when  war of words breaks out, when "negotiation" is defined by the bully as "compromise or....go to war" or flip-flopping of positions.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unlike some other UMNO "Stars", Badawi was not one of those carpet beggars with some personal ambition.<br><br>He was not amongst those who fought for the Deputy Prime Minister post, nor that of any higher echelon positions in the UMNO Supreme Council.<br><br>At each turn of his political career, he was pushed up the ladder by popular support.<br><br>It is due to his lack of ambition, and sincerity shown while in office, that PM Mahatir picked him, after knocking out the impatient, young and ambitious DPM Anwar Ibrahim.<br><br>When Badawi was a Foreign Minister, he was the one that patched up relations with Singapore, when the ties were strained to the limits by the frequent and unending "Singapore bashing" by the UMNO Members and also by the Ministerial "hench men" of their PM Mahatir.<br><br>Unlike the present Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar, when Badawi was the Foreign Minister, there was very little controversial language coming from Badawi.<br><br>His gentle and straight forward character has won the respect of many in the multi-racial Malaysian Community; and many have preferred to call him, by the affectionate name "Pak Lah".<br><br>He does not seem to have any grand ambition of being the "Voice of Asia", or "a Champion and Torch Bearer for ALL the Muslim Countries on this Globe" unlike the current Malaysian PM.<br><br>With the realistic views of the world, as displayed by his very circumspect replies to News Reporters' probing questions, one can see that he is not a 'controversial' person.<br><br>If Badawi has the political strength and influence to prevail against the pulls and pressures of parochial politics, we should see a return to better ties with Malaysia.<br><br></div>
