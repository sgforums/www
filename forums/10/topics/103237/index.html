            <div class='col-md body'>TODAY<br><br>18th Nov 2004<br><br>Local press plays different role, says Minister Lee<br>SINGAPORE may rank low in press freedom, but this is because the rankings favour the advocacy and adversarial role of the press.<br>.<br>According to Dr Lee Boon Yang, Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, the Press Freedom Index drawn up by Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) is largely based on this model which Singapore does not adopt.<br>.<br>He was responding in writing to Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia, who had asked what efforts would be taken to give the press more freedom.<br>.<br>The latest rankings, released on Oct 26, placed Singapore 147th out of 167 countries while countries such as Switzerland and Norway emerged tops in respecting press freedom.<br>.<br>Said Dr Lee: "Our model is that of a free and responsible press whose role is to report news accurately and objectively to Singaporeans. The Singapore media also serves as a platform for diverse views to be expressed and to reflect the debate on national issues."<br>.<br>This model evolved out of "special circumstances" as the media have to be sensitive to national interests such as racial and religious harmony and to promote "our shared values as a society", he added.<br>.<br>He told Mr Chia that RSF's ranking would not affect Singapore's reputation and development as a cosmopolitan city, citing two surveys that reflected a high international regard for the Republic.<br>.<br>A recent city governance survey by Jones Lang LaSalle of 33 major cities placed Singapore tops based on integrity, autonomy, stability, efficiency and effectiveness.<br>.<br>Singapore was also ranked the second most global country according to the 2004 A.T. Kearney's Globalisation Index which ranks countries on economic integration, technological connectivity, personal contact and political engagement.<br>.<br>Dr Lee stressed that the priority must be the "prosperity and progress" of Singapore. "Our media has a tremendously important role in this national effort by rallying Singaporeans to do the things which matter most to Singapore. This is certainly more important than for them to adopt practices which are not relevant to us just to gain the favours of international ranking associations," he said.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Pikamaster,<br><br>In this internet age, information travels across all borders in micro-seconds to reach anyone in any countries.<br><br>So, how is Dr. Lee Boon Yang going to make information system in Singapore uniquely Singapore.<br><br>All Singaporeans are taking in new knowledge and new thinking irrespective of what the Straits Times say. Those who got fed up by the same pro-establishment news and propaganda simply bypass the ST and go to get their own news and information from CNN, New York Post, Washington Times and their forum postings.<br><br>Based on what they know about others are thinking and saying, they will come to their own conclusion about what is good for themselves and whether or not Singapore is so unique like what Dr. Lee is uttering.  Singapore is fast losing out in economic competitivenss without new solutions. Is that uniqueness ? May be uniquely oblivous to surrounding.<br><br>It is plainly foolish to pretend that the government has all the right answers. They are there to perform their duties to create jobs and motivate people to meet new challenges not to keep singing the old tune about their greatness. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
