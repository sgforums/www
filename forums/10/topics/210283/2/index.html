I do not know where people get the idea that quote source = complete defense to copyright infringement.<br><br>That is unequivocally a myth. You are confusing plagiarism for copyright infringement.

An infringement of copyright as u claimed, with a very high chance of no legal action taken in my opinion, does not matter.

But again, I did not mention anything about suing. I was merely stating my opinion; like "it is cold today". You, however, seem to take exception to that. It is as though you cannot accept that someone might think there is very likely copyright infringement here. Very very odd behaviour - very sensitive and very defensive.<br><br>2) I never said anything about how proabable it is that FEER would sue. I said that the decision is another matter altogether. I have never said "you cannot post because it is illegal". I merely gave warning that it is probably copyright infringement<br><br>3) To give pointers in good faith = cowardice and brainwash? If so, mea cupla. Though I have to say, I find your assertion to be very very odd.<br><br>TBH, I never meant for the copyright issue to become a focus here; this is a thread about the suit against FEER. I pointed out the copyright issue in good faith so that the parties concerned would be able to make an informed decision. I also corrected what appeared to be a widespread myth concerning defences to copyright infringement. I do not think I can be faulted on either or both counts.<br><br></div>
