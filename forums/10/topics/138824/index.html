            <div class='col-md body'>The more I read stuff from here and the more I listen to people who have suffered under the PAP system and the more I hear of stuff by people who have great insight of the flaws of the PAP system, the more I believe the ordinary citizens deserve better.<br><br>That's why we must start now in that respect- to show discontent at the way the PAP have handled matters so far. By not voting for them, we will send a message to the PAP that we are no fools, we are no idiots and we weren't born yesterday.<br><br>I believe just as well that if the PAP continues to be in this way, then eventually they will get a taste of their own bitter medicine.
