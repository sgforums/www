              <p>As can be deciphered from the statistics (there are lies, damn lies and statistics <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">), the averages of entire group in real terms has been raised to 6.9% due to the higher top income earners 8.1%.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have 2 person Mr. A &amp; Mr. B, in the first year Mr. A makes $2 and Mr. B makes $100, their average income is $51.</p>
              <p>The following year, Mr. A makes $4 and Mr. B makes $200, both their incomes have increase 100%. Their average income is now $102.</p>
              <p>Both wages increased 100%, but Mr. A makes $2 more than before, while Mr. B makes $100 more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The lowest income earners only has 1.9% increases in real wages in 2007.</strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Household income from work is defined in the publication as:</em></p>
              <p><em>Household income from work refers to the sum of income received by working members of the household from employment and business.</em></p>
              <p><em>However, it does not include the income of domestic helpers.</em></p>

              as i have implied in my other posts, i think this is just broad stroke statements from the ministry.
              
              i am sure they have the details but they choose to release what works for them.
              
              my company is one of the larger employers in singapore and top performers do not get close to 9%. many were told tt their salary cap will be enforced for 08. i got a pittance 2% rise. was told i was luckier than most, though i indicated that this is (very)disappointing.
              
              guess what, your job can easily be filled up if you are disgruntle and don't performed. so, as my mum would contantly remind me, "mustn't grumble"...
              
              this is a reality many have to live through. you need to manage within yourself and i take those reports with a pinch of salt. but i have to admit that i am not in a dire situation. i can afford some vices. so, i am lucky. i just dun understand why the government continues to crank such propaganda when it is plain to see that if you go to the hearltlands in mature estates, it is a grim picture we see. 
              
              the reality is, the rich are getting richer....so in some ways, i agree with M13's pov.

              <p>Yup.</p>
              <p>I can't seem to understand why some people go around asking forumers about whether they got a raise or bonus last year.</p>
              <p>It's an extremely skewed data, because it only singles out certain segments of the population (like those who are better off, with the ability to afford a broadband and computer. What about other less well of citizens without broadband or computer).</p>
              <p>Maybe TCH05 should go around 1-2 room HDB housing estates to ask if everybody there got an increment or bonus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rich have certainly benefited from the reduction in top tier income taxes since the inception of GST in 1994. The government has place a greater reliance on the poor for it's revenue requirements instead of the rich. The top bracket for income taxes in 1987 for an income above $400k was 33%. Since then the top bracket for income taxes has gone down to 18%. So if a high income earner who makes $1 million above $400k, he would have save income taxes of $180,000 now. Whereas, the poor who don't need to pay any income taxes then, would need to contend with the 7% GST now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why should the low income earners bear the brunt of the governmental administrative expenses? Afterall, isn't the rich the ones who benefited from less crime and more orderliness. A rich person walking down the streets feeling more secure would better trained and equipped policemen. Whereas a poor person would be indifferent to it. I think there is something amiss when you have rich man in power, dictating (taxes) how income should be distributed between the rich and the poor.</p>
              <p>Does the rich or the poor benefit more from low crime rates?</p>

              <p>If the government does better, i.e. if they raise transport, electricity &amp; water, "public" housing and telecoms charges, then the GDP (total value of goods and services produced) would increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then they can claim that GDP went up, then demand more salary increments and bonuses.</p>
