              <p>especially the condos, it is the open market, singaporean upgraders, FT, foreigners are all coming in. But of course, the FT also have to work to get money to buy, most of the FT buying condos are in their 30s already, professionals, if they don't have an appreciated HDB, it is tougher for them to even pay the first 20%. The hot money from overseas are going for the higher class condos, in prime district.</p>
              <p>Just have to watch if there is a property bubbles.</p>

              <p>You are an extremely ill informed Singaporean. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First you tell us that all the CPF could be used to pay for housing, not knowing that the CPF is split between the 3 accounts (Ordinary Account, Special Account and Medisave). Then you tell us that there are no homeless in Changi beach, but then you are correct about no homeless in Changi beach because they have been arrested or chased away by the police. There is also a limit on the amount of CPF you can use for your HDB, once it's over the amount, you have to pay cash from you monthly salary. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><em>On Monday, 29 March, I went to Changi Beach in the morning. I had been there several times before in the past few months and have always been greeted by the sight of tents lined along the beach front. This time, however, the beach was completely empty of any tents, except for one put up by a young Chinese couple.</em></p>
              <p><em>I wondered where the regulars were – those homeless people who had been camping out there the last few months. I had become friends with some of them and heard their stories of how officers from NParks and MCYS had threatened and fined them for “squatting” at the park.</em></p>
              <p><em>Later I chanced upon one of the women who frequent Changi Beach. “They came and raided the place every day last week,” she told me. She was referring to officers from Nparks and MCYS. “Some of them were fined S$200,” she said. “So that is why there is nobody there now?” I asked her. “Yes, they have all disappeared. I do not even know where they have gone,” she replied.</em></p>

              <p>how can singaporeans be asset rich?our hdb flats is where we go to 
              eat,bathe,sleep and shit while we make money at our jobs,if we sell it 
              where can we go?take our families overseas?or sleep in our cars?judging 
              by the price of real estate in singapore,all we are doing is changing 
              one door number for another.</p>
              <p>worst still all the hdb flats look the same,people actually think that by paying $350k+ for a 5 room
               flat that somehow their home is higher standard of living than the rest
               of us.sure maybe they can afford oakwood floorings,tvs in walls and 
              huge mirrors to make their flat look bigger,at the end of the day its 
              still a tiny cramped ugly block of concrete that cost a fraction to 
              build.</p>
              <p>for 350k i can probably buy a 2 story villa,with a heated swimming pool and jacuzzi in middle town,usa.or i can buy a cheap apartment in chicago that is just
               as good as a hdb flat and put that $350k in a high interest bank 
              account,better than the crappy cpf rates that the government give us.i 
              want to eat steak and potatoes not cat food and hup seng biscuit when im

              <p>On the other hand, if the Canadian PAP government increases the Toronto population by 35% in a few years, you will also find your condo prices doubling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>It's a case of demand out pacing supply.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is good if prices double and you have extra condos in Canada to sell, in Singapore you only have 1 HDB, if you decide to sell, it's either you plan to rent or live on the streets. Forget Changi beach can't squat there since the police raided the place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>As far as i know, m'sia welcome foreigners to stay as PR, under the M'sia 2nd home scheme, provided that you buy a house of value at least RM$250k (roughly slightly over S$100k, based on current exchange rate).</p>
              <p>for RM250k, you can buy a semi-detached or even a bungalow, at a price cheaper than the cheapest HDB 3 room flat.

              <p>Meanwhile, you still continue to work in singapore, earn in terms of SGD which gives you 2.3times purchasing power over in M'sia.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the money saved justifies the slightly longer travelling time. It takes bloody long to save up/repay $200/300k (housing loans), to have it all locked up in a non-liquidable "asset". The money could be better spent on investments for retirement.</p>

Go to the causeway at 5 am in the morning or 7 pm in the evening and you wll see thousands of people doing exactly what you said, come to singapore and make SGD and spend in RM in johore!! there are also thousands of kids travelling to schools via the causeway, ......has happening and is still happening,</p>
              <p>but, when they can get PR, they will buy pigeon hole HDB in Singapore, why?</p>
              <p>many people can do calculations, sell HDB and buy villas in USA, a big condo in Vancouver or a house in Perth, actually, a few years ago, during the sub-prime crisis, a 2 room HDB can buy you a mansion in the US, but why are people coming to singapore to jack up the prices ????????????</p>
              <p>Who jack up the prices of HDB in Singapore? the singaporean who pay high COV then kpkb or the stupid foreigners who forgo the villas and mansion in US, Canada .....for a lousy HDB? <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The singapore government is just too happy to collect the stamp duty, the housing agents have their pocket filled, and all existing house owners happy to see their property appreciate....only the outsiders, think singaporean are very poor, and there are people living on the streets....Who really suffers from this unhealthy hike in prices of houses, both public and private? Anybody got a true story to tell?</p>

              <p>Thanks for telling us how overpriced our properties are compared to other developed economies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US houses cheaper, but they have restrictions on immigrations there, you don't see a 35% increase in their population in 3 years. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>US houses cheaper but still you don't see a large majority of Americans purchasing Singapore HDBs, the majority of HDB are taken up by new 3rd world immigrants (either through purchase or rental), driving up prices. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foreigners who can't get citizenship or green card won't want to purchase properties in the US. So what's the logic in saying that foreigners (3rd world) here have a choice of immigrating to US and purchase a property there.

              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, as a HDB owner, it won't make a difference if my property is a million dollars, I can't sell it and live on the streets. On the other hand, if our HDBs was cheaper it will help new families in providing a higher standard of living for their children. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>just curious, anyone here seriously contemplating buying a house in johor insteadof hdb, somewhere near 2nd link or causeway?</p>
              <p>As far as i know, m'sia welcome foreigners to stay as PR, under the M'sia 2nd home scheme, provided that you buy a house of value at least RM$250k (roughly slightly over S$100k, based on current exchange rate).</p>
              <p>for RM250k, you can buy a semi-detached or even a bungalow, at a price cheaper than the cheapest HDB 3 room flat. Also, these kind of luxury houses often come with a fenced security perimeter with 24/7 security surveilence, and most importantly, the cost of living there is cheap.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, you still continue to work in singapore, earn in terms of SGD which gives you 2.3times purchasing power over in M'sia.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the money saved justifies the slightly longer travelling time. It takes bloody long to save up/repay $200/300k (housing loans), to have it all locked up in a non-liquidable "asset". The money could be better spent on investments for retirement.</p>
              <p>please share your opinions</p>

              <p>6) Foods, markets, shopping center...near to the place I buy.</p>
              <p>7) Lastly, let me check how much I left after forking out sgd$100K + renovations costs.</p>
              <p>But, back to the top....if you are a sporean, how are you going to buy a bungolow there in the first place? There must be some form of procedures sporean need to fulfil right?</p>

              <p>So your take is. Property prices is not linked to demand from new immigrants? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Foreigners buying mansions in US and Canada.

              <p>An interesting point to note also.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While PAP embark on their massive open door immigration policies (35% foreigners), the HDB flat increased by only 0.2% from 2004 to 2009. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Restrict supply and increase demand, drive up prices so that they can make more money. This same principle is also applied to COEs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Some rich PRs tons of money, settle in here, buy some private apartment costing few millions, no problem for them. And some rich PRs who buy resales hdb flats, also no problems, they have cash to spare.</p>
              <p>Shouldnt the govt set a rules that sporean will have a set of prices to stick with and not lump sporeans and PRs and foreigners together. Sporean died faster.</p>

              <p>maybe singaporeans are doomed,we need to constantly take in foreigners in order to sustain our economy but theres no longer any land to build affordable housing,even if the government subsidise the hdb flat building cost by 100%  for singaporeans the price will still be 200k+ from  the bidding wars</p>
              <p>how can a 60k increase in hdb flats support 1 million new immigrants ?has our prime minister ever lived in a hdb flat before?</p>

              <p>Singapore property prices go up, because there are immigrants. American property prices go down, because there are no immigrants. Do people need green card or citizenship to own a property in the US? Who need Singapore citizenship to own property in Singapore? Is the hike in property prices in HK due to immigrants?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
