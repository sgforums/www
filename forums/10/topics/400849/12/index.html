              <p>I think the problem is not the 99 year lease.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's the difference between 99 year lease for a HDB flat and 99 year lease for a private property owner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You stay in a HDB flat, the government can just tell you to vacate your flat without your approval or the residents living in the same block.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For private properties, approval must be sought from the residents through a vote.</p>

              <p>Then they will realised that 70 years is still too long, because you start work around 20s, it will be a good 5-10 years before you consider marriage and buying a house.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Say you marry at 30 y.o. plus 60 years leasehold, which means you will only work all your life to pay for the house, thereafter the house reverts back to the government (so that they can sell to the new generation), it's a system for perpetual serfdom.</p>

              <p>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew says Singaporeans should not sell their <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Housing+Development+Board&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Housing Development Board (HDB)</a> flats as they will appreciate in value year after year.</p>
              <p>He told some 500 residents at a Tanjong Pagar GRC event, “I urge you
              not to listen to the estate agents and sell it and go and rent a flat
              because that’s a stupid thing to do.”</p>
              <p>“You sell it, you may not get a rental flat for a long time. And you
              cannot gain from a rental flat… Please remember that,” he added.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee’s advice comes shortly after the Government took measures to
              curb homeowners from selling their HDB flats to make a quick profit.</p>
              <p>In an effort to encourage financial prudence, the HDB introduced a
              seven-day cooling-off period for people intending to sell their flats,
              starting from November 1.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was speaking at the annual Tree Planting Day in the GRC, and
              also took the chance to emphasise the importance of the Government’s
              home-ownership policy in creating a stable nation.</p>
              <p>“No other country in the world has every family own their own flat or their own place,” he said.</p>
              <p>“If we had not done that from the earlier days, we would not have today’s stable and peaceful Singapore.”</p>
              <p>“Everybody has a piece of property which has increased in value
              every year. The infrastructure grows, the economy grows, the value of
              your home can go up,” he added.</p>
              <p>He noted that flats 30 years ago which cost about S$30,000 to
              $40,000 would cost about ten times more today after upgrading, and told
              residents, “I congratulate all those who have kept your flats, and I
              urge those who have got old flats, keep them. Your upgrading programme
              will come, and you will have a much more valuable piece of property.”</p>
              <p>When asked if he will contest in the next General Elections (GE),
              the 87-year-old Minister Mentor told reporters, “If I’m fit, I’m
              prepared to stand. But whether I stand or not, that’s up to the Prime
              Minister.”</p>
              <p>This stance is similar to the one he portrayed in 2006, shortly
              after the last GE, when he told constituents at a National Day dinner,
              “If I’m still fit and capable of making another speech like this, I’ll
              be here, I will stand with you.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lee has been the MP for Tanjong Pagar since the first Legislative
              Assembly elections in 1955, and last faced a contest in the elections
              in 1988 against independent candidate M.G. Guru, winning 81.6 per cent
              of the vote then.</p>
              <p>The Tanjong Pagar seat became part of the Tanjong Pagar GRC in 1991, and since then, the constituency’s MPs have been unopposed.</p>
              <p>However, we may have the opportunity to see some competition in the upcoming elections, with <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Reform+Party&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Reform Party</a> chief <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Kenneth+Jeyaretnam&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Kenneth Jeyaretnam</a> declaring his party’s interest in contesting the Tanjong Pagar GRC if they have enough candidates.</p>
              <p>When asked if he thought the Reform Party had a chance to win over
              the GRC, Mr Lee replied, smiling, “You can sense the crowd, you can
              feel the ground, I don’t have to answer you.”</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sure, why not, PAP do allow that, just control and change the CPF rules and regulation will do just fine. You sell yr HDB under loan from CPF, PAP will credit that loan cum interest back into your CPF, extend the withdrawer years and resell those flats you sold/or rebuild as condos at a higher price to foreigners, it is a win win situation for PAP. Go ahead, singaporeans liquidate yr HDB.</p></div>

              <p>I read with great skepticism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you buy a 2 bedroom HDB costing $250,000, let's say you work for X number of years so you only took a loan of 80% for 30 years at 3% interest rate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You would need to repay $10,204 a year, if what the Minister say is true, then the income of that household is $92,764 a year, which equates to $7,730 a month. Are all 2 bedroom HDB owners making $7,730 a month? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Affordability</strong></p>
              <p>Minister for National Development:</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Another widely-accepted measure is the debt-service-ratio (DSR), which looks at the proportion of the monthly income used to pay mortgages.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The DSR for new HDB flats in non-mature estates, based on an industry norm of a 30-year loan, averaged 23 per cent this year. This is well within the 30-35 per cent international benchmark for affordable expenditure on housing.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Depending on flat type, the DSR ranged from 11 per cent for standard flats</strong> to 29 per cent for premium projects like the Punggol Waterway Terraces, which cater to higher income households”.</em></p>
              <p>The definition of DSR is all costs related to housing, such as mortgage, maintenance, property taxes, insurance, utilities, etc, and not just the mortgage repayments, as a percentage of net income and not gross income.</p>
              <p>Also, the use of “averages” is meaningless for the lower-income. Moreover, the very concept of average affordability is flawed because those who cannot afford to buy or cannot afford to continue to pay, will not be included in the “average affordability” statistics.</p>

              <p>One should not just look at the issue of property price increases per se, we should look at the root cause of drastic property price increases in Singapore. One of the reasons is the lax PAP policies regarding immigration, more people in Singapore means more apartments needed to house these people, more demand means higher prices.

No need to pay property agent, most of them no good.<img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>there is a house hold income ceiling for first time buyer of 2 rooms and 3 rooms flat. 3 room flat max income ceiling is $3000 per month, above which you buy from open market. CCK, Hougang and Punggol new 3 room standard HDB going for $164K onward.</p>
              <p>If you take a loan of $200K for 30 yrs, your monthly repayment is $800, at current HDB interest of 2.6%, with household income is $3K, your CPF is $990, more than enough to pay month installment, no cash payment involved. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

Millions of singaporean are living in HDB, if they can manage their $3k a month, you can do better. <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If you can buy cheaper and better houses elsewhere, go!!! too much demand for HDB has already pushed up the prices. but, do you noticed that many people are chewing sour grape when they realize that the lousy HDB flats are appreciating faster than the cheaper and better.<img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Its your choice, but put the money where your month is.</p>
