              <p>Sg gov dont believe in this because they are greedy. They tqke high salary, buy pte properties as investments and get richer . They considered this is honorable because sg gover is the cleanest in governments.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately without compassion for the ppl in ruling the country, Singpaore will only be built for the rich. By giving our land to the rich of the world, we are selling teh country away. It is ok to attract the rich to our country, but not with land.</p>
              <p>We can create an island like dubia for the rich and they can pay whatever price to live there but for Singaporean, it is politically wise to ensure its citizen has an affortable root, reasonable job and huge seletion of entertainment to keep them happy.</p>
              <p>It stupid our government dont realise that. Maybe they are thinking that not their problem afterall, human being only have a short period to work and will eventually die and that not their problem. Just be selfish and keep enjoying.</p>

              <p>Prices will not drop by 30%. At most there is a short-term correction, but in the longer term, prices will just go up.</p>
              <p>So many people stood there and waited, hoping to strike 4D, strike Toto, in the end, just have to buy the house at a higher price coz they just kept waiting until they can wait no more.</p>
