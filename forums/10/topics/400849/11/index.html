              <p>HDB prices is one of the item that go against the theory of whatever goes up must come now.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, not only the prices will go up, even the flats will go higher and higher, from 10 to 20 to 50 storeys, next time go up 100 storeys. Why not? a piece of same land can earn more money with more storeys. Do your math.</p>

              <p>Yes, its true, I believe its 76% or something. Reason is they don't want you using 100% of your monthly incoming CPF balance on home loan.</p>
              <p>I believe alot of ignorant singaporeans are unaware of that, unless they have did their sums using the loan calculator from CPF or HDB webbie.</p>
              <p>An example, is you have to pay off your HDB loan of $1400 monthly, but the limit on your CPF stops at $900, you have to fork out the balance via cash.</p>
              <p>So to new home seekers, that 5 room flat might seem like an attractive investment, but be responsible to do your sums first before you commit. Lots of ignorant farkers just ballot without brains, secured the option, then realise they can't pay up later, then the people who really need the flat can't get shit because of these ignorant farkers.</p>

              <p>Yes, its true, I believe its 76% or something. Reason is they
              don't want you using 100% of your monthly incoming CPF balance on
              home loan.</p>
              <p>I believe alot of ignorant singaporeans are unaware of that,
              unless they have did their sums using the loan calculator from CPF
              or HDB webbie.</p>
              <p>An example, is you have to pay off your HDB loan of $1400
              monthly, but the limit on your CPF stops at $900, you have to fork
              out the balance via cash.</p>
              <p>So to new home seekers, that 5 room flat might seem like an
              attractive investment, but be responsible to do your sums first
              before you commit. Lots of ignorant farkers just ballot without
              brains, secured the option, then realise they can't pay up later,
              then the people who really need the flat can't get shit because of
              these ignorant farkers.</p>

              easy for the layman to comprehend. CPF should have shown this to

              <p>HDB is the new communism, they sell public housing to you at inflated prices, you work all your life to pay for the HDB, at the end of it (when you die or your leasehold of less than 99 years end), everything would have been returned to the government. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>HDB prices is one of the item that go against the theory of whatever goes up must come now.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, not only the prices will go up, even the flats will go higher and higher, from 10 to 20 to 50 storeys, next time go up 100 storeys. Why not? a piece of same land can earn more money with more storeys. Do your math.</p>
