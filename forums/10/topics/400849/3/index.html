              <p>You obviously do not have brains. It's precisely because of the huge influx of PRs that resulted in the spike in demand. How can you blame singaporeans for asking for sky high prices? Any rational person will sell at a higher price if the demand is strong. Going to the root of the problem, it's because demand is higher than supply. Why is this so? Because the government has failed to control BOTH the demand AND the supply effectively. Or in another point of view, perhaps the government planned to allow the demand to outstrip supply just to inflate property prices and boost GDP.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Either way, we have only one party to blame, we all know who.</span></p>

              <p>If sg citizen cannot own the millions, forget abt private housing, just be contented and live in HDB. Afterall, we are the one who choose the government and live like a third world citizen in a first world coutnry.</p>

              <strong>Moratorium on the renting out of a whole HDB flat</strong><br> Until HDB flat prices come down to a 'decent level' there ought to be a moratorium on the renting out of a whole HDB flat.<br> <br> This is because Public Housing ought to remain public, meaning for the good of Singaporeans and whomsoever is granted PR status.<br> <br> Rich Singaporeans who are staying in pte housing and renting out their 
              HDB flat are hogging public apartments at the expense of poorer 
              Singaporeans who can ill afford public housing, since many such 
              apartments are not appropriately used as citizens housing but as rental 
              houses for profit (foreigners being the principle tenants I believe).<br> <br> The renting out by SG owners of whole HDB flats would have been 
              acceptable during a period of HDB flat glut, but where such public 
              housing is in short supply (to the extent of impacting upon public 
              housing affordability and thus national birth rates), then the time has 
              come, I think, for a policy change that bars such practice.<br> <br> (A family may however be allowed to own both pte and HDB properties- but
               in this case, the family MUST stay in the HDB property- the pte 
              property would then NOT be considered the main abode and as such the 
              owner NOT be entitled the owner occupied property tax discounted rate of
               4% rather then the normal p.tax rate of 10%)- failing which, a forced 
              sale of the HDB flat should be enforced.<br> <br> No owner of a public housing flat should be so distanced from the 
              'Public Housing' lifestyle that he should choose to live in luxury 
              whilst directly profiting from a 'subsidized' public housing scheme.<br> <br> One cannot have one's cake and eat it. A family enjoying pte living 
              benefits from BOTH i) property tax discounts for owner occ. property 
              (pte property) ii) rental profit from the renting out their HDB flat 
              (property tax even at full rate is nominal because of govt policy/ 
              discounts etc).<br> <br> Additional legislature should HDB flat supply still NOT meet population 
               demands would be to restrict the size of HDB flat owned to 'the number 
              of registered inhabitants + 3 rooms'. i.e a single registered 'occupant'
               may only own an up to 4 room apt etc. (some time exceptions/ 
              concessions may be given to families with deceased members to comply)- 
              this would ensure that all HDB flats are optimally used. Only Citizens 
              and PRs can be reg as 'occupant(s)', foreigners have to be reg as 
              'tenants' and their numbers do NOT count towards ownership right to a 
              HDB flat for a larger size.<br> <br> Post script:<br> - The BAR on renting out of full HDB flats would ensure that ALL 
              foreigners to SG are able to either (i) stay with a Singaporean in a HDB
               flat (contribute financially to Singaporean family and 'integrate' as 
              well), or, (ii) are of a talent and income sufficient to deserve private
               housing.<br> <br> Reference:<br> - [TR22Jun2010]: 'YPAP leader and new citizen Sinha Shekhar complains about low rent of his resale' [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/06/22/ypap-leader-and-new-citizen-sinha-shekhar-complains-about-low-rent-of-his-resale-flat/">link</a>]</div>

Why not you turn around and ask you yourself as a Singaporeans, how much have your benefit from selling your flat to a PR.</p>
              <p>Because the demand for resale flat is there, Singaporean take this opportunity to sell their flat at cut throat prices, make a profit and careless those still unable to buy a house. So, dun alway blame it on the supply market or the demand one, PR can be right or wrong, Singaporeans also need to take the blame for the high cost of resale flat. No PR would know the market well and thereby get cheated in one way or the other, a PR staying here for 10 years will not go and buy a flat costing nearly a million.</p>

              <p>My dear, the taking of foreigners into Singapore provide pros and cons approach, the ironic is that the pros outweight the cons, and there are many pros which include increasing population due to low fertility rates, aging population and also for economy both in scale and prosperity. Certainly, nobody like stranger to come into his house, but if the house is in need of people to perk it up, make it more vibrant and economical, rather than ending up as an empty ghost house, I think you have to invite strangers in, potential talented strangers. You get a big bulk of them in, then slowly filter out the unwanted.</p>
              <p>For local, I urge you all to make full use of these period of foreign influx to upper your capital gain, you can rent houses, be stall owners as people are getting more and spending are higher and higher, take this opportunity to make money instead of hummming non stop on govt faults, eg, if last time you sell 10 papayas per day, with more influx of peoples, you should be able to sell more papayas, maybe 20 papayas which can double your income.</p>
              <p>The govt is not so stupid not knowing the unpopularity of foreign influx among locals, they also have a hard time to convince the locals to accept, and also they have more works to do in all ministry, now, given a choice, why not they just sit back and allow this country to go down due to low fertility and reduction in population, for them, with millions in pay, just sit back, relax, and when singapore go down, they can just migrate with what they had gained. But no, being responsible govt, the must see the future on a long term basis, if we do not bite the bullets now, do not start being cheap, better and faster now, we will be history when tomorrow come.</p>

              <p>My dear, the taking of foreigners into Singapore provide pros and cons approach, the ironic is that the pros outweight the cons, and there are many pros which include increasing population due to low fertility rates, aging population and also for economy both in scale and prosperity. Certainly, nobody like stranger to come into his house, but if the house is in need of people to perk it up, make it more vibrant and economical, rather than ending up as an empty ghost house, I think you have to invite strangers in, potential talented strangers. You get a big bulk of them in, then slowly filter out the unwanted.</p>
              <p>For local, I urge you all to make full use of these period of foreign influx to upper your capital gain, you can rent houses, be stall owners as people are getting more and spending are higher and higher, take this opportunity to make money instead of hummming non stop on govt faults, eg, if last time you sell 10 papayas per day, with more influx of peoples, you should be able to sell more papayas, maybe 20 papayas which can double your income.</p>
              <p>The govt is not so stupid not knowing the unpopularity of foreign influx among locals, they also have a hard time to convince the locals to accept, and also they have more works to do in all ministry, now, given a choice, why not they just sit back and allow this country to go down due to low fertility and reduction in population, for them, with millions in pay, just sit back, relax, and when singapore go down, they can just migrate with what they had gained. But no, being responsible govt, the must see the future on a long term basis, if we do not bite the bullets now, do not start being cheap, better and faster now, we will be history when tomorrow come.</p>

              <p>Angel, as I said, the population intake has nothing to do with our low fertility. If it was low fertility, the govt would have stopped the population inflow long time ago. We have crossed the population replacement mark long time ago. Instead, and as of now, we have become the densest place on earth. This is what Singaporeans gripping about and they all have valid points. </p>
              <p>It is all about increasing our GDP of which our ministers pays, bonuses are tied with. GDP is one of the tools of measuring our country's performance BUT not the only measurement of our economic well being. (If you want to more go read books by Prof Joseph Stiglitz, a renowned Nobel prize winner, World Bank's chief economist, Clinton’s economic advisor, professor and writer.)</p>
              <p>People to perk up a house? You must be joking. I only know woman’s twin peaks can be perked up. Use simple words lah, make up, you mean?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">For local, I urge you all to make full use of these period of foreign influx to upper your capital gain, you can rent houses, be stall owners as people are getting more and spending are higher and higher, take this opportunity to make money instead of hummming non stop on govt faults, eg, if last time you sell 10 papayas per day, with more influx of peoples, you should be able to sell more papayas, maybe 20 papayas which can double your income.</span></em></p>
              <p>This is a juvenile reasoning. By this reasoning, we should all join USA or China than we can all make even more capital gain.</p>
              <p>Our economic don’t thrive by stimulating domestic consumption thru local born or foreign born Singaporean consuming more goods and services.If you are talking about your bar – yes but we are talking about the country.</p>
              <p>Domestic population is too small to soak up all of our industries output. To give you give an example and using the last US led recession, even if the govt increases our population from the 5 million to 6 million and beyond, the recession would still bite.</p>
              <p>China can. As with the last USA’s export of global recession, China can withstand this onslaught by stimulating its own domestic market to soak up the excess industrial capacity.</p>
              <p>Increase more people into a country without adequate supply of amenities, utilities and services results in ‘artificial’, unwanted inflationary pressure. Which Singaporeans are complaining now. Our economic depends on global demand.</p>

              <p>Their future is to see that they remain as kingpin, kingmaker, and king with their packets lining with fats from the economy – simple as that.  <br><br>Please, don’t call me dear. Wait people think I ever had some illicit affair with you, which I don’t. While, in realty, I don't know if you are some lassy or old haggy. </p>

              <p><br>YOu can said that I am naive or plain, but I just want to be simple, I dun like to complicate thing, things get complicated when people at the losing stage start to create illusion and lies to make a name for themselves. I choose to be simple, clean and easy going.</p>
              <p>Everyone has a life to handle, it up to them, leave, stay or remain as complainer or loser, is all up to you. Everything has a light at the end of the tunnel, but didn't your teacher or some senior taught you that the light you see, might be the end of a cliff cave.</p>
