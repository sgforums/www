              <p>personally i dont think HDB prices will come down 20-30%.</p>
              <p>fall at most 5%. the govt will not allow HDB prices to fall that much for fear of creating a asset crash.  unlike most countries HDB controlled 60-70% singapore home ownership. but cutting new house supply they can effectively control the prices of HDB within a specify range.</p>
              <p>unlike in the late 90 and year 2000 which alot of HDB flats go underwater. the influx of PR and foreigners will ensure there are demand of houses in a country which land are scare and limited.</p>
              <p>i urge all singaporeans not to wait for the prices of HDB to fall 20-30%. buy what you can afford or barely afford. the prices of houses are here to stay. singapore govt has alot of tools to control the housing market. they only thing they dont control is how much are you willing to pay. buy wisely.</p>
