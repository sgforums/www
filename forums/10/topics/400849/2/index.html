              <p><br>If you only allow PR to rent and not to buy, rental is going to be expensive and also price of housing will also go up. Now, let us be more logic here, who are the sellers of HDB flats?? Singaporeans, greedy Singaporeans asking for sky high profits, and when PR bought it, they start to blame PR spoiling the market...Fair? Why not you turn around and ask you yourself as a Singaporeans, how much have your benefit from selling your flat to a PR.</p>
              <p>Because the demand for resale flat is there, Singaporean take this opportunity to sell their flat at cut throat prices, make a profit and careless those still unable to buy a house. So, dun alway blame it on the supply market or the demand one, PR can be right or wrong, Singaporeans also need to take the blame for the high cost of resale flat. No PR would know the market well and thereby get cheated in one way or the other, a PR staying here for 10 years will not go and buy a flat costing nearly a million.</p>

              <p>You obviously do not have brains. It's precisely because of the huge influx of PRs that resulted in the spike in demand. How can you blame singaporeans for asking for sky high prices? Any rational person will sell at a higher price if the demand is strong. Going to the root of the problem, it's because demand is higher than supply. Why is this so? Because the government has failed to control BOTH the demand AND the supply effectively. Or in another point of view, perhaps the government planned to allow the demand to outstrip supply just to inflate property prices and boost GDP. Either way, we have only one party to blame, we all know who.</p>

              <p>You obviously do not have brains. It's precisely because of the huge influx of PRs that resulted in the spike in demand. How can you blame singaporeans for asking for sky high prices? Any rational person will sell at a higher price if the demand is strong. Going to the root of the problem, it's because demand is higher than supply. Why is this so? Because the government has failed to control BOTH the demand AND the supply effectively. Or in another point of view, perhaps the government planned to allow the demand to outstrip supply just to inflate property prices and boost GDP. Either way, we have only one party to blame, we all know who.</p>

              <p><br>Your thinking is so childish, "if singaporeans is to get united and refuse to sell to PRs...", if you are a seller, would you refuse to sell your flat to someone who is willing to pay a crazy price for it? I think most singaporeans who sold their flats at crazily high prices to the PRs probably thought that the PRs are stupid suckers anyway. The only way to solve the problem is not through some childish "let's ostracise the PRs" method, but rather to shift the market equilibrium through proper demand and supply control.</p>
