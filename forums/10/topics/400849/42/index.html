              <p>you wait until you earn enough, you will never catch up with the increase. you buy to rent, your loan interest can reduce your income tax. Always better to take loan, use bank money to buy my house.</p>

              <p>If you see outside the group of people who have to earn money by doing a employed career, you will see how things can happen.</p>
              <p>There are people who are born with golden spoon, daddy got money. I once took on real estate job for 3 months, many singaporeans are buying houses for their children. If they give the money to their sons, then you will see young man buying houses with cash.</p>
              <p>There are Chinese, Indians, Indonesian...who don't know where they got their money, fast money, dirty money.....if there is no way to prove that it is illegal, they can bring in here and use, and the best way is to buy a property, values will appreciate in long term, currency secured. If they stay in China, India, Indonesia,....continue to make the money, and take risk of going to jail, and let their sons do the buying in singapore, you see young people buying with cash.</p>
              <p>There those who take on high flying jobs, lawyer, financial bankers... and their first priority in life is to buy a house (before prices go too high). I know of this guy who work as lawyer for 5 years, married another lawyer, got married and bought a 1.2 million condo. Don't think they pay cash, but they are daring to commit. They are young. A point to note with that they have no other commitment, except a small car, they dont have to support their parents, except some pocket money.</p>
              <p>There are other scenarios,....but if we were not born with golden spoon, we have to be contented with what we have and work from the bottom, hopefully we give our sons a golden spoon, or equip them to jump start as in scenario 3 above.</p>
