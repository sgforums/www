              <p>Oh, then that will be a ridiculously rediculous HDB price.</p>
              <p>a foreign friend visited me and asked me: how come yr resale govt flat is so expensive?</p>
              <p>Angel: cos the govt say it is a free market, let the market force decide, they cannot intervene</p>
              <p>foreign friend: then is should be private, not govt? govt should be able to intervene the prices, my country in Poland also control prices for govt houses, every resale have to go thru govt housing office to determine the right price and the capping of it. Seem like your govt is purposely allowing a free market on their flats.</p>
              <p>Angel: I dunno, i live in private house, but I think you are right, the higher the resale prices, the more taxation like Gst govt can collect, but these are singaporeans problem, they are not a united lots, easy for their govt to exploit.</p>

              That we are mired with a govt that purports to be a democracy is our own undoing because we acquiesced unawares to a one-party system and today the reality is far from it. It is a pseudo-democracy and it is in expereince a dictatorship. Singaporeans have been for much too long deluding themselves that they have an accountable, responsible, just and transparent govt. It is a myth â€“ the reality is that it stinks from all quarters! Even if one tries to obtain info or .., one is more likely to run into a bureaucratic cul-de-sac. If they really â€œlistenedâ€� n not hear they would have made a big difference to many lives and Singaporeans would be proud of them as a government or what-have-u.
              
              Singaporeans are in a relatively unfavorable and in a sorry state in many ways â€“ eg, high cost of living has been oversold as higher standard of livng, so-called subsidized HDB flats though claimed to be offered at reasonable prices is in fact most likely untrue and no independent source(s) have yet to or has it ever been verified. HDB has never and doubt it will ever release the actual costing (costs) or how they came about with this pricing. Why the secrecy? No one owns any HDB flat â€“ it is being leased at an exorbitant rate and top of that tenants (that is the reality) pay for the building costs of each unit n incur property tax which should actually be borne by HDB. Muse over this â€“ Does one rent a room and pay the landlord for the cost of the unit and foot the property tax bills?
              All that is palpable is HDB fattening itself on $$$ and if it is not rationalizing, it is hoodwinking the citizens into believing half-truths and sadly roped in a conniving media (we dont have a msm, a lame one â€“ yes!) to prop itself up and propagate its one-sided stories n truth-sounding lies.
              
              Also, the incumbent ruling party/govt keeps harping on this: that other models or so-called political models (eg multi-party/proportional representation) are unsuited for Singapore and it must be discouraged or eschewed at any cost;of course, it is utter rubbish and crap and one has to be an imbecile to subcribe to such rantings! Beware, it is a ploy to perpetuate power and the rationale and arguments put forth seems at best hollow and dubious. 
              
              Is not this being enslaved to a system (one-party state) that is choking and stultifying us in many ways? It would have made a difference if were oppo ... had been voted. They would have been forced to reveal and where possible be more transparent. Some limitations would have been imposed on PRs buying resale flats.
              
              From health to education to transport n CPF â€¦ â€“ all one way traffic (almost opaque). Who are these people who sit in committees or bodies that make recommendations or implement â€¦? people who are ostensibly yes-man/woman!
              Why? Simply, cos the one-party system favours PAPâ€�s style of governance. It was NEVER transparent nor accountable to the people (citizens) and doubt it will as long as the one-party system remains.
              Does Singapore ministries/ govt depts have an OMBUDSMEN? Do we have checks n balances? Who is checking whom? Imagine an independent organisation or an oppostion party â€“ it would make a BIG difference. The so-called â€˜â€™self-checkâ€� mechanisms are at its best lip service gestures, cursory and perfuntory and at its worse, sadly spurious!
              These are questions that Singaporeans need to seriously ponder about and not be lulled by the mainstream media's propaganda and what is put  out 
              As an aside, the FT (foreign â€˜talentâ€™ in quotes cos the incument govt ''defined'' and decided which or what is .., on close scrutiny it seems so facetiously shallow) policy is not in the favour of SIngaporeans but to the advantage of the govt. Do other countries allow foreigners to take up PR/citizenship so VERY easily and facilitate them and what is worse is that Singaporeans who were born here and in some ways directy/indirectly contributed to the country have to COMPETE for jobs, schools and who knows what else is to come.
              
              Why accord preferences (preferential treatment) to foreigners when NS is concerned? It is criminally unfair! Utter shame that it has come to this. This is a self-serving policy.
              The benefit(s) of FT policy to the citizens is a mere trickle effect! It seems more of a political tool to leverage (and benefit) during elections (the unchecked and poorly policed foreingn intake of  ... attests to the motives that belie this so-called label ''talent''. Lest one forgets, higher poplulation means higher GDP = means higher salaries for ministers and their cohorts cos salaries are pegged to GDP. For political orthodoxy/patronage n personal gains, Singaporeans have been (and are being) sacrificed and pawned.Does anyone know or heard of any country allowing foreigners on a social visit(toruist) pass to seek employment while they are in that particular country?
              
              Foreigners dont create jobs, on the contrary locals forgoing market-rate wages are SUBSIDIZING EMPLOYERS N FOREIGNERS. Hence, the resistance to a poilcy of minimum-wages. 
              
              Winners are MIWS and Employers.
              Losers are Singapoerans!
              
              By ignoring the realities we are unwittingly perpetuating â€˜ tyrannyâ€™. The crime of â€˜tyrannyâ€™ would persist as long as we are complicit and stay non-chalant to this charade.
              Singaporeans, need to wake up and disallow these state of affairs to persist and seriously consider a two/multi party system. It may not be perfect but is all hunky dory now?
              The past does not equal the future. There is no nation, no country, individuals make up that nation or country. It is the quality of individuals that makes or breaks a nation/country. Life without dignity is worthless. Hopefully Singaporeans understand and be cognizant of the pitfalls of simply imbibing what is told to them.
              
              One who is ethical, principled, knows sense of justice would never stand for this and would have never voted in such a party to govern us.
