              <p>if you cannot loan, rent lah, afterall, singapore peoples work
              long hours, house is just for sleeping and cook maggie mee, so why
              need to buy. In some fast pace city, people are renting and
               living in cages or tubes just to sleep, wait up, share a
              common toilet and go to work till around midnight.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, taking a loan of $130,000, to pay for a
              230,000 flat, in 10 years time, the flat would had gone
              up to $400,000++, sell it off, pay off all the loan, and you still
              get perhap a $100,000 profit, rent a room and live happily
              everafter, $100,000 leh, some people work until die also dun

              <p>Those HDB flats with high prices are due to their prime locations and good features, like one in Marine Parade with sea view on a high storey which was bought several months ago as reported in newspapers.</p>

                   affordable public housing, how can foreigner demand be prevented from 
                  skewing HDB flat prices?<br> <br> How about a more egalitarian way of distributing public housing which 
                  adopts  a more stable and progressive approach towards the provision of 
                  public housing in Singapore?<br> <br> The following suggestions return HDB to its original mission of "<a href="http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10320p.nsf/w/AboutUsOurRole?OpenDocument">Providing Affordable, Quality Homes</a>" to Singaporeans and PRs:</p>
              <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
              <li>Owner
                   occupancy ought to be promoted, as such, ALL HDB should thus for the 
                  consideration of property tax, be considered a 'primary abode' and thus 
                  be charged property tax at the usual <em>discounted</em> owner-occupied 
                  rate of 4%. Any OTHER residential property owned by a HDB flat owner(s) 
                  shall be for the purposes of taxation, be charged the higher 
                  non-owner-occupied rate of 10%.</li>
              <li>As 'subsidised' public housing 
                  is a limited commodity, no owners(s) should possess a 'subsidised' 
                  public property larger than the owners(s) maximal needs, defined as 
                  [800sq FT + X (300sqFT)], where X is the  number of registered SC/PR owners of such a flat. i.e. a  couple can own up to a maximum of [800 +
                   2(300)]= 1400sqFT sized HDB unit. -  this is so that no SC/PR consumes in excess of his equitable share of  'subsidised' public 
                  property- in a state where land is limited and as a  result of new PRs, 
                  young SC/PR couples now 
                  postpone marriage due to lack  of affordable public housing; and so that
                   large 'granny' units remain  available to multi-tier families and not 
                  the fiefdom of landlords or  other suspect use. {[800 + 2(300)] is a 
                  rough guideline, the actual numbers  may be adjusted as appropriate.} 
                  This new guideline would give married  couples (and those with larger 
                  families) an upper hand over smaller  families and singles by ensuring 
                  that 'subsidised' public housing is  optimally utilized.  A public 
                  housing unit too big for the number of registered occupants is  given 
                  between 6 months to 2 yrs, as circumstances require, to be  disposed of-
                   unless granted an exception as a case by case might requisite.</li>
              <li>Should the owner of the HDB want to rent out the flat or rooms, then the tenant(s) should preferably be SC/PR,
                   however where this isn't the case, then foreigners may rent the HDB 
                  unit subject to a govt levy of 20%rental rate OR S$80/pax/month, 
                  whichever the greater, all of which subject to usual HDB crowd control 
                  rules. Proper registration with HDB about the details of this 
                  arrangement are necessary, fines and confiscations of property may be 
                  imposed for offenders.</li>
              <li>The a/m policies would make HDB's job of
                   planning for population expansion easier and ensure efficient 
                  utilization of HDB apartments and that only SC/PR remain the primary users of public housing in Singapore. Singaporeans 
                  would always remain first class in their own country and foreigners 
                  wishing to enjoy the safe and secure environment here would have to 
                  contribute accordingly.</li>

                   little to clear old baggage- that of foreigners renting cheap

                  monopolized by individual owners for personal use or rental returns? <br> Would a HDB price correction of 20% occur now that rental returns from foreign lessees are taxed at 20%?<br> <br> The MND must quickly implement the foreigner public housing levy as described above to level the playing field between SC, PR and foreigner ownership and use of 'subsidised' public housing programmes.<br> <br> May all citizens in this world feel at home in their countries of origin.<br> May the Singapore citizen enjoy the privileges of citizenship, financial status notwithstanding.<br> May all Singaporeans feel equal in their own home country.<br> <br> Majulah Singapura, I love Singapore.<br> <br> Comments/ Responses?<br> Rgds<br> B.C.<br> <br> PS:<br> Please scrap the stupid restriction on pte property owners buying HDB (within their entitlement-Pt2) as refered to in <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/OnlineStory/STIStory_573123.html"><strong>'Don't deny investors a choice'</strong></a> and the silly 'no other property' rule (abroad inclusive) because it's

              <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
              <li>Rationing
               of HDB flats ownership by floor area, with entitlements proportionate 
              to the number of citizens/PRs owning any particular apartment. My 
              suggested (generous) calc. even in this time of 'dire need' is [800sqFt +
               X(300)]: where X is the no. of SC/PR owning such a flat (acc. ref 
              below, would still qualify a single owner for most 4rm HDBs, but not 5/ 
              larger which would be for larger groups only).</li>
              <li>Make anyone 
              owning BOTH HDB and Pte property enjoy the owner-occupied property tax 
              rate of 4% on the HDB and have the pte property be annually taxed at 10%
               REGARDLESS of where the owner actually resides in- so as to keep to the
               spirit that HDB are actually meant for owner-occupancy. (A dual 
              property owner in disagreement can dispose of his HDB which he is 
              obviously not occupying, to enjoy usual 'owner occupied' discounted 
              property taxes on his condo etc).</li>
              <li>Charge PRs double purchase 
              stamp duty when they purchase a HDB unit (open mkt) to discourage PRs 
              competing for public housing options over pte housing options and limit 
              the number of foreigners awarded PR status given out per annum until the
               a/m can be properly enforced.</li>
              <li>Impose a Public Housing foreigner
               rental levy (PH-FRL): every foreigner (F) (i.e. non citizen(SC)/ PR) 
              renting a HDB room/ unit shall have to pay a levy of 20% of rental / 
              $80/pax/mth, whichever the greater to HDB for their enjoyment of 
              'subsidised' public housing in Singapore. ALL lessees (SC/PR/F) shall be
               registered with HDB so no SC/PR can 'rent' a unit whilst owning one 
              (i.e. profiteer fr secretly re-renting it to the F).<br> - All foreigners (friends/ relatives) bunking in with a Singaporean for 
              &gt;2 weeks would have to be registered with HDB so as to avoid 
              misunderstanding when HDB officers come round to check.<br> - Evasion of such levy would entail a a fine, jail or confiscation of the HDB flat.</li>
              <li>Charge
               PRs who own in HDB units higher conservancy fees so as to encourage

               with more foreigners- there must already be formed a foreigner and PR
