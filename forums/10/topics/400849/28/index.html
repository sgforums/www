              <p>High asset value good mah. Why you wanted to devalue your asset value.</p>
              <p>MM Lee and Minister Mah cannot be wrong. Sorry must be right. High asset value will improve your value isn't it good for you?. If the children cannot afford to stay in high value asset, then they should stay with their parent. So indirectly, Minister Mah also improve Singaporean's family cohersion. so great.</p>
              <p>Current rental rule allow 4 persons to stay in a room. Correct me if I am wronged. So I wondered if it's an offence that more than 4 siblings found living in a room. That's my worry.</p>
              <p>If it's no an offence. Then seriously singaporeans should considered staying together. Saving is also a good thing to practise since we can't make more money, isn't it. You agree.</p>
              <p>Don't be a daft..mentioned by MM Lee. I selectively quote.</p>

              <p>Whether your HDB is $50,000 or $1,000,000, makes no difference, you can't sell it, if you sell it you have to live on the streets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So high asset value of HDB is like CPF, it makes you feel good, but you can't touch it, ultimately you might not even get it back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>MM Lee and Minister Mah cannot be wrong. Sorry must be right.
              High asset value will improve your value isn't it good for you?. If
              the children cannot afford to stay in high value asset, then they
              should stay with their parent. So indirectly, Minister Mah also
              improve Singaporean's family cohersion. so great.</p>
              <p>Current rental rule allow 4 persons to stay in a room. Correct
              me if I am wronged. So I wondered if it's an offence that more
