              If you bought a resale hdb flat probably you can rent it out but if you bought a new BTO 4 rooms flat, its illegal to rent it out....unless you want to take the risk and when you are caught HDB will confiscate your new flat.

              Well...hmmm...the legal technicality term of the HDB owner defination of still living in the HDB flat while the rooms were being sublet to tenants need to be define clearly. The owner got off the hook..that is a good precedence for other HDB owners to watch out..
              
              HDB BACKS DOWN ON ACQUIRING FLAT; LEGAL CHALLENGE AVERTED
              
              A flat owner's bid to challenge the HDB's move to take back his five-room unit ended yesterday when the Housing Board told the High Court it will withdraw its notice of intent to acquire the flat.
              
              Mr Chew Teck Fatt in return agreed not to proceed with his judicial review application. Justice Woo Bih Li, who made no order on the application, ruled that HDB pay Mr Chew's legal costs at the closed-door hearing.
               
              Yesterday's turn of events staved off a potential landmark case on whether the decisions of the HDB and the office of the Minister of National Development can be the subject of judicial review.
              
              When contacted last night, Mr Chew, a 38-year-old company director, said he was about to leave for Taiwan in the morning with a "heavy heart" as this matter had caused him stress for about two years. But "I felt very relieved and happy when my lawyer Kirpal called me and said the case was withdrawn, just as I was about to board the plane".
               
              An HDB spokesman The Straits Times spoke to warned that the board "takes a serious view of any unauthorised subletting as HDB flats are primarily meant for owner occupation.
               
              "In this particular case, as additional information had surfaced after Mr Chew had filed his court application, we decided to give him the benefit of doubt... "This avoids unnecessary litigation in court and will save both time and costs for the court and all the parties concerned."
              
              Mr Chew had bought the resale flat along Bukit Batok Street 25 for $480,000 in 2010. The next year, he let out a room to a couple and then a second to a Taiwanese man whose child went to school here. In both cases, he had HDB's approval.
              
              But a probe by HDB officers, which included surveillance of the flat and interviews with the tenants, found that he was not living there.
              
              It is a longstanding HDB policy that where an owner does not stay in his flat during the period of subletting, this would be evidence that the whole unit was being rented out. Subletting an entire flat without approval is against the rules, and can lead to the HDB compulsorily acquiring the unit.
              
              But Mr Chew denied renting out the whole flat and claimed he kept the third room for his use. He also said that there were times when he worked late or stayed at his mother's place at Jalan Bahagia in Balestier.
              
              He made several appeals against the acquisition and said he sought his MP's help. When they all failed, he went to court, arguing that he had a right to be heard on all the evidence gathered.
              
              At issue in the case would have been whether there must be continuous physical occupation of the flat before Mr Chew can be said to have abandoned his interest in the unit and was wholly subletting it illegally.
              
              At yesterday's hearing, the court was informed that both HDB and the minister would notify Mr Chew in writing that they would not pursue their notice of intent to re-acquire his flat made in December 2011 and January 2012 respectively. The minister's decision is made after any aggrieved party appeals to his office in a compulsory acquisition notice by HDB.
              
              Justice Woo asked for copies of the letters to be deposited with the High Court registry, said lawyer Kirpal Singh on Mr Chew's behalf.

              <p>An <span>HDB</span> spokesman The Straits Times spoke
              to warned that the board “takes a serious view of any unauthorised
              subletting as <span>HDB</span> flats are primarily meant
              for owner occupation.</p>
              <p>“In this particular case, as additional information had surfaced
              after Mr Chew had filed his court application, we decided to give
              him the benefit of doubt… “This avoids unnecessary litigation in
              court and will save both time and costs for the court and all the
              parties concerned.”</p>
              <p>Mr Chew had bought the resale flat along Bukit Batok Street 25
              for $480,000 in 2010. The next year, he let out a room to a couple
              and then a second to a Taiwanese man whose child went to school
              here. In both cases, he had <span>HDB</span>’s
              approval.</p>
              <p>But a probe by <span>HDB</span> officers, which
              included surveillance of the flat and interviews with the tenants,
              found that he was not living there.</p>
              <p>It is a longstanding <span>HDB</span> policy that where
              an owner does not stay in his flat during the period of subletting,
              this would be evidence that the whole unit was being rented out.
              Subletting an entire flat without approval is against the rules,
              and can lead to the <span>HDB</span> compulsorily
              acquiring the unit.</p>
              <p>But Mr Chew denied renting out the whole flat and claimed he
              kept the third room for his use. He also said that there were times
              when he worked late or stayed at his mother’s place at Jalan
              Bahagia in Balestier.</p>
              <p>He made several appeals against the acquisition and said he
              sought his MP’s help. When they all failed, he went to court,
              arguing that he had a right to be heard on all the evidence
              gathered.</p>
              <p>At issue in the case would have been whether there must be
              continuous physical occupation of the flat before Mr Chew can be
              said to have abandoned his interest in the unit and was wholly
              subletting it illegally.</p>
              <p>At yesterday’s hearing, the court was informed that both
              <span>HDB</span> and the minister would notify Mr Chew in
              writing that they would not pursue their notice of intent to
              re-acquire his flat made in December 2011 and January 2012
              respectively. The minister’s decision is made after any aggrieved
              party appeals to his office in a compulsory acquisition notice by
              <span>HDB</span>.</p>
              <p>Justice Woo asked for copies of the letters to be deposited with
              the High Court registry, said lawyer Kirpal Singh on Mr Chew’s
              behalf.</p>

              <p>99 yrs, 999 yrs and freehold lease are all british system, you have the right of land use for the tenure period. These land parcels are within the country, and is governed by the law of the country.</p>
              <p>HK was returned to China, as China recognized the original lease agreement, even when it is signed with canon pointing at their head. Whether one country two system works or not, it is China to decide.</p>

              I see many Singaporeans are tempted to buy private condos in Singapore and many housing agents tried to make Singaporeans sell their HDB flats to buy private condos in private development sites too. If the buyers are not cafeful they may ended up being bankrupt. Singapore economy is very vulnerable and uncertain.
              
              Don't be tempted by the housing agents or those condominium advertisements you see on TV in Singapore.

              I saw many Singaporeans fell down in the past from great height like spoil fruitsâ€¦and recently early 2013 I met one young man in a coffeshop near woodlands checkpoint. He was a HR Manager and bought a condominiumâ€¦then he was retrenchedâ€¦now a bankrupt and no HDB flat. It also happened to two of my working colleagues in the past. One upgraded his HDB flat from a four rooms HDB flat to a five rooms HDB flat in 2003 or 2004, then recession came and he was retrenched. He lost his 5 rooms HDB flat. The other one same thing, upgraded his flat to from a four rooms HDB flat to a five rooms HDB flat, then the global monetary crisis came in 2008, he was retrenched, lost his five rooms HDB flat and a bankrupt now.
