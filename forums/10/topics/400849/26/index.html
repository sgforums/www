              i think we should demand MBT for explaination
              
              Now Housing is getting SKY HIGH PRICE
              Example
              5 years ago sengkang housing was around 150k to 180k for a 4room flat
              5 years later NOW from 150k to 180k jump up SKY HIGH to price of 280k to 311k
              INFLATION really so HIGH? Resources really so EXP? need 100k plus more for resources to build each HDB units?
              
              so now concrete and steel cost 100k more to build each hdb unit?
              
              reguarding the following:
              "The PAPâ€™s view and approach on housing policy consist of 3 points. The first point is that home ownership is the cornerstone of the housing policy.
              
              The second point is there must be gradual appreciation in property prices. Why is this important for HDB price to appreciate gradually over time? Consider the hypothetical situation of a Singaporean who bought a HDB flat for $200,000. In 20 years time, would he benefit if the selling price is less than the price he bought today?"
              
              "HDB price to appreciate gradually over time" so appreciation of a new HDB flat within 5 Years is to be 100k?
              
              where by now a general worker earns $1500 and still able to afford for hdb at a so call acceptable price of 280k(avarage price for a 4rm) by MBT
              
              then another 25 years later when our kids growup the new HDB will be 800k
              and the monthly installment will be at the price of 800000 / 30years = $2222
              so will then 25 years later the salary of our children be $3.2k per mth at the age of 25yo
              where by he only start to work at the age of 22???

              <p>HDB housing has become another rich man's game for the rich to get richer and the class disparity bigger.</p>
              <p>It is also becoming a game which the middle income is playing.</p>
              <p>So the danger is the govt blindly letting ppl doing a lot property speculation which obviously will burst at some point and is obviously bad for the future generation.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are in a relatively unfavorable and in a sorry state in many ways – eg, high cost of living has been oversold as higher standard of livng, so-called subsidized HDB flats though claimed to be offered at reasonable prices is in fact most likely untrue and no independent source(s) have yet to or has it ever been verified. HDB has never and doubt it will ever release the actual costing (costs) or how they came about with this pricing. Why the secrecy?<br>All that is palpable is HDB fattening itself on $$$ and if it is not rationalizing, it is hoodwinking the citizens into believing half-truths and sadly roped in a conniving media (we dont have a msm, a lame one – yes!) to prop itself up and propagate its one-sided stories n truth-sounding lies. This is the reality - Singaporeans dont own anything excepting paying exorbitant rent and on top of that paying for the the landlord (HDB for the cost of building each unit) for a 99-year lease. . The title deeds belongs to HDb. Even after full payment, the buyer does not own it. Singaporeans are foolishly under the illusion that they own their flats.</p>
              <p>That we are mired with a leadership that purports to be a democracy is our undoing because we acquiesced unawares to a one-party system and today the reality is far from it. It is a pseudo-democracy and it is in actuality a dictatorship. Singaporeans have been for much too long deluding themselves that they have an accountable, responsible, just and transparent govt. It is a myth – the reality is that it stinks from all quarters! Even if one tries to obtain info or .., one is more likely to run into a bureaucratic cul-de-sac. If they really "listened" n not hear they would have made a big difference to many lives and Singaporeans would be proud of them as a government or what-have-u.<br>.<br>Also, the incumbent ruling party/govt keeps harping on this: that other models or so-called political models (eg multi-party/proportional representation) are unsuited for Singapore and it must be discouraged or eschewed at any cost;of course, it is utter rubbish and crap and one has to be an imbecile to subcribe to such rantings! Beware, it is a ploy to perpetuate power and the rationale and arguments put forth seems at best hollow and dubious. Citizens ought to be able to decide and it is thro wise voting. To be dictated to as to what is ‘good’ for the citizens is not being democratic but telling people that u are not wise, u are immature – ‘let me decide’. They have decided enough and ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.</p>
              <p>Is not this being enslaved to a system (one-party state) that is choking and stultifying us in many ways?<br>Eg, this bullshit about ‘Swiss standards’ or ‘good’ years simply vaporized! what an insult! Why is there no longer this mention of attaining Swiss standards. ‘It was talking cock’ during elections. It was futurizing and the reality today is, to cite a jarring eg. PMETs are driving taxis, wating on tables and … add on.</p>
              <p>From health to education to transport n CPF … – all one way traffic (almost opaque). Who are these people who sit in committees or bodies that make recommendations or implement …? people who are ostensibly yes-man/woman!</p>
              <p>Why? Simply, cos the one-party system is in the favour of the ruling party or govt. It is NEVER AND WILL NEVER be transparent or accountable to the people (citizens).</p>
              <p>Does Singapore ministries or govt depts have an OMBUDSMEN? Do we have checks n balances? Who is checking whom? Imagine an independent organisation or an oppostion party – it would make a BIG difference. The so-called ‘’self-check" mechanisms are at its best lip service gestures, cursory and perfuntory and at its worse, sadly spurious!</p>
              <p>These are questions that Singaporeans need to seriously consider when they vote and hopefully not be simply be swayed by short-term money handouts or rebates or for that matter, eg, the upgrading programs that had been recently announced. All of us know , ti will eventaully be recouped (hidden) through price escalation/increases in medical,tranport, …. add on</p>
              <p>Also, the FT (foreign ‘talent’ in quotes cos the incument govt defined and decided which or what is .., on close scrutiny it seems so facetiously shallow) policy is not in the favour of SIngaporeans but to the advantage of the govt. Do other countries allow foreigners to take up PR/citizenship so VERY easily and facilitate them and what is worse is that Singaporeans who were born here and in some ways directy/indirectly contributed to the country have to COMPETE for jobs, schools and who knows what else is to come. Why accord preferences (preferential treatment) to foreigners when NS is concerned? It is criminally unfair! Utter shame that it has come to this. This is a self-serving policy.</p>
              <p>The benefit(s) of FT policy to the citizens is a mere trickle effect! It seems more of a political tool to leverage (and benefit) during elections. Lest one forgets, higher poplulation means higher GDP = means higher salaries for ministers and their cohorts cos salaries are pegged to GDP. For the sake of political n personal gains and expediency, Singaporeans have been (and are being) sacrificed and pawned for political ortodoxy/patronage for the few with vested intersts.</p>
              <p>By ignoring the realities we are unwittingly perpetuating ‘ tyranny’. The crime of ‘tyranny’ would persist as long as we are complicit and stay non-chalant to this charade.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, need to wake up and disallow these state of affairs to persist and seriously consider a two/multi party system. It may not be perfect but is all hunky dory now? The past does not equal the future. There is no nation, no country, individuals make up that nation or country. It is the quality of individuals that makes or breaks a nation/country. Life without dignity is worthless. Hopefully Singaporeans understand and vote sensibly and vote for BIG changes.</p>
