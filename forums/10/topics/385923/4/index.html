              <h1>MM Lee should apologize to Singapore Malays and Indians for divisive remarks made in National Geographic magazine</h1>

              <p><span class="time">December 26, 2009</span></p>
              <span class="time">
              <p>Though he admitted to a Japanese audience lately that he is “not doing much work” as the Minister Mentor of Singapore except “forecasting”, Lee Kuan Yew showed why many still consider him as the “hidden” hand behind the nation’s policies.</p>
              <p>In a frank interview with journalist Mark Jacobson from the National Geographic magazine, Lee spoke about the ruling party’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies as if he was their principal architect.</p>
              <p>Though he said he was aware of the fact that “many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants”, he continued to insist that it is for “good” of the nation:</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee described the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>There is a racist undertone in Lee’s remarks on Chinese immigrants. Shouldn’t the acceptance and admission of immigrants into Singapore be based solely on meritocracy rather than race?</p>
              <p>There are only four countries in the world with a Chinese-majority population – Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that China is the primary source of Singapore’s Chinese immigrants for the last few years since the floodgates were opened.</p>
              <p>By his outlandish statement, is Lee insinuating that mainland immigrants have a higher chance than other nationalities of being granted Singapore PR and citizenship even if they are less qualified?</p>
              <p>It appears to be so judging from the large number of Chinese new citizens in Singapore, many of whom hail from the poorer inland provinces instead of the rich coastal cities which bear a closer resemblance to island’s ethnic Chinese such as Guangzhou, Xiamen and Shantou.</p>
              <p>A Singapore PR and Chinese citizen Zhang Yuanyuan was granted her PR within 2 months of application.</p>
              <p>There were news reports of Chinese construction workers, cleaners and masseurs being given Singapore PRs and citizenships.</p>
              <p>How Lee manage to arrive at the conclusion that these new immigrants from China are more “hard-driving and hard-striving” than Singaporeans is anybody’s guess.</p>
              <p>In the first place, they have no choice but to work hard here since they have to pay through their noses to an agent to get a job in Singapore, often ending up in huge debts.</p>
              <p>It is both unfair and inappropriate to compare locals who need to spend time with their families with these migrant workers who are forced to work under inhumane conditions in order to repay their debts.</p>
              <p>Lee should perhaps quote a few living examples to substantiate his statement that China immigrants “pushed the children very hard”.</p>
              <p>A significant percentage of these children from the mainland studying in Singapore come from broken families.</p>
              <p>They are accompanied to Singapore by their mothers who are known as “Pei2 Du3 Ma1 Ma1″, many of whom are separated or divorced from their husbands.</p>
              <p>Common sense will tell us that few mothers will be so courageous to bring their children overseas to start life afresh without their husbands if there are no compelling reasons to do so.</p>
              <p>As they are unable to work in Singapore, many of them end up in the sleaze trade to support their children’s education.</p>
              <p>It is a challenge to bring up a child in the absence of a father under such trying circumstances.</p>
              <p>Is Lee insinuating that children brought up by single “Pei Du Ma Ma” are more “hard-driving and hard-striving” than locals from traditional families?</p>
              <p>Lee’s callous remarks is an effrontery and insult to the Malay and Indian ethnic minorities in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Regardless of race and religion, all of us are Singaporeans and we should not be divided based on our skin color.</p>
              <p>Though the ethnic Chinese in Singapore are descendants of immigrant Chinese as well, we have managed to forge a common Singapore identity over the years with the other races.</p>
              <p>An ethnic Chinese Singaporean has more in common with a Malay Singaporean than a new immigrant from mainland China.</p>
              <p>“Hard-driving and hard-striving” are not traits unique only to the Chinese. Does Lee mean to say that Malays and Indians are less “hard-driving” than the Chinese?</p>
              <p>Lee’s actions are akin to a father adopting others’ children and praising them for being more hardworking than his own children. Which father in the world will do that?</p>
              <p>Lee should clarify what he meant exactly by his statement and issue a public apology immediately without delay to Singapore Malays and Indians for his divisive, discriminatory and potentially inflammatory remarks made in an international magazine with a readership of more than 5 million worldwide.</p>
              <p>What will the rest of the world think of Singapore’s ethnic minorities when they read the interview?</p>
              <p>They may be misled into thinking that Singapore has no choice but to “import” Chinese immigrants from overseas because its own indigenous people are less “hard-driving and hard-striving”.</p>
              <p>He should also explain to Singaporeans who are paying his multi-million salary on why he thinks that they are less “hard-driving and hard-striving” than the new immigrants from China.</p>
              <p>It is utterly unbecoming for a senior statesman in the stature of Lee to go around the world disparaging his own citizens who put him and his party in power in the first place.</p>
              <p>Lee should realize the fact that he owes everything he has today to the people of Singapore and not the other way round.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans are not “hard-driving and hard-striving”, where did GIC and Temasek get so much money to lose?</p>
              <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report in September this year, Government of Singapore Investment Corp whose Chairman is Lee himself,  suffered a loss around 59 billion Singapore dollars (US$41.6 billion) in the fiscal year ended March.</p>
              <p>This staggering sum, which was accrued from years of budget surpluses, did not belong to Lee or his government, but to the people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>And if it is not the “problem” of the elected government of the day to take care of the people who have “fallen behind”, then who should be responsible?</p>
              <p>In any other Asian democracies like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and even Malaysia, Lee would probably be forced to apologize and resign from the government.</p>
              <p>He is only able to get away in Singapore because its subservient people are too timid to tell him to “sit down and shut up” straight in the face.</p>
              <p>It is time for Singaporeans to show what they think about Lee and his coterie of “department store dummies”, borrowing a quote from former president Devan Nair in the next general election and stuck some spurs into their thick hides.</p>
              <p>Whether the PAP gets elected again is their problem, not Singapore’s. Singaporeans deserve a more humble, caring and compassionate leader who truly understand their concerns and work to safeguard their interests rather than this self-proclaimed “forecaster extraordinarie” who goes around the world offending the sensibilities of Singaporeans and foreigners alike with his half-baked bigotry.</p>

              <p><br>No, when MM Lee spoke on Singaporeans, he mended only one citizen, and that is Singaporean. His quote on Chinese immigrants does not imply that other races from other countries are not allow to come in, with the right attitude, the right talents and mindset, anyone can come here and make a living here. By saying Chinese, which is the most immgrants coming in, certainly is not a racist remark.</p>
              <p>And as you know that China population is the biggest in the world, lots of excess people, given the freedom and openness of the country, many flock out in search for a better living, therefore, Chinese tends to be the bigger group. If you ask Malaysia, Arabs or Indonesia to come, are they willing to come??, and as for India, they are also booming, are they willing to come? Given our culture demographic racial diversity, we are alway at about 60% Chinese 20% malays 10% indians and another 10% or so other racial, it is obvious that we will tends to attract chinese more, that had alway been our diversity percentage in making policies, same goes to HDB houses allocation, same goes to schools allocation etc etc.</p>
              <p>MM Lee had once quote "if you match a typical Malay life with our neighbour Malaysia or Indonesia, I think Singapore Malay are much much better off here" You agree with him??</p>

              <p><br>No, when MM Lee spoke on Singaporeans, he mended only one citizen, and that is Singaporean. His quote on Chinese immigrants does not imply that other races from other countries are not allow to come in, with the right attitude, the right talents and mindset, anyone can come here and make a living here. By saying Chinese, which is the most immgrants coming in, certainly is not a racist remark.</p>
              <p>And as you know that China population is the biggest in the world, lots of excess people, given the freedom and openness of the country, many flock out in search for a better living, therefore, Chinese tends to be the bigger group. If you ask Malaysia, Arabs or Indonesia to come, are they willing to come??, and as for India, they are also booming, are they willing to come? Given our culture demographic racial diversity, we are alway at about 60% Chinese 20% malays 10% indians and another 10% or so other racial, it is obvious that we will tends to attract chinese more, that had alway been our diversity percentage in making policies, same goes to HDB houses allocation, same goes to schools allocation etc etc.</p>
              <p>MM Lee had once quote "if you match a typical Malay life with our neighbour Malaysia or Indonesia, I think Singapore Malay are much much better off here" You agree with him??</p>

              Why Singaporean need to work harder than their leader and for their leaders.
              Singaporean ministers are paid millions for their job and LKY family has amassed more than 10 billion dollar(So I read, it's probably about 20 billion plus the fund that they control through temasek) and there's a very good reason why LKY is not (doesn't want to be) listed among richest head of state because there's simply no way they could amass such a fortune so it would be publicly admitting that they have amassed their wealth through their political position which lky familee has never stopped enjoying.

              And to say that lky and his familee could be paid higher if they were out of the public sector hahahahahaha is there anyone in the business who has amassed billions of dollars? A liar is always a liar. Lying through their teeth.
                                <br><br>
                                Can you bankrupt your enemies had you not been the head of state. Could you cover a murder or make dictation to the IMH? Could you falsify grades to your benefit and to your enemies loss? Could you make the police force as your own legalized street thugs? Could you have any women you want had you not be the head of state? Could you amass billions of dollars through your own enterprise? Well Warren Buffet did but there's a good reason why the movie 2012 put the salvation ship price tag to a mere billion. Had they upped that to 20 or 30 there would probably too few who could afford it.

              <p>Tan Kin Lian condemns MM Lee’s remarks on Singaporeans being less “hard-driving”</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 26, 2009</span></p>
              <p><span class="time">
              </span></p><p>The former CEO of NTUC INCOME Mr Tan Kin Lian has spoken out against MM Lee’s remarks on Singaporeans being less “hard-driving”.</p>
              <p>MM Lee had earlier made the comments during an interview with the National Geographic magazine more than a week ago.</p>
              <p>Speaking to journalist Mark Jacobson, MM Lee said he is aware that “many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants, especially those educated newcomers prepared to fight for higher paying jobs.”</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>In a blog entry written on Christmas’ Eve, Mr Tan expressed his dismay at MM Lee’s remark:</p>
              <p><em>“I find this remark to be quite unfair to Singaporeans. Already, they have to study very hard in schools, such that many children do not have time to play and enjoy their childhood. The male citizens have also to serve National Service…….In spite of these efforts, Mr. Lee said that the Singaporeans have become “less hard-driving and hard-striving”.</em></p>
              <p>Mr Tan’s views were shared by many of his readers who left comments on his blog condemning MM Lee for “insulting” Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>An anonymous poster wrote that Singapore is not necessarily attracting the best talents from China:</p>
              <p><em>“For a country as big as China, obviously there are some places and people there where things are much worse off than Singapore. They even find Singapore attractive despite low wages and poor working conditions when they come here.</em></p>
              <p><em>So Singapore is attracting a lot of such immigrants, not so much as those from richer and more developed areas of China.</em></p>
              <p><em>And in doing so. we are in fact not only downgrading ourselves in quality of living but also create difficulty in seeking a living for a majority of our own people.</em></p>
              <p><em>Of course the ruling and other elite classes are not affected by all this.</em></p>
              <p><em>GDP may grow with such a policy but there are many hidden negative social aspects arising from this.”</em></p>
              <p><strong>Rex </strong>commented in a sarcastic tone that MM Lee is wishing “lazy Singaporeans” a Merry Christmas:</p>
              <p><em>“I am shocked to read these disparaging remarks from this old man, not just because of its implications, but also because he is airing bad linen in other’s courtyards.</em></p>
              <p><em>Removing all the victorian english aside, LKY plainly told the american media (not S’pore media), “Singaporeans are getting LAZY that’s why we have to bring in 25% foreingners to overcome it).</em></p>
              <p><em>What kind of leadership is this? I never heard of it. Analogy: If your children are lazy, is it not your fatherly duty to train and help him with all means possible? Instead, his solution is to kick flesh and blood out of the house and look around adopt another child, without giving his own child a chance. I suppose that his own children and grand children will be exempted from such treatment. I don’t believe it. It is absolutely horrifying and outrageous!!!</em></p>
              <p><em>One pertinent point: we cannot compare times of old to present times. 50 years ago, it was a level playing field. Chinese immigrants worked hard together with locals for the same rewards. Today, locals can work hard, but we are bogged down with artificial barriers like high CPF (so employers favour foreigners), NS reservist (so employers favour foreigners) high exchange rate (so foreigners effectively gain more and have more reason to work hard), high HDB prices (foreigners earn singapore money and convert back to their home money and they can afford decent housing) and many other socio economic factors.</em></p>
              <p><em>I was luckily born in a generation when, if you work hard, you will succeed. THERE EXISTS AN INCENTIVE FOR WORKING HARD. Today things are so bad that there is somethings no reason to work hard, because you can’t succeed are get rich that way. The Singapore dream is shattered.</em></p>
              <p><em>On the other hand, foreingers have reason to work hard, because the SGP dollar is strong and they can convert back and retire comfortably in their original land.</em></p>
              <p><em>I think it is a very very very sad Christmas present LKY give to Singaporeans. The Great Leader is abandoning us totally, and telling the whole world about it. This is his Christmas present to all of us.</em></p>
              <p><em>Merry Christmas you lazy Singaporeans!”</em></p>
              <p>Mr Tan shot into fame last year by holding more than 10 rallies at Hong Lim Park to fight for the rights of the aggrieved minibond investors who lost their entire life-savings after purchasing credit-linked products with financial institutions in Singapore following the collapse of Lehmann Brothers.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan had earlier claimed he would participate in the next presidential elections if he managed to garner 100,000 signatures from Singaporeans on a petition drive. Nothing has been heard about it ever since.</p>
              <p>Initially touted as a possible candidate for the opposition, Mr Tan has been keeping his fingers crossed so far.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan was a PAP member for the last 20 years. He has since terminated his membership.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans do not mind the fact that he was formerly from the establishment.</p>
              <p>Having an alternative voice other than the PAP to speak up for them in parliament is better than nothing at all.</p>

              <p>Article:</p>
              <p><span>THURSDAY</span>, DECEMBER 24, 2009<br>MM Lee: Singaporeans have become “less hard-driving and hard-striving.”</p>
              <p>National Geographic Magazine, Jan 2010</p>
              <p>Over time, the MM says, Singaporeans have become “less hard-driving and hard-striving.” This is why it is a good thing, the MM says, that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants (25 percent of the population is now foreign-born). He is aware that many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants, especially those educated newcomers prepared to fight for higher paying jobs. But taking a typically Darwinian stance, the MM describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.” If native Singaporeans are falling behind because “the spurs are not stuck into the hide,” that is their problem.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Personal Opinion:</p>
              <p>If i am to rephrase the last sentence posted in this article. MM Lee just asked us to go and ‘F’ Ourselves. if we do not push ourselves or our children very hard. Singapore is already a fast paced environment where money rules over time. If MM is trying to tell us that we have to push even harder, wouldn’t that make a materialistic and economical society that does not have any social interaction? This kind of life would be very difficult to grasp for Singaporeans, and is already showing in the early stages of immigration. If he wants the influx to continue or even expand, he would be contradicting the whole <span>PAP</span> and his own son, who are trying to change immigration policies to suit Singaporeans better.<br>According to Dr. Mahathir’s book “Malay’s Dilemma”, the mindset or attitude of people cannot be changed overnight, what MM Lee is saying ‘the spurs are not stuck into the hide’ means that we have to change our mindsets to drive ourselves more and basically be hungry to strive for better grades and so on… As shown in the case of the Malays in Malaysia, they have taken 50 years, and would probably need another 100 or 150 years to catch up with the Chinese in terms of economic power. If the influx of foreigners continue coming in, we would become a modern age Malaysia, where the ‘indigenous’people are disadvantaged by the incoming foreigners and their rulers. The Main difference between this comparison, is that this ‘sabotage’ in Malaysia happened during the british colonial ruling, so the Big Questions means: Is MM Lee just like a colonial ruler? he just sounds like one.</p>
              <p>Just some food for thought, feel free to respond to this comment</p>
