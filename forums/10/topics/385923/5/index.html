              So, when the new citizens (PRC, Indians, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Malaysians, Burmese) become too comfortable with life in Singapore, LKY (if he's still alive) or maybe LHL will say the same thing:
              
              <p>Over time, the new citizens have become â€œless hard-driving and hard-striving.â€� This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many African immigrants. They are even cheaper to employ than the new citizens. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <h1>Complete media blackout on MM Lee’s remarks in National Geographic magazine</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 27, 2009</span></p>
              <p>The Singapore media has imposed a total media blackout on MM Lee’s remarks made in the National Geographic magazine on 20 December 2009.</p>
              <p>Speaking to journalist Mark Jacobson on how he had governed Singapore, MM Lee said he is aware that “many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants, especially those educated newcomers prepared to fight for higher paying jobs.”</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>After the Temasek Review has published a report on MM Lee’s interview on 24 December, a massive outcry broke out  in cyberspace with many netizens expressing their disgust and outrage at his views.</p>
              <p>Over 60 comments were posted on Temasek Review in one day alone, condemning MM Lee for his remarks. The issue was such a hot topic of discussion that it was even featured on “Top News”, an online aggregator.</p>
              <p>Despite intense public interest in the story, it did not warrant even a brief mention in any of the Singapore papers, including the Chinese tabloids.</p>
              <p>The Singapore media has always published any news about MM Lee faithfully, including his frequent overseas trips and numerous speeches made in Singapore and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>For example, MM Lee’s recent visit to India was given extensive publicity by the Singapore media when it was hardly covered by the Indian press.</p>
              <p>As the “foreign talent” issue is a burning hot topic of late among Singaporeans, the media has a duty to report MM Lee’s views on the matter to the rest of Singapore.</p>
              <p>After all, though by his own admission, he is “not doing much work except forecasting”, he still appears in the news on a regular basis, more so than his son the Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>Did the Singapore media miss the story or was it “under instructions” from some other authority not to publish MM Lee’s remarks?</p>
              <p>In any other democracies like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong, such callous remarks made by a prominent politician would be splashed on the front pages of most papers almost immediately.</p>
              <p>The former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso often made the headlines for his infamous gaffes which helped swayed public opinion against him leading to his crushing defeat during the August general election this year.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the media is completely controlled by the ruling party via the Singapore Press Holdings, led by a former minister Dr Tony Tan.</p>
              <p>News portraying government leaders in a bad light are censored while scandals involving opposition politicians are played up and given prominent coverage, e.g. the recent extradiction to U.S. of a Reform Party member on charges of arms-trafficking.</p>
              <p>Without a free and independent press, it is little wonder that more than 90 per cent of Singaporeans inteviewed has faith in their leaders and public institutions, according to a report released by the United Nations Development Programme in September this year.</p>
              <p>In the age of the internet, it remains to be seen how long more the Singapore media can afford to keep a lid on sensitive news as such without alienating their readers who are flocking to alternative news sites like Temasek Review.</p>

              <h1>Complete media blackout on MM Lee’s remarks in National Geographic magazine</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 27, 2009</span></p>
              <p>The Singapore media has imposed a total media blackout on MM Lee’s remarks made in the National Geographic magazine on 20 December 2009.</p>
              <p>Speaking to journalist Mark Jacobson on how he had governed Singapore, MM Lee said he is aware that “many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants, especially those educated newcomers prepared to fight for higher paying jobs.”</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>After the Temasek Review has published a report on MM Lee’s interview on 24 December, a massive outcry broke out  in cyberspace with many netizens expressing their disgust and outrage at his views.</p>
              <p>Over 60 comments were posted on Temasek Review in one day alone, condemning MM Lee for his remarks. The issue was such a hot topic of discussion that it was even featured on “Top News”, an online aggregator.</p>
              <p>Despite intense public interest in the story, it did not warrant even a brief mention in any of the Singapore papers, including the Chinese tabloids.</p>
              <p>The Singapore media has always published any news about MM Lee faithfully, including his frequent overseas trips and numerous speeches made in Singapore and elsewhere.</p>
              <p>For example, MM Lee’s recent visit to India was given extensive publicity by the Singapore media when it was hardly covered by the Indian press.</p>
              <p>As the “foreign talent” issue is a burning hot topic of late among Singaporeans, the media has a duty to report MM Lee’s views on the matter to the rest of Singapore.</p>
              <p>After all, though by his own admission, he is “not doing much work except forecasting”, he still appears in the news on a regular basis, more so than his son the Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>Did the Singapore media miss the story or was it “under instructions” from some other authority not to publish MM Lee’s remarks?</p>
              <p>In any other democracies like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and Hong Kong, such callous remarks made by a prominent politician would be splashed on the front pages of most papers almost immediately.</p>
              <p>The former Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso often made the headlines for his infamous gaffes which helped swayed public opinion against him leading to his crushing defeat during the August general election this year.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the media is completely controlled by the ruling party via the Singapore Press Holdings, led by a former minister Dr Tony Tan.</p>
              <p>News portraying government leaders in a bad light are censored while scandals involving opposition politicians are played up and given prominent coverage, e.g. the recent extradiction to U.S. of a Reform Party member on charges of arms-trafficking.</p>
              <p>Without a free and independent press, it is little wonder that more than 90 per cent of Singaporeans inteviewed has faith in their leaders and public institutions, according to a report released by the United Nations Development Programme in September this year.</p>
              <p>In the age of the internet, it remains to be seen how long more the Singapore media can afford to keep a lid on sensitive news as such without alienating their readers who are flocking to alternative news sites like Temasek Review.</p>

              <h1>MM Lee should apologize to Singapore Malays and Indians for divisive remarks made in National Geographic magazine</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 26, 2009</span></p>
              <p>Though he admitted to a Japanese audience lately that he is “not doing much work” as the Minister Mentor of Singapore except “forecasting”, Lee Kuan Yew showed why many still consider him as the “hidden” hand behind the nation’s policies.</p>
              <p>In a frank interview with journalist Mark Jacobson from the National Geographic magazine, Lee spoke about the ruling party’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies as if he was their principal architect.</p>
              <p>Though he said he was aware of the fact that “many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants”, he continued to insist that it is for “good” of the nation:</p>
              <p><em>“Over time, Singaporeans have become less hard-driving and hard-striving. This is why it is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants.” </em>Lee was quoted saying.</p>
              <p>Lee described the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.”</p>
              <p><em>“If native Singaporeans are falling behind because the spurs are not stuck into the hide, that is their problem,” </em>he quipped.</p>
              <p>There is a racist undertone in Lee’s remarks on Chinese immigrants. Shouldn’t the acceptance and admission of immigrants into Singapore be based solely on meritocracy rather than race?</p>
              <p>There are only four countries in the world with a Chinese-majority population – Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China.</p>
              <p>It is obvious that China is the primary source of Singapore’s Chinese immigrants for the last few years since the floodgates were opened.</p>
              <p>By his outlandish statement, is Lee insinuating that mainland immigrants have a higher chance than other nationalities of being granted Singapore PR and citizenship even if they are less qualified?</p>
              <p>It appears to be so judging from the large number of Chinese new citizens in Singapore, many of whom hail from the poorer inland provinces instead of the rich coastal cities which bear a closer resemblance to island’s ethnic Chinese such as Guangzhou, Xiamen and Shantou.</p>
              <p>A Singapore PR and Chinese citizen Zhang Yuanyuan was granted her PR within 2 months of application.</p>
              <p>There were news reports of Chinese construction workers, cleaners and masseurs being given Singapore PRs and citizenships.</p>
              <p>How Lee manage to arrive at the conclusion that these new immigrants from China are more “hard-driving and hard-striving” than Singaporeans is anybody’s guess.</p>
              <p>In the first place, they have no choice but to work hard here since they have to pay through their noses to an agent to get a job in Singapore, often ending up in huge debts.</p>
              <p>It is both unfair and inappropriate to compare locals who need to spend time with their families with these migrant workers who are forced to work under inhumane conditions in order to repay their debts.</p>
              <p>Lee should perhaps quote a few living examples to substantiate his statement that China immigrants “pushed the children very hard”.</p>
              <p>A significant percentage of these children from the mainland studying in Singapore come from broken families.</p>
              <p>They are accompanied to Singapore by their mothers who are known as “Pei2 Du3 Ma1 Ma1″, many of whom are separated or divorced from their husbands.</p>
              <p>Common sense will tell us that few mothers will be so courageous to bring their children overseas to start life afresh without their husbands if there are no compelling reasons to do so.</p>
              <p>As they are unable to work in Singapore, many of them end up in the sleaze trade to support their children’s education.</p>
              <p>It is a challenge to bring up a child in the absence of a father under such trying circumstances.</p>
              <p>Is Lee insinuating that children brought up by single “Pei Du Ma Ma” are more “hard-driving and hard-striving” than locals from traditional families?</p>
              <p>Lee’s callous remarks is an effrontery and insult to the Malay and Indian ethnic minorities in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Regardless of race and religion, all of us are Singaporeans and we should not be divided based on our skin color.</p>
              <p>Though the ethnic Chinese in Singapore are descendants of immigrant Chinese as well, we have managed to forge a common Singapore identity over the years with the other races.</p>
              <p>An ethnic Chinese Singaporean has more in common with a Malay Singaporean than a new immigrant from mainland China.</p>
              <p>“Hard-driving and hard-striving” are not traits unique only to the Chinese. Does Lee mean to say that Malays and Indians are less “hard-driving” than the Chinese?</p>
              <p>Lee’s actions are akin to a father adopting others’ children and praising them for being more hardworking than his own children. Which father in the world will do that?</p>
              <p>Lee should clarify what he meant exactly by his statement and issue a public apology immediately without delay to Singapore Malays and Indians for his divisive, discriminatory and potentially inflammatory remarks made in an international magazine with a readership of more than 5 million worldwide.</p>
              <p>What will the rest of the world think of Singapore’s ethnic minorities when they read the interview?</p>
              <p>They may be misled into thinking that Singapore has no choice but to “import” Chinese immigrants from overseas because its own indigenous people are less “hard-driving and hard-striving”.</p>
              <p>He should also explain to Singaporeans who are paying his multi-million salary on why he thinks that they are less “hard-driving and hard-striving” than the new immigrants from China.</p>
              <p>It is utterly unbecoming for a senior statesman in the stature of Lee to go around the world disparaging his own citizens who put him and his party in power in the first place.</p>
              <p>Lee should realize the fact that he owes everything he has today to the people of Singapore and not the other way round.</p>
              <p>If Singaporeans are not “hard-driving and hard-striving”, where did GIC and Temasek get so much money to lose?</p>
              <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report in September this year, Government of Singapore Investment Corp whose Chairman is Lee himself,  suffered a loss around 59 billion Singapore dollars (US$41.6 billion) in the fiscal year ended March.</p>
              <p>This staggering sum, which was accrued from years of budget surpluses, did not belong to Lee or his government, but to the people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>And if it is not the “problem” of the elected government of the day to take care of the people who have “fallen behind”, then who should be responsible?</p>
              <p>In any other Asian democracies like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and even Malaysia, Lee would probably be forced to apologize and resign from the government.</p>
              <p>He is only able to get away in Singapore because its subservient people are too timid to tell him to “sit down and shut up” straight in the face.</p>
              <p>It is time for Singaporeans to show what they think about Lee and his coterie of “department store dummies”, borrowing a quote from former president Devan Nair in the next general election and stuck some spurs into their thick hides.</p>
              <p>Whether the PAP gets elected again is their problem, not Singapore’s. Singaporeans deserve a more humble, caring and compassionate leader who truly understand their concerns and work to safeguard their interests rather than this self-proclaimed “forecaster extraordinarie” who goes around the world offending the sensibilities of Singaporeans and foreigners alike with his half-baked bigotry.</p>

              <p>its not that we cant take criticisms...its the way the local media handles the situation.

              <p>Article:</p>
              <p><span>THURSDAY</span>, DECEMBER 24, 2009<br>MM Lee: Singaporeans have become “less hard-driving and hard-striving.”</p>
              <p>National Geographic Magazine, Jan 2010</p>
              <p>Over time, the MM says, Singaporeans have become “less hard-driving and hard-striving.” This is why it is a good thing, the MM says, that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants (25 percent of the population is now foreign-born). He is aware that many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants, especially those educated newcomers prepared to fight for higher paying jobs. But taking a typically Darwinian stance, the MM describes the country’s new subjects as “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.” If native Singaporeans are falling behind because “the spurs are not stuck into the hide,” that is their problem.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Personal Opinion:</p>
              <p>If i am to rephrase the last sentence posted in this article. MM Lee just asked us to go and ‘F’ Ourselves. if we do not push ourselves or our children very hard. Singapore is already a fast paced environment where money rules over time. If MM is trying to tell us that we have to push even harder, wouldn’t that make a materialistic and economical society that does not have any social interaction? This kind of life would be very difficult to grasp for Singaporeans, and is already showing in the early stages of immigration. If he wants the influx to continue or even expand, he would be contradicting the whole <span>PAP</span> and his own son, who are trying to change immigration policies to suit Singaporeans better.<br>According to Dr. Mahathir’s book “Malay’s Dilemma”, the mindset or attitude of people cannot be changed overnight, what MM Lee is saying ‘the spurs are not stuck into the hide’ means that we have to change our mindsets to drive ourselves more and basically be hungry to strive for better grades and so on… As shown in the case of the Malays in Malaysia, they have taken 50 years, and would probably need another 100 or 150 years to catch up with the Chinese in terms of economic power. If the influx of foreigners continue coming in, we would become a modern age Malaysia, where the ‘indigenous’people are disadvantaged by the incoming foreigners and their rulers. The Main difference between this comparison, is that this ‘sabotage’ in Malaysia happened during the british colonial ruling, so the Big Questions means: Is MM Lee just like a colonial ruler? he just sounds like one.</p>
              <p>Just some food for thought, feel free to respond to this comment</p>
