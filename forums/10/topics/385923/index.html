              MM Lee: Singaporeans have become "less hard-driving and hard-striving."
              
              National Geographic Magazine, Jan 2010
              
              Over time, the MM says, Singaporeans have become "less hard-driving and hard-striving." This is why it is a good thing, the MM says, that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants (25 percent of the population is now foreign-born). He is aware that many Singaporeans are unhappy with the influx of immigrants, especially those educated newcomers prepared to fight for higher paying jobs. But taking a typically Darwinian stance, the MM describes the country's new subjects as "hungry," with parents who "pushed the children very hard." If native Singaporeans are falling behind because "the spurs are not stuck into the hide," that is their problem.
              
              __________________________________________________________________
              
              Personal Opinion:
              
              
              If i am to rephrase the last sentence posted in this article. MM Lee just asked us to go and 'F' Ourselves.  if we do not push ourselves or our children very hard. Singapore is already a fast paced environment where money rules over time. If MM is trying to tell us that we have to push even harder, wouldn't that make a materialistic and economical society that does not have any social interaction? This kind of life would be very difficult to grasp for Singaporeans, and is already showing in the early stages of immigration. If he wants the influx to continue or even expand, he would be contradicting the whole PAP and his own son, who are trying to change immigration policies to suit Singaporeans better. 
              According to Dr. Mahathir's book "Malay's Dilemma", the mindset or attitude of people cannot be changed overnight, what MM Lee is saying 'the spurs are not stuck into the hide' means that we have to change our mindsets to drive ourselves more and basically be hungry to strive for better grades and so on... As shown in the case of the Malays in Malaysia, they have taken 50 years, and would probably need another 100 or 150 years to catch up with the Chinese in terms of economic power. If the influx of foreigners continue coming in, we would become a modern age Malaysia, where the 'indigenous'people are disadvantaged by the incoming foreigners and their rulers. The Main difference between this comparison, is that this 'sabotage' in Malaysia happened during the british colonial ruling, so the Big Questions means: Is MM Lee just like a colonial ruler? he just sounds like one. 
              
              Just some food for thought, feel free to respond to this comment

              <p>MM Lee is taking a darwinian approach - just prove him correct by working even harder. I think this is his 'only' issue with singaporeans, too comfortable with what we are given.</p>
              <p>It is not totally impossible to interact with FTs, it may be hard, but FTs do have the same needs as sgians, think again, we do have the same problem - overcrowding. This is purely my speculation but I think he wants us to depend on each other for help, by forcing this situation.</p>
              <p>Then we start tackle other MPs one by one, their arguments are much less relevant to poor you and me, and they sounded much less credible than MM Lee.</p>
              <p>I personally do not feel MM Lee is corrupted, perhaps too 'used to power', and can't see much of the activities at the lowest level, but for others, I think they didn't not really share his 'insights' and merely acting as part of the cogs to reproduce a dysfunctional government in which MM Lee and his team did not expect.</p>

              <p>As much as I dislike many of the policies that MM lee has put in place, I do not deny that he has done much for Singapore and I definitely agree with him in this case.</p>
              <p>I think Singaporeans are getting lazy and we need to bring in the external competition to keep our students on their toes. If Singaporeans get lazy and we use all our funds feeding ourselves so that we can continue to be lazy, it creates a deadly cycle of increasing debt and eventually Singapore will crumble into dust.</p>
              <p>At the same time, it is important to make it clear that Singaporeans are going to get first priority for things like scholarships and entry to top courses. The foreigners should get a decent chance at making it in Singapore, certainly, but we should put Singaporeans first. We are already doing foreigners a favour by allowing them into our system, it is a privilege, we do not owe them anything, so if we put Singaporeans at priority it does not mean we are discriminating against them unfairly. But we should continue to bring them in to keep our system competitive.</p>
              <p>I do not believe our current schooling system is so terribly competitive that without an enormous talent for academic subjects one cannot do decently well at school. If you work hard, if you put in as much effort as you could, you will not be at the bottom. You may never be number 1, but in the current situation I believe that for the general population, trying hard is all it takes to make it to the top 30%.</p>

              <p>I totally agree with the TS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To critise singaporeans saying that we do not work hard enough is rubbish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right from our childhood, we are being forced by our parents to study hard. They arrange many tutions and CCA activities for us and teachers arrange many remedial lessons for the students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Than when we graduate and start working, we work long hours because of the heavy workload given to us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those in the service and retail industry are worst. They work 6 days a week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those people who say singaporeans are getting lazy, I think they are talking about themselves. The majority of singaporeans are hardworking while these minority lazy ones should feel guilty about themselves and yet they still have the cheek to spread malicious propaganda that singaporeans are lazy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The hugh amount of salary that MM Lee and his son is getting every month proves that he is corrupted. Of course he calls it "paying high salary to the ministers to prevent corruption and to attract the best talents to be ministers".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But such lame theory obviously can't bluff the majority of singaporeans who can see that we are paying high salary to attract rubbish quality kind of minsters in our country</p>

              <p>We have a free market/capitalist system in Singapore.  Like all free market economies, jobs are created or lost based on global economic cycle.  Decision to hire or fire rests entirely on companies (who are profit-seeking) and depending on whether you are an asset or a liability to them.  These are the characteristics of a free market/capitalist system. If you want an "Iron Rice Bowl", go live in North Korea.</p>

              <p>very well understand the intentions of MM from the strict Darwinian perspective to survive (he is still one PAP whom i still hold my greatest respect in terms of his political genius) .</p>
              <p>If we pursue such a system to the extreme, we would become human animals or high tech robots without EQ. I believe his subordinates feel the tight control their "father boss" has over them....keep pressuring them...not an easy person to work with in Lee Inc. </p>
              <p>There ought to be a balance in work and life...so that competition could be well sustained in the long run than to be overly worried over an economic phenomenon.  Any overworked bolt or nut will need rest and maintenance. The Ministers will have to think even harder or smarter themselves than just pushing the nuts to perform.....(their hefty salaries justifies so as compared to "low increments-productive bonus-pay cuts-weak union" workforce..).</p>
              <p>Adding on to my favourite subject...it is also about time...the high pay Ministers work towards Men's Charter...come on...the very much spoiled status of women in Singapore (even China or foreign females could testify) is all at the expense of men...from our support for army, women, and to the stability and success of Singapore....women here owe us a great deal.... </p>

              <p>This is a good quote to repeat at the next GE to remind the mother-fucker Lee Kuan Yew what he thinks of his own Million $$ Ministers.</p>
              <p>He was obviously referring to those slack, useless bums when he made the statement.  </p>
              <p>He was comparing them to the PAP team of the 1960's.</p>
              <p>And for the first time in a very long time, I agree with him.</p>

Then we were told they were here because of the low fertility rate. Long time ago we were told they were needed for skills that didn't exist in Singapore. We were also told they are here for jobs Singaporeans did not want.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>Now we are told they are here because Singaporeans are now too lazy for Singapore Inc. Yes, years of good life and pampering by the PAP govt has turned us into softies unable to compete in this globalised economy. Strange isn't it? If these hardworking and hard striving Chinese immigrants are so productive why has our <a id="AdBriteInlineAd_productivity" style="padding-bottom: 2px; margin-bottom: -2px; background: url(http://files.adbrite.com/mb/images/green-double-underline-006600.gif) repeat-x 50% bottom; color: #006600; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none;" name="AdBriteInlineAd_productivity">productivity</a> fallen as their numbers rise?</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>To the elitist PAP govt, the ordinary Singaporean is never good enough. The 70 yr old who has to clean tables at the Bedok Hawker Center for a living does not strive hard enough. The mother with 2 disabled kids did not strive hard enough to look for a job to support her family. The Singapore workforce ranked no. 1 for over a decade was not hard driving enough for the PAP. Only people who does any real work in Singapore is the PAP govt that is why their ministers deserve to make in one day what some of the workers earn in a year.</div>

              <div><em>.</em></div>
              <div>This explains why the blame is always put on Singaporeans for almost every problem faced by our society. You find it hard to afford a HDB flat - that is because you didn't strive hard enough. You struggle to raise your family, pay the ever-increasing bills for electricity &amp; transport and find it hard to cope with the unstable job market - you didn't strive hard enough.</div>

However, the PAP itself shuns competition preferring to tweak the laws to retain their monopolistic powers. The PAP men like to work in state own monopolies for ridiculously high salaries and from their ivory towers command the ordinary Singaporean to be cheaper, better and faster. We take the overcrowded buses and MRT so that their transport companies can make money, we live in small overpriced public housing (the most expensive in the world), we pay the 2nd highest electricity tariffs in the world and we pay the highest salaries in the world for those PAP ministers...if there is one reason Singapore is not competitive it is because there are leeches sucking the blood of ordinary Singaporeans.</div>
