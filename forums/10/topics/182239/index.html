HEALTH CARE<br><br>6.1 Medisave - A System in Collapse<br>6.1.1 Medisave is not the answer to the very real problem that our low income citizens face in paying for their health care. The system is nothing more than a way of shirking society's responsibility but ensuring on the other hand that hospital fees and charges are collected without the odium of taking to court those who are unable to pay for their bills.<br><br>6.2 The Workers' Party Alternative<br>The Party proposes to <strong>phase out the Medisave Scheme as soon as possible and implement instead a comprehensive public health insurance scheme.</strong><br>........The details of insurance claims (what its scope should be/whether there should be different classes of care within the public health care system/how the scheme will interact with private health care, etc.) can only be fully worked out once the Party is elected. The Party will study schemes in operation in other countries and learn from their experience. A comprehensive health insurance scheme has the following advantages over the Medisave scheme<strong></strong></blockquote>3.<strong>Is 'abolish 'equivalent' to phrase out as soon as possible'?</strong><br>This looks like TAIWAN Chen said 'ceases to be operation.='freeze'<br>Shall Secretary-General,Low Thia Khiang apology and recitify this mistake?<br><br>4.<strong><a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/khawbw.htm" rel="nofollow">Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan</a></strong> was born in Malaysia and came to Sg to study.<br>I think he likes Sg more than most of us here for he has experienced personally the two systems.Who really  hoodwink voters?<br><br>5.Search for <strong><a href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/parlweb/hansard_search_latest.jsp" rel="nofollow">Parliment report few days later to read what Low and Khaw reallt said.</a></strong><br><br>6.We can tolerate different views but the facts must be right.<br>If one have proposed or said somethings,one must admit.<br><br>If one dare to deny which has been recorded down,what he will do if those nobody or only few know he has done or said?He simply just forget them at all.<br>Can u trust a potential leader so 'forgetful'?</div>

No speeches, please.</strong><br><span style="color: blue;">Mr Low Thia Khiang:</span> Sir, the Prime Minister has referred to the Workers' Party's manifesto.  I happen to have a copy here. On unemployment insurance, I would like to clarify the reason why we contemplated and decided to propose this unemployment insurance.  It is because of the experience of the financial crisis.  Yes, we have retrenchment benefits, but when the company closed down, the workers get nothing.  Bearing in mind that there are a lot of workers who are not unionised, they are just retrenched and left with nothing. They can be drawing a few thousand dollars or a few hundred dollars but, suddenly, when they are retrenched, they must be left with nothing because the company just went bust. How do they cope with life with the sudden drastic change in income?  The current situation that we have, in terms of securing some kind of payment, when a person is retrenched, is not satisfactory.<br><span style="color: red;">Mr Wong Kan Seng:</span> <strong>That is not one point of clarification. It looks like Mr Low is making another speech.</strong><br><span style="color: red;">Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</span> <strong>He should have said this in the debate, not now.</strong><br><span style="color: blue;">Mr Low Thia Khiang:</span> I am clarifying.  He is saying that unemployment insurance is something ---<br><span style="color: red;">Mr Speaker:</span> <strong>But you are taking the opportunity to make a long speech, Mr Low.</strong><br><span style="color: blue;">Mr Low Thia Khiang:</span> Okay.  I cut it short, Sir.<br>Mr Speaker: Just clarify. That is all.<br><span style="color: blue;">Mr Low Thia Khiang:</span> The concern of the Government is whether this is going to be a welfare state. So I clarify that it is not so because we are contemplating unemployment insurance ---<br><span style="color: red;">Mr Wong Kan Seng:</span> I do not think Mr Low knows the meaning of clarification.  After the PM has made his round-up speech, he is to seek clarification from the Prime Minister and not to say something in clarification of what he had wanted to say or had said but said wrongly or was misunderstood. That is the meaning of clarification.  I think he better understand this carefully.  If he wants to have a debate on the Workers' Party manifesto, that is a different matter. It is not a clarification.<br><span style="color: blue;">Mr Low Thia Khiang:</span> May I understand that I can only seek clarification of what the PM has said. Okay, never mind, Sir.  I leave the matter.  I do want to clarify some points made by the Prime Minister. First, on unconditional needs-based welfare scheme, he said it would bankrupt the Government.  He criticised the Workers' Party for saying that the Government should provide unconditional needs-based help.  I would like to seek clarification from the Prime Minister as to what form of help that is going to be.  If it is not going to be unconditional needs-based, is it going to be adhoc or depending on budget surplus?  What happens if there is no budget surplus? The people who need help will perhaps have to fend for themselves.  I hope he would clarify that point.<br>The second point is on fiscal prudence. First of all, I wish to thank the Finance Minister for his detailed explanation as how the Budget is funded.  I noted the funding is actually quite thin in the sense that you do not have very much left.  Practically, this Government is spending almost everything it has accumulated within the term of government.<br>Is he spending too much and having it too thin in terms of the margin that has to be contributed to the national reserves?<br><br>Sir, the fact that the Prime Minister has to explain in detail here how the budget is funded shows that we do not need an Elected President.  What we need is a robust parliamentary democracy and sufficient number of Opposition Members in Parliament.<br><span style="color: red;">Mr Speaker: <strong>Mr Low, there you go again.</strong> </span><br><span style="color: blue;">Mr Low Thia Khiang:</span> It is purely for clarification, Sir.<br><span style="color: red;">Mr Speaker: <strong>Please take your seat</strong>.</span><br><span style="color: blue;">Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong :</span> I want to thank the Prime Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Can I clarify with him about his comments on the funding of the Budget.  Which chapter and clause in the Singapore Constitution states that all land sale proceeds go immediately into the national reserves and should not be reflected in the operating budget?  I think it is the Government's choice of accounting practice and not a constitutional requirement.  Can the Prime Minister clarify on this?<br><span style="color: red;">Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</span> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, Mr Low Thia Khiang asks: unconditional needs-based versus what?  It is versus what we have been doing, where we have many helping hands.  We have ComCare, S&amp;C, U-Save and Progress Package.  We have many schemes to address problems according to their needs.  But unconditional needs-based, that you will all be entitled, do not be afraid to put your hand out.  This is something which should have been debated during the debate, when he made his speech, instead of scoring political points.  Then we can discuss whether it is wise or unwise, how he raises it.  Well, there will be further opportunities for him to do so, I assure him, before the General Election.<br><br>As for funding being thin, let me tell Mr Low that every self-respecting Finance Minister has more than one bottom card and I have not shown him all of my cards yet.<br><br>On Mr Steve Chia's land sale, this is the principle in the White Paper which is settled between the Government and the President, and it has been tabled.  It is not an arbitrary arrangement.  Land is a form of asset.  So when you transform one asset into another, you are not earning something, you are just changing from land to the equivalent amount of money.  The money can come back and become land.  So land is locked up, therefore, the money is locked up.  This is a straightforward matter.  There is no monkey business or anything strange about it.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Is it any surprise that the Speaker of Parliament - managing the debate - seems to be bias towards the Opposition Member of Parliament, while allowing the Ruling Political Party MPs to make speeches ?<br><br>With the Members of Parliament from the Ruling Political Party being allowed to make clarification and distort statements and speeches from the Opposition Party, lies and distortions will go into record of Parliament, while any attempt by the Opposition to challenge those errors and set the record straight will remain unrecorded.<br><br>Can we depend on the Parliamentary Report for any accuracy ?</span></div>
