            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eagle:</div><div class="quote_body">in addition, why would you want complain about foreigners if you cannot compete with them and win? This happens in many countries in the world. It is the basics: the best and the cheapest win.<br><br></div></blockquote>To be fair, the irony of this whole notion is twofold and the two groups must be considered separately to have any sensible discussion (regardless of your stance on this issue). It surely is no rocket science that one realizes skilled labour and unskilled labour are two completely separate entities belonging to two different worlds.<br><br>Skilled labour that is widely coveted (ie. athletes, entertainers, senior management, professionals, executives) very often possess certain expertise and skills which you can't find in an average Joe. Fair enough, these people - who are incidentally also the greatest beneficiaries of globalization - should be commensurated competitively for the expertise they offer which is in short supply in a labour pool. In addition, it certainly makes sense to pay them wages befitting their skill sets. More importantly, it's certainly not this group of foreigners whom the worldwide hordes of anti-globalization protestors are aggrieved with.<br><br>Unskilled labour, on the other hand, very often provides a source of labour that is widely available that the plane Janes are well capable of undertaking. While even the most developed countries implement legislations and policies to facilitate the hiring of such workers, they are often limited to doing so after exhausting its local supply of unskilled labour (as a matter of fact, most of those from the former Eastern bloc working in the developed EU countries are hired on short-term basis). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In addition, by enacting <strong>minimum wage legislations</strong>, such countries often seek to deter the extensive hiring of foreign unskilled labour to ensure that employers, even if given a choice, see no economic sense to do so at the expense of its local labourers.</span></span> That, in essence, is the crux of the issue surrounding the whole notion of hiring foreign unskilled labour (it is worth noting unskilled here does not necessarily refer to illiterates; rather, it's more a matter of whether the local labour pool available is capable of performing the same task). Without sensible policies in place to protect the interests of the locals, why should any commercial entity - whose sole existence conforms with and adheres to economic principles - increase its labour expenses by hiring locals over their cheaper foreign counterparts? This issue is grossly compounded by this regime through its extensively generous legislations and policies that actually support (instead of limit) the hiring of such cheap unskilled labour.<br><br>There are actually some economic dissertations on such issues suggesting models like those adopted by this regime, while beneficial in the short term, is unsustainable in the long run. Obviously, the fact most residents and citizens of this regime (especially the unskilled labour force) are unaware and completely nonchalant about issues like minimum wage or the role of active trade unions with regard to safeguarding their interests would only serve to further advance the interests of this fascist regime.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Even the africans are begging the developed nations to not "steal" their nurses. WHO had to actually make a formal request on their behalf to other countries.<br><br>Another one is actuarial science because it is hard for anyone to pass their exams.<br><br>The third is tradeskills - non university skills - simply because no one wants to do the dirty work.<br><br>The fourth are medical specialists - it is hard to train a doctor in a specialty and to retain doctors there because of the professional indemnity costs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically Singapore's FT policy is just plugging one small hole without plugging the other big hole of local skill drainage and training. It does not value its skilled and experienced workers who can teach the next generation. It will have a flow on effect. Instead it tells older experienced workers to go work at macdonalds or be cleaners after they teach the foreigners how to do work.</div>

Oh it's considered and achievement if you get a great paying job overseas, but it's at the same time disgusting how foreign workers here get our jobs?<br><br>It is not considered an achievement .

A better paying job with better career prospects OR a crap paying job with no prospect at all after you turn 40? I would be interested to know your view.<br><br>Quit going on and on about how they're stealing your jobs. They sacrificed many things to get here. They deserve the jobs if they can do it better than you do. Before you complain, ask yourself if you're willing to do the same, forsaking friends and family and uprooting yourself to work in an unfamiliar environment. If you are, why are you still here?

Doubt that - most have the jobs because they are cheaper and Singapore is a stepping stone to Australia/UK/Europe/USA .<br><br>The ones who get paid the million dollar handshake don't stay around for long.

At least a Singaporean won it and did he get recognition ? yes.....a few decades later.<br><br>How many international scientific breakthrough did an FT made while in Singapore since the FT policy? 0.<br><br>How many international artistic contributions did an FT made while in Singapore since the FT policy? 0 AGAIN.<br><br>So now 0+0+0 = zilch ,zero , nada, nothing.<br><br>For the purposes of FT - we are not including permanent residents or Singapore citizens.<br><br>For the purposes of FT - we are not bringing foreign laborers , i.e. construction workers/maids ,who do menial work - However I do recognise their unrecognised contribution in building Singapore or making the lives of some Singaporeans better.</div><div class="quote_body"></div></blockquote>First of all, pls quote better.

I was there when they started formulating the FT policy . I was in the forums discussing with an MP determined to run around the bush for the FT policy. Where were you?<br><br>As for Singaporean companies favoring foreign talents - lol look at DBS -CEO is a foreigner Jackson Tai who is , I think , is saying bye bye after a million dollar handshake. You don't need a policy on it - you just need to look around and see who is on top of who.<br><br>With all the so called top scholars going overseas under prestigious government scholarships , how come Singapore has to go and look for a foreigner to run DBS or Sentosa?<br><br>With a FT who is the CEO of Sentosa,  the <span style="font-style: italic;">best</span> they can come up with to revive a themepark is a casino resort? Wahahahaha.<br><br>If they recruited such great sport talents from China to become Singaporean citizens, how come no olympic win yet?<br><br>The only reason why American scientists are going to Singapore is because of embryonic research where they can use a day old embryos (whose embryos?) for experimentation. Once another developed country opens up to the idea , you will see them leaving for the next destination.<br><br>Hey if they are supposedly talented and great foreign talents - why don't I see a nobel science prize winner yet?<br><br>While other countries taken in talents that are of international standing , I have not seen any of international FT research or nobel science prize FT winners come out of Singapore yet  .<br><br><strong>I can name you one Singaporean who went on and make it big internationally - Sim Wong Hoo and Creative Technologies . Local grown company who turned into an international brand.

USA takes in some and they turn out to be very successful like some of their own citizens. I have yet to see any good come out of FTs but alot of complaints from educated Singaporeans about their jobs.<br><br>As for NTUC trade union ....<span style="font-style: italic;"> you mean you actually call that a union</span>?

You obviously don't know what trade unions are other than the one you have in Singapore which is not a true trade union.<br><br>A trade union exists to protect the rights and benefits of the workers. Period. Not regulate it.<br><br>And I think your first question is incoherent at best.<br><br>I do not accept lower wages. I am covered by what we call in Australia, a certified agreement, as other local workers - that is also why I never enter a foreign country to work unless I have permanent residency status.<br><br>Those certified agreements are negotiated between the employing organisation and the trade union who represents the workers. So one side negotiates for the employer's benefits and the other negotiates for the workers'  benefits.<br><br>Basically I came to the conclusion that either you know nothing and very naive ,or you are a high school kid on internet access paid for by his/her parents .<br><br>You cannot be a foreign talent because you have no freaking idea of what a trade union is. Right ... trade unions protect against  supply and demand and regulate it....Hahahhaha</div>
