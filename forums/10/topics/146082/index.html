            <div class='col-md body'>Actually all these years the people are not asking the government to distribute free monies to the lazy or the irresponsible.<br><br>People are not that stupid to ask for free lunches but you get ministers talking like people are asking for free lunches.<br><br>What people have been asking is some forms of allocations to relieve temporary setbacks or bad lucks for the unfortunate who fall into prolonged unemployment, the abandoned old and the sick. A certain insurance is what people ask to provide a certain three meals and payment of bills for the unfortunate.<br><br>Unfortunately the government has gone overboard to paint the doom-day scenarios using scare tactics to frighten the people allowing the whole government to accumulate wealth for its own sake going into the reverse - greedy for monies, relentless taxing and recovering costs, accumulating surpluses and keeping all the monies locked up in 30-60 years' reserves as what its favorite NKF was encouraged to do.<br><br>I am sure that while welfarism is bad moneyism is worse. The government using this kind of scare tactics has become uncaring of people's unfortunate occurrences not of their own choice.<br><br>Limitations and conditions actually can be appropriately set to prevent any welfarism from taking root. Now by outwitting people on welfare scare the worse is heppening - government worship money for its own sake.<br><br>So the government is caring for people's wellbeing using scare tactics to allow it to go on taxing and privatising essential services to create more surpluses and more reserves.<br><br>So this is how the government is building all its world class surpluses and building 30-60 years' reserves - the best government in the world.<br>_______________</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we cannot blame this complain mentality, and nor is it such a uniquely singaporean trait. People act and react to things and how they react can be in various forms of expressions. Complaining is just a lazy excuse and another form of expression to promote the status quo...and hopefully, life goes on as the saying goes... this 'complain' mentality stems largely from the paternistic style of government that has conditioned many to believe the government as their father or some worship idol status. Interestingly, I knew of an old folk who bought many books written by a certain minister and proudly displaying it in his living room cabinet like some godly bible or statue that can ward off evil. Years later, he took them away and junk them all to the garang guni man. he didnt complain. well, that is his form of expression. But many forget that it is the people who elect their government to power, entitlement and all say, so they should do their jobs and make sure things don't go wrong. And because of our culture, one should be a respectful bowing yes man subject to every decree that is passed may just make things worse. No questions asked or you will be sued till your pants drop. It is not typical of Singaporeans per se, but it so happens that since independence, many have struggled hard for economic success and few have ever questioned about other issues (even those that affect economic well being) until certain policies don't quite work out and the so called 'elites' are unable to find the right solutions. the everyday person, feeling lost and more than betrayed will just have to express all their frustrations. While the latter feels that all the time they have been charting the course and making all the decisions, the former has no right to question. This unwritten rule will further widen the distrust. Participation is a genuine 2 way process. If it is just a token speech, there is no point.  And all along, 'Complain', 'whining' etc becomes a general speak that brainwashes'the public into thinking that it is something bad and you should rather keep your mouth shut, study hard, question no authority, make money and see how you can practically pay up your loans for that pigeon hole flat and whatever COEs. Complains can be opinions and some being rather factual problems but they are usually quashed by 'majority' who feels that Singaporeans should not even raise a sound or talk about those in power. This has led to an extremely low political awareness to the point that if some one were to even stage a talk or event on capital punishment, outdated laws or human rights, many will generalize these as anti-government radicals.  Just like there must be conflict before it becomes constructive, and when these become constructive, a change must be put in place. If the voice stops there, there is no follow through to the process of legitimate change in place and indeed if Singapore were to catch up with the rest of the world and be truely global, it will not reach that stage. It is no point practising a leadership style that consults but already has a decision engineered by a privvy few even before it is raised by others. So, same thing goes for criticism.  The schools have already incalcated the young very well into conformation e.g. obedient, follow the rules, memorize your text etc. Good things, but not to the extreme. As can be seen, the single minded pursuit to be no.1 in everything and anything has its shortcomings, e.g. 'let our zen quash that ipod' challenge only brings disappointment because one is being so focused about a target and having just a one track mind would lead one oblivious to other issues and the outside world. Or if women are getting so focused in their careers that they sacrifice in terms of even finding a date when they hit 40.  Hence, even if some characteristics are good, it must not be too good for its own sake.  Same for being questioning. The problem occurs when an individual fears that even a silent whisper/criticism will be quashed with such retribution that he begins to think that the fault must lie solely with the individual. So, complaining is still at a far behind 'safe' stage, because it is figured that few will act but the result is nothing will be changed and so, it is celebrated as a form of 'harmony'. If one begins to feel like a 'dog', it is dangerous as it could signal higher discontent and possible revolt, and one must be careful which direction to tread and whether any herd mentality makes sense, like those you see in political rallies or religious events with sing-song rara hold your hands that gets participant's emotions all worked up. some dogs will bark but dont bite, while some quiet dogs just bite and very viciously too. and there will be other dogs that look for ways to seek for better master. so barking dogs are more preferred, but if it is let to bark too long, it becomes hungry and quiet, and then it is time to fear.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ndsef:</div><div class="quote_body">No offence Drawer...

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh by the way ndsef,I dont think India has arise as a many investment opportunites country.Our ministers say so just to "ball-carrying" those India ministers......I remember not long ago,those Indians even chase out the western fast food company.From the way i look at it,Those Indians have a very strong resistance to foreign investment.<br>Another thing is that u say Taiwan government are more worse than HK government n Singapore government n dont care about their ppl.That i also disagree.Becoz now Taiwan is a very democratic country(or we call it area).If the ruling party neglect the demand of their ppl,they will definitely get kick out by the Taiwanese in General election.<br>And from what i saw in Taiwan news,their leaders always first timing show their concern to their ppl when there is a disasters strike,like earthquake or typhoon.Unlike Singapore leaders,when Nicoll highways collaspe,our dear former PM Goh n the Lees family never show their face.They sent some low ranked ministers to check the incident first then "slowly take their time to show up" n talk rubbish!!!<br>Lastly,Singaporeans are not "domestic dogs" who depend too much on the government.Actually is vice versa,it is our government who depend on us too much by taxing heavily on us becoz they have lost alot of money in foreign investment plans.</div>
