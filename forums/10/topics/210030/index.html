Over-promoting foreign investments led to killing of our own domestic sector of the economy. Over-academic pursuit led to neglect in grooming future business leaders and entrepreneurs.<br><br>So many people have neglected their other more worthwhile pursuits in life which are many more than a piece of paper. Today we must be one country where people went wholesale into pursuing degrees for the sake of degrees and trying to win the recognition rather than improvements in the practical sense.<br><br>Seeing this as the danger, I for one have posted not numerous feedbacks to the Feedback Unit back in 2002 pointing out the greater importance of pursuing practical knowledge application. I suggested the Singapore should learn from smaller European countries like Finland and Denmark how they excelled in broad-based education which created many good enterprises and world products.<br><br>I suggested that people should instead merely trying to go for higher academic degrees develop entrepreneurial knowledge application to prepare themselves to go into business. I cited the examples of many poly students becoming entrepreneurs because of such practical knowledge application as part of their training.<br><br>I also informed Spring during seminars that skill retraining over the past years did not seem to raise productivity or efficiency. It was admitted by Spring that the past training courses did not seem to have achieved the desried results.<br><br>I predicted then that Singapore was going to become a nation of educated unemployed or under-employed.<br><br>How true was that prediction. Today many of my advice to Feedback Unit had come true as predicted. We have produced many educated people unable to find suitable jobs or joining the rank of unemployed with the government not being willing to admit there is such a problem as usual.<br><br>Still the newspapers are reporting how quickly graduates are being snapped up by the employers when so many more remained unemployed for prolonged period.<br><br>It is another sad situation where government is causing big problems by their conceptual policies which did not work for yearfs.<br><br>The root of the problem is self-centredness, where mistakes made were denied and ministers refuse to admit problems like has happened in the NKF.<br><br>This is precisely the reason why many of the past policies need to be thrown out of the window and let new leaders come up with better solutions without any further delays.</div>
