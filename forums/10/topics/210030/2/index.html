            <div class='col-md body'>Why are so many new graduates unemployed ?<br><br>Why are so many highly educated work force out of jobs?<br><br>With such unemployment, can we afford not to lower costs of doing business and increase attractions to our own people to start their own small businesses?<br><br>As far as I can see, the present government's pro-foreign investment and employment policy is just a smokescreen based on its claim that foreigners would come in to create jobs and help lift the local's employment prospect.<br><br>There is no independent study to verify that this claim is true, and it will not cause unemployment problems among the locals.<br><br>With so many policies and decisions in the past causing so many problems as posted in the "20 major government policy errors", one could see that it is bad for government to push such policy again withut substantiation down the throat of the people.<br><br>There should be no judgmental or creative accounting method of presenting what look good and avoiding mention of problems.<br><br>Until such government claim is properly presented, citizens could only take it with a pinch of salt that it will be good as claimed.<br><br>This type of leadership and government is still the old-style "we know best" approach adopted by the past leaders which might be the cause of our losing out in economic competitiveness, dropping of wages and increasing high cost problems since the 1970s.<br><br>I could only see the jobs being taken away as all kinds of foreigners are coming in to occupy all the businesses and positions locals could handle.<br><br>Just because government needs to approve foreigners' applications for starting similar businesses here must government be the one to succeed in its invitation game while local are edged out and becoming unemployed by large number.<br><br>If the foreign talents we want are categorized and identified, at least the whole policy will become more transparent and we can see it will not cause problems to locals.<br><br>Majority of local businesses are not doing well. Give them a chance to succeed by changing the government present pro-big pro-foreign procurement policy and local businesses will become vibrant again.<br><br>About the only talents we badly need now is heavy-weight foreign-talent ministers who have better ideas how to transform the economy to value-adding technology-start-up and knowledge-application model and some specialist scientists and engineers.<br><br>The government now only generalize its claim that foreigners will do a better job in existing investments and existing jobs locals are doing.<br><br>Let the ministers tell us with facts and figures which special categories of foreign talents we need and not generalise and open up all businesses and employment liberally to all foreigners just to save a few dollars.<br><br>In the long run, there is a social costs incurred by foreigners which should be factored in as we can see in the great number of study mamas working as moonlighting masseues in AMK and many estates.<br><br>Show facts and figures and not presumed all major policies will work by just making top-down announcement with no chance for locals to ask questions.<br>Back to top<br></div>
