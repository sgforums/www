In Feb 2002, I telephoned them to see how things were going and they told me the book had been withdrawn from sale as "someone" had objected. It took me until July to finally locate a Kinokuniya manager who told me that Helen Yeo was the person who objected to the book.<br><br>2) I figured out that the book had appeared in this forum through our website access logs.<br><br>3) I am no longer a resident of Singapore, but live in Arizona.<br><br>4)I have no worry about being sued in the Singapore courts. There is nothing defamatory in the book. What we published on the website (after Helen Yeo's attack) was NOT in the book, but it is much worse for her. We held back in the book which was checked over by three US lawyers prior to publication.<br>Naturally, if Helen Yeo were to sue in Singapore, she would win. To collect a judgement, she would have to apply to the court in Arizona. She would then learn that WE have already filed a lawsuit against her in the US District Court of Arizona. Helen Yeo, if she appears legally in the US, would then have to face a jury trial in Arizona.<br><br>5) Yes, I am amazed that one person can unilaterally ban a book and have it thrown out of Singapore's National Library, as well. This may, however, backfire on Helen Yeo. The book has been read by CJ Yong, and three members of LKY's immediate family (so far as we know). Only Helen Yeo has objected.<br><br>6) Thanks for wishing us good luck, and we hope you enjoy reading the <a href="http://www.escapefromparadise.com/NewFiles/bc2.html" rel="nofollow">URL Escape from Paradise Body Count</a>.<br><br>John<br></div>

From what I know the figure being unofficially bandied about for the 2001 GE was 30% of the electorate voting. 3 million voters? Nowhere near, CX<br><br>The fault of the opposition for the FUBAR state they're in now? Maybe, but I think only the most blinkered among us here would put the blame for the state of the opposition on their own doorstep. They cannot be absolved of the blame, but at the same time you cannot say the there exists anywhere near a level playing field in Singapore.<br><br>Which of course, really makes one wonder that if the ruling party is as good as they are, why not make it a real fair fight, and "may the best man win"?<br><br>But then, we know better....<br><br>You said<br><strong>blame yourself for not stepping out and making yourself heard for fear of being clamped down like the rest. Blame yourselves for lacking the will and the courage to face change. </strong><br><br>Is that not being done here right now? Ineffective as here is, if theres a more effective means to do so, I will gladly.<br><br><strong>u want to be the passive majority that hates it but can't and don't want to do anything, then u're better off gone.</strong><br><br>I wanted to, but for<br><br>1) My constituency was not contested. It used to be a opposition hotbed but surprise surprise, it became a 5-man GRC last time round<br><br>2) The powers-that-be, using the extremely lame(understatement for want of a stronger word) excuse of post 9/11 terrorism fear, happily jumped on the chance and took away my(and all overseas Singaporean's) overseas vote. Just because I'm overseas pursuing a degree to contribute to my own, and hopefully my country's, well-being does not make me any less Singaporean or deserving of a vote than you or any other Singaporean.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Atobe, you are a very angry person. Calm down a little. You're also very paranoid. The government has been very receptive to criticism, especially in the last decade. There are many NMPs, civic leaders and NGOs that routinely question and criticize policy without repercussion. It is disruption and insolence that the PAP cannot abide.<br><br>The PAP is not perfect, but the question is whether there is a superior alternative. They, along with the civil service they have created to serve them, do extremely well with the resources and limitations they are under. The only government run better is the Canadian government, IMHO. Don't criticize a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes.<br><br>If you're not happy with the PAP's policies, do something about it! Enter the political arena. You can do it the easy way, by joining the PAP and working from within. They welcome all comers. You can do it the hard way by being in the opposition. You can do it from the side by being a civic or grassroots leader and/or contributing to fora and talkback sessions. You can do it from above by writing actively about Singapore, as this lady has done. Don't just sit here and complain!<br><br>The only thing worse than the PAP's high-handedness is the average Singaporean's smug apathy. It's easy to complain. It's easy to criticize policy, especially after the fact, when hindsight is 20-20. The government does not have the luxury of knowing "what if". They have to act and live with the consequences.<br><br>The only thing that makes the "elite" elite is that they are willing to act. Look at the people in Parliament. They aren't all scholars and highly educated people. Many are simply businessmen or working class individuals. What seperates them from you and me? You might be cynical and claim that the difference is their willingness to lick the PAP's boots. I think the difference is that they were willing to do anything at all, which is a hell of a lot more than the average Singaporean.<br><br>About Chee in particular, I feel that he had his time in the sun and squandered it. The skillful use of the by-election effect won him a lot of legitimacy, if not necessarily seats in Parliament. Obtaining nearly 50% of the "popular vote" (in contested districts only) gave him and the opposition a voice.<br><br>However, he never had anything useful to say. He turned out to be nothing more than a complainer. He had no agenda. He had no direction for the nation. His only goal was to act as a hinderance to the PAP, whether it made sense or not. He rarely had an alternative for the policies he attacked in Parliament, and what he had never stood up to scrutiny. He turned out to just be an angry and paranoid guy. I was not very surprised when his public infighting with other opposition members gutted the opposition from within. Singapore has given up on this man.<br><br>JBJ and Low Thia Khiang (heck even Tan Liang Hong) were more credible opposition. At least they had some message, even if I disagreed with them. At least they represented a CHOICE for Singaporeans, rather than a non-choice like Chee and the SDP in general. Now he is reduced to sniping from the sidelines -- still without a vision for the nation. Sad.</div>

Secondly, having tamed the Civil Service, the Ruling Elite place their own Appointees that are politically inclined towards themselves.<br><br>This is repeated throughout the entire system of government Â– from those in the First Line of Control and Command, to the Second and Third Lines of Support and Administration Â– in the important Justice Department, Legal Service, Police Force, Military, Statutory Boards, Foreign Service, GLCÂ’s, GICÂ’s, PA, PWD, PUB, PSA, Universities, Institutions, and any other Government Departments that are part of the machinery to run SGP.<br><br>The danger of such a system is that when a popularly elected Opposition Party ever comes into Government, its performance will be sabotaged at every turn.<br><br>Can these Â“Political AppointeesÂ” be mature enough to act as independent and disinterested apolitical animals to listen and obey the commands of a New Political Master?<br><br>Or will they only act to hamper, delay, disrupt, obstruct, confuse, and leak information to the ex-Ruling Elites who have been voted out of office?<br><br>This is unlike the scene acted out in Taiwan, when the long established Kuomintang Party was shockingly kicked out of office, and a much-ridiculed Opposition Party was voted into Office; and the Political Appointees in the various command structure of the Government Machineries began to act their role.<br><br>If our previous First Elected President could not make any headway to learn of the Â‘extent of the hidden wealthÂ’ that belongs to SGP, what else can we expect of this Ruling Elites that insist on behaving in secretive ways.<br><br>The events that were finally revealed by the First Elected President was surprising, considering that he was elected to office by popular mandate, and whose role was to guard the one of the Two Keys that access the SGP Reserves.<br><br>Those events should serve as a wake-up call but for a controlled press that remain muted.<br><br>It is surprising that in the GIC, its Chairman is not the current PM, but remained with our SM (who was the previous PM), and a DPM is on the Board of Directors.<br><br>Will this same set up be repeated when Goh steps down and become an SM, and the present SM steps out of political life?<br><br>Will Goh as the next SM become the next Chairman of the GIC, and the next DPM becomes a member of the Board; or will the new PM take over again the Chairmanship of the GIC because of the surname being common to the stronger of the founding fathers of SGP?<br><br>Is this country the sole preserve of only one family?<br><br>What will happen when this one family tree dries up, and cannot throw up the next successor to provide Â“leadershipÂ” in the successive decades of this country's existence?<br><br>Can the system of Government be allowed to continue to function based on the present set up where Political Appointee run the entire machinery?<br><br>The System of Government must begin to evolve where it is answerable to the Public that it serves, and where any Political Party that forms the Government will be served by the System of Government that is Politically Blind, and only exist to serve the Citizen and the Government that it elects.<br><br>This country cannot belong only to the Elites.<br><br></div>

You can do it the easy way, by joining the PAP and working from within. They welcome all comers. You can do it the hard way by being in the opposition. You can do it from the side by being a civic or grassroots leader and/or contributing to fora and talkback sessions. You can do it from above by writing actively about Singapore, as this lady has done. Don't just sit here and complain!<br><br>Do the PAP members have any say of what the PAP Elites are doing?<br><br>The PAP system is a reflection of the political system that they have established for SGP Â– that being a 2 tier system; one for the Ordinary Members, and the other for the Elites.<br><br>The Ordinary Members of the PAP have no voting power to influence the outcome of the selection of any person to the role of Elite Appointees. They exist like cows in the field, only to produce milk and beef, and unlike the real cows in the cattle farm, they do not have the privilege to produce any offsprings for the bull stud.<br><br>Quote:<br>Â”The only thing that makes the "elite" elite is that they are willing to act. Look at the people in Parliament. They aren't all scholars and highly educated people. Many are simply businessmen or working class individuals. What seperates them from you and me? You might be cynical and claim that the difference is their willingness to lick the PAP's boots. I think the difference is that they were willing to do anything at all, which is a hell of a lot more than the average Singaporean.Â”<br><br>Those that enter Parliament is but just one cut above the average Citizens, but are they the Â“Ruling EliteÂ”?<br><br>Here again the 2 tier system also exit in Parliament.<br><br>Do the Ruling Elite listen to them at all?<br><br>Yes, having entered Parliament is only half a step closer to the Â“Ruling EliteÂ”, but when the talk stops, and the voting begins; are the votes cast in Parliament according to the personÂ’s conscience in representing honestly the electorate, or submitting themselves to the rules of voting as imposed by Party Politics of the Ruling Elite?<br><br>Can anyone make any serious contribution towards positive change for SGP by joining the Ruling Party?<br><br>Some of the Public Figures in office today, are singing a different tune from that sung in their youth and as common citizens.<br><br>This is largely due to their Animal Instinct to survive in this Political Jungle.<br><br>Quote:<br>Â”About Chee in particular, I feel that he had his time in the sun and squandered it. The skillful use of the by-election effect won him a lot of legitimacy, if not necessarily seats in Parliament. Obtaining nearly 50% of the "popular vote" (in contested districts only) gave him and the opposition a voice.Â”<br><br>Â”JBJ and Low Thia Khiang (heck even Tan Liang Hong) were more credible opposition. At least they had some message, even if I disagreed with them. At least they represented a CHOICE for Singaporeans, rather than a non-choice like Chee and the SDP in general. Now he is reduced to sniping from the sidelines -- still without a vision for the nation. Sad.Â”<br><br>You are comparing the personalities of two different generations with different experiences.<br><br>Chee is in his early 30Â’s, while JBJ and Tan Liang Hong are beyond 60Â’s; Low Thia Khiang is older then Chee by another 10 years.<br><br>If age is the measure of wisdom, give Chee the opportunity to be hit a few more times, and he will learn.<br><br>Even Einstein did not realize his full potential until much later in his years.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u bore me. u just keep harping on the same point.<br><br>yes, i know how the PAP came into power and stayed in power. i don't need a crash course on that.<br><br>u can't change that. they're already entrenched. complaining and bitterness won't help.<br><br>i do not think that chee has been slimed by sph any more than he has let himself be slimed.<br><br>i distincty remember last year's election fiasco. i happened to be having dinner at hougang that night. the coffeshop was showing the news and there was chee screaming his head off at the PM...<br><br>the table next to me (consisting of retirees and 30-40 somethings chugging beer) cheered at the outburst... then sank into a more private conversation about how absolutely "KAM LAN" that outburst was cos he's just gonna get sued again.<br><br>it doesn't take very astute political observers and very sophisticated sense of hindsight to tell that this man is not weighing the consequences of his actions.<br><br>Atobe,<br>be objective. i'm no big fan of SPH publications. and SPH did not slime him the day after that outburst. it was reported, refuted and rebutted by the PM and the whole thing was phrased in rather calm and detached language.<br><br>the point is, people were already laughing their heads off at his stupidity hours after the outburst (and hougang is no PAP stronghold).</div>
