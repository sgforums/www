            <div class='col-md body'>the GST is not much, forget about it.<br><br>and you can't just reduce land prices as and when you like, 1st of all it would cause the country to lose all the trust built up over the years. who the hell would wanna put money into a place where the govt will just say ok the land price today will be $10 as and when they like?<br><br>2ndly, you don't seem to understand economics very much. property is an asset that companies use to replace cold hard cash. it is with these properties that is used as a bargaining chip to get banks to loan them money, so that should they ever fail to repay the loans, the bank would take the land, sell it, and return them the remainder.<br><br>by reducing prices all of a sudden would turn the entire economy upside down. what would happen to those people who bought homes over a 1-20yrs loan period? and home owners are just the small fry, what about MNCs with loads of freehold land? what about all those buildings in the CBD? instantly reduced to a supermarket sale?<br><br>in the invisible long run, it might be helpful, but the devastation brought about in the visible and all too tangible short term would cripple us beyond any hope of salvation.</div>

Its worth $1 when the government has to buy it back. All that talk about benefiting when the MRT runs through it, bollocks!

Worse, it hides behind the argument that its doing what it's doing for the peoples and countrys sake and it just so happens that its coffers benefit at the same time.<br><br>Join the club Azrael and the Bear, my wife and me have decided on moving to Melbourne eventually, it has its pros and cons like everywere else but I guess to us its pros are more important to us than Singapore's.
