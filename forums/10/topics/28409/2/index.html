            <div class='col-md body'>Come on lah, just look at their objectives and you know which is more pro<br><br>SDP<br>____________________________________________________-<br><br>SDP's 5-Point Economic Plan For Singapore<br><br>Local as well as international experts are saying that SingaporeÂ’s economy cannot continue to grow under the present set of PAP policies of depending so heavily on MNCs and GLCs. The present recession is a manifestation of the economic direction taken by the PAP. To alleviate the problems that confront the economy, the SDP proposes two sets of solutions for the immediate term (next 1-2 years) and the longer-term (within the next 5 years).<br><br>Immediate Term<br><br>Many Singaporeans have been retrenched or have seen their wages cut because of the recession. Under the present system these workers have little financial protection when they are retrenched. Adding to the worsening situation is the PAP's ill-conceived foreign talent policy. To remedy the situation, the SDP proposes:<br><br>Â•  A minimum wage policy. The DOS has reported that while Singapore's GDP per capita income is $23,000, its wage structure is closer to that of the Third World. Such an economic arrangement is not good for long-term growth. Ensuring a minimum wage for the lowest of the low-skilled employee guarantees that prosperity is shared by all. Legislation is needed to prevent Singaporean workers from being exploited and ensure that employees be paid fair wages for their work commensurate with the cost of living. For a start, the minimum wage should be set at $5 per hour.<br><br>Â•  Retrenchment entitlements. Presently when a worker gets retrenched, he or she is left out in the cold with no financial protection. This cause severe strain on the entire family with serious social repercussions. Under the SDP proposal, the Government will pay all retrenched workers their full salary for the first six months. This amount would be reduced to 75 percent during the next six months, and further reduced to 50 percent in the third six months. Each worker will be allowed to reject only up to three job offers in the one-and-a-half years following which the retrenchment entitlement ceases. Such a scheme will provide workers a cushion when they are retrenched while at the same time encourage them to seek employment.<br><br>Â•  Singaporeans First Policy. The PAP's foreign talent policy adds to the burden of Singaporeans by indiscriminately allowing foreigners to seek employment here. The SDP will push for a Singaporeans First Policy, which will insist that employers retrench foreign workers first and only lay off Singaporean workers as a last resort. In addition such a policy will require the Government and employers to employ foreigners only if locals cannot be found for the job. This will ensure that only qualified foreigners will be allowed into Singapore.<br><br>Longer-term<br><br>To ensure long-term, sustainable economic growth, the SDP proposes the following:<br><br>Â• Scale back GLCs. Pretend as they might, GLCs cannot provide, much less sustain, economic development in Singapore. They must be dismantled and, in their place, local private companies must be allowed to surface and be given the chance to compete internationally, with the government playing only a supporting role. The SDP advocates that, with the exception of PSA and SIA, the Government privatises all other GLCs within the next five years. Every year the PAP drags its feet is every year Singapore loses its ability to compete at the international level.<br><br>Â• Protect local companies from MNCs. If Singapore is going to assist local private companies in becoming more competitive it must wean itself away from dependence on MNCs. Many countries have strengthened their economies without the MNC crutch. Asia abounds with examples, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Where MNCs are permitted in these countries, they are also given attractive financial incentives. These incentives are, however, clearly spelled out, as are agreements as to what and how technology transfer is to take place. Today Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan boast corporations that have become world-beaters in technology and innovation. In Singapore, however, reliance on MNCs has consigned the people to an economic system that breeds more model employees than visionary entrepreneurs. This means that Singapore will forever be at the mercy of foreign investors on the lookout for cheaper wages.<br>_____________________________________________________<br><br>You judge for yourself.By ousting the MNC. what would happen to Singapore?Imagine the government under the SDP booting out the shell and Bp petroleum in tuas in an attempt to "Protect local companies "<br>We need those foreign investments.Thus his plans are fudlementally flawed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow,<br><br>take a break of one day from SGforums for exams, and come back to find all my points being spelled out.<br><br>Thanks for the eloquent post Atobe, you've said all that I've wanted to say.<br><br>The only part I've disagreed with is the SDP formula for retrenchment benefit. Full pay for the first 6 months is too generous, and should take into account that almost always, retrenchment of workers will have retrenchment benefits. I would suggest a formula of 50% pay for the 1st 6 months followed by 35% for the next 6.<br><br>Agree with your point that all to frequently, the PAP, with the complicity of the media, allow real issues to become trivialised. A good example is the recent debate on bar-top dancing. The original issue was on greater individual responsibilites and freedom of expression, with bar top dancing cited as an example.Over time, this degenerated into debate on bar-top dancing alone, side-tracking from the big picture. And of course, we all know what came out of it...<br><br>CX and CenturionMBT, theres nothing wrong with establishing a Singaporeans First policy. Nobody is calling for a "Foreigners Out" campaign, neither do we want to keep globalistion out of Singapore. We realise the importance of foreign contributions to our economy, and we should welcome real foreign talent who bring skills that are not available in Singapore. What worries me is the over-reliance on so-called "talents" which are nothing but cheaper labour thats edging Singaporeans from jobs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back when this thread began, it was about the book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Escape from Paradise</span>, and more specifically perhaps the page at <a href="http://www.escapefromparadise.com/NewFiles/bc.html" rel="nofollow"> http://www.escapefromparadise.com/NewFiles/bc.html]</a> referring to the unilateral banning of the book by Helen Yeo, wife of Yeo Cheow Tong.<br>In the greater scheme of things, the fact that this book was banned is a small matter. However through this small incident, Singapore is needlessly making a bad name for itself. (Although an American, I am very pro-Singapore, even pro LKY.)<br><br>Another unnecessary (<strong>and much more important</strong>) incident which will have a negative impact on Singapore is the imprisoning of Chee Soon Juan. Although I do not agree with Chee's politics, I disagree with his imprisonment. Even for diplomatic reasons Chee should not have been imprisoned. It makes a bad impression on Singapore, and can cause <strong>potential economic damage.</strong><br><br>Any foreigner who reads Chee's letter written from prison will draw from it a very negative picture of Singapore, and a picture which is largely undeserved.<br><br>You be the judge. Here is the text of Chee's letter, which I received on 14 November:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Dear friends and supporters,<br><br>This is just a note to thank all of you for your support and help over the last few weeks while I was in prison. I am doing well although I have lost some weight as I was ill for the initial part of my incarceration. I want to give you a glimpse of prison life in Singapore and to highlight some deep concerns I have about the justice system here.<br><br>I shared a tiny cell (6ft by 15 ft) with two other inmates and a toilet bowl, the squatting kind. I ate and slept Â– at nose level Â– the entire 5 weeks beside a latrine. I was fortunate as other cells had four inmates crammed into an even smaller cell. The cell is completely bare except for a small window near the ceiling, which allows natural light into room; an awning covers the window so that one cannot see the sky. The wardens peer into the cell through a tiny slit on the solid metallic door, which entombs the cell.<br><br>WeÂ’re given a straw mat to sleep on the concrete floor (there are no bunk beds like you see on TV) and a plastic box containing two small blankets, toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, toilet paper, a small pail, a drinking mug, and a face towel. Water is provided during meal times. Because of the heat and humidity, inmates flush the toilets and use their pails to collect extra water for washing, cooling down and even drinking.<br><br>There is Â“yard timeÂ” an hour a day for exercise and showers. WeÂ’re locked in for the rest of the 23 hours. Breakfast is brought in at about eight, lunch at noon and dinner between 3 and 4 oÂ’clock in the afternoon. The meals are adequate except that by nightfall inmates get hungry because dinner is eaten so early.<br><br>I spent a couple of nights in the sick bay when I was ill. The Â“bedsÂ” have no mattresses, just a metal plate with holes throughout on which you tried your best to make yourself comfortable. Our ankles are chained to the bed-post. Some prisoners even had both ankles and a wrist cuffed to the bed-frame.<br><br>At night if one needs to answer the call of nature, one is given a small pail to urinate into. With one ankle chained to the bed, it takes some skill (and not a little bit of contortion) to manoeuvre into a position where you could bring the bucket onto the bed and kneel over it to ease yourself.<br><br>In prison, minutes seem like hours and hours like days. You long to be free and be with family and friends again. DonÂ’t get me wrong, I am not complaining. I accept willingly the punishment because in doing so, I want to demonstrate the nature of the ruling party in Singapore and seek to help it mend its undemocratic ways.<br><br>While I donÂ’t have complaints, I do, however, have major concerns:<br><br>Hundreds of prisoners comprising men from China, Thailand, Indonesia, Burma, South Asia, etc. who are caught for overstaying in Singapore after their work visas have expired. I witnessed what seemed like an endless row of new inmates all squatting, head shorn and clutching their straw mats and plastic boxes, waiting to be introduced to their cells.<br><br>They all looked bewildered and terrified. Why wouldnÂ’t they? A minimum of three strokes of the rotan awaited them (the number depended on how long they overstayed in the country). Caning in Singapore is a barbaric act where trained personnel (some say the caners are trained exponents of the martial arts) slash a six-foot long, one-inch thick cane, across the hapless victimsÂ’ buttocks. The individualÂ’s ankles are strapped onto a heavy, metal frame and they bend forward where their wrists are similarly locked, with only their naked backsides exposed.<br><br>I was told by some of the inmates that the screams of the victims after each stroke of the whip makes one lose all appetite for food. The cane breaks skin and draws blood. Doctors are on hand to administer treatment and to assess if the individual can take more punishment. A maximum of 24 strokes is the legal limit and only males below 50 years of age can be whipped.<br><br>I shared my first night (inmates are rotated in different cells on a regular basis) with a 45-year-old guy from China. His face turned ashen when he told me of his impending ordeal under the rotan. My heart sank further when he told me that many men in his plight leave their countries out of desperation in search of a livelihood. Many are not aware of mandatory caning rule in Singapore.<br><br>Our short conversation ended when he lay back on his mat and stared blankly at the ceiling. I then thought of Michael Fay, the American teenager who was caned by the Singapore government for vandalising (spray-painting) cars. The situation then caused a furore in the United States. It was over one individual. But now, only silence greet the thousands who have been whipped, and continue to be whipped, for their Â“criminalÂ” acts. The pain is just as excruciating for Fay as it is for these overstayers. The only difference is the colour of their skin.<br><br>I also saw a couple of inmates who were imprisoned under the Criminal Law Temporary Provisions Act, a law that empowers the government to detain a suspect when it is unable to secure a conviction in open court. The detention order is signed by the minister and is valid for a period of two years. It is also renewable so that a suspect can be detained indefinitely, much like the Internal Security Act used for the ruling partyÂ’s opponents.<br><br>Â“Dr Chee, I want to commit suicide,Â” one of the detainees whispered to me when I paused outside his cell. Â“I canÂ’t take it. I donÂ’t know when I am going to be released and I canÂ’t get a trial.Â” He, like the rest of his fellow criminal law detainees, is kept singly in isolation cells.<br><br>If my imprisonment can bring the international spotlight to bear on the economic, social, and political injustice that prevails in Singapore, then every minute that I spent in jail was worth it. If pressure can be brought to bear on the Singapore government by our friends in democratic countries and international organisations, and so doing help us in our struggle for freedom, human rights and democracy, then I would without a momentÂ’s hesitation step into that cell again.<br><br>But change must ultimately come from us Singaporeans. And if we, by daring greatly, attempt to restore justice and democracy to our country, our current sacrifices would more than compensate for our future successes. For success will come, it is only a question of when and how.<br><br>Once again, I thank you all for your support and concern. I am well. Unfortunately, it is democracy in Singapore that is not.<br><br>Sincerely yours,<br><br>Chee Soon Juan</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your views on the state of politics in England, Germany and France is insightful, and I will agree with you that their respective population and political process have certainly evolved into a level of maturity that is to be admired for its tolerance towards alternative views, acceptance to the changes of political fortunes with good grace, and with institutions that independently protect the political process.<br><br>While Singapore has always prided itself as taking the Â“Best from the West and the EastÂ”, its selection process was more self-serving to the perpetuation of the political power of the Elected Political Party forming the Government of the day.<br><br>What took the European political process a few centuries to evolve, Singapore political process has reached to near Â“similar standardsÂ” in Governance of the people, but not in the political process.<br><br>The Singapore Citizens remained politically disenfranchised, and its present status have been deliberately preserved for the sake of the continued grip on political power by the present Ruling Political Party that has entrenched itself since 1950Â’s.<br><br>The early generations of Singapore, before the Japanese soldiers Â“liberatedÂ” Singapore, were certainly not interested in the politics of governance Â– with the exception of a few educated ones.<br><br>However, those Â“AsiansÂ” in Singapore who saw the Japanese Army defeating and then belittling the proud Caucasians Colonials Masters, also saw the awakening of their sense of controlling their own Political Future; and this fire had sparked during the days immediately after the end of WW2 in Europe and Asia.<br><br>With the declaration of independence in India, and followed by Indonesia, the eyes of Asia were roused from deep slumber.

They can prolong reaching that point by unfair measures tat exploit the poor countries while making the rich countries richer, however one fine day tat point will still be reached. Tat is why communists sounds so attractive to people in the past. Maxist is wrong about communist but he is right about our economy.<br><br>Then about policies in Singapore... I can only say my mum will rather I worked as a cleaner than be an opposition member. Why ? Because the gov is clamping so hard on oppositionto the point of perversity. Look at Potong Pasir, how many years have they gone into decay ? Gov don't give them upgrade, don't give them good infrastructure just because an opposition party win at tat location ? Is tat fair ? Did they not pay tax or live as Singaporean ? Why the discrimination ? Why, in every election, some opposition will certainly be sue and certainly lose the case and cetainly slap with a heavy fine or jail ? Why does PAP have the right to attack opposition character such as being chinese chauvinists while the opposition is accused of libel just for very mild statement.<br><br>One can ask, why need opposition ? It is because absolute power corrupts absolutely. They can do something so incredibly unfair such as redraw the constituents map, set all the rules for election, changing the years people can go to vote, increase their OWN PAY etc. Wat makes u think they won't do something like doing something tat benefits themselves only or sacrificing singaporean for foreign companies ? Wat is the difference between British colony if tat is the case, seems policy is for their own private interest ? Anyway I can only say tat their high pay r considered LEGAL Corruption. Those tat joing political arena should have strong belief to improve life of people, not because they r motivated by high pay.<br><br>This is one improvement I can see for our gov is. Fight a fair battle. Stop all those 'I sue u, u sue me' kinda of monkey business. If u want to be a politician, u have to be criticised. Don't shows us wat a spoilt brat u r tat can't stand criticism. U can't force respect just by shutting our mouths.<br><br>About Chee jail business... I can only say tat jail is not a holiday chalet resort. However though sometimes silly as he seems, I have to say he has a strong morale courage to take up arms against gov. I have no such courage and hide behind a monitor secretly complaining about gov.</div>
