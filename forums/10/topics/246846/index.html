Again, there's a complex formula for determining the pension amount, with a cap of "two-thirds of the highest annual salary of any office" held by the individual in question.<br><br>The shocker was momentarily revealed in June 2004 - though the mainstream media did not highlight it then nor have they since. That was when an opposition MP asked then deputy prime minister Lee Hsien Loong whether it was true that a "serving minister who turns 55 actually receive[s] both salary and pension at the same time". Lee, in answer, said yes. There are currently eight cabinet ministers aged 55 and above, including Lee himself.<br><br>Alex Au is an independent social and political commentator, freelance writer and blogger based in Singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aww..that is Meritocracy for you..got brains got talent earn top dollar, otherwise can just slot your whole llife through and make peanuts. This is how things are la, don't get too disgruntled over it, in the end, also will come back to square one one as history has shown, just be happy with what you have and get on with life. Migrate also same thing lor, western socialism, even though got free perks, at the end of the day ur perks also you pay one what - high income tax, high indirect taxes, pay as you earn pension schemes. Only thing is have more opportunity, but the same things apply - need qualifications, need brain, need money. So no matter go where also stuck la.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm currently living in a western welfarist state, even though it has it's virtues in that the there is free universal healthcare and the lower income being allocated welfare handouts-to fund all this, there is in place high tax rates. I think income tax is 30 odd per cent and indirect taxes here are 13 per cent. Everything here in nationalized, everything from Hydro to the public transport to car insurance. Healthcare while free is also quasi-nationalized, and doctors are really anal abt seeing patients cause since they are getting paid per consultation irregardless of the treatment, u can only see the doc for one problem, if you have another, go to the back of the line. There are also long cues for operations and stuff, and people with $$$ get fed up and just go across the border to private clinics. And while their politicians are being paid peanuts compared to ours, the way politics here work is that various industries will form or fund lobby or interest groups to push for their interest to politicians. Hence, money politics come into the equation and more often than that, abuses come into play. Where am I the logging industry is really powerful as the are like a huge percentage of the state GDP, hence several pro-logging policies have been put in place to the disadvantage of citizens, especially the local indigenous people who live out in the country side. While many paint a rosey picture of western systems, this is more to it</div>
