              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Today is the 40<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> day since my arrival in Singapore on May 26, 2008. I expected to remain
              in Singapore only until June 3rd, 2008 i.e. for only 9 days for a short
              holiday and to witness the Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew vs Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan defamation case.<br><br>On May 29, 2008 I wrote a blog criticizing the judge in the case of Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew vs Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> Soon Juan Juan which was heard from May 26, 2008 to May 28, 2008. My article critical of Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> appeared in this blog.<br><br>On
              May 31, 2008 5 plain clothes policemen and women from Cantonment Police
              Station arrested me from my hotel, the Broadway Hotel at <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Serangoon</span> Road at 9 pm.<br><br>The
              Singapore government in this case is being being deliberately malicious
              and small minded in wanting to hurt me unnecessarily by refusing to
              proceed with this case in an expeditious manner. It has now been
              already been 40 days since my arrival in Singapore and I still have not
              had a trial yet. The Singapore government very well knows that this
              sort of delay is especially hurting to a foreigner who is waiting here
              while his affairs in his home country are being neglected. This sort of
              delay causes untold misery to a foreigner, which itself amounts to
              severe punishment.<br><br>The Singapore government is being
              deliberately malicious in refusing to proceed with this case in an
              expeditious manner and is intentionally causing me severe harm by
              dragging this case on unnecessarily.<br><br>This Singapore government
              is aware that I have my personal business to attend to in the USA and I
              have to go on with my life, which happens to be in the USA. Not in
              Singapore. While here, I have no proper accommodation, no right to work
              or no means of survival. Yet knowing this, this heartless and unjust
              Singapore government deliberately drags their feet with this case
              instead of giving a a trial immediately or alternately dropping all
              charges and letting me go home.<br><br>Let me make this very clear. When I attended the 3 day case before Judge Belinda <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>,
              there was no doubt in my mind at all that she was clearly biased as
              biased can be, and completely and utterly unfair towards Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Soo</span> Juan. In court she was not presiding as a judge at all, but was being merely a spokesman or spokeswoman for Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_10" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew and his son to ensure that they get to say whatever they want and at the same time to ensure that Dr. <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_11" class="blsp-spelling-error">Chee</span> was not given any effective means to put his case forward. It was not a
              trial, but a charade, a sham, an opera and a make believe of the most
              disgusting sort.<br><br>The Singapore government in their effort to use
              the law courts as a means to remain in power can do whatever they want.
              But they cannot try to make me say things which are not true. They
              cannot and will not succeed in making me lie. No matter what, they
              cannot compel me to say that what happened in the Singapore High Court
              was indeed a fair trial. It was not.<br><br>The police had seized my
              personal notebook containing my Email password and either themselves or
              through their agents sent Emails to this judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_12" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span> and are now trying to blame it on me. I have not sent any emails to this judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_13" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>.
              I did post 2 blog posts about the matter. Sending emails by seizing my
              personal particulars to a judge and then trying to blame it on me shows
              the depths of desperation and dishonesty to which this pathetic
              government will go to prove their point. By lies and dishonesty.<br><br>Look here, Singapore government. There was no need for me to send any Emails to Judge <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_14" class="blsp-spelling-error">Ang</span>.
              I had made my position that this judge was biased and unjust very
              clearly in my blog. If she wanted to, she could read it. I couldn't
              care less. But there was no need for me to send her any Emails. I had
              already made my point that she was biased and unjust. Sending her any
              emails was totally unnecessary. So Singapore government, this is my
              message to you. Stop being infantile and stupid. Grow up. This is not
              how a first world country should behave.<br><br>I wish to make it clear
              that I am not going to permit this silly government intolerant of
              dissent to intentionally punish me by making me remain in Singapore
              unnecessarily. You may try such strong arm tactics with others but you
              will not try that with me. My having to remain in Singapore for an
              extended period is causing me very severe harm. The bad reputation that
              Singapore has throughout the world as a country which abuses the law
              for it's political ends is getting progressively worse by these false
              charges against me. In fact it is hitting rock bottom.<br><br>Therefore as from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday, July 7<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_15" class="blsp-spelling-error">th</span> 2008, 9am, I will be holding a one man protest in front of Singapore

              <p>It is the most foolish way to deal directly against the aggressor by going head on in an absolutely unbalanced, biased leverage environment. The courageously outspoken have my empathies.

              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">July 4th, Singapore. Independance Day</h3>
              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Not
              satisfied with having arrested me for just writing a blog in criticism
              of the Judge Belinda Ang in the Lee Kuan Yew vs. Dr. Chee Soon Juan
              case respecting her bias during the 3 days May 26 2008 to May 28 2008,
              now the Singapore Police have resorted to beating me up.<br><br>I
              suppose they are not satisfied with the fact that I have not relented
              and withdrawn my accusation that this Judge was clearly biased during
              the trial to favor Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and his son. But no matter what,
              the fact remains what it is. No amount of police brutality against me
              can change the facts. Neither can it make me say that 2 and 2 is 5,
              simply because it is not.<br><br>Judge Belinda Ang was biased. There is
              no doubt about it. She behaved that way for all to see. If no
              Singaporean mentioned it, it was because they are afraid. They live in
              a police state. They live in fear and in subjugation. I do not live
              that way. I am a free man. And I will say what I saw.<br><br>If
              Singapore continues to claim that it is a first world country, after
              this, that statement is only useful during a round of beer at a lively
              party. After this Singapore is no better useful than for the butt of a
              solid joke.<br><br>On July 4th, 2008, Independence Day, at about 11 pm,
              I was passing by Race Course Road Little India. I earlier had a small
              Scotch in celebration. And why not, it was after all the 4th of July,
              2008, even if I was in Singapore. Just before reaching the junction of
              Bukit Timah Road, I hear loud calls asking me to stop. Looking back, I
              see about 4 people in civilian clothes. They confront me and ask who I
              was. And where I was going. Surely I have no reason to give any
              information. They appeared no better than thugs. Gangsters. I refused
              to give my name. Or any information.<br><br>The next minute, these
              cowardly unruly ill mannered ungentlemanly and gangster like persons in
              plain clothes, force me down to the floor. They man handle me. They
              hurt me. They shove my fact to the hard tarmac floor. They use their
              boots to kick me while I am in the floor. A Malay officer is especially
              brutal. He hurts me badly. They abuse me by calling me bastard and
              other dirty names. They intentionally cause sever pain and hurt me. And
              all for what? Just because I did not oblige them with my name? In the
              physical encounter, with about 10 policemen in plainclothes overcoming
              me, they have obviously won the physical fight. But in the moral
              question, they have failed miserably. They were thugs. Singapore
              government thugs. Lee Kuan Yew thugs. Another example of Lee's first
              world country.<br><br>The newspapers all owned by Lee Kuan Yew and his
              government can of course conveniently say anything they want about the
              incident. What else do you expect of a state controlled monopoly of
              news media? I have been falsely accused of touching the police car, and
              shouting abuses at the police. None of that ever happened. I was
              walking peacefully along the street, when these state sponsored thugs
              in civilian clothes ask me to stop etc.<br><br>This is what I am going
              to tell the Singapore government. I, Gopalan Nair am deliberately being
              singled out for victimization. We all know that on that day, Friday
              July 4th 2008 at 11 pm at night, there would have been hundreds if not
              thousands of Singaporean who may have a little to drink who may have
              behaved not necessarily as a proper English gentlemen, so to speak. I
              am sure there have been countless arrests. But you know, none of them
              would have made the headlines in the Singapore press. They would all
              have been given warnings and let off.<br><br>But surely in the eyes of
              this pathetic Singapore government who are at the butt end of jokes all
              over the free world, Gopalan Nair has to be singled out. Gopalan Nair
              had to be punished. A mountain has to made out of a molehill. His name
              has to be splashed all over the Singapore propaganda press. He has to
              be made to look like a real criminal, just because he did not have the
              decency to respond to some thug looking characters who wanted to know
              who he was.<br><br>Any way, the answer is not guilty once again. We
              have no free press here. All I can do is to use this blog of mine to
              tell my side of the story which I will continue to do. The Singapore
              dictator cannot intimidate me. I will not allow it.<br><br>And mind
              you, the entire action against me makes no sense. If the intent is to
              shut me up and keep me quite, it will not work. I will return to
              California and write and agitate with increased vigor the fact of the
              of the lack of any freedom in this island republic.<br><br>I understand
              the Far Eastern Economic Review is being sued. But unlike the Far
              Eastern Economic Review who can be prevented from circulating within
              Singapore, my blog cannot be stopped. No matter what my message will be
              coming through with heightened intensity to Singapore.<br><br>And what
              is worse, I had been just another blogger before my arrest on May 31,
              2008. With my arrest by this government, I have been propelled into
              international fame, where now I will be taken much more seriously
              internationally than if I had been left alone for my blog post of May
              29, 2008, the blog post which has made me internationally famous.<br><br>I
              am grateful to the US Embassy and the US State Department which is
              monitoring my case at the highest levels in Washington. I know that I
              have the US Government behind me in all this. I know I am not alone.<br><br>I also know that I have the entire free world who cherish their freedom behind me in this. Truly I am not alone.<br><br>I
              wish to thank those supporters out there particularly for their
              financial support. I was at Block 292 Bishan, at 9 am, yesterday,
              Sunday, with the Singapore Democratic Party helping them with
              distributing their leaflets and selling their books and literature to
              the public. At the location, I am particularly grateful to a supporter
              who handed me a very generous donation to help me sustain myself in
              Singapore during this ordeal. Not only to this supporter but to the
              countless other supporters who have given me both financial and moral
              support, I wish to say a heartfelt thank you for your kindness.<br><br>As
              you know, I have no choice in this matter. It is not possible for me to
              apologize to this Singapore government or to anyone else to seek mercy.
              I continue to stand by what I had said in my blog namely that Judge
              Belinda Ang was not a judge at all during the 3 days while she sat in
              judgment in the Lee Kuan Yew vs. Dr. Chee case. I would of course
              gladly apologize for the choice of words used, but the essence of the
              meaning of what I said remains intact and correct, for which I cannot
              apologize.<br><br>I am sorry that I was not able to be at Parliament
              House for my protest to demand that this government either give me a
              speedy trial or let me go home. I will have to see the outcome of the
              Pre Trial Conference tomorrow before I make a decision. Also there is
              the matter of the investigation against me for the alleged disorderly
              behavior.<br><br>All in all I intend to hang in there and not give up.
              Every political action has a price. In this case, I am lucky I am an
              American citizen. At least this dictatorial Lee Kuan Yew regime cannot
              have a hold on me forever, unlike the plight of my fellow Singaporeans
              who remain citizens.<br><br>They on the other hand they cannot escape
              the Lee Kuan Yew grip, unless they themselves decide they no longer are
              prepared to be enslaved.<br><br>Thanks to all.<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br>Imprisoned in the island paradise, Singapore<br>Against my will</p>
