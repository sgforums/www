              <p>Hi guys, I thought I'd just make some of my thoughts into words and share with you guys on what I'm thinking.</p>
              <p>Its gonna be about the comparisons between Singapore and Malaysia in respect with Dr.Mahatir's blog: http://chedet.co.cc/chedetblog/2009/06/the-modern-middle-kingdom.html#more</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some doubts and some clarifications would be great.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Water issues</strong></span></p>
              <p>I'm not exactly sure if any country in this dispute is actually making a loss. But for as far as I know, none are.</p>
              <p>What Malaysia has been trying really hard to inject is that the sale of water to Singapore has been of an unfair pricing compared to what the other states are purchasing the water at a higher pricing and that they would LOVE an increased in pricing.</p>
              <p>With the sale of treated water back to Msia and the Msia govt re-selling the water to their people at a profit-earning price, I really don't see why Msia is whining here.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, what Mahatir has been trying to brainwash his supporters are that Msia is doing a service to Singapore.This is utterly untrue and to be honest, crap.</p>
              <p>Malaysia had an abundance of water before and after Singapore requested to buy water from Singapore. It was of the lack of insight into the future that Malaysia sold the water to Singapore at that price.</p>
              <p>But right now after Singapore has far surpassed Msia economically, Msia just seems to start whining about how they have done a "service" to Singapore back then and that Singapore is everything but grateful. Even with the proposal to increase the price of water that is sold to Singapore approved, Malaysia tried to bundle up all the existing bilateral problems and try to make it into a one-time trade solution.</p>
              <p>Malaysia scrapped it when both countries could not come up with a suitable solution, effectively putting negotiations to earn more from the water sold to a halt.</p>
              <p>Who's fault?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Crooked Bridge</strong></span></p>
              <p>Msia is a sovereign state. She has the right to build whatever she wants in her territory. Singapore has no right to intefere as long as the water pipes are not cut.</p>
              <p>There are countless methods to do this. The water pipes can be rerouted, just like how the sliproad of a mainroad leads onto expressways. Its as simple as that.</p>
              <p>Although with this, how are the extra costs borned? Who will? Singapore or Malaysia?</p>
              <p>Anyway, Msia decided to give the go ahead to construct their side of the bridge. What I do not understand is how the construction has been cancelled.</p>
              <p>Reading from uncited sources because I'm too lazy, this can be contributed to some basic reasons.</p>
              <p>1) They cannot build their side of the bridge because they along, with Singapore, could not come to an agreement due to Singapore wanted to only approve the project and also build their side of the bridge to build a STRAIGHT bridge only if they sold sand and something else to Singapore in a trade-agreement.</p>
              <p>I have NO idea why they are being controlled by Singapore in a decision wholly independent of Msia.</p>
              <p>2) Singapore refuses to budge because she is afraid that Msia's ports will take away all of Singapore's business.</p>
              <p>Sure, Msia can come up with a tons of reasons as to why the bridge is of utmost importance. Just to name one.</p>
              <p>1) Stagnant non-east to west flowing sea water on the johore strait, which to be honest, is shared by Singapore too. I don't see why only the Malaysians are affected by this to an extend they need a whole new bridge.</p>
              <p>Even so, its just reasons why Singapore do not have to agree to a new bridge.</p>
              <p>But the true question is why Singapore is actually a contributing factor to the construction of the bridge? Or has the bridge construction halted due to another factor being that the money was much better spent on more urgent needs like feeding the poor?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RACISM</strong></span></p>
              <p>With regards to Dr.Mahatir's blog. With the sudden interest sparked in me in politics, I dutifully read through every english-written comment posted.</p>
              <p>Many say that Singapore is far from being non-racist.</p>
              <p>I guess there are 2 parts to this.</p>
              <p>Socially, racism will never disappear off the face of this earth. Everyone stereotypes. We all know how we stereotype each race here in Singapore. Afterall, thats sometimes how businesses work too.</p>
              <p>But what I admire is that Singaporeans will call themselves Singaporeans. Not Singapore Malay, not Singaporean Chinese or not Singaporean Indian.</p>
              <p>But political wise, Singapore is on the move on changing the past mindset. For instance the first Malay brigadier general in the SAF is proof that this is on the right track to proving that Singapore is not a racist state.</p>
              <p>Some even commented that as a Malay, he/she found difficulty in finding a job in Singapore. But to me, what one doesn't realize is that Singapore's economy relies heavily on foreign investments. Basically Singapore is too much of a metropolitic country.</p>
              <p>There is a high percentage of businesses here that deals with the big foreign countries. Very much often these businesses have dealings with China. Which probably explains why a Mandarin-speaking representative is much desired over one that do not speaks Mandarin. </p>
              <p>The market compared to another country that speaks mainly Malay like Malaysia or Indonesia is considerably smaller, but still big.</p>
              <p>With equal educational rights, Halal-food certified stalls everywhere and the weekly friday prayers recognition, I don't see how Singapore should be classified as nothing less racist than Msia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After finish typing this, I suddenly realize that putting thoughts to words require more than just 30mins of my time. I just want to have a dedicated thread as to the current disputes between Singapore and Malaysia, and hopefully Indonesia as these disputes have really made many confused.</p>
              <p>Lets discuss anything, shall we?</p>
