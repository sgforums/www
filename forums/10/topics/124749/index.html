            <div class='col-md body'>The sad fact is, the Singapore Government is paranoid of offending other countries, most of all Indonesia which has always practiced an 'abang-adik' (big brother, small brother) relationship with Singapore.. unfortunately, this has extended to such extremes whereby the law is not equally applied to Singaporeans and Indonesians who commit the same offence in Singapore.<br><br>In the Bukit Merah fire which was featured in last week's episode of crimewatch, the maid very obviously murdered her employer before setting fire to the house to destroy the evidence. In the end, she was not sentenced to death but to life imprisonment. I was like WTF?!?! As Singaporeans, one of our citizens got murdered and yet we'll have to pay for this scumbug's food and lodgings for the rest of her natural life. Since she's still so young, she's likely to live for at least half a century more. Just imagine the tens of thousands we'll be spending on her in the next 50 years.<br><br>I think this political interference in the criminal justice system is really making a big joke out of our judiciary. All the crap about everyone being equal in the eyes of the law remains as it is... crap.

            <div class='col-md body'>Precisely!<br><br>That robbery case just shows what one-tracked mind our scholars and bureaucrats have!!<br><br>I take issue with the public prosecutor's comments that the man's circumstances notwithstanding, the State should send a clear message that bank robbery is not tolerated and that Singapore's reputation should be protected.<br><br>I think that is utterly callous and shows a complete lack of sympathy and empathy on the part of our so-called "elite" who seem to think that the ends justifies the means. So protecting Singapore's reputation absolutely overrides all other concerns, and has no place for even the fact that the robbery is probably going to be a remote event.<br><br>Four cases last year do not mean there will be another four cases this year.<br><br>Now, you'll remember that case of the woman who was raped and killed at Bukit Butok nature reserve on CNY couple of years back. If I'm not wrong, the case is unsolved. Does this mean that rapists will be emboldened to do the same thing because our police wasn't able to catch the culprit?<br><br>Suffice to say, Singapore I feel is standing on the edge of a precipice built up by years of complacency, materialism and self-delusion that our system is the best (read: PAP can only be the sole custodian of power).  Singaporeans have betrayed a total lack of soul that comes with a vibrant civil society and the reason why this is so is because of the material culture the PAP has fostered.<br><br>So winning the case is everything for the Public Prosecutor because you know, it'll look good on his appraisal. Sadly, that comes at the expense of the underlings of society.</div>

I'm going out of point here.<br><br>Anyway, I am still in firm support of the death penalty.

The only circumstance whereby killing is justified is in the case where one's life is in danger, as an act of self-defence when under grave and sudden provocation.<br><br>By the way, if one were to examine the 'ill-treatment' claims made by the maid in court, it actually merely involves verbal abuse, extra work twice a week and deduction of salary.

Aren't they splashed all over the papers everyday?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Anyway, no one is arguing that these maids were not unfairly treated. They were overworked, verbally abused, paid peanuts etc etc. Of course the employers are guilty and should be punished for that. But the issue at hand is, are the maids guilty of murder? Is being overworked and underpaid enough justification to kill?<br><br>As i mentioned, the only legal defence for a sane person killing another human being is when such an act is committed in self defence, when there is a real and imminent threat to life. Does ill-treatment constitute a threat to life or limb, especially when no physical violence was involved? So does the killing in this case fall into the category of self-defence? i think not. Even if we were to disregard the legal aspect, don't u think that killing someone is a far too excessive response to mere verbal abuse and overwork?<br><br>hmmm... and i dun quite get your point on Singapore rejecting political interference. Are u suggesting that if we were to hang the maid, it will be out of an attempt on our part to demonstrate that we're not subjected to political intereference, rather than because hanging is the precribed punishment for all murderers?</div>
