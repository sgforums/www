But this should be seperate from the killer maid issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Profounder:</div><div class="quote_body">Based on what do you "examine" the ill-treatment claims?  A quarter page newspaper report with 1 or 2 lines on the diary entries of the maids?<br><br>Killing a person is a very grave matter and would take plenty of courage considering the strict laws in Singapore as well as as the widespread coverage involving Flor Contemplacion and the likes. It would take a series of events or a major event to trigger that instinct.<br><br>I am not defending the maids here but let's inject some humane perspective into what would otherwise turn out to be another sanitized proceeding that Singapore is so capable of: Kill, Court, Death Sentence.  That Singapore should protect its sovereignty by rejecting any form of political interference is just plain bullshit.  TO begin with, there is already lots of subliminal political interference on the part of the US with Singpaore, except that in this case, Singapore is a willing sucker.<br><br>Coming back to the case, if the maids were sentenced to death, I feel the sister-in-law and the husband should get their comeuppance too.  They should be charged for sharing the maid and asking her to go clean that sister-in-law's house.<br><br>What also totally disgusts me is that the sister-in-law only pays them $10. Now, corny, if you were asked to clean 2 big houses every week and at the same time, were told to follow strictly to a routine that basically reflects the whims of a perverse mind, I believe you'll be very very very frustrated.<br><br>Again, let's not just think that "Oh, the maids were merely overworked, they deserve to die"...There could be more to the matter.<br><br>Maids are also human. In the first place, I'm very disinclined to call them "maids".  They are real people who are raised in poverty and are merely looking for a better life. Some come here to earn that eatra $100 to send back to finance their brothers and sisters to school.  Some just want a more comfortable life for themselves or their parents.  And all this as their loved ones toil in the homeland.  And mind you, they don't get paid in the first few months as the money goes to the agency, some of which are real bloodsuckers.  Put yourself in their shoes.  You go through all this. Do you want to land yourself in the gallows for a moment of greed?<br><br>Singaporeans are basically a selfish lot. That's the truth. And that's the reason why our service standard may never be up to par. As customers, we think we deserve the best service but at the same time, we are unwilling to be generous or gracious to the people who serve us.  How many times have you heard a Singaporean say "Thank You" to the waitress or cashier??<br><br>We need to re-examine our souls before we are really spiritually bankrupt as I believe many of our scholars and bureaucrats are.<br><br></div></blockquote>i agree with some of your points.  in truth, im quite disgusted with how many singaporeans viewed of maids.<br><br>they are EMPLOYEES, not SLAVES.<br><br>i mean i often learn of their working schedule as terrible as more than 12 hrs per day and 7 days per week.  now which singaporean here can dahan?  huh?  and that is already considered GOOD liao hor.  i felt so disgusted to hear them flaunting how nice they treat their maids when i felt that they think maids dun have a brain and needed more discipline than their own 10-year olds.<br><br>for their bloody stupidity...well go to hell.  im not saying maids are angels, but the general acceptance of treatment that is considered "GOOD" is crap, and that CRAP is abusive....and how many more maids suffered in silence?  they cant complain becos thats the norm.....<br><br>i think singaporeans are frigging lazy ya?  if you dont wanna do your own housework you may employ a maid, but dont be cheapskate la ah?  always make one maid work 10 maids job. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
