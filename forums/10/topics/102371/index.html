We are talking about recovery but we have not seen any real improvement in business and employment.

The government will save tons of money. But they're doing this mainly because of aging population fears. And it's expected to worsen in the future. So I won't be surprised if there are further "adjustments" to CPF and retirement.<br><br>But that means that I won't be able to enjoy retirement in the distant future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chartered's 60.5 percent - majority owner is Singapore Technologies Group, which itself is owned by Temasek, the Singapore government's investment vehicle for local companies.<br><br><img src="http://membres.lycos.fr/cedbrain/gifs_animes/donnie_yen.gif"><br><br>Sinking Feeling<br><br>Far Eastern Economic Review<br>September 19, 2002<br><br>By Trish Saywell and Assif Shameen/SINGAPORE<br><br>RELATED:<br>Chartered Semiconductor faces trading investigation<br><br>CHIA SONG HWEE probably wishes he never took the job. In July, the 40-year-old chief financial officer of Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing became the company's third chief executive officer in as many months.<br>The world's No.3 maker of customized chips is under siege. Rumours are dogging the company that it's likely to be sold or merged. In July, Temasek Holdings, the government investment holding company that owns Chartered's largest shareholder, Singapore Technologies Group, said it no longer viewed the chipmaker as a "strategic" holding.<br><br>In an interview with the REVIEW on August 5, the management denied Chartered was looking for a buyer for its oldest silicon-wafer fabrication plant, or fab, to raise cash. "We have no intention of selling it," said Bruno Guilmart, Chartered's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing and sales. "Look at our balance sheet. We have over $1 billion in cash and credit facilities."<br><br>Chartered's message was clear: There would be no fire sale of assets because it didn't need the cash. In subsequent remarks to media and analysts last month, Chartered officials emphasized the company's capital expenditure for 2002 of $500 million was supported by its strong financial position. Indeed, most analysts and investors were left with the impression that Chartered didn't need any money and wasn't about to raise any.<br><br>So it came as a rather nasty surprise when Chartered announced on September 2 that it would raise $633 million through a rights issue at S$1 per share. The issue was at a steep 52 percent discount to the then market price of S$2.10. "I had been predicting for months that they would have to do a rights issue because they really needed the cash, but they kept denying it," says Warren Lau, a foundry analyst for HSBC Securities in Taipei. Lau says Chartered, which has $1.1 billion in debt, needs up to $2 billion to complete its new Fab Seven, which will expand its capacity. Chartered says Fab Seven will cost approximately $3.5 billion. At the end of June, it had only invested about $200 million.<br><br>Rumours that the company was preparing to raise funds through a bond or a rights issue gathered steam from August 28, sending its shares down 18 percent in the week before the announcement. The controversy around the issue has wiped off about one third of Chartered's Singapore market capitalization in two weeks. Chartered stock is down over 70 percent since January and more than 92 percent from its peak in early 2000.<br><br>Minority shareholders are outraged. "Retail investors feel the company has not been sensitive to their interests and its badly timed decision has burnt the pockets of many retail investors," says David Gerald, president of the Securities Investors Association of Singapore, an association for small investors. The Singapore Exchange has launched an investigation of market activity before the announcement was made to find out who was trading shares and whether any possible information was relied on.<br><br>For its part, Chartered denies having misled the market with statements about its cash position. It also denies that there was any insider trading by its officers and directors. Merrill Lynch, the investment bank acting as the issue's underwriter, said in a statement on September 6 it "conducted itself properly in every regard with respect to Chartered."<br><br>None of this sits well with shareholders or company analysts. Recent events "don't pass the smell test," says an analyst at a rival investment bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Our understanding is that there were leaks two weeks in advance. Given such widespread leaks, Chartered should have had an obligation to postpone the timing of the issue. This has hurt the company's reputation in the investor community."<br><br>While rumours that Chartered might be sold were rife before the rights issue was made public, speculation is in overdrive now. If Chartered is to be sold, however, it's got a way to go in any pre-sale beautification campaign. The chipmaker has posted six straight quarters of losses. It lost $384 million in 2001 and analysts estimate losses could be as high as $400 million this year and $230 million next year.<br><br>The foundry's overall capacity utilization rate is running at about 40 percent, better than the low of 18 percent a year ago but well below its break-even rate of about 75 percent. By contrast, the utilization rate at rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., (TSMC), the world's largest chipmaker, is about 65 percent, and at United Microelectronics Corp. 65 percent - 70 percent.<br><br>Chartered is also grappling with long-term structural issues. It's got to compete with the fabs at the bottom of the technology spectrum that are coming on stream in countries like Malaysia, China and Korea. At the same time, it's trying to keep in step with the top-tier foundries in Taiwan. Its advanced-process technology is also lagging; Chartered is up to four quarters behind TSMC. Chia has said that it expects to catch up by the time 0.10-micron wafers are rolled out next year, but for now, few are willing to bet that it will. "There is no room for lagging players in foundries," says Russell Tan, an analyst with NetResearch Asia, a Singapore investment advisory firm. "Chartered will have to do something drastic soon or be sold for scrap in a few years' time, given its business model, cost structure, customers, and technology."<br><br>"[They're] not good enough to have the premium pricing that the Taiwanese guys have," adds Arthur Chai of Morley Fund Management in Singapore. "So long term, there are questions about sustainability. Selling it away might be the best way to address it."<br><br>Can Chartered chart a new course? That will depend on whether Temasek will continue pumping money into the company and upgrade its facilities to rival the Taiwanese--or cut its losses and bow out of the industry. "The choice now facing Temasek is either to exit the foundry business or to launch a massive up-scaling to match the industry leaders," says Tan.<br><br>TIME IS RUNNING OUT<br><br>Chia declined to be interviewed for this story. But Guilmart argues that Chartered has learned lessons from the current downturn in electronics demand. Chartered has also raised the portion of annual revenues it spends on research and development. It will spend about $100 million on R&amp;D this year, up from last year's $79 million.<br><br>Guilmart also argues that Chartered can afford to be a few months behind the technology curve because it doesn't need to be No.1 in all chip segments. "If you want to be a major player in microprocessors or in graphics chips, you've got to be the No.1 in technology," he says. "In the area of the convergence of communications, computers and consumer electronics, there are plenty of spaces you don't need to be No.1 [or] have the latest and greatest technologies."<br><br>Analysts aren't holding their breath. Eric Gomberg, an analyst with United States-based brokerage Thomas Weisel Partners, says in a recent report, ". . . barring a robust semiconductor recovery, this company will face ongoing challenges and a significant cash burn . . . the balance sheet will degrade over time." Adds Lau of HSBC: "Instead of preserving capital, their new strategy seems to be expanding capacity."<br><br>One of the simplest strategies for Chartered, analysts say, is to form partnerships and technology alliances with integrated-device manufacturers. In addition, it has already tied up with SMIC, a foundry in Shanghai, and isn't ruling out others.<br><br>Chartered's new CEO is listening. He recently told reporters that Chartered hoped to speed up discussions with potential partners on its newest fab. The tie-up "could be technological cooperation or a partnership on the physical assets" of the fab. "We are always looking for new business models and opportunities to evolve the company," he said. Chia knows the makeover can't wait. Time is not on Chartered's side.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chartered Semiconductor faces trading investigation<br><br>Asian Wall Street Journal<br>September 9, 2002<br>SINGAPORE<br><br>By PHILLIP DAY<br><br><img src="http://membres.lycos.fr/cedbrain/gifs_animes/donnie_yen.gif"><br><br>REGULATORS are investigating claims of insider trading in the stock of government-linked Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd., whose shares plunged before last week's announcement of a rights issue.<br>Rumors in the market of a coming rights issue by the world's third-largest contract chip maker sent Chartered's Singapore-listed shares down about 16 percent in the week prior to the official announcement last Monday. On August 30, the Friday before the rights issue was announced, Chartered's shares fell more than 8 percent as investors dumped the stock on the rumor. The company's Nasdaq Stock Market-listed American depository receipts kept pace as the Singapore-listed shares fell.<br><br>Investors liked the official news even less when it came. The stock fell nearly 24 percent last Monday after the company announced a rights issue designed to raise $633 million, in part for capital projects to help it catch up with the technology now being used by its main competitors in Taiwan.<br><br>Investors complained to local newspapers and on stock-trading Web sites that the company's comments in the week before the rights issue seemed to suggest it didn't have any need to raise new cash.<br><br>Chartered's capital-expenditure need "for this year is $500 million and this amount is well-supported by our strong financial position," company spokeswoman Maggie Tan said August 27 as rumors of a rights offer were starting to build. The company made similar comments elsewhere, while saying it wouldn't comment directly on any rumor.<br><br>In a news conference late Friday, Chartered officials denied they had attempted to mislead the market with statements made before the rights-issue announcement. And there was "no insider trading by the officers and directors of Chartered Semiconductor," said Chia Song Hwee, Chartered's president and chief executive officer.<br><br>Mr Chia said Chartered had been aiming to issue the rights offer in the second half of the month, but "the events of [August 30] -- the heavy trading, the drop in share price, followed by, more importantly, a communication from the [exchange] towards the end of market close ... caused us to re-evaluate our timing."<br><br>Investors also complained that trading ahead of the official announcement indicated some people were certain there would be a rights issue, with share trading reaching three or four times normal volume on August 30 as talk escalated and the stock tanked.<br><br>"What is intriguing is the fact that there has been a substantial amount of offloading" in the week before the announcement, wrote David Gerald, chief executive of the Securities Investors Association of Singapore, in a letter to Chartered after the rights issue was announced. In the week before the announcement, "the man in the street was given a comfortable picture by the company with respect to its finances ... implicitly suggesting that fund-raising through a sharply discounted rights issue is not necessary," he said in the letter.<br><br>The Singapore Exchange Ltd, which is responsible for monitoring the trading and actions of listed companies, early last week declined to specifically address the allegations of insider trading on the day of the rights-issue announcement, only saying that it routinely monitored market activity. It did point out, however, that it had asked Chartered for an explanation as the selloff peaked on the Friday before the rights issue was announced.<br><br>But after a series of stories in the local press and amid growing investor criticism, the exchange said Thursday in a letter to a local newspaper that it had begun an investigation of market activity before the announcement was made, "to see who was trading and whether any possible inside information was relied on."<br><br></div>

I'm forced to lend my money to the government at a lousy 4% for a period of 30 years or more, if I were a lending instituion I could get 24%, and this is what they are doing using my money for investment or lending to others for a huge return and giving me a pittance. 4% is bullsh it.<br><br>I don't care whether they make staggering losses or huge gains because I'm not getting a share of it so why really bother. All I care about is when I reach 55 I want my money PERIOD! not your god damn excuses.</div>
