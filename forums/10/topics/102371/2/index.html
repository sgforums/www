            <div class='col-md body'>I fear our men in white are missing the point entirely. Who the hell wants to work until they're in their 60s and 70s if they had a choice?(whatever happened to enjoying retirement years, quality of life etc?) If you're in top management being chauffered around and flying business and first class, wining and dining with top clients etc then age not so much of a problem, but when you're working lower level jobs, it can be more of a problem. The current trend of companies dumping staff who are considered old(40 and above) is not helping any. As it is, the 22 years bet 40 and 62 are kind of a limbo for many right now(qualified, iwht advance degrees and all but cannot find employment as the HR departments will throw out applications that are above a certain age without even interviewing them). So for 20 years drive taxi and work in McDonalds is it? Only the PAP members enjoy employment all the way up to their 80s it seems(MM Lee will most likely die while in office because he seems to refuse to step down no matter what). Our men in white need to remove their heads from their behinds and look at the picture again.<br>As it is I'm seeing more old people selling tissue paper, begging, collecting old boxes etc, younger and highly educated taxi drivers, more old people working the McDonalds counters and perhaps in coming years we'll get an increase in the number of elderly throwing themselves onto MRT tracks. Its a time bomb slowly ticking away.</div>
