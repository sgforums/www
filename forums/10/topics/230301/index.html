            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Philip Moon is a SE Valley high school and community college teacher and an Ahwatukee/Chandler community columnist.<br><br>German educational model: nicht sehr gut<br>01/02/2007 02:32:01<br><br>My brother just flew in from Germany. Having not seen each other for several years, we had a lot of catching up to do. And while we have had many interesting conversations, one has especially caught my attention: tracking in the German public schools.<br><br>The fact that the German public school system tracks students didnÂ’t catch my attention. I already knew that students in Germany were tracked into 1 of 3 tracks. What I didnÂ’t know is that this tracking starts when students finish 4th grade. I was stunned.<br><br>I was stunned because we are talking about 10 year-olds whose entire college and career aspirations are irreversibly determined when students are only 10 years-old.<br><br>I was equally stunned because student aptitude and student achievement ostensibly donÂ’t really matter. All that matters is the subjective whim of the 4th grade teacher. And so it is that students get pigeonholed for life solely upon the basis of teacher recommendations. Talk about subjective. Talk about scary.<br><br>Talk about stupid. Folks, we are talking about 10 year-olds whose entire futures are being decided by teachers playing God. This is wrong, and it doesnÂ’t take a rocket scientist to figure out why.<br><br>ItÂ’s wrong for the simple fact that not all students Â“bloomÂ” by the end of the 4th grade. Some students need more time, as they are not yet fully cognitively developed so early.<br><br>I was one of those students. Had I been in Germany, I surely would have been denied the chance to attend traditional high school as well as college and university beyond. Had I been in Germany, I wouldÂ’ve been chopped down at the get-go, never allowed to be the late bloomer that I was. As such, had I been in Germany, I would never had the chance to earn 2 college degrees and thereby teach physics at both the high school and junior college levels.<br><br>Had I been in Germany, I would have been forced to become a realtor, truck driver, or the like because when I was in 4th grade, try as I might, I just couldnÂ’t Â“getÂ” mathematics and science.<br><br>Back in 4th grade (at Eisenhower Elementary School in Mesa)) I was a Â“CÂ” student. I routinely earned CÂ’s on just about everything. I did especially poor in mathematics and science. Why? It just didnÂ’t make any sense to me. Try as I might, when it came to mathematics and science, I just didnÂ’t Â“get itÂ”. And so I got low grades.<br><br>I got low grades because I was a late-bloomer. It wasnÂ’t until 9th grade that I started Â“getting itÂ”. It was then that the proverbial light bulb suddenly went off. All of the sudden I finally understood algebra. All of a sudden I finally learned how to write. My grades suddenly shifted from C's to AÂ’s &amp; BÂ’s.<br><br>Why the sudden change? Simple. It was during my freshman year that my brain came of age. Whereas before I was cognitively unable to meaningfully engage in abstract and analytical thought, during my 9th grade year I was finally able to start engaging in formal thinking. The change couldnÂ’t have been any more dramatic.<br><br>But as dramatic as it was, it was not unexpected. My brain just needed time to develop.<br><br>The young brain needs time to develop. Piaget was telling us this nearly a century ago. And so are todayÂ’s neurophysiologists. And anybody with half a brain knows this. ThatÂ’s why the typical 10 year-old cannot meaningfully engage in formal thought.<br><br>And thatÂ’s precisely why I am so grateful that I didnÂ’t grow up in Germany. Had I grown up in Germany, I wouldÂ’ve been summarily denied the chance to be all that I could be.<br><br>And thatÂ’s why the German system is so wrong: it arrogantly cuts down and casts aside late-bloomers.<br><br>And thatÂ’s why the American public school system must not look to Germany as the model of exemplary public education.<br><br>But if we must look to the German model, we must do so with the late-bloomer in mind.<br>Rather than tracking students at the end of 4th grade, we need to do so at the end of the 9th grade.<br><br>Likewise, we need to replace subjective teacher recommendations with objective rigorous criterion referenced achievement and aptitude tests.<br><br>If we do so, we can meaningfully reform public education in America at a time when such reform is urgently needed.<br></div>
