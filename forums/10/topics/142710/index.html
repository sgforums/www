Dismiss the notion that Government is to govern.  Treat every Department / outfit as a Business Centre (Profit Centre) then you are near there.<br><br>Dismiss the notion that NKF is collecting donations from the public.  Dismiss the notion that Government is collecting taxes from the public.  Whatever collected is termed as turn-over.  Whatever reserves accumulated is the KPI.<br><br>Ministers pay are never bench mark with the peers (Ministers of other Governments) but with private sector companies.  The mentality is you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.  And $600,000 is peanuts to those in the highest authority.  That is why you have monkey suing SPCA.<br></div>
