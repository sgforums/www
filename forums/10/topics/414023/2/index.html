              <p><br>Nooooooo ! No way. My father didn't bring our family to migrate to singapore for nothing. We wanted to grow up in a non-discriminatory environment. My Malaysian cousins are very unhappy with the political situation in the country. You don't know how difficult is to work in a government or semi government employer in Malaysia (if you can get into one). All the promotions go to certain people while the minority race are given the dirty work to toil. The majority doesn't want to do the tough and analytical work leaving the poor minority to take up the heavy burden. The minority don't get any cooperation and team work. If minority complain, minority will be boycotted so the minority has to comply because minority are not the master.</p>
              <p>Also the majority have worked in key positions for 10-20 years but they are unwilling to share their knowledge to the minority, leaving them to struggle with their jobs. The majority will help each other but they will push all the dirty work to the minority.</p>
              <p>That is why most minorities prefer to work for China Man companies or well run multinational companies such as Nestle and Exxon Mobil in Malaysia but they are hard to get in and while China Man companies are easy to get in, they don't pay very well because of their thriftyness.</p>
              <p>Malaysia's exchange rate is controlled so the country continues to languish in low skilled labour mentality. Merger with Malaysia would be disastrous because the majority cannot take the working style of singaporeans. Recently a singaporean general manager who was transferred to Malaysia was sacked because the majority there boycotted his policies and he could do little about that as the local labour laws protected them. If it was the minority of course, they can get sacked but the majority is very strong and have a lot of backing.</p>

              <p>I don't think a merger would work very well.  Totalitarian regimes don't mix well with democracies.</p>
              <p>Here are some remarks by Australia's Senator Bob Brown regarding the buy-over of ASX:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 17px; font-size: 12px;">

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.8em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">A 30-year-old remark made by former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew that Australia was the "poor white trash of Asia", as well as the execution of convicted Australian drug trafficker Van Nguyen, demonstrated Singaporean authorities' dim view of the country and its assets, he said.</p>
              <p></p>

              <p></p>

              <p>i dun think oz  is interested in merger or even merging a macdonald in their towns even.must be saiao or mad to think of merger with oz even.....why dun merge wiv england instead.</p>
              <p>besides that oz still recently had that white australia policy n recently classifies aborigines as part of flora n fauna of oz....australia isnt ready.</p>
              <p>they have those jobs as i see needs like a masters degree for a simple job iequivalent of diploma level spore type of jobs or gangster connections with single minded purpose.....other than that they mainly dig holes n rocks in ground using men with muscles who talk as if they are grunting most of the time.damn funny...as if they needed clothes to dig rocks from ground....might as well werk butt naked in that case .</p>
              <p>they have no need for real skills......their skill is driving bulldozer n cutting up a cow hanging on a chain n hook......as basically all australia needs at the skilled level.....meanwhile they have industries that are mainly badly planned and mostly seem to be ad hoc planning n fabrication in a production plant.....seems like their production factory is falling apart as we speak or it was badly planned from start.</p>
              <p>forget about merger....ya would have better chance if spore merged with the moon or china or england or maolaysia......</p>

              <p>i dun think oz  is interested in merger or even merging a macdonald in their towns even.must be saiao or mad to think of merger with oz even.....why dun merge wiv england instead.</p>
              <p>besides that oz still recently had that white australia policy n recently classifies aborigines as part of flora n fauna of oz....australia isnt ready.</p>
              <p>they have those jobs as i see needs like a masters degree for a simple job iequivalent of diploma level spore type of jobs or gangster connections with single minded purpose.....other than that they mainly dig holes n rocks in ground using men with muscles who talk as if they are grunting most of the time.damn funny...as if they needed clothes to dig rocks from ground....might as well werk butt naked in that case .</p>
              <p>they have no need for real skills......their skill is driving bulldozer n cutting up a cow hanging on a chain n hook......as basically all australia needs at the skilled level.....meanwhile they have industries that are mainly badly planned and mostly seem to be ad hoc planning n fabrication in a production plant.....seems like their production factory is falling apart as we speak or it was badly planned from start.</p>
              <p>forget about merger....ya would have better chance if spore merged with the moon or china or england or maolaysia......</p>

              <p>I always hear you complain complain. Hitman, you don't know how lucky you are. My Singapore cousin who married a Malaysian, he work for so many years there, cannot even get a PR. Some more his son is rejected as Malaysian citizen because of his father's citizenship. So, he had to apply for singaporean citizenship instead.</p>
              <p>Even for a mainland Malaysian to travel to East Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak, you need a passport. For a Malaysian to work in East Malaysia he or she needs a working visa. A mainland Malaysia cannot set up business or spread hsi company business to East malaysia without proper connections.</p>
              <p>I have one friend whose mother 70 years old is a chinese born in Malaysia but the immigration refuse to give her citizenship because she was born traditional style didn't go to hospital so no birth certificate. So how to prove? They gave her a red IC card instead which means she is merely a PR.</p>
              <p>But a lot of malays in Singapore are PRs in Malaysia because they can get a lot of benefits like cheap petrol, low cost, discount on purchase of houses, free university education in local and overseas and guaranteed employment in government.</p>
              <p>I hear a lot of Malaysian minorities marry foreign wives from Thailand, Vietnam, etc, and then suddenly their children become stateless because of vague excuses like they register their marriage late, birth certificate not clear, bla bla. THere are some Malaysian minorities who are stateless. And you still want to merge with M'sia? Haven't you learn the lesson of 1963 ? It will never work.</p>

              <p>You are allowed to complain as you wish but I only say it because you suggested Singapore to merge with Malaysia is better than merging with Oz.</p>
              <p>You do not know the half of the story in Malaysia. Sure thing, Malaysia is better than Afganistan but there are a lot of discriminations there. You do not know the Malaysian working environment. Perhaps there are a some places like well run MNC in Malaysia that is well run but the majority of the companies there run like shit.</p>
              <p>I have worked in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia and from this I can tell you people in Malaysia working ethic is the worst, they don't teamwork, egoistical like hell, don't want to share information - make you struggle, very racially orientated, lazy, play tai chi, sabotage, backstabbing, blame people, etc, etc. Sure thing, Singapore also got this kind of culture but on a scale of 10, Singapore is 5 while Malaysia is 9.</p>
              <p>Do business in construction also difficult. Somebody claim to tell me that there is a lot of corruption, no open tender, pair with majority to get main job but majority person shareholder do nothing but sit down on his ass while you do all the dirty work. Majority people get the main con job and then they sub out to the chinese for cheaper price and chinese end up have to cough out cheaper materials to build schools and stadiums that collapse within 6 months.</p>
              <p>The majority race, they bully the minority people (pass all the dirty work to them). Some chinese there also gang up with the majority race because they don't want to be left out of the big cake (their morsel portion). The majority have special privaledges to take up contractor licences (transport gas, taxi business, hospital cleaning services, toilet cleaning services, selling car marques, supply building services, guaranteed construction building contracts) and also can buy cheap accres of land use of farming (but some with connections are able to turn them into commercial land and made bundles of money). So if you as a chinese after merger, what do you get? You get bullied to work for the majority. Occupation, man. Last time you were ruled by the British, now you are ruled by....the Majority.</p>
              <p>I also know of one Majority race guy, he is just a mere government contractor but he has three wives, three bungalows, 5 mercedes, 2 BMW, 2 toyotas and 3 hondas. I know of another chinese contractor of the same business only drives a Peogeot, one semi-d, one wife and 30% of his profits goes to his Majority business partner (he has to have a "majority" race business partner to qualify to obtain certain contracts that exceed MYR200,000 from government or semi government companies.</p>
              <p>Yes I know Oz is giving you a lot of problems, Hitman, hang on there. But if you think that Malaysia is a better place, I think you will complain more than 1 page. Oz you complain 1 page, Malaysia you can write a book.</p>
