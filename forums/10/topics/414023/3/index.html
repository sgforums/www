              <p>No way, I will take up my rifle to defend Singapore from invasion.</p>
              <p>Malaysia even worse, they also got CPF, call EPF. They use the EPF to buy shares of "Majority" party businessmen companies in the stock exchange and to bail out "majority" cronies. The EPF is so low and exchange rate so pathetic, the retiree cannot even use it to travel to Europe or USA for tour because the amt so small.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is rich because of oil in Sarawak. The government is draining all the oil wealth to pay for all the subsidies in peninsular Malaysia. But the oil in Sarawak is running out. And the Sarawak people are cheated also, they should have earn oil royalties but the money is being paid to pay for subsidies for the ruling party can fish for more votes in the general election.</p>
              <p>If Singapore merge, Malaysia will force Singapore to pay royalties to the central government. For example, Penang which is ruled by the opposition DAP, is dried up of government funds because central government is witholding all the funds.</p>
              <p>And then your squeky clean streets will turn into the sewage drains of Kuala Lumpur. Have you been to Kuala Lumpur and see the dirty shit garbage and diapers in the monsoon drains? Ever seen Sungai Kelang? The river smell like sewage shit and sometimes dead bodies flood in it during the rainy monsson season. Yes, Kuala Lumpur will suck all the tax payers money in Singappore to pay to all the corrupted politicians and Singapore will turn back to a dilapidated village.</p>

              <p>No way, I will take up my rifle to defend Singapore from
              invasion.</p>
              <p>Malaysia even worse, they also got CPF, call EPF. They use the
              EPF to buy shares of "Majority" party businessmen companies in the
              stock exchange and to bail out "majority" cronies. The EPF is so
              low and exchange rate so pathetic, the retiree cannot even use it
              to travel to Europe or USA for tour because the amt so small.</p>
              <p>Malaysia is rich because of oil in Sarawak. The government is
              draining all the oil wealth to pay for all the subsidies in
              peninsular Malaysia. But the oil in Sarawak is running out. And the
              Sarawak people are cheated also, they should have earn oil
              royalties but the money is being paid to pay for subsidies for the
              ruling party can fish for more votes in the general election.</p>
              <p>If Singapore merge, Malaysia will force Singapore to pay
              royalties to the central government. For example, Penang which is
              ruled by the opposition DAP, is dried up of government funds
              because central government is witholding all the funds.</p>
              <p>And then your squeky clean streets will turn into the sewage
              drains of Kuala Lumpur. Have you been to Kuala Lumpur and see the
              dirty shit garbage and diapers in the monsoon drains? Ever seen
              Sungai Kelang? The river smell like sewage shit and sometimes dead
              bodies flood in it during the rainy monsson season. Yes, Kuala
              Lumpur will suck all the tax payers money in Singappore to pay to
              all the corrupted politicians and Singapore will turn back to a
              dilapidated village.</p>

              <p>Australia seems to be a more 'dark horse' choice as they seem more to minding their own business, save for a spate with Indonesia a few years back, the only link I can think of is the fact that there's around a few hundred thousands Singaporeans there. Australia can't handle the fact that if Singapore is linked to them, Malaysia and Indonesia will rise heckle with them.</p>
              <p>A few years back, USA would be my perferred choice but they are also more concerned about their own economy now. USA will be more than able to support Singapore with their carrier battle groups and we have a few of their warships docking at Changi Naval Base. But right now, they got no more stomach for conflict, they can't even force China to raise their currency. Their days are numbered.</p>
              <p>Sorry, but I still think the most likely scenario will be to return back to Malaysia, we were once part of them so most countries will not protest and even less likely in Sinkapore, where we can be arrested for protesting. Very horrible, I admit. The way those MIW is running this country, I think the day of reckoning might be closer still.</p>
