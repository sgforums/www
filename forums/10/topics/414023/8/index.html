                      even asians arent perfect. there are tons of things asian do that

              <p>prhaps i should move out of this town like u said u wouldnt be caught dead in this town......but unlike u i have family commitments in this town,,,,,i didnt dump them in spore like u did!</p>
              <p>shame on u ged.....with all yer education yer nuthin but a deserter who deserted his folks,:)</p>
              <p> there are many chinese who had it tough in oz after immigrating in the skilled category.</p>
              <p>discrimination is nothing new..its their oz culture.</p>
              <p>thats why most chinese sooner or later set up their own business.....this goes true especially the japanese in oz.</p>
              <p>there were quite a number of people in sgforum of chinese or asian descent who had a tough life in oz.....just take a glance.....</p>
              <p>on the useless part....i dont know what u are talking about really.wow....ged must reaally be sucking balls big time in his company.most aussies seem to talk more than they do.</p>
              <p>look...i dun werk in a land with the industrial might thats dates back to 1900s technolology......im more geared up to technology thats between the timeline of 1990-2007.if they have dinosaur like or caveman technology thats gonna make me lose an arm or leg coupled with poor management......then i would be better off with my own company with my own high end technology thats at least 1980 technology.</p>

              <p>ged...they just kept u for fun or perhaps they are the rare civilised lot .i have seen chinese people werking in this town.initially i saw this malaysian chinese guywerking at BIG W department store in the shopping mall.....then a year later i saw him werking at dick smith in the same shopping mall...i looked at him with a questionin look and he looked embarrased......then last month i saw him werking as a packer in a small bookstore in the same shopping mall.this time he ran away from me and hid in some dark corner....seems like his werkplace is kinda getting smaller n smaller.</p>
              <p>then theres this burmese gal who was brought up in oz town and the only job they gave her was a temp job for 2 months.she was so desperate to get a job she decided to go to spore with a few aussie frends n even wated to sign on with the army....</p>
              <p>then i saw personally for myself how some educated chinese guy from hong kong who started werkin in some roadworks.i first saw him..he had a neat haircut and looked well mannered and happy with werk colleagues ...as time went by his haircut looked bad like he hadnt washed or combed his hair.....after 6 mths he walked around alone looking sad n dejected still in his work uniform.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the list goes on.....theres quite a number it seems...which is unfortunate.most of them appear to be...............some kinda football.why is this so???</p>
              <p>although some are great people who gave me a high paying job which is the most i have ever earned in me life......most of oz dun have much high tech industries needed or seen in most developed countries.oz industries is mainly labour intensive type and messy..dirty and dangerous....i have even seen like 3 workplace accidents all fatal in less than a year</p>
              <p>if they dun have safe high technology n placxe their lives on old unsafe technology....then i will build a state of the art factory by myself........to the aussies they are using old outdated apprenticeship systems....licensing for old defunct systems fit to be in the slums of Calcutta....i dun think they have enough technology to be even be on par with malaysia let alone the usa and spore!</p>
              <p>face it ged....u are living on borrowed time with their outdated and old dangerous factories and system fit to be on another planet.no one in the werld uses their kinda old technology or system anymore.its at least 50 years behind most of the advanced countries....even china and malasyia would make oz kinda ancient.when compared to spore,usa n japan....australia is most likened in the bronze age era.</p>
              <p>remeber ged....u are living on borrowed time...yer children would not be fortunate as u if the current australian trend continues.</p>

              <p>As for the sob stories about racially-based hiring practices that Shitman presents as an excuse for his uselessness, here are a few facts for you.  1 out of 30 applicants (with a minimum of an Honours degree) for a job at my firm make it as far as starting probation, and 80% don't pass probation.  Out of all of that, next to the boss himself, I've been here the longest as the go-to guy for technical expertise.  Gee, do you think my being Chinese in an Australian firm has hampered my success?  Really?  Just try pushing the point, sport. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>So let me get this straight: all you've got is a bunch of fairytales and second (if not third) hand sob stories that you're not even remotely connected to, and you're trying to convince me to ignore what I experience every day and go with your bullshit?</p>
              <p>Do you even have the slightest, faintest hint of an inkling of how monumentally idiotic you are? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>By the way, in my field I have national markets cornered by way of federal government regulations, so not only does that mean that I most assuredly make a much more comfortable living than you possibly could, it also means that the well you refer to is in fact a sea.  Suck it up.</p>

              <p>on one occasion i met a white australian 29 yr old who married a chinese girl from shanghai.he spoke chinese with me which i found  interesting.....some gals smile...some gals chat with u....some  gals look at u like they need to explore u or something...and some guys tend to chat u up with a smile .....but some woman also tend to be very arrogant,,,,and some guys tend to display a streak of violence....and some tend to demand a cigarrete from u....</p>
              <p>all in all it may seem ok only when its nort dealing with work related issues.i have werked for mainly americans for many many years and found them to be geniuses and i liked the way they werk with not much effort but with maximum productivity and rewards.</p>
              <p>but looking at d australian way of werking...they seriously need help which they by some state of pride and mindset refuse it on the spot.,,,so be it...that is their fate if they choose it that way.</p>
