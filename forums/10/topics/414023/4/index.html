              <p>Singapore's population increased significantly during these few years is because we are taking in cheap foreign labour from 3rd world countries, those cheap labour from China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those cheap foreign labour are the ones taking away Singaporeans' job. Ooops, according to some Minister, they are telling us that these foreign workers are creating more jobs for Singaporeans. But something which I fail to understand is: If these foreign workers are creating jobs for Singaporeans. Why is the unemployment rate higher for citizens compared to foreigners? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>we are not asking gahmen to kick them. but there is no control over the rate they come in. with no minimum wage our middle and lower income group really is annaled even without need to drop our pants. power rangers aside you see 1,300,000, 1/4 of sg population. don;t you feel alarming? dont you see something very wrong. so you tell me tehse 1,300,000 all of them are skiled over our very own sg work force? gahmen already condem workers to be no efficient. so come electon its time we condemn them. voute some kuailan face mp into parliament, and the rest of the votes void them see how howlian they can get. but i think the hwolians don;t care already. after this generation i can say hopeless along the line already/ now its time for GCT to play bad guy. i have only 1 wish. make my area walkover so that at least i can save the time, effort standing and waiting along the queue not for IPHONE or hello kitty. i old cannot standmust provide sit for me to vote.</p>

              <p>They have savings rate, therefore they also have high loan rate, it's that simple.</p>

              <p>Singapore's savings rate is pathetically low just like Japan (deep recession), the home loan rate is also low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But in Australia they have higher pay, a supermarket packer will get AUD15/hour, compared to Singapore's SGD3.50-4.00? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I last remembered you crapping about Australian currency going below AUD1 for each SGD1, you said that the Australian economy is in deep shit. So now the AUD1 trades for SGD1.28, the Australian economy must be doing very well. I am amazed with the ability of Australian Finance Minister, in less than a year, he turned around the Australian dollar and the Australian economy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Seriously, I am doubting your existence as a Singaporean, you sure don't like Singaporean who has gone thrrough our highly regarded education system, you can only be passed off as a half baked PRC with the kind of English you speak. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe it's because you applied for citizenship for Australia and Singapore, Australia rejected your application but Singapore took you in, that's why you have such strong malice for anything Australian. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You only have yourself to blame if Australia rejected your application, it's an English speaking country, you are not going to be able to communicate with much people there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Do you think Australia is suddenly going to see an influx of Indians and Mainland Chinese?  As it is we're constantly raising the standards to keep the intake volume from skyrocketing, and year after year there's always debate about lowering the numbers too much - don't hold your breath waiting for that to change.</p>

Singapore are not happy about it. food prices increase and dependant on regional supplies. why are we not puttig r and d in these and make ourselves sustainable? we can do it and we are doing it on water. its time to work against oil for fuel too. our bank interests andrates goind down, exchange rate aginst currrenies like those countries with cheap cheap labor (vhina / india / pinoy etc) going up.

              <p>Forget the ethics and morality, do you honestly believe that the Singapore government is doing its job?  They're bringing in FTs hand over fist and robbing their own people of jobs just to make a quick buck, and Australians are the ones being shortsighted?  Have you seen how Australia's government is keeping tight control of its immigration quotas and standards to make sure that Australia doesn't have an FT clusterfuck?</p>
              <p>Wake up your ideas - you've got things so arse-end-round you've just given the inside of your rectum a sunburn.</p>
              <p>You're the one letting your petty little ego blind you.  Oh, boo hoo hoo - Singapore offers some money and people are automatically supposed to grovel and thank them? That may work fine within Singapore's little goldfish bowl, but the rules are different in a global playground.  When you consider how much Australia's natural resources alone are worth, Singapore's 8 billion offer is as laughable as a mouse trying to rape an elephant.  They can easily afford to turn away a bothersome visitor, and that's exactly what they're  doing, so grow up and deal with it.</p>

              <p>Oh, for Pete's sake.  Are you really that retarded, or are you being a deliberate fuckwit?</p>
              <p>Singapore is initiating this deal - in the context of this discussion I frankly couldn't give a flying fuck about how this will help the Australians.  The pertinent question here is how it will help Singapore, since Singapore is the one making overtures.</p>
              <p>To wit, if Singapore stands to benefit (the half of  your "how the merger can help us
                                                          both" bullshit that you're lamely sidestepping at present), why are you carrying on like a two-bob watch about what a terrible place Australia is?  One way or another, you're lying, so toughen up and come clean about which one the lie is.</p>
              <p>Lemme dumb it down for you again: SINGAPORE is initiating this, Australia is free to say no for whatever reasons it sees fit.  Just because you think a lousy 8 bill is the be-all-and-end-all doesn't mean that everybody sees it the same way - some people can happily afford to trade off that cash to avoid partnering with unscrupulous characters.  It's as simple as that, so maybe you want to wrap your tiny little head around the REALITY that what Singapore is offering is not a big deal.</p>
              <p>Lemme dumb it down for you even further: you ask a girl out, she says no thanks because, to be blunt, you're a creep.  Are you going to make yourself a pain in the arse pestering her about what the harm is in going out with you?  Are you going to tell her all of her faults to try to make her grateful that you're deeming fit to ask her out?  Do you realise how much of a utter and total deluded loser you would make yourself look?</p>
              <p>Well that's exactly what you're doing now, stupid.  FFS, have some fucking dignity.</p>
              <p>Now is that simple enough for you, or do you need to call mommy to help you with the big words?</p>

NO. i am questioning the basis of their claims, besides 'sidestepping' to honour and ego. for heaven's sake, why dont u put on some well-based arguments of ur own for a change? ranting on and on and trying to twist my words r down right contradictory, not to mention stupid. heres my question: does the merger HARM ANYONE? DID I SAY THE AUSSIES SHOULDNT SAY NO? I AM QUESTIONING THEIR RATIONALE HERE! god, did u take ur pills today? maybe ur eyes r sealed shut by ur ego? why dont u answer that question and stop ranting like a retard?</p></div>

              <p>And why are you questioning the rationale?</p>
              <p>They don't want to deal, and it's entirely their choice to do so.  So what if you in your infinite wisdom believe that there is nothing other than the almighty (and currently trading at a pitiful A$0.78) dollar?  They don't agree with that view, and that's all there is to it.</p>
              <p>The only useful reason for looking at Australia's rationale for saying no is to find a way to make the deal work.  Well, here's a newsflash, sunshine: according to the objections, Singapore would have to drop the death sentence, disband the ISD and open its doors to organisations like Amnesty International for scrutiny. </p>
              <p>So, booster, do you really want to go there?  Do you?</p>

WHY and WHAT justifies their rationale? why wont u answer that? i want to go there, then so what? how then, will u deal with that SENSIBLY AND RATIONALLY, since u have chosen to walk with me and talk with me, my friend?</p></div>
