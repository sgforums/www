              <p>First thing: Australia is not in Asia - you see that big patch of water in between?  Or do you think the US is in Asia too? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Second thing, if the Ang Mos leave, the land goes back to the Aborigines, who have been around a helluva lot longer than the Chinese, so you still lose.</p>
              <p>Third, if you get your wish, there'll be a lot fewer - how did you put it - "blonde girls with big tits" - in the neighbourhood for you to drool over.  In any case, given your attitude, it's no wonder why they won't touch you with a barge pole.  They're only racist if flaming arseholes count as a race.</p>

              <p>What happen after chasing off the Chinese,the Australians start to kill themselves?</p>
              <p>Although Ang Mo like to brag about how humanity or how good they are,the most notorious,vicious n ruthless crimes are committed by them,among themselves.I remember got this 1 case happen in Australia,whereby a bunch of gays kidnapped young boys n raped them.Then,they stuck a bottle into the victims butts n literally let them bleed to death.</p>
              <p>Another happen in Russia,a crazy man hit n kill men n women with hammer,strike the hammer into their head n beat them to death.Think the victims reach a total number of 60+.And also many such vicious crimes happen in America.</p>
              <p>I dare not say there is no such crimes happen in Asia.Probably,the Asian governments are covering them up.But if they are covering them,they are covering them too well.</p>
              <p>Back to the point,if i am an Australian Ang Mo,would i want my neighbour to be the killers that i mention above?Even if they were also Ang Mo?......Really,No Thanks.</p>

              <p>What happen after chasing off the Chinese,the Australians start
              to kill themselves?</p>
              <p>Although Ang Mo like to brag about how humanity or how good they
              are,the most notorious,vicious n ruthless crimes are committed by
              them,among themselves.I remember got this 1 case happen in
              Australia,whereby a bunch of gays kidnapped young boys n raped
              them.Then,they stuck a bottle into the victims butts n literally
              let them bleed to death.</p>
              <p>Another happen in Russia,a crazy man hit n kill men n women with
              hammer,strike the hammer into their head n beat them to death.Think
              the victims reach a total number of 60+.And also many such
              vicious crimes happen in America.</p>
              <p>I dare not say there is no such crimes happen in
              Asia.Probably,the Asian governments are covering them up.But if
              they are covering them,they are covering them too well.</p>
              <p>Back to the point,if i am an Australian Ang Mo,would i want my
              neighbour to be the killers that i mention above?Even if they were
              also Ang Mo?......Really,No Thanks.</p>

              <p>Right, so you acknowledge that such crimes may happen in Asia, so what's your point?  Leave the Asians to kill the Asians and the Australians to kill the Australians?</p>
              <p>As an Asian, would you  want your neighbours to be the killers that you mention above?  Even if they were
              also Asian?  Really, yes please?</p>

              <p>face it, the aussies and singaporean can never get along together happily. the way each side does things r too different and theres no way this will ever change. its human nature and the very reason why wars occur. ideollogy. this topic can go on and on, bbut never resolved. there is just no clear cut answer to this.</p>
              <p>let me reply ur question on the merger of sg and AU with this question then: can the north korea ever be reconciled to the south without war? as stalin put it, the war between communism and capitalism is inevitable. the idea here is ideolgy then.</p>
              <p>who are we singaporeans to question the way aussies live and work? then again, what right  do the aussies have to question the way we do things? if this bitter gap between ideology and tradition cannot be breached, there is no real way we can live together in peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all of u, stop trying to dig up dirt on both sides. bottomline here, the aussies arent saints and neither are the singaporeans.</p>

              <p><br>that is true, but i have to agree with what gedanken who as usual rudely and ruthlessly tried to point out, no one is perfect, even asians arent perfect. there are tons of things asian do that they arent proud of. go on trying to dig up dirt on the aussies and gedanken will prob go red in the face and explode with vulgarities whilst throwing back at u everything asians do that arent nicey ^^</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and FYI gedanken: aussies ARE racist, like it or not. want me then to point out every racial conflict that happened to push thru my point?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
