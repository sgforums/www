              <p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>A book review of " The Singapore Miracle" by Australian Rodney King which appeared in The Nation, A Bangkok <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">Independent</span> Newspaper, July 2<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-error">nd</span>, 2007. I haven't read it yet, but it appears a must read to know what Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_2" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew's "miracle" Singapore really is. Courtesy of the Singapore Democratic Party website. Book available at Select Books, <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Tanglin</span> Shopping Center, Singapore. For other possible bookshops, please
              contact Singapore Democratic Party. It is also available on line, of
              course.<br><br>The reference to "Lion" in the title is because
              Singapore calls itself, "The Lion City". With Singaporeans today living
              in fear of it's strongman Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew, a more appropriate name would have been "The Sheep City" but that is beside the point.<br><br><span style="font-size: 180%; color: #ffff66;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Lion without teeth</span><br></strong></span><br><strong>Singapore
              is brilliant at self-promotion, says an Australian analyst, but it is
              no financial dynamo. Much of the world has been deluded by its hollow
              roars of success<br></strong><br><strong>Singapore, the modern
              city-state known for its authoritarian ways and conservative
              government, has a reputation for functional efficiency and capitalist
              success.<br><br></strong><strong></strong><strong>The smallest member of <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_5" class="blsp-spelling-error">Asean</span> geographically is often touted as one of Asia's great success stories -
              a gleaming city that emerged from the tropical swamps under a strict
              but wise autocrat, Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew.<br></strong><br><strong>But
              a fascinating new book by Australian Rodney King looks deeper into the
              "the Singapore Miracle" and reveals that a lot of the city's supposed
              successes are in fact hot air.<br></strong><br><strong>Reports of
              Singapore being a dynamic commercial melting pot are, King says, simply
              the oft-repeated claims of a government that tolerates little dissent,
              and city leaders who may actually have stifled the sort of
              entrepreneurial dynamism you get in places such as <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Hong</span> Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan and maybe even Bangkok.<br><br></strong><strong></strong><strong>King is a Perth journalist who lived in Singapore for a number of years and worked briefly at the Straits Times.<br></strong><br><strong>"The
              Singapore Miracle - Myth and Reality" casts doubt on the city-state's
              claims of cutting-edge efficiency, global competitiveness, economic
              freedom and transparency. Most Singaporeans are not as affluent as
              their government makes out, King says in his extensively documented,
              500-page tome.<br></strong><br><strong>"Books about Singapore usually
              praise its achievements or criticise its authoritarian rule," he
              writes. "But few ever probe its widely publicised claims that it is a
              brilliant success that other countries should follow."<br></strong><br><strong>King
              argues that Singapore's workforce productivity is often mediocre and
              well below that of the West and Asian economies such as <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">Hong</span> Kong.<br></strong><br><strong>"The
              country also displays endemic inefficiencies at both macro and
              micro-economic levels. The performance of the construction, financial
              and service sectors is second-rate, while Singapore Airlines does not
              deserve the top rankings it receives."<br></strong><br><strong>Singapore,
              he says, has "a dependent and underdeveloped economy". Multinational
              companies and state enterprises predominate, and the economy has "low
              entrepreneurial and innovative capacities and an under-educated
              workforce".<br></strong><br><strong>The city-state's supposed affluence is also largely a myth.<br></strong><br><strong>"About
              30 per cent of the population still lives in poverty by Western living
              standards," he says. And Singapore's Housing Development Board, Central
              Provident Fund and state-run health schemes have severe shortcomings.<br></strong><br><strong>What Singapore has been good at, he says, is marketing itself.<br></strong><br><strong>"Singapore
              has brilliantly sold itself to the world as an amazing success story to
              attract foreign investment and talent. It's managed to get most Western
              think-tanks and ratings agencies to give it top scores for such things
              as competitiveness, transparency, economic freedom, etc.<br></strong><br><strong>"These
              bodies reflect the interests of foreign capital and their methodologies
              are shoddy and incompetent at times. And the statistics they are fed by
              the Singaporean authorities are often dubious and designed to put
              Singapore in the best light.<br><br></strong><strong></strong><strong>"To sell itself to the world Singapore has also denigrated and patronised its lesser-developed neighbours."<br></strong><br><strong>Singapore was hardly an economic backwater when Lee <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Kuan</span> Yew took power in 1959, says King, who has no special regard for the
              premier, who held office through his People's Action Party (PAP) for 31
              years. Lee is now known as a "Minister mentor" and elder statesman.<br></strong><br><strong>"Lee
              is always carefully listened to, and rather too politely ... his views
              and lectures often receive reverential attention from opinion lenders,
              American think-tank experts and others who often have little direct
              first-hand knowledge of Singapore."<br></strong><br><strong>In the
              early to mid-'60s, Singapore had one of the highest living standards in
              Asia, with one of the best-educated and hardest-working populations.
              Its strategic location and magnificent harbour - with extensive
              British-built shipyard facilities - alongside one of the world's
              busiest sea-lanes, meant that it became a natural transport hub. And
              these features were a great asset for industrialisation.<br></strong><br><strong>The
              strategies Lee used to develop Singapore were an open-door policy to
              foreign capital and export orientation to tap into global trade. They
              helped the city-state enjoy double-digit growth from the '60s to the
              '80s.<br></strong><br><strong>But the Lion City became heavily
              dependent on foreign capital while state enterprises focused on
              infrastructure and "nation-building concerns".<br></strong><br><strong>Entrepreneurial
              and innovative capacities have suffered because of a lack of domestic
              competition and the predominance of state bodies. Public servants
              running state boards often have little experience of the private sector
              "and no idea how to run a business", King and other analysts say.<br></strong><br><strong>"The
              local private sector, normally the seedbed of innovation in most market
              economies, is stunted and starved of venture capital," King writes.
              "The country's capacity for indigenous research and development and
              entrepreneurial and innovative endeavours remains limited.<br></strong><br><strong>"Heavy
              state control of the economy is exercised through an extensive layer of
              state enterprises. The state imposes this control through layers of red
              tape.<br><br></strong><strong></strong><strong>"The government also
              manages a big chunk of the people's savings through forced savings …
              and owns 72 per cent of the city-state's land. Moreover, the government
              controls the unions and most of the labour force. Equally mythical are
              Singapore's claims to being transparent. Nothing could be more untrue.
              The operations of Singapore's government and bureaucracy are swathed in
              secrecy."<br></strong><br><strong>King counters claims of high
              home-ownership levels, saying 86 per cent of Singaporeans rent
              government flats from the Housing Development Board on 99-year leases.<br></strong><br><strong>The author is provocative but very thorough. Every aspect of life in the city-state is analysed in detail.<br><br></strong><strong></strong><strong>"Singapore's
              flaws are hidden by the PAP state's vigorous marketing campaign," he
              says. And most local and foreign journalists "are usually too
              restricted or intimidated by government defamation laws and other
              penalties to challenge or refute" the "river of statistics" promoting
              Singapore's achievements.<br></strong><br><strong>There is a wealth of
              statistical and anecdotal material in this book to counter the official
              lines - or lies. Economists and anyone with an interest in Singapore
              should take note. This book could change the way you view our
              industrious neighbour.<br></strong><br><strong>But, perhaps the saddest
              facet of King's work is not what he's written, but the fact that the
              people who most need to read his book may find it hard to get, if
              Singaporean bookshops refuse to stock it, as he expects. </strong></p>

              <p>Rodney is not incorrect but seems to appear one sided in his
              arguement. Yes. There is too much control and regulation in almost
              anything, state enterprises etc. Everyone planted in state enterprises
              are their own, who comes from what they think are Super As scholar.
              Lack of creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. And they continue to pay
              lip service to these flaws.<br><br>And PAP is obsessed with holding on to power either through state enterprises, fear, intimidation or libel suits.<br><br>Singapore's
              strengths are in its location, workforce, efficiency and political
              stability. Athough these strengths are diminishing as other neighbours
              are also copying our strengths and lowering their tax rate. <br><br>Why would not a company go to Indonesia, Malaysia or Thailand? <br>These places - lack of infrastructure, political stability, and internal fightings etc.<br><br>Hongkong
              is our nearest challenger and in a way, although under China rule, they
              continue to flourish with a lot of freedom to express and they do not
              regulate much of their economy. Hongkong is accelerating ahead of
              Singapore, Singapore is too pre-occupied with control and PAP
              dominance. And this could be the start of a fall for Singapore and with
              this financial crisis, the cracks are starting to show as Singapore is
              the first economy to go into depression.<br><br>Scholars and elites are
              groomed to lead and the PAP thinks this is a fool proof formula. In the
              past, there had been evidence of success but now? And in the like of
              Mdm Ho Ching (a scholar), PM Wife who made disastrous decisions in
              buying Citibank, Merril Lynch etc in the last few months, amounting to
              enormous losses, more than 100B.<br><br>The Lee dynasty wants to hold
              on to power, possibly lining up grandson to the hot seat with a
              possibility of another seat warmer after the current PM Lee leaves
              office. In modern China, President Chiang, President Hu, they dont do
              such passing of baton to their immediate family and this can be
              explained why China is emerging as super power, although it is a
              communist state. Whereas Singapore is looking almost dynastic, moving
              step back to ancient China where kings would pass hot seat back to his
              descendant.<br><br>While many Singaporeans are educated to be selfish
              and fearful of politics, our inactions would eventually cost the whole
              country to spiral down.</p>
