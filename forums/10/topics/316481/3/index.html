              <p><em>But Prachanda stressed that the Maoists <strong>did not believe in a one-party state.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>He said they had concluded that "multi-partyism is a must, even in socialism" and that <strong>without competition, a vibrant society could not be created.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The Maoists have said time and again that such <strong>pluralism is necessary.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>Another senior Maoist leader, CP Gajurel, recently told the BBC that communism had failed in other countries precisely because it <strong>did not allow competition, adding that it would be normal for the party to lose some elections, then come back to win others.</strong></em></p>

              <div id="articleBody" class="artText"><span> <span style="color: #666666;"><strong>Starting from July, fines from $20 up to $1,000,  jail</strong></span>
              <div> </div>
              Nazry Bahrawi<br>nazry@mediacorp.com.sg
              <div> </div>
              FARE evaders on public buses will be fined from July. The Public
                  Transport Council (PTC) says those caught dodging or under-paying fares
                  will be fined $20. A higher penalty of $50 awaits those guilty of
                  misusing concession cards, such as those meant for students and
                  National Service personnel.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Passengers
                  who cannot settle the amount on the spot will be issued a notice to pay
                  within 14 days, failing which they would be liable for a fine of up to
                  $1,000. Repeat offenders face double the fine and/or jail of up to six
                  months.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Although such a penalty
                  has been in place for train rides since 1987, there is no penalty for
                  bus rides. The new penalty will "remove this disparity between the two
                  modes of public transport", said the PTC in a statement on Friday.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Last
                  year, an estimated $61,000 in fines was collected from 2,700 errant
                  train commuters. Some 100 offenders who failed to pay the fine were
                  prosecuted, said the Land Transport Authority.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              However,
                  before the new penalty kicks in, SBS Transit, SMRT and TransitLink will
                  run a public education programme this month and next month to ensure
                  that Singaporeans familiarise themselves with the penalties, added the
                  council.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Singapore's public
                  transport operators have been losing an estimated $9 million annually
                  to fare cheats. The decision to penalise such cheats comes more than
                  two years after the issue was hotly debated in Parliament.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Asked
                  why it took such a long time to implement the fine, the PTC said it
                  "takes time" to develop a penalty fee regime that has "sufficient
                  safeguards and appropriate allocation of responsibilities".
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              PTC
                  chairman Gerard Ee told Today that ticket inspectors and bus drivers
                  had to be trained to undertake enforcement, while also ensuring
                  commuters' interests.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Despite
                  the two-month-long public education programme, some still have
                  concerns. While the programme is "useful and needed", Dr Amy Khor, MP
                  for Hong Kah GRC, believes that some leniency should be accorded
                  because some commuters would still be ignorant "even after a couple of
                  months".
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Dr Khor was one of the
                  eight MPs who had spoken up on the fines when it was first proposed in
                  October 2005. She had urged that inspectors be trained properly so they
                  would not end up treating commuters like criminals.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Stressing this on Friday, she told Today that "older folk" especially must be treated compassionately.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Commuter Muhd Nauruz, 35, believes the new fines will add to the stress of a possible economic downturn.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              "The
                  Government can think of a less harsh way of handling fare evaders, like
                  making them pay the full fare instead of $20," counter-proposed the
                  human resource executive, who travels to work by bus everyday.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              Mr
                  Nauruz is also concerned that commuters would be unfairly punished for
                  faulty ezlink cards, referring to a Today report on Wednesday that
                  featured complaints by motorists who were fined for faulty CashCards in
                  their in-vehicle units.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              But at
                  least one commuter, Mr D Kong, welcomed the new penalty structure. The
                  35-year-old executive said that on his occasional bus trips home, he
                  had seen some commuters cheating on their fares by tapping it on the
                  card readers long before alighting.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              "This new fine system is fair. Those who want to cheat will now think twice," he said.
              <div style="visibility: hidden;">.</div>
              According to the PTC, commuters can appeal their penalty fee within 14 days of its imposition.
