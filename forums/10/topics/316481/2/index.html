              <p><br>its sometimes difficult to cycle on the pavement so your parents most likely will assume u cycling on the road and when that happens its a worry. furthermore just imagine if u cycle on the pavement then must navigate your way thru c ppl walk slowly or block yr way must ring bell. then they dont want 2 siam, u cut onto the grass. worse got dog shit on the grass yr tyre smelly. or worse the ppl hear yr bell c u coming they panic scared u knock them down they move onto the grass then step on dog shit sure take the shoe throw at u.</p>

              <p>Sometimes I feel like challenging the notion of "going" to work.  Here we have a work force that has so much access to IT, and a state of the art telecommunications backbone, but people are still unable to work from home.</p>
              <p>Of course, this doesn't apply across the board.  But imagine if all those who didn't need to be physically at work in order work, just stop doing so, how much savings they'd have in terms of transport costs.</p>
              <p>Sigh.  IT Hub... yeah.</p>

              <p>the claim they have to be accountable to the shareholders.  as such, we know gahmen run the public transport companies as business.    As long as PAP rules, there is not going to be any positive change that will benefit the commuters.</p>

              socialism" and that <strong>without competition, a vibrant society could not be
              created.</strong> </em></p>
              <p><em> The Maoists have said time and again that such <strong>pluralism is necessary.</strong> </em></p>

              some elections, then come back to win others.</strong></em></p>
