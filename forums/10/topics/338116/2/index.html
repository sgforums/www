              <p>I don't think OCBC owes the old lady any duty of care, there is a case in N. America about and old lady being cheated by a druggie man while withdrawing money from the bank.</p>

              <p>Apparently the old lady made alot of withdrawals which were absconded by another man for drugs, the old lady later filed a claim against the bank citing duty of care was breached by the bank, but the Superior Court dismissed the claim. The old lady then filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, but her appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court with the decision of the Superior Court upheld.</p>

              <p>Coming from you I find this extremely hilarious. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Since when have you started understanding English? And you want to decrypt legal language? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Ermmm...., under which ambit of the law would you prescribe your "verdict"? Since you said "I think the uS bank shall be liable if there were any signs that the woman had been druged or under threat to take out the $$". Duty of care or breach of contractual obligations? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seems like lionnoisy has taken a penchant for legal musings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Suggest you go get a proper primary and secondary education before you proceed on your legal career. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Seriously my dear, what you think of this case is inconsequential and immaterial as far as I am concerned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It is precisely tat there is a fuzzy line on the limit of duty of care of the bank exists and tat is why there were court cases fought between banks and customers. U can see in the court case shown by maruzio tat customers can sue the bank for nt exercising tis right and tat is why  OCBC decides to intervene in tis case. If u look at maruzio website, u can find many many suit case between man and bank such as <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Griffin v. Centreville Savings Bank etc. I am not sure all cases ended up with the bank having no responsibility at all</span></p>
              <p>Note tat there r many differences between the 2 cases. First, the junkie is no matter wat his real son and guardian while in tis case the adopted girl can be a virtual stranger. Second, it can easily be shown tat there is foreseeability tat the money can be cheated by tis adopted daughter of hers if she is mentally incapacited. Third she refused to let a psychatrist see her condition or let the bank inteview her. Fourth she claims she wanna take care of tis old lady then she can instead just draw 2000 every day till she die to take care of her. Why draw all the money at the same time ? Fifth maruzio case has the old lady took out he money at small amount over a long interval which is less suspicious. Since no one knows the details, the best thing is to let the court decides. DO u want the old lady to be cheated ? Tis is not a small matter</p>
              <p>Lastly I think it is silly to say tat the gov is trying to steal all the money. First, she can enact a will and can give the money to anything or anyone such as her dog or a complete stranger or to tis daughter and the gov cannot take the money.  In fact she can very well already have a will enacted when she is 60 or something when she is more sane. And if the gov really desperately wanna take the money, tis matter will be very low key and will not be published in the newspaper</p>

              <p>Well I think u really read with one eye shut. Throughout the replies, there r many hints and suggestions or sarcasm on the gov.The NTUC is gov controlled. CPF (which u r quiet on) is gov controlled. Even a few forumers such as shotgun and skythewood can see there r sarcasms on the gov when it has nothing to do with it. Now another guy mention if there r any key personnel with the gov. Again it serves nothing on the purpose of the thread and judging from the replies he made throughout, it is against the gov.</p>
              <p><strong>So I just talk about the point I mentioned before tat is has nothing to do with the gov but rather, the protecting of the poor lady and people shouldn't push and make decisions beause they hate the gov.</strong> Some people believed the gov want to suck money and tat is THE ONLY REASON why they r constantly brought into the picture. Why can't i say against such an act ? If I managed to convinced people tat the gov is not gonna get tis money, then the gov will not be involved isn't it ? Then the focus is on whether should we prevent cheat or prevent abuse of bank's power (which is relevant). Should we politicise the matter and force it to be linked with the gov and let the adopted girl girl the money who can very well be a sham ?</p>
              <p>And wat is your point in preventing people from asking the thread to delinear from the gov ? Aren't u directly supporting people to politicise the matter and link it to gov ? Wat is your intention ?</p>
              <p>Lastly, if u had read properly, I had mentioned "now even" OTC is involved in tis case when it clearly has nothing to do with it. Did I say tat reply is after my previous reply ?</p>
