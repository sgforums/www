The argument of 24-hr standby is totally irrelevant as they aren't always recalled (can compensate with off-days anyway), and the policy applies to policemen doing office-hour staff work as well. Almost definitely, our men-in-blue do not face much 'dangerous' actions on the streets  as foreign police forces like HK and Msia.</strong><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>44.           The Home Affairs Uniformed Services, comprising the Police, Prisons, Civil Defence and Narcotics services, are lagging their benchmarks by up to 26% in certain grades. As the gap is large, these services require major adjustments. These services are now dealing with more complex and challenging tasks given the threat of terrorism and the increased security measures required.  We need to pay our home team officers competitively, so that the uniformed services will be well-staffed, and able to address any emergency.  The first step of this adjustment will be carried out now, amounting to 10-13%.<br><br>http://app.sprinter.gov.sg/data/pr/20070409992.htm<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Annual vacation leave of 18 days and casual leave of 14 days<br>http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/enforce/enforce_benefits.htm</div>

The argument of 24-hr standby is totally irrelevant as they aren't always recalled (can compensate with off-days anyway), and the policy applies to policemen doing office-hour staff work as well. Almost definitely, our men-in-blue do not face much 'dangerous' actions on the streets  as foreign police forces like HK and Msia.</strong><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>44.           The Home Affairs Uniformed Services, comprising the Police, Prisons, Civil Defence and Narcotics services, are lagging their benchmarks by up to 26% in certain grades. As the gap is large, these services require major adjustments. These services are now dealing with more complex and challenging tasks given the threat of terrorism and the increased security measures required.  We need to pay our home team officers competitively, so that the uniformed services will be well-staffed, and able to address any emergency.  The first step of this adjustment will be carried out now, amounting to 10-13%.<br><br>http://app.sprinter.gov.sg/data/pr/20070409992.htm<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Annual vacation leave of 18 days and casual leave of 14 days<br>http://www.spf.gov.sg/career/enforce/enforce_benefits.htm[/b]</blockquote>Since the police officers are under paid then I think those in PDU are also under paid and overworked...<br><br>Yes... those dogs in the dog units... I think their bones allowances should be increase 33% too.... and they too have annual leaves and casual leave or so called doggy leave...<br><br>They should be given more bones and more meats and grooming sessions...<br><br>We really need to compare them with the top bred in the market... and they should also be given a performance bonus e.g. find more drugs, pirated vcds...</div>
