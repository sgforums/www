You might not know this, but the massive pay rises only affects the senior officers [ie inspector, asp and above], scholars and their ilk. The typical frontliners get much, much lesser. A pittance of 'few tens of dollars', as put by one forumite in another thread.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>For example, in the past many municipal duties like security patrolling were carried out everywhere by the police. Now police is excused from patrolling private estates who is expected to employ their own security guards and when there is a crime the security firms could lose their licence.</strong></blockquote>That's where you're very, very wrong. They do conduct patrols at private estates, regardless of whether there are security personnel employed or otherwise.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Similarly all the fire safety duties and alterations and additions and electrical and work site safety controls were passed to the citizens and even checking on and application for public entertainment licensing within private housing estates have been transferred to the various management corporations whose staff could be fined for failing to perform certain duties.</strong></blockquote>Shouldn't civil defence come into the picture for fire safety matters? Anyway, application for public entertainment licenses is gone through police for people living in hdb estates. For private estates...  The management of the said estates would act like what town council is doing for hdb estates. So naturally things which involve permits like entertainment licences, permits for renovations will go through the estate management anyway.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Immigration check to prevent entries of illegal immigrants were passed on to private landlords who may be fined or jailed for renting out flats to illegal immigrants when traditionally policemen were responsible to check on them through the check points and other hideouts.</strong></blockquote>There is a reason why ICA is set up, to specialise in such matters. However, having said that, you will be surprised to know that the Police are the ones doing the bulk of these Immigration Act-related offences.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Mosquito breeding caused by lack of proper treatments of public drains were not passed to the flat owners as officers' failures to perform checks were spared whereas flat owners could be heavily fined.</strong></blockquote>This one is under jurisdiction of NEA. However, if need be, Police can also take charge of the situation. However, the only thing they can do is to obtain the particulars of the offender, and the details of the offence. After that, they can only forward the information to NEA, who will then conduct their own investigations and process the punishment meted out.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Housing board has transferred their responsibilities for defective construction to flat purchasers who could be fined or jailed for any incidents of window dropping.</strong></blockquote>Police involvement could be because of the circumstances of the case indicate that there is enough grounds to charge the person for an ofence of rash act, or negligence which allowed this to happen. And... what does this have to do with the Police again?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Just imagine by doing less and lesser all our policemen and ministers are still claiming to be worth more and more and many of them are asking to be paid higher than the S$300,000.00 pa for sitting around and trying to cater to passers-by enquiries which they call successful policing which deserves more pay rise.</strong></blockquote>You're wrong about doing lesser and lesser. The thing is, they still do the same things. It's just that nowadays, instead of just the Police, other agencies also have powers to take enforcement actions for certain matters.<br><br>So the Police do the same amount of things, possibly more nowadays, but there are certain matters which can now be enforced by other relevant government bodies.<br><br>The Police's job is to enforce all sorts of laws under the sun. But whether they are the lone agency to enforce it or have other agencies to help enforce it is another matter altogether.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
