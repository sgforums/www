            <div class='col-md body'>I have a very urgent matter. 14th January 2007 is my ord day. i was an NSF in the SCDF and i drive the RED RHINO and met an accident on around december.<br><br>I claimed that the steering wheel was locked and not functioning and therefore i was unable to turn my vehicle and eventually hit the curb and mounted.<br><br>This result to dents on 2 rims, 2 tyres were torn, steering box break. ( from what i observed ). After the reviews from confort delgro ( SCDF vehilce repair supporting agency ) , the claim alot more... which resulted in a repair fee of almost and unbelivable $30k.<br><br>I was told to pay $500 to clear this case or i would be charged. I was not allowed to get back my IC unless i settles this problem.<br><br>May i know how can the SCDF be so unreasonable and do such ridiculous thing?<br><br>They wants you to drive the appliance just because they were shortage of drivers, as of good will, u help them and made their vehicle able to turn out. And when unforseen incidents occured, they wants you pay for the damages.<br><br>Furthermore the most hilarious thing is, they found out the steering box is broken, and i claimed i was unable to steer thats why my vehicle was unable to turn and result to an accident. Why could not relate that the malfunction steering box may have caused this whole tradegy? However they confirmed that this incident was due to human error.<br><br>I'm really unsatisfied with this whole outcome. May i know is there any ways i could appeal or seek for help to handle this problem ??<br><br>I really hope there are kind souls out there who can help me and give me some appreciating ideas. And i believed there are much more SCDF NSFs or Staffs out there who had enountered such unfair problems just like me, but probably in other areas.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reading your account - and on surface of the account, I give my opinion:<br><br>a. did you check the vehicle prior to taking over and driving off at the MT line?<br>b. are you trained drive the vehicle,i.e. have you gone through orientation to handle the vehicle?  You mentioned, out of good will, you agreed to help, so maybe your superior or whoever instructed you to handle the vehicle must share some of the blame.<br><br>c. you mentioned you mount kerb, I gather you tried to avoid something?  Its not very clear from your account.  Was a traffic report lodged?<br><br>d. in Army, if you feel unjust, you could feedback to higher authorities or SAF hotline, is there a similar setup for SCDF?<br><br>e. last but not least, see MP.  I know some ppl tried and got some attention.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a) yes i checked, but only the exteriors and so on.<br>b) i was trained, with class 4 RDL ( only can drive class 4 scdf appliances )<br><br>c) i wasnt trying to avoid something, my steering was locked, and it was approaching a bend. AS my steering was locked, i could not steer and the appliance couldn't turn. And eventually it mounted curb. The impact of knocking and rubbing on the curb caused the rim to disfigure and dent, the tyres to tear off.<br><br>The review add on that the steering box was broken. i was wondering why the claimed that it was a human error and why not a mechanical fault since it could be the malfunction steering system that caused me unable to steer and eventually this incident occured.</div>

Sounds like you tried to turn the vehicle but the vehicle didn't turn. Not really a human error. But maybe you could have brake.<br><br>Anyway, comfortdelgo is out to suck money one. Since they are not under SAF, hence the government, they'll try to suck the government money as much as possible.</div>
