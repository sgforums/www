            <div class='col-md body'><strong>This will help Singapore raise new breed of entrepreneurs, says SM<br></strong><br>THE public sector is too talent-heavy and <strong>up to half its scholars should be released into the private sector after six or seven years, said Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.<br></strong><strong><br>They should be sent into the private sector to become entrepreneurs and not just managers, he added.<br></strong><br><br>Right now, too many of Singapore's able are professionals when the country actually needs more business people.<br><br>While the system has worked well before with the Government retaining the best brains, the next phase of development must focus on producing more entrepreneurs, he said.<br><br>This way, they will not only have a solid knowledge of how government works but also 'the brain power and the drive' in the private sector.<br><br>He made these points in an interview with Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao, Channel U and Channel NewsAsia, broadcast last night.<br><br>He noted how in global competitive rankings, such as those by the well-regarded Institute for Management Development (IMD), Singapore scores very highly on its public sector systems, from its laws to services.<br><br>But it does not fare well on other criteria such as the level of entrepreneurship and venture capital.<br><br>'What does that mean? That means too much concentration of talent, drive and energy in the public sector,' the Senior Minister said.<br><br>It meant Singapore had the systems right, which was necessary at the beginning. But now, the Government could still provide youths with scholarships, but release them after they have worked for six or seven years.<br><br>'Let half go, let one third go and get them to be entrepreneurs, not just managers.'<br><br>Every year, the Public Service Commission awards 50 to 60 scholarships but there are also several hundred others given out by other government agencies and government-linked companies.<br><br>The idea of pushing scholarship holders back into the private sector has been raised before, most recently by sub-committees within the Economic Review Committee.<br><br>The sub-committees had debated whether it was time to change the scholarship system but no decision was taken, other than an affirmation that the public sector still needed its share of the top brains.<br><br>The subject of entrepreneurs emerged during the interview Mr Lee gave to talk about the 10th anniversary of the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP). He is now in Suzhou for the celebrations tomorrow.<br><br>On Suzhou, he said one lesson learnt has been that there must be 'total alignment' of interests at the central, provincial and local levels before starting projects.<br><br>When the SIP started in 1994, Singapore controlled 65 per cent of the stakes, and China the rest. The idea was for Singapore to transfer its software and knowledge to the Chinese, using SIP as a model development.<br><br>But the park soon ran into problems, which were only solved after the controlling stakes were reversed.<br><br>Mr Lee said that if this had been done from the start, there could have been a higher level of software transfer. Still, he added: 'We never walked away from the project, we put our best efforts in and solved the problem. Therefore, I would say because we had all these difficulties, there is a deeper appreciation on both sides that we are long-term players. We are not fly-by-night operators. When we promise, we deliver, whatever the difficulties.'<br><br>He said the value of being involved in Suzhou is to have it now as an icon of the 'Singapore quality, integrity and capability'. He also revealed that China now wants Singapore to go into projects in the west and north-east. It is considering them but must not take on more than it can deliver, he added.<br><br>He also underscored how the Suzhou experience had forged relations at the top: 'If we have not had Suzhou, they would not have understood or they would not have been so convinced that we have something to offer. Just think of it, we're three, four million with the workers from abroad, and they're 1,300 million.<br><br>'So, why should they meet us at that high level? But I think that they have found that although we are small, we have systems which they can apply throughout many of their hundreds of cities.'<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>not so sure if this will work.. pushing ppl into private sector?<br><br>not all kinds of so called talents can thrive in the business world..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most entrepreneurs I know don't have University education. They have only "O' level or less. I feel that it is inborn, they must have the drive &amp; willingness to take risks &amp; suffer cos first few years very difficult. Some companies  start as small 1-man business, &amp; they have to sacrifice by having very low pay &amp; doing everything themselves from delivery, accounting to marketing</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think even if they free up scholars also not able to really turn the tables on the non-entrepreneural culture in Singapore...<br><br>I have come acrossed them many time in my job. As some of the projects that i am involved with are quite high tech and so involve a need to be adventurous. They have certain working mentalities which is a MAJOR stumbling block if they are to become entrepreneurs.. esp those junior ones and maybe mid-mgt..<br><br>1. I was involve in many meetings involving stat board pple.. Those in the junior and mid-mgt positions follow the leader. Thye have this unique ability to sense the tune that the "top-most" civil servant is singing and then everyone will jump aboard to criticise and sink the idea or to add comments on how good the proposal/ idea is. So far, i have not seen someone who is adventurous enough to sing a different tune.. He will just be shot down by those who followed the crowd. Such a mentality is crippling to the growth of the individual. i.e. the scholars in this case. So if u bring them out after they finish their bond, they will need time to readjust and think on a totally different mindset and really dare to take risk and be different. Those who can really be different and voice opinions are those at the top. I wonder if they really release scholars.. Which level they will release at.. So maybe its still too early to tell<br><br>2. They dun take risk. Cos its such a comfy position up there and secure. So even those at the lower echelons will take the "sure-safe" route and dig their heels deep into the organization. Many ideas are thrown out cos they dun see beyond the value of how it can add security to their position in the stat boards. They stick to all the rules and "get back to their superiors". They are no decision makers or risk-takers. At least, the culture in the civil service do not allow them to.. so i ponder if they can really make a big impact when thrown into the big open seas..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm...... what can I say? I don't quite think the world of scholars but I suppose there are ppl meant to be scholars and ppl meant to be those who dare to try. think they should keep their scholars n not try to make things worse. Let us who dare to try, try, and scholars, go do their thang.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If they really want to promote entreprenuership, my opinions are:<br><br>- create demand. (No demand -&gt; no fund -&gt; no continuity of businesses)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>=&gt; when there are demands and opportunities, we will see more entrepreneurs.<br>=&gt; There should be more small-scale demands/opportunites for entreprenuers with little fund to establish themselves. Those potential ones will evolve.<br>=&gt; do not set bureacratic rules that requires entrepreneurs or their businesses to have certain financial assets, etc to those small scale demands/opportunities.<br><br>- create knowledge/business thru' networking.<br>=&gt; Create opportunities for big &amp; small businesses or entreprenuers to learn from each others/'indirect internship'.<br><br>- encourage/promotes/publishes/advertise outstanding products/services created/produced by these entrepreneurs/businesses (create awareness or branding)<br><br>- time to take more risks<br>=&gt; do not reject a potential person because of certain criterias:<br>E.g<br>he/she do not know how to write a business plan;<br>he/she does not guranteed to meet certain criterias, etc.<br>=&gt; instead, listen to the potential person: his/her dream, his/her idealogy, his/her plan, his/her products/services, his/her personal attributes (drive, personality, mentality, his working/networking background, etc), his/her analysis of the business, his/her lacking in the business (financial, skillset, network, etc).</div>
