              what, they monitor all the phone calls? how many people will you need to monitor all the phone calls? 1000? 2000? you want to tell me a computer is able to moniter the phone conversation, and highlight mas to human operator?

              <p>If the only reason why people argue over here is to gratify their egos, instead of having a constructive dialogue, then it really reflects on the state of the social consciousness.</p>

              <p>no lah... not using satalite lah...</p>
              <p>the company i am working for have been trying to sell this service to telco for quite sometime liao. Duno this service provided by singtel is done by my company or not. Need to check it out.</p>
              <p>Anyway, just for ur infor, it is done using mobile cell id networks. using some math formular, user position can be pin point to up to 50m without the use of GPS device. Our company design and built this alogrithm[gprx] into the phone sim card. In short, once activate, it can tell the position of the mobile.</p>
              <p>With a software and server map data, it can provide alot of service, base on current location, at your finger tip.</p>
              <p>Unlike gps, it work for indoor too. Combine that with gps.... the range of  new age service that can b provided is rather.... huge</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE Telecommunciations has launched a new service to allow its mobile customers to track the physical location of other SingTel customers, with their permission.</p>
              <p>Launched on Wednesday, the Locator service will display up to three designated users' locations on the phone via an interactive map.</p>
              <p>Locator, said SingTel vice president for consumer marketing Wong Soon Nam, will give 'parents and caregivers ... peace-of-mind of knowing the whereabouts of their elderly and young family members anytime easily, without calling or sending an SMS to them.'</p>
              <p>To prevent abuse, the person being tracked has the option to allow or deny the service when it is being activated. He will also get a SMS reminder that he is being tracked monthly, and can deactivate the service anytime.</p>
              <p>Only users on SingTel's mobile network will be tracked, with accuracy ranging between 50 to 500 metres. The service costs $5.35 monthly.</p>
