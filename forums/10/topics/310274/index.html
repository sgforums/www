              <p><strong>Malaysia's BN coalition suffers worst electoral defeat</strong><br><span class="update">Posted: 09 March 2008 0453 hrs CNA</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpchWYOD.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="200"></p>
              <p><span>KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia's ruling coalition on Saturday suffered its biggest electoral upset ever, losing control of four state governments and failing to win the crucial two-thirds majority in parliament. <br><br>It is Barisan Nasional (BN)'s worst performance in a general election since independence in 1957. <br><br>Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi's multi-racial coalition won 139 out of 220 seats counted for the 222-seat Parliament, state television reported. Even if the BN wins the remaining two seats, it would fall short of the 148 seats needed for a two-thirds majority. <br><br>The opposition alliance of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and the Islamic Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), won 81 seats. In the outgoing parliament, the opposition had 19 seats. <br><br>The only other time the 14-party BN coalition failed to win a two-thirds majority was in 1969 when it secured 66% of the seats. This time, it would have only 63.5% if it wins the remaining two seats. <br><br>A two-thirds majority is needed to amend the Constitution. The last time the BN lost that majority was in the 1969 election. <br><br>In the 2004 elections, BN had a landslide victory when they clinched 199 of the 219 seats. <br><br>Adding to the BN's woes this time, the coalition lost control of four states - Kedah, Penang, Perak and Selangor, while PAS secured two-thirds majority to keep its hold on Kelantan. <br><br>Indicative of the scale of the debacle, three of BN's component parties - the MCA, Gerakan and MIC - were almost routed. MIC president S. Samy Vellu, Gerakan acting president Koh Tsu Koon and PPP president M. Kayveas were trounced. <br><br>PM Abdullah, who is also the BN chairman, retained his Kepala Batas parliamentary seat in Penang while his deputy Najib Tun Razak won with a huge margin in Pekan in Pahang. <br><br>Asked whether the election results showed the people had lost confidence in his leadership, Mr Abdullah said: " No...this is the people's stand to show their stand not to give us a two-thirds majority." <br><br>On the defeat of several of his Cabinet ministers, the prime minister said defeats are normal. <br><br>Besides Samy Vellu, who is also Works Minister, Shahrizat Abdul Jalil, Zainuddin Maidin and Abdul Aziz Shamsuddin were also defeated in the elections. <br><br>Mr Abdullah also denied talk that he would step down as prime minister. <br><br>"I don't know who is being pressured (to step down) I'm not resigning," he told a press conference at the BN operations centre at the Putra World Trade Centre. <br><br>Mr Abdullah, who has been prime minister since November 2003, said he would have an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin, on Monday on the formation of the new government. <br><br>Saturday's poll, called before it was due in May 2009, was widely seen as a referendum on PM Abdullah's rule, and Malaysians took the opportunity to administer a stinging rebuke over price rises, religious disputes and concerns over corruption. <br><br>Chinese and Indians account for a third of the population of 26 million and many complain the government discriminates in favour of Malays when it comes to education, jobs, financial assistance and religious policy. <br><br>About 70 percent of Malaysia's 10.9 million eligible voters had cast ballots, the country's top poll official said. - CNA/ir</span></p>

              <p>sorry, no wake up call, imo.</p>
              <p>here, the government is more astute in preserving the singapore political status quo, through many means. in malaysia, it is much harder to control from within.</p>
              <p>i think (unfortunately), there is also a lack of moral and political courage by singaporeans to vote for change. and PAP do contribute, and credible oppositions in singapore a few and far between since most are nipped in the butt.</p>

              <p>With the events that reddressman has raised, along with the increase in GST, minister pay, ERP and the number of gantries, public transport fare, coupled with the refusal to reduce fuel taxes when the oil price is high and listen/poll to the people for the implementation of the potentially society-crippling IR,</p>
              <p>LHL will face an extremely uphill task in improving his margin even if the opposition do less. In the previous election, facing a new-faced WP team that did not even rally much in his GRC, he could only win 60+%. Shows how much support he gets.</p>
              <p>2010~2011 =&gt; time for the people to sound their displeasure (if they have not forgotten all of the above by that time with the implementation of the IR and the circle line in 2010). My guess is once the circle line starts to be used by many, the IR starts to generate profits for the economy and the youth olympics completed, PAP will call for election.</p>

              <p><br>PAP, interesting how your abbreviation pans out <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>the willingness of the people is one part of the equation, we should also consider credible opposition who are regularly exposed to the people. there are capable people out there, no doubt, but if they or their qualities are not made known or expose to the general population, then it is hard.</p>
              <p>Notice how well the government mobilize the media? On the Youth Olympic bid, a certain Teo is literally in your face. Given Singapore won the bid, he must be good. (I am not suggesting that he is, imo). And on health matters, another face becomes the front for it. So, when it comes to voting later, they will have a lot of muffin points to score, versus a `nobody' who may be more capable.</p>
              <p>do you vote in confidence if you don't know too much about someone?</p>
              <p>i think singapore politics is easier to control if you are in charge.</p>
