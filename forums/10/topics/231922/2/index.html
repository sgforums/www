Real wage of an average Singaporean reamins "Stagnant" ( If you ask me it has fallen dramatically ).... so taxi usage will not improve in the near future until the IRs are completed.<br><br>So I have absolutely no idea how did LTA pull manage to assume those figures which it has hope to improve.  And to be frank, after the Bozos from Aussieland finished their report, expect more MAD Hare schemes to be implemented. We have the most complex payment system in the world for our fares. T<br><br>The fact remains that we are only a small island... there is simply no excuse where the Transport providers sees itself fit to be ALWAYS passing the cost of their infrastruce building and the renewal of their fleet to the consumers.<br><br>PUBLIC transportation is a utility item. It is something that every country must invest in with their taxpayer's money, to built land transport infrastructure. But our transport providers have always maintain their position of charging every single cent to us while KEEPING ALL THEIR PROFITS to themselves.<br><br>To be blunt, it is also a simple issue of addressing the commuters' needs rather then creating more complex schemes to make things work. If the system is efficient, simple and the fares are reasonable, it is only logical to expect more commuters to use the transport system extensively.<br></div></blockquote>Let me tell you how it works . They invite the ang mohs who might have learnt from us previously. Then they pay them for consultation . After the whole thing fails - they blame them lor but not themselves. The ang moh already go laughing to the bank with the golden handshake.<br><br>I never give face to ang moh. I work in their culture and I tell them they are wrong if they are wrong. Thing worth of note - you can actually tell your boss why you think an idea is stupid and they will actually listen.</div>

Singapore's transportation is actually quite good compared to other countries I have been to. Only Victoria in Australia has good transportation facilities  because of the retention of their tram lines in the whole damn Australia...and they are inviting Australians in? This is one big hilarious JOKE! Never mind , maybe LTA will come up with free public transport on public holidays like how Melbourne did.</div>
