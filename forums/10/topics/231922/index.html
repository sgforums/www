            <div class='col-md body'>Why Australia? i do not understand at all..<br><br>Does Australia have the same background as us?<br><br>Does any Australia city have a city with 99% asians, 70% of them taking the public transport everyday, with such a hectic lifestyle?<br><br>Australians are people that only work 4 days a week, 6hrs a day, and have 3 varied seasons. How are these Australians gonna access us Asian singaporeans? I just do not understand it..so different from Singapore.<br><br><strong>Geographically, historically, socially, technically, linguistically, mentality, operationality, racially, politically, financially, environmentally SOOO different from us!!</strong><br>sigh...i think isn't it better that our super elites consult a firm that could be more related to us, like Tokyo Subway, New York Subway, Shanghai Metro or Hongkong MTR?<br><br>WTH Australians? how much we paying? damn...we are really big carrot heads..no...we are ang mo co.ck sucking carrot heads. To top things off, they actually need 6months to evaluated our world-class transportation.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=230989" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=230989</a><br><br>I sense a similar case same as Fortes and NKF...</div>
