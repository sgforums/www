              <p>Though a system which ensures the basic human liberty is subject to abuse by some, we should endeavour not to diverge from it, for without it we would be no better than the people in Burma, North Korea and Iraq (by Saddam). Where basic rights of humanity are obliterated to facilitate the rule of dictatorships.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Human rights are often misunderstood by folks from a lower social strata (the under achievers), thus you see many citizens from Third World countries not recognizing the needs.</p>

              <p>can u explain why mobs and gangs have grown in aus over the last few years?</p>
              <p>Partly due to massive emigration into Aus. But lack of draconian laws is the main fault. People who have lived and worked overseas wil understand.</p>

I used to feel the same way  and realised (the hard way) that littering carries a fine of about $500. But over time - it's only fair. The only things the government fines you for are things you shouldn't be doing in the first place. Come here with heroin - you will be hanged. Spit in public - you will be fined. Most private institutions work with the same mentality these days.  - fake a bill or leak company secrets - you will be fired. And it's enforcing these kind of laws that has made Singapore one of the safest places to live in today.</p></div>

              <p>You might be surprised but the answer is YES.</p>
              <p>What human rights mean in such countries is that the policeman himself cannot make the decision to do this without approval from the Police Commissioner.</p>
              <p>These measures are in place to keep the police from abusing the law.</p>
              <p>Yet at the same time, the Police Commissioner is accountable to the public and independent judiciary. He may face impeachment if found guilty of abusing his power.</p>

              <p>Gangs exist regardless of the law.It is like saying people should not flock together although they have the ability to flock together. Things happen because they can. Even this is true in draconian Singapore.</p>

              <p>can u explain why mobs and gangs have grown in aus over the last few years?</p>
              <p>Partly due to massive emigration into Aus. But lack of draconian laws is the main fault. People who have lived and worked overseas wil understand.</p>

              <p>draconian law will reduce crime rate by immigrants in australia?</p>
              <p>the problem to me more like the type of immigrants they are allowing into the australia that are causing the problems. such as refugees, loopholes in their immigration laws thus attracting heaps of low skills, low education immigrants who could barely speak english.  i dont think any draconian laws would make any difference to these ppl. try draconian laws in afgans. see whether you will be shot while trying to enforce it, or they pay fines to you.</p>

              <p>The Spore system towards tackling crime is:-</p>
              <p><br>1. Public monitoring system - Spore is small and easily monitored. As long as enforcement agencies are deemed to be friendly and people orientated, the public would willingly help by cooperating with them thru reporting of suspicious activities or even attending court as witnesses.</p>
              <p><br>2. Education:- rather than to spend vast sums on building prisons and feeding prisoners for years, such funds were channelled instead on guiding our young and weaning them off their natuaral basics instincts.</p>
              <p><br>3. Opportunities:- We are a loser society - one that will hold itself back so that the weak may catch up instead of being a winner society where one cares not a hoot about others. We believe a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, similary, so too our society, The rich and well off take pains to spread wealth, create employment for all, white or black, so that there will be no opportunities for the poor to use the lack of it to rob or steal.</p>
              <p><br>4. Asians:- We are asians, natuarally docile and not as confrontational as our western brothers. Thus, if there were softer options, we would go for it than to wreck lives.</p>
              <p><br>5. Rehabilitation: Our prisons are not cesspits, but have programmes to reform and rehabilitate the criminal to adjust his mentality back in tune to our society. These criminals are treated not as animals, but as human beings and singapore citizens, whose forefathers had played a role in making our society successful.</p>
              <p><br>Thus, it is not just 'draconian laws' that made Spore having lower crime rates. It is active citizenry at work, a model the rest of the world can follow.</p>
              <p><br>However, there still are some draconian laws in place in our society. There is a critical need for it to prevent massive harm to society such as drugs.</p>
              <p>But do not be proud of such a fact, for as long as such draconian laws are not repealled, it only mean we had failed as a society to help and rehabilitate our fellow singaporeans into being productive citizens and will not harm our fellow members.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only difference between a robber and his/her victim is opportunity in life. The victim probably lived in a safe environment conducieve for growth but the robber never knew,or had the mentality to grasp such opportunities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Education and opportunities, and not draconian laws, are the long term solutions to create a better world for our children to inherit.</p>
