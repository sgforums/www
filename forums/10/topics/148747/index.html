            <div class='col-md body'>Since I don't know how long ago, I stopped supporting the Singapore's Charity TV Shows. I'm only drawing a mere wage..hardly enough to feed my own mouth, plus with the flag days and Charity shows so often, much as I want to help, I really can't.<br><br>Flag days used to be only on Saturdays. But now, it's happening almost everyday.<br><br>TV Charity show used to only have NKF, but it gradually increase so much a year that I lost count. Let's see, there's NKF, the Heart Foundation, The Cancer Foundation, The President Star Charity, the Ren Ci show and the list goes on...<br><br>Such overdose of charity show simply makes my heart just harden and immune to all the trumatic trailers.<br><br>Out of all the shows, I honestly only have respect for the Ren Ci show. I can't deny how much effort Rev Ming Yi puts in to raise funds for his own organisation. Think about it, how many organisation in-charge comes out to do stunts on the charity to raise funds themselves? Do you see Durant from NKF performing ever once? Or do you see our President doing his part to raise money for his own fund? All they do is just to sit with the audience comfortably enjoying their own show and the celebrities risking their lives.<br><br>On this, Rev Ming Yi, I really respect you for your selfless, nobel efforts.<br><br>I feel strongly that if you want money, come ask for it and sweat for it. You don't sit there and wait for money to fall. Just as I don't donate to the students who are not sincere about raising funds or expect us to go up to them to donate while they're sitting and holding the tins.. Whoever approachs and asks, I seldom reject. As the saying goes, "Ask and it'll be given".<br><br>Recently, my company was trying to raise funds for the Tsunamis Tragic, and working in a bank, with a lot of high flyers, high income earners, I expected thousands to flood in. But a week had past, and I'm disappointed with the collections. Only a miserable few bucks came in.<br><br>As the Chinese says, the rich ones are the stingy ones. The rich gets richer and the poor get poorer.<br><br>I'm ashamed of those earning huge bucks but not contributing a penny back to the society. May you be so blessed and never need anyone's help cause fat hope that I'll help you! If that ever happens to you, may you starve on the streets and eat back on your own retribution. Shame on you!!<br><br>Anyway, I despise the telco for charging the darn 21cents admin/service/gst charge. Common, it's for charity purpose, can't they freaking waive out this darn charge? With all the charity shows, they must had made big bucks from it. "mei liang sin de!"<br><br>If Singapore Idol can get 3 million calls, why can't Renci get their 6 million calls?</div>
