At time of WW2 only Japan is strong in East Asia region while China was weaken through it's civil war, Taiwan under Japanese rule and most of SEA were under the western countries which has limited amount of troops in their respective colonies....hence an easy Japan's series of initial victory. But for now in modern times, just the same scenario but change of country, assuming the military strength of North Korea is the same as Japan when it started out WW2, but PRC is insanely military strong, Taiwan got it's own armed force and not to forget they have to worry about ROK forces at their rear should they try to expand anywhere without battling out with ROK. SEA?...dun need to say much with Vietnam holding the strongest/largests armed force in SEA it would be another new blockage access further down to SG, by the time it reaches Johor or even KL it's frontline would be overly extended and would not be able to sustain further that's when SAF comes in and whack the hell of them out....my scenario though sounds like a war story but it's one of the possible real life scenario that would occur should North Korea would try a WW2 wartime Japan....</div>

That way, our planes have no way of taking off. The remaining planes in the air will easily be outnumbered. Problem is now, Singapore has actually reserved runways in the form of highways. Remember that long stretch of road at the Lim Chu Kang area? And it so happens there is an air base right beside? Coincidence? I don't think so. The invaders just need to analyse hard at our hidden assets and then take them out as well.<br><br>As a side note, you did realise Taiwan has developed a bomb that can distrubt electrical supplies?
