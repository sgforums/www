AWACs leh? What happen to diplomacy? Our air force is top notch in SEA, the only people capable of doing carpet bombings like you mentioned is USA, Russia and the europe countries which will take significant time to deploy all the bombers you mentioned. Malaysia and Indonesia will just let by those bombers fly past them at low attitude? We don't have SAMs thus need to resort to AA guns?<br><br>The scenario is rather unrealistic and flawed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>lol I really don't think Singapore has a fighting chance against any country. The other country probably wouldn't even need to invade, just bomb the crap outta Singapore and everyone's dead because Singapore's so tiny.</strong><br><br>depends on which wages war on singapore. If USA, then it is better to leave and fight another day. If if any ASEAN country or even australia dare to wage war against singapore. i will say, singapore will not be defeated easily.<br>i hope many forumers here serve in SAF and has particpate actively in joint forces exercise with foreigner forces.  i would say, we can easily defeated malaysia, indonesia and philppines in terms of air, sea and land forces because of our superioity in weaponry, training and quality of our soldiers.<br><br>I am a ex NAVY man,trust me forumers, if Malaysian/ indonesia or phillpines dare to confront us in a sea to sea battle, we can eliminate their sea forces in a day. that how highly regards i held our navy and how lowly , badly equipped their navy is. in today warefare, fitness or soldiers no longer play a critical role in a decisive battle. it is training, quality of the soldiers who can handle state of the art technology and battlefield command.<br><br>our weaponry arent defensive if you bother to study hard what we had. eg. submarine is never meant to be a defensive weaponry. singapore has to adopted a pre-emptive strike. every much like the israelis style. we have to cover as much ground as possible into enemy territories to make singapore out of range from their arti. secure our food chain. the rest, our navy and airforce will have sea and air supremacy.<br><br>there are many officers here. trust them, singapore aint a small fry as what many of you may think.<br>eventually we also have to realistic who our enemy really is.</div>
