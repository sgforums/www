            <div class='col-md body'>It's because of Thailand's adoption of the Fixed Exchange Rate, that is they will change 25 Baht : 1 USD, irrespective of whether that level is acceptable by the foreign exchange market. Soros knows that the rate is of 25 Baht : 1 USD is too high for the Thai Baht, so he anticipated that the Baht will drop to maybe say 33 Baht : 1 USD. So he short (speculative selling) the Thai Baht, the Thai central bank defended the Fixed Exchange Rate with their foreign reserves, as soon as the reserves ran out, the Fixed Exchange Rate is no longer supported, in the end the Thai Baht fell. So all Soros has to do is to buy back the contract that he sold short.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To understand the Asian Economic Crisis you need to understand 3 technical concepts in Finance.<br><br>1. Currency peg - a system where the government fix currency exchange at a rate say 1USD = 35Baht. This is to say their currency would not fluctuate unlike Singapore where you have to check the exchange rates daily.<br><br>2. Current account deficit - The country is importing more goods than exporting<br><br>3.Short selling - e.g. Borrowing Thai currency for 30 days from another friend (pay him 30 day interest), then sell on the currency market today,  buy Thai currency back (with USD) and return to friend 30 days later.The Seller is betting the Thai currency would drop in 30 days, hence making a profit from the decline.<br><br>In the case of Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, they have chalked up huge current account deficits (Importing more than Exporting). The extra imports was financed primarily by borrowing - they have lots of debts especially in USD.<br><br>What the currency speculators did was they knew the Asian countries had so much US Debt, that if one day all the creditors decide to ask for money, their foreign reserves would collapse maintaining the artificially high currency peg.<br><br>They began their attack on the currency by short selling Thai currency. Many other vultures joined in the attack because they saw the Thai currency with so much US debt has little chance of appreciating but a high likelihood to depreciate.( Nothing to lose, much to gain)<br><br>When the Central Bank of Thailand's foreign reserves were depleted, it became pandemonium. For Foreign investors holding Thai Currency, they saw they Thai currency depreciating in seconds. Being fearful, the converted their Thai investments in US currency which caused a further decline in the currency. A further decline spark a greater panic causing more investors to withdraw their investments and convert to US currency spuring another cycle of further decline.<br><br>The Rupiah for example fell from 1USD to 2000 Rupiah to 1USD to 18,000 rupiah.<br><br>The value of the currency has depreciated 11% of its original value at one point.<br><br>If i did remember  correctly, George Soros didnt really make much from that crisis. Even if he didnt short sell the currencies, they are plenty other hedge funds that would attack an unstable economic system.<br><br>[/b]</div>
