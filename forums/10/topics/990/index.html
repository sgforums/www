            <div class='col-md body'>The so-called manpower problem is not unique to Singapore. Every nation, including the US, is facing that problem, other than the old die-hard commies with ridiculously large armies.<br><br>And then we have millennium and maestro, hmm. Both claim they're from MINDEF. One confidently proclaims that we can't defend, much less attack, and anyone who says otherwise isn't thinking properly. The other says we can, and goes on to talk about striking longer distances... Well, looks like MINDEF personnel are sharply divided as well. Care to reconcile the difference in opinion, anyone? Or is it gonna be "can't say much, it's classified" again? Hmm?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Isn't it so simple that who ever had a better army strength and better technology had a greater chance to win the war?<br><br>Gulf war is one very good example, united nation won because they had better technology, they used air raid against a defending country. They stopped ration supply to the defending country resulting in lack of ration and low morale of soldiers.<br><br>If a war were to occur, how many days our ration and water can last? Looking at our rich pamper soldiers, expect to win a war? Must be dreaming I must say. Still want to attack when we can't even defend.<br><br>When I said must accquire larger better fleet, got people say no need, current fleet able to defeat our neighbour. I can say those people are totally ignorant about military warfare and keep dreaming here. Our both neighbours already had frigate and submarine way ahead of us when we are still having convette. Our frigate will only reach Singapore in 2004 and comissioned in 2006. With our current strength, still expecting to win a war? You carry on watching TV advertisement and continue your beautiful victory dream.<br><br>maestro, how long a distance you want to strike? KL or Penang? Don't think of attack, think can we defend ourself or not first?</div>
