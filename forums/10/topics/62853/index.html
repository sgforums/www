            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">NOV 28, 2003, The Straits Times</span><br><span class="large"><strong>Taiwan backs down over independence </strong></span><br><br>Lawmakers vote against change to political status, flag and name, after threat of 'strong' response from China<br><br>By Lawrence Chung<br>STRAITS TIMES TAIWAN BUREAU<br><br>TAIPEI - Taiwanese legislators voting on a controversial referendum Bill yesterday played safe by rejecting a sensitive clause seeking to change the island's flag, official name and political status.<br><br>The compromise move is likely to stave off China's threat of a 'strong' response, made on Wednesday, if legislators were to pass 'unrestricted' referendum legislation.<br><br>Beijing has warned that it would not tolerate such a referendum law, which could lead to a public vote on Taiwan's independence and eventual split from the mainland.<br><br><span style="color: red;">China has vowed to attack Taiwan, which it regards as part of its territory, if the island formally declares independence.</span><br><br>The United States has also told Taiwan to cool it, by reiterating its 'one China' policy.<br><br>Taiwanese markets got the jitters yesterday, with stocks posting their biggest plunge in three weeks. The Taiwanese currency also fell to its lowest level - NT$34.22 (S$1.75) - against the US dollar since Aug 21.<br><br>However, the legislators yesterday also approved a proposal giving the President the power to hold an independence vote if China tries to use force to reunify the island with the mainland.<br><br>The passage of the so-called 'defensive referendum' clause was the only victory for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates breaking away from the mainland.<br><br>But it sticks largely to a pledge made by President Chen Shui-bian in his inaugural speech in 2000 - that unless Beijing attacks Taiwan, he will not seek independence.<br><br>The day belonged to the opposition camp, which was led by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the People First Party (PFP).<br><br>In a show of unity, KMT and PFP legislators outnumbered their DPP colleagues and other pro-independence legislators to defeat the more controversial proposals such as those calling for a change in Taiwan's flag and official name, the Republic of China.<br><br>Many DPP legislators chose to abstain from the voting.<br><br>Political analyst Emile Sheng said: 'This shows that the DPP is at a loss under pressure from the United States and from the mainland's war warning.'<br><br>He said the opposition alliance had succeeded in forcing the DPP to show its hand.<br><br>'After this, how can the DPP convince hardline pro-independence supporters that it is on their side? At future campaign rallies, the DPP would not be able to use the referendum issue to attract the votes of this group,' he said.<br><br>The Taiwanese people are due to go to the polls next March to elect a new president.<br><br>Referendums have been turned into a major issue by Mr Chen, who is seeking a second term and has been pushing hard for a referendum law.<br><br>Only recently, he rattled Beijing when he said he planned to hold a referendum on a new Constitution in December 2006 and enact it by 2008.<br><br>Last night, there was no immediate reaction from China on the vote in Taiwan.<br><br>Instead, Chinese state media lambasted Mr Chen, calling him a troublemaker who is bringing disaster to the island.<br><br>According to Chinese cross-strait expert Zhang Tongxin, the dust has not yet settled on the issue of Mr Chen's push for independence.<br><br>'China has the determination and the ability to not let the situation develop to a stage where it would be out of control,' he said.<br><br>And he added that Beijing has only started to apply pressure.</blockquote>Ermm, can anybody tell me why China insists on its "One China" policy?<br><br>I think it's quite... barbaric to apply such pressure on a country - if you don't submit we'll attack - in such a scenario. We're civilized people... no more wars please. If a war were to erupt just because Taiwan declares independence, it's quite insane. But of course for now I still dunno why China wants the reunification lar. If the two countries are doing well as two independent countries, then why need to reunify.....?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this should answer some of the Question----&gt;<br><br><blockquote>NuclearHead, your acount of Taiwanese history is filled with half-truths and a selective reading of events.<br>Firstly, while it may be true that the original Taiwanese were aboriginal people from the Philipines, this is not a definition of nationhood, otherwise, Singapore should never be a country as the original inhabitants were "Orang Laut", and the US should be rightfully returned to the Native Indians.<br><br>Secondly, the later emigration you speak of probably accelerated during the Ming Dynasty. There was no democratic governance! These were mostly Ming officials and traders owing their allegiance to the Ming Emperor. Taiwan was adminsitered loosely by the Ming and than the Ching for the next 300+ yrs, until the Japanese annexed the island in 1892, after the Ching govt signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki.<br><br>Thirdly, you claimed that Taiwan was "returned" to China after WWII, yes, this is correct, minus the quotes, it was a rightful return, not against the wishes of the Taiwanese people.<br>Chiang Kai-shek's KMT retreated to Taiwanese after losing the civil war against the Communists, and establish the alternate nationalist govt in Taiwan, with the clear expressed aim to return to the Mainland. This was taught in all taiwanese schools for the next 40 yrs. This is not a separatist govt, it is in all aspects a re-unification govt!<br><br>Fourthly, you claim that the the taiwanese evolved their own language, culture, religion, etc. Excuse me! Does your knowledge of culture and history only span 50yrs! The local Taiwanese dialect is a variation (as all vernacular languages tend to be) of the Fujian dialect on the Mainland. Its culture is invariably Chinese, with strong Confucian roots, and its religion is based on Chinese taoism, with some local flavour. To claim that this is developed locally by the Taiwanese is like saying New Yorkers speak their own language as compared to Texans, and therefore are different languages.<br><br>Finally, you claim that the Communists are just being greedy in wanting Taiwan for its wealth. No doubt you owe this nugget of insight to pro-Taiwanese independence bluster and sound-bites. I'd advise you exercise your judgement before subscribing to hubris. The Chinese economy is set to grow into the largest economy in Asia within the next 10-20 yrs, with or without Taiwan. Foreign investment in manufacturing into China (Taiwanese companies included) outstrips the whole of Asia today, and is set to grow at an increasing rate for yrs to come. I am pretty sure about 1 thing, if Taiwan does not declare independence, China will not use military force, and the Taiwanese can continue to prosper. This makes a joke of your "China greed" theory. The eventual re-unification with Taiwan is the objective of China, be it in 50yrs or more. By that time, China is likely to be a economic powerhouse, Taiwan's economy in all likelihood will be dependent on China for a sizeable portion of her GDP. THINK!<br><br>No NuclearHead, <span style="color: red;">Taiwan to the Mainland, is an issue of National dignity.</span> China after the humiliation of Shimonoseki, the lost of HongKong and Macau at the turn of the century to foreign powers and opportunists, will not allow itself to be bullied into losing part of her sovereignty again.<br><br>There are of course strategic concerns for the Chinese, the US and the Japanese over Taiwan. I won't go into that.<br><br>I suggest you read up on why Chen Shui-bian and Lee Teng-Hui are so set on Taiwan's independence. The reasons are hardly altruistic.<br><br>Please be careful less you become a mouthpiece for those with less than honourable intentions</blockquote>.<br><br>from another forum..a poster reply to another..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what nathan mention is quite right. however there are other mitigating reasons for China's realist response.<br>China cannot allow Taiwan to declare independent as it wil be a huge loss of face and more importantly it wil prompt other secessionistic states to use Taiwan as a precedence to gain national self determination. Namely, Tibet and Xinjiang. China views these issues as a threat to their national sevurity as Taiwan's independence will undermine their constitution.<br>these are some reasons that i know of.<br>But in my personal opinion, it is still some way to go before it happens.<br></div>
