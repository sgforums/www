            <div class='col-md body'>If we are serious about pollution and green house gases, the government should drastically cut or remove taxes for more environmentally friendly vehicles like the hybrid car. From what I hear, sales are poor because of the high prices and lower performance. Similarly, there is little done in terms of recycling because there is not enough government incentives to do so. We don't see recycling trucks plying the HDB to take away suitable wastes and the inconvenience of having to find recycling bins has made recycling not attractive for many. I think Singaporeans used to recycle more in the days of the karang guni man..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We are a long way from matching the rigidity of environmental friendliness in other developed countries, especially in the industrial sector, let alone the recycling bins we place all over SG.<br><br>At the moment, it's all lip movement and hot air. We talk a lot but have not focused into proper and feasible everyday practicalities that will entice the local singaporean to respond favourably. All our ISO 14000, 15000 are words on paper. Many shipping companies blatantly dump their chemical wastes in the sea, factory environments are horrendous with oil seeping into drains and contaminating our lines etc.<br><br>Safety and green environment has not reached a level of awareness needed to educate the average singaporean. They simply cannot believe in threats like global warming and airborne pollution, having never experienced one.<br><br>The difficulty is in convincing this majority which form the nucleus of the working population about the inherent and immediate dangers of damaging the environment. Once this is overcome, the rest is simply laying out a roadmap.<br><br>Take obesity for example. Everyone talked about it but no one did anything concrete. In the last 5 years, the message has finally gotten thru. Now everyone talks about BMI and fitness in schools. Pressure on MOE to ensure kids stay trim and fit is ever increasing.<br><br>Likewise, the environment. Education is the first step. Everything else is doomed to fail.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup I totally agree!<br><br>Recycling bins can scarcely be found in Singapore. There used to be some at Watten Park estate. I'm not sure if they're still there now though. As far as I know, recycling bins are found in schools, and BP stations. Aside from that, recycling bins are a rare sight.<br><br>Compared to other developed countries such as Australia, we, as a nation are definitely guilty of being not being environmentally conscious. In Australia, plastic bags at the supermarkets are given out sparingly. Shoppers are encouraged to buy the reusable bags (which go for 99 cents). The bags are, in fact, quite fashionably made, such that it isn't a stigma to be seen carrying one of those bags. Common garbage bins are separated into those meant for 'cans', 'bottles', and 'paper' material.<br><br>It's high time Singapore did such things too, instead of just shoving down 'Reuse, reduce, recycle' down student's throats when there are seemingly few avenues to encourage such behaviour.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Recycling ought to be a lifestyle as well. Okay maybe recycling is hard due to the economics of things but what about reusing? Just look at the way we Singaporeans (and yes, I have to bear some blame too here) 'anyhow throw'. Egg Cartons, Bottles, even plastic bags. Perhaps plastic bags aren't that much of an issue and it's come to my understanding that Carrefour has stepped up efforts to reduce the number of plastic bags dispensed. Yet. There is surely, a more effecient way. Paper bags? How about issuing tote bags or encouraging consumers to buy one which they then lug to the supermarkets instead of dispensing plastic bags all the time?</div>
