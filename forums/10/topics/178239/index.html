            <div class='col-md body'>Do you think you are sophisticated or naÃ¯ve as an article in Littlespeck.com quizzed:<br><br>Singaporeans<br>Sophisticated or.. naÃ¯ve?<br>Too many are suckers for sob story or a con scheme. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Feb 12, 2006<br><br>ARE Singaporeans naive? No, this is not a flippant question and there are good reasons for it.<br><br>One of those who believe that Singaporeans are gullible when it comes to a sob story is Prof Lee Wei Ling, the daughter of Minister Mentor.<br><br>She wasn't referring to the National Kidney Foundation scandal, in which the former management misled hundreds of thousands into donating millions for needy people requiring expensive dialysis treatment.<br><br>The director and senior consultant of National Neuroscience Institute, Lee - speaking on a private capacity - was talking about well-intentioned people donating money indiscriminately to questionable causes.<br><br>She referred to four recent cases in which people opened their wallets to help children to undergo complex surgeries that created complications for some of the aid takers.<br><br>In one case, the separated conjoined Nepalese twins never fully recovered but left behind unceasing costly follow-up treatments and misplacing of the funds by their parents, who kept coming for more money.<br><br>Then when young Huang Na, a little girl from China was murdered here, sympathetic Singaporeans forked out a small fortune to the girl's mother, who promptly went back to refurbish her home in China, thank-you-very-much.<br><br>"I am disappointed with my fellow Singaporeans' gullibility," said the sister of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. "What good is that money to Huang Na who has died?<br><br>Not every one agrees with the professor. Charity is in the eyes of the beholder.<br><br>She would have made a stronger case if she had also warned contributors to beware of officially sanctioned charities, including NKF, as well as to ensure their money is well spent.<br><br>Actually, the act of giving charity always involves an element of risk of being taken for a ride since no one can guarantee that every taker is one hundred per cent truthful.<br><br>"If one has to check up on every beggar's financial background first, no one will ever give alms," exclaimed a church worker, who disagrees that charity is worthwhile only if it is officially sanctioned.<br><br>At any rate, donating not only helps the acceptor, but emotionally benefits the giver, too.<br><br>But Lee is not wrong to say that Singaporeans are naive, especially those who handed over large sums (reportedly tens of thousands of dollars) to a foreigner mother just because her child was murdered here. What about other death victims?<br><br>Today's Singaporean is painted as a well-informed, sophisticated person able to cope with the modern world, but for every such person, there is another who is less savvy.<br><br>This is, of course, not surprising. Most countries wear two faces - or more.<br><br>Cosmopolitan but with half the population poorly educated, Singapore is often smart and terribly green at the same time, at least a portion of it, anyway.<br><br>People have simple-mindedly handed over money to people they have never met on the vague promise of a "sure-thing" stock investment or a "well-paying" job in Singapore or overseas.<br><br>Even savvy investors are known to have been cheated of millions by Nigerians, or Africans, whom they often look down as less smart than them. The exact number is unknown since some victims are too ashamed to report it.<br><br>So far, the police have arrested more than 20 foreign fraudsters who arrived to collect.<br><br>People say there's a fool born every minute. The majority are victims of greed and naivety, succumbing to a more sophisticated breed of crooks using the Internet and easy transfer of funds.<br><br>An insurance agent was strung along for three weeks over the Web before he was cheated of S$330,000, some of it borrowed from friends.<br><br>It began with an e-mail (the type all of us get dozens of times) that promised him a chance to earn an easy S$13mil. It was from a "Anya Duruoha", supposed manager of the "Diamond Bank of Nigeria".<br><br>He spun the tale of a rich Nigerian killed in a road accident, who had left behind US$25mil without will or kin.<br><br>Since the Nigerian government pockets any inheritance not claimed in five years, our man was asked to pose as a relative. He was promised a 30% cut, or about S$13mil, but he had to wire lawyer's fees that would lead to more demands incrementally.<br><br>Despite the worldwide publicity, five Singaporeans were cheated of S$2mil in 2003. In 2004, seven people lost between S$1,000 and S$30,000 each.<br><br>Another con declares the victim a winner of a rich prize in a foreign lottery, which requires payment of a "handling fee" to collect.<br><br>A ridiculous scheme, I agree. How could they win the top prize when they never bought any overseas lottery? Yet by March 2003, at least 50 Singaporeans were taken for a total of S$150,000.<br><br>People are so naive or unable to look after themselves that many laws have to be passed to protect them from being cheated.<br><br>The very young and the very old are the most vulnerable. Thefts of mobile phones have become one of the worst crimes here, thanks to careless teens who think the world is as safe as home.<br><br>Naive teenage girls fall prey to sexual ICQ predators posing as students.<br><br>Senior citizens are swindled by fake meter readers no matter how often they're warned, as well as by "magic stones" tricksters or bomohs, who claim they can cure every sickness under the sun.<br><br>Politically? Well, that too.<br><br>Renowned author Catherine Lim calls Singapore "a nation of politically naive citizens" that can threaten its own survival.<br><br>She said it was time the Government taught politics and independent thinking to its people.</div>

He cashed the unused leave for $423,000 between 1995 and 2003 when NKF employees were not permitted to do so.<br><br>Â· He charged an average of $32,952 a month to his corporate credit card in 2004.<br><br>Â· Durai received numerous salary increments.<br><br>Â· He flew first class as did other Board directors and senior volunteers.<br><br>Â· Matilda Chua, a former employee, was given a backdated raise when she resigned.<br><br>Â· She received an additional 6 months' bonus of $75,000 and an ex-gratia payment of another $75,000 on her departure.<br><br>Â· She also cashed in her unused leave for $79,195.<br><br>Â· She then came back as a member of the Board.<br><br>Â· NKF signed 2 contracts worth $7.5 million with companies owned by Durai's personal friend.<br><br>Â· Matilda Chua had an interest in one of the companies.<br><br>Â· Durai and others went on a study tour of Las Vegas in 2004 for $70,000.<br><br>In 2004, however, the Government was still defending NKF. Ministers Khaw Boon Wan and Lim Hng Kiang were still singing the praises of an organization and its staff when the rot had already set in. Mr Khaw lauded NKFÂ’s operations and wanted the organization to remain transparent. He said: <strong>Â“I take my hat off to the NKF.Â”</strong> <strong>Mr Lim assured everyone that NKF was on Â“quite a sound record.Â” </strong><br><br>I highlight these statements made by the Ministers not to show how silly they now in retrospect because Mr Khaw Boon Wan has admitted as much. Words like Â“dupedÂ”, Â“misledÂ”, Â“naÃ¯veÂ”, and Â“oversightÂ” were used liberally in the aftermath of the KPMG expose.<br><br>Parliamentary statements in 2004, however, indicate otherwise.<br><br>For example, in Parliament on 19 April 2004, NMP Braema Mathi had raised the concern of NKFÂ’s computation of the amount of donated money going to the beneficiary. <strong>Second Minister for Finance Lim Hng Kiang brushed off the matter and concluded that NKF wasÂ” on quite a sound record.Â” </strong>The following was the exchange:<br><br><strong>Braema Mathi:</strong> Â“Â…NKF, in the public domain, has made two announcements of 52 cents coming back to the beneficiary, as well as 56 centsÂ…What I am raising here with this incident is that different definitions do go into making up what comes back to the beneficiary in terms of a precise dollar value. There needs to be greater consistency in the factors that go into such computation.Â”<br><br><strong>Lim Hng Kiang:</strong> Â“Â…[NKF] put up the press release and explained the differences between 52% and 56% go to the beneficiaries. I recall also that they indicated in the press release that about 26% goes to the reserves. So, actually, if you add up the two numbers, nearly 80% goes to the beneficiaries. I think that puts NKF on quite a sound record.Â”<br><br>The NMP also brought up the question of transparency and suggested that NKF reveal the salary of its CEO. <strong>Mr Lim left it to the NKF to decide whether it wanted to tell the public </strong>(remember, this was in spite of the misgivings many quarters had over NKF). He said:<br><br><strong>Â“Â…this is a decision by NKF whether to disclose the salaries of the CEOs. Here, I have some sympathy for their dilemma.  If they do not disclose, then there will be critics who say they are not transparent. If they disclose, there will also be critics who will say that whatever they pay are too high. So I think they are caught between a rock and a hard place. I think it is their decision not to disclose.Â”</strong><br><br>If there was ever any doubt that concern was brought to the direct attention of the Government, it was removed by this statement from Ms Braema Mathi: <strong>Â“NKF's reservesÂ…[are] in dire need of better governance.Â”</strong><br><br>To put the publicÂ’s unease over the NKFÂ’s compliance with regulations, Mr Lim Hng Kiang told Parliament in 2004:<br><br><strong>Lim:</strong> Â“Mr Speaker, Sir, it is important to have clear guidelines on the raising and utilisation of funds to maintain public confidence in our non-profit organisations and their programmes. There are essentially three questions the public is most interested in. First, what methods are used to raise the money?  Second, how much of the charity dollar is used to raise funds?  And, finally, how is the money spent or saved?Â”<br><br>Of the three questions, the third is the most relevant to the issue today: Was NKF in compliance with regulations over how the money spent or saved?<br><br><strong>PAP MP Charles Chong asked Minister Lim point-blank:</strong> Â“Sir, could the Minister tell us whether the National Kidney Foundation is in full compliance with all the current guidelines that he mentioned just now in the collection and utilisation of the funds that it receives from the public?Â”<br><br>Mr Lim did not mince words: <strong>Â“Mr Speaker, Sir, the NKF is in full compliance with the regulations.Â” </strong>(emphasis added)<br><br><strong>From the above parliamentary exchanges, it can be seen that the Government was alerted to questionable practices in the NKF. Not only did Mr Lim ignore these warnings he categorically told Parliament that he had Â“full confidenceÂ” that NKF had complied with regulations. </strong><br><br>Then there was the matter of the National Council of Social Services (NCSS). On Dec 31, 2001, the NCSS revoked the IPC status of NKF. <strong>The NCSS took action because it saw the problems within the NKF. And yet, within a month the Ministry of Health reinstated the NKFÂ’s IPC status. </strong><br><br>Now read what Mr Lim told Parliament in 2004:<strong> Â“[The Ministry of Finance] has certain criteria by which [it] evaluates applicants who want IPC status, and these criteria are set by IRAS, and we make sure that people who apply have to qualify before they are given this IPC status.Â” </strong>(emphasis added)<br><br>In other words we are given to believe that there was an active search for answers from the NKF before NKF was given clearance to reclaim its IPC status. </span><br><br></div>
