              <p>By Richard Boudreaux and Ashraf Khalil<br> Los Angeles Times Staff Writers<br> <br> May 8, 2008<br> <br> JERUSALEM —
              Frustrated by years of on-and-off peace talks with Israel, Palestinians
              are losing hope for an independent homeland, and some are proposing a
              radically different cause: a shared state with equal rights for
              Palestinians and Jews. <br> <br> A
              "two-state solution" has been the basis for Israeli-Palestinian
              negotiations for nearly 15 years and remains the declared aim of both
              groups' highest elected leaders and the Bush administration. But its
              advocates are increasingly on the defensive, and not just against
              militant Islamists and Jewish settlers who have long opposed
              partitioning the land. <br> <br> Majorities on both sides dismiss the
              current U.S.-backed peace talks as futile. And a small but growing
              number of moderate Palestinians contend that Israel's terms for
              independence offer less than they could gain in a single democratic
              state combining Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.<br> <br> As a
              result, the 60th anniversary this month of Israel's birth is a time of
              insecurity and flux. Conventional wisdom about the long-standing
              formula for peace is being turned on its head.<br> <br> No Israeli leader
              accepts the idea of sharing power with Palestinians; nor has such a
              plan been offered to the Israeli government. But a collapse of the
              two-state effort would leave Israel in de facto control of a region
              where by the next generation, Jews probably will be a minority. <br> <br> That
              scenario inspires Hazem Kawasmi, who recently gave up on the two-state
              ideal and runs brainstorming workshops in the West Bank on single-state
              proposals.<br> <br> Sooner or later, the former Palestinian Authority
              official predicts, the growing burden of occupation and threat of
              Islamic extremism will make Israelis receptive to the idea of a
              bi-national system that protects the rights of Jews. <br> <br> "Israel
              cannot be a dominating power forever," Kawasmi, 43, said between puffs
              on a water pipe in a cafe in Ramallah, the West Bank's administrative
              center. "Time is on our side."<br> <br> Israel captured the West Bank and
              Gaza in the 1967 Middle East War, but efforts to incorporate the
              territories by encouraging massive Jewish settlements fell short. It
              took a generation after the war for Israeli and secular Palestinian
              leaders to recognize each other and start discussing statehood for the
              occupied territories.<br> <br> The Palestinians' rethinking of that goal
              has been influenced by Hamas' ascendancy. Its rise has unnerved
              moderate Palestinians who don't want to be ruled by the militant
              Islamic group and made many in Israel, which Hamas refuses to formally
              recognize, more averse to a two-state accord.<br> <br> The near-daily
              rocket attacks from Hamas-controlled Gaza have turned Israel's defense
              minister into a powerful critic of a peace process he once led.<br> <br> U.S.
              Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, struggling to propel peace talks
              between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by the secular Fatah
              movement, warned last week that the lack of progress was causing
              younger Palestinians to give up on the goal of an independent state.<br> <br> "Increasingly, the Palestinians who talk about a two-state solution are
              my age," said Rice, who is 53.<br> <br> The
              U.S. revived the peace talks in November with the aim of an accord by
              the end of President Bush's term, but disillusionment set in quickly. <a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/huji/eng/">Hebrew University</a> and the <a href="http://www.pcpsr.org/">Palestine Center for Policy and Survey
              Research</a> reported that three-fourths of the Palestinians and just over half the
              Israelis they polled in March said the talks serve no purpose and
              should be halted. Other polls show that at least one-fourth of
              Palestinians favor a single state.<br> <br> "The number of people who
              believe in two states for two peoples is decreasing, and that worries
              me," said Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a Palestinian official involved in the
              talks. "And I'm talking about a circle of rational intellectuals,
              people with an open mind. On the street, the two-state idea has become
              a joke."<br> <br> Fatah's leadership has begun a quiet, informal debate of its options if
              talks for an independent state fail. <br> <br> The
              emergence of one-state proposals, said Kadura Fares, a member of
              Fatah's revolutionary council, are "a sign that the current strategy
              has been exhausted and it's time to rethink all our goals."<br> <br> Ali
              Jarbawi, an independent West Bank political scientist who advises the
              Palestinian leadership, has urged Palestinian Authority President
              Mahmoud Abbas to resign and abolish the government, which would oblige
              Israel to take direct responsibility for managing the West Bank and
              Gaza and paying public employees. <br> <br> "I would say, 'Be my guest.
              Continue your occupation. But we're going to declare this is all one
              state and ask for equal rights. Are you going to be able to keep us
              under control for another 40 years?' " Jarbawi said.<br> <br> Israeli
              Prime Minister Ehud Olmert cited just such a scenario last year to make
              the case for shedding the territories quickly, while the Palestinians
              still have leaders who want their own state.<br> <br> Israel, he warned,
              faces a demographic threat. There are 5.7 million Jews and 1.4 million
              Arab citizens in Israel and its West Bank settlements, according to
              Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics; the bureau's Palestinian
              counterpart tallies nearly 3.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank
              and Gaza.<br> <br> By 2025, Israeli demographer Sergio Della Pergola
              predicts, Jews will make up no more than 46% of the people living
              between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, an area slightly
              smaller than Maryland.<br> <br> Rid of the territories, Olmert told
              reporters in November, Israel would have a sustainable Jewish majority
              within its borders, enabling it to preserve its Jewish character within
              a democracy.<br> <br> "If the day comes when the two-state solution
              collapses and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting
              rights, the state of Israel is finished," he said.<br> <br> But
              resistance to a two-state accord has risen not only from right-wing
              allies of Olmert who support continued Jewish settlement in the West
              Bank but also from Ehud Barak, who leads the dovish Labor Party.<br> <br> As
              prime minister in 2000, Barak made Israel's first concrete offer of a
              Palestinian state. (Yasser Arafat rejected his terms.) Now defense
              minister, Barak has privately dismissed the current talks as "a
              fantasy."<br> <br> Until Israel upgrades its missile defenses, which
              could take several years, Barak says, he favors keeping troops in the
              West Bank and continuing frequent incursions into Gaza. Israel withdrew
              its army bases and civilian settlements from Gaza in 2005.<br> <br> Many Palestinians take Barak's shift as a sign that independence is
              unattainable.<br> <br> Kawasmi,
              the former Palestinian Authority official, said his moment of
              disenchantment came last year in June during an encounter with Israeli
              peace activists at an unofficial Middle East forum in Italy.<br> <br> The
              Jerusalem native had been campaigning 15 years for an independent
              Palestinian state. The dream had brought him home from studies in
              England in 1994 to help the newly created Palestinian Authority set up
              a ministry of economy.<br> <br> But the Israeli peaceniks dismissed two
              cherished Palestinian aspirations. Like Olmert's government, they
              wanted to avoid talk of giving Palestinian refugees and their families
              the right of return to homes in Israel that they fled in 1948 or of
              sharing Jerusalem as capital of both Israel and a Palestinian state.<br> <br> At
              that moment, Kawasmi said, he realized "there is zero chance" for a
              two-state solution. He didn't sleep well for months. Then he embraced
              the single-state option, which had been debated for several years among
              Palestinians living abroad, and set out to create a buzz for it in the
              territories.<br> <br> Several dozen intellectuals and activists are
              engaged in the debate, in books, newspaper articles, seminars and
              discussions on such websites as <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/">Electronic Intifada.</a> Some
              call for a power-sharing government, others for a federation with
              separate administrations for Palestinians and Jews. <br> <br> Sari
              Nusseibeh, president of Al Quds University in Jerusalem, suggests that
              many Palestinians would feel more at home in a democracy shared with
              Israelis than in a Palestinian state run by Hamas.<br> <br> A bi-national
              system, Nusseibeh said, would "need to come about by consent and not by
              force; it will need a complete new strategy and thinking." <br> <br> Perhaps
              after decades of fruitless bloodshed, he said, "we might find ourselves
              having no option but to coexist within one state."<br> <br> A single
              state, other proponents say, would resolve disputes that have long
              bedeviled peace talks. Jews could keep their settlements, the thinking
              goes, but Palestinians, now restricted to a disproportionately small
              area, could live and travel anywhere the country. So could returning
              Palestinian refugees.<br> <br> Most Israelis dismiss single-state
              proposals as recipes for dystopia or tactics in a Hamas-guided scheme
              to overrun the Jews and impose Islamic rule.<br> <br> "Such an idea of
              one country with two peoples, it will never happen," said Benjamin
              Ben-Eliezer, the infrastructure minister. "Bloodshed will happen. The
              Arabs will not accept us. We will not accept them." <br> <br> But
              Palestinians who favor the idea say they would have no problem living
              with Jews as equals. If Jews were to give up their superior status and
              allow Palestinians the right to vote and move about the country, they
              say, Islamic extremists would lose their appeal.<br> <br> "I'm
              envisioning a state where Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities live
              equally with full rights," Kawasmi said. If Israelis cannot accept
              that, "it's up to them to face an Islamic power that will not accept
              them."<br> <br> It might be months or years, he acknowledges, before
              Palestinian leaders embrace the single-state vision and another
              generation before Israelis take it seriously. He plans to spend the
              year hammering out a detailed proposal and getting it launched by a
              political party, even if he has to start one himself.<br> <br> Israelis,
              meanwhile, are weighing the choices that will shape the country's
              seventh decade if the two-state talks fail: Israel could declare that
              the wall it has built along the length of the West Bank is now a border
              and retreat behind it, unilaterally defining an Israel with a Jewish
              majority but exposing itself to rocket fire. Or it could try to prevent
              the attacks by occupying the territory more thoroughly, and
              re-occupying Gaza, with the risks of long-term fatigue and
              international condemnation.<br> <br> Either option could mean years of
              conflict, an outlook that weighs on Israel as it celebrates 60 years of
              national rebirth and achievement.<br> <br> Meron Benvenisti, a historian
              and former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, is one of the few prominent
              Israelis who see a way out by sharing a state with the Palestinians. <br> <br> He
              has proposed that Israeli Jews start debating the shape of such a
              state. They could best protect Israel's gains and the haven of a Jewish
              homeland, he suggests, by opting for a federal system with autonomous
              administrations for Jews and Palestinians.<br> <br> "Israelis and
              Palestinians are sinking together into the mud of 'one state,' " he
              writes. "We need a model that fits this reality. . . . The question is
              no longer whether it will be bi-national, but which model to choose."</p>

              <p>Way back on March 31, 1977, the Dutch newspaper Trouw published an
              interview with <strong>Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee
              member Zahir Muhsein</strong>. Here's what he said:</p>
              <p><strong>The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian
              state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of
              Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference
              between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for
              political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of
              a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we
              posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose
              Zionism. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with
              defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a
              Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and
              Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of
              Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and
              Jordan.</strong></p>

              <p>IMHO 1 state solution could spark a civil war in the future...because the Palestinians are not going to give up their Palestinian identity just like that. The same thing that the Jewish population will not accept their Palestinians fellow citizens as equal.</p>
              <p>In an ideal world that would work but we don't live in an ideal world.</p>
              <p>What the Jewish and the Palestinian people need is a commmon enemy LOL. That would surely forge their unity. A common enemy that is so powerful and frightening that would threaten the very existence of each of the faction i.e Jewish and Palestinians.</p>
              <p>Any country want to play this role? LOL. They need a Hitler type leader with hatred for both the Jews and Arabs.</p>
              <p>They need ALIENS. The little wicked green biologic  with a thrift to exterminate Jews and Arabs. And with the mind, technology and firepower to do what it takes.</p>

              <h4 style="text-align: left;">Before the Hebrews first migrated there around 1800 B.C., the land of Canaan was occupied by Canaanites.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>“Between 3000 and 1100 B.C., Canaanite civilization covered what is
                  today Israel, the West Bank, Lebanon and much of Syria and
                  Jordan</strong>...Those who remained in the Jerusalem hills after the Romans
                  expelled the Jews [in the second century A.D.] were a potpourri:
                  farmers and vineyard growers, pagans and converts to Christianity,
                  descendants of the Arabs, Persians, Samaritans, Greeks and old
                  Canaanite tribes.” <em>Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright, “Their Promised Land.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">The present-day Palestinians’ ancestral heritage</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“But all these [different peoples who had come to Canaan] were
                  additions, sprigs grafted onto the parent tree...And that parent tree
                  was Canaanite...[The Arab invaders of the 7th century A.D.] made Moslem
                  converts of the natives, settled down as residents, and intermarried
                  with them, with the result that all are now so completely Arabized that
                  we cannot tell where the Canaanites leave off and the Arabs begin.” <em>Illene Beatty, “Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">The Jewish kingdoms were only one of many periods in ancient Palestine</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“The extended kingdoms of David and Solomon, on which the Zionists
                  base their territorial demands, <strong>endured for only about 73 years...Then
                  it fell apart...</strong>[Even] if we allow independence to the entire life of
                  the ancient Jewish kingdoms, from David’s conquest of Canaan in 1000
                  B.C. to the wiping out of Judah in 586 B.C., we arrive at [only] a 414
                  year Jewish rule.” <em>Illene Beatty, “Arab and Jew in the Land of Canaan.”</em></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">More on Canaanite civilization</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“<strong>Recent archeological digs have provided evidence that Jerusalem was
                  a big and fortified city already in 1800 BCE.</strong>..Findings show that the
                  sophisticated water system heretofor attributed to the conquering
                  Israelites pre-dated them by eight centuries and was even more
                  sophisticated than imagined...<strong>Dr. Ronny Reich, who directed the
                  excavation along with Eli Shuikrun, said the entire system was built as
                  a single complex by Canaanites in the Middle Bronze Period, around 1800
                  BCE.</strong>” <em>The Jewish Bulletin, July 31st, 1998</em>.</p>

              <p>This is a useless debate. The land will go to whoever has the power. Joshua ordered the Israelites to wipe out the entire population of Jericho, the first major city they conquered in the West Bank. The Israelites were to kill everything that had breath, from the baby in his mother's arms to the calf in the manger. Israel was to drive away every single inhabitant in the land so that the Israelites could occupy that land (read it...it's in the bible).</p>
              <p>Israel could not drive away every single inhabitant or the land nor kill everyone there. Neither can the Palestinians today drive away the jews or kill every jewish child with their rockets or suicide bombers. The current state of affairs will continue long after we are all gone...</p>
