              <h3>The Chinese</h3>
              <p>Singapore's Chinese residents were the descendants
                  of immigrants from coastal southeastern China, an area of much
                  linguistic and subcultural variation. The migrants spoke at least five
                  mutually unintelligible Chinese languages, each of which contained
                  numerous regional dialects.</p>
              <p>Singaporean usage, however, following the
                  common Chinese tendency to assert cultural unity, referred to mutually
                  unintelligible speech systems as "dialects." All the Chinese languages
                  and dialects shared common origins and grammatical structures and could
                  be written with the same Chinese idiograms, which represent meaning
                  rather than sound.</p>
              <p>The primary divisions in the immigrant Chinese
                  population therefore followed linguistic lines, dividing the populace
                  into segments that were called dialect communities, speech groups, or
                  even "tribes". In the nineteenth century, each speech group had its own
                  set of associations, ranging from secret societies to commercial bodies
                  to schools and temples. The groups communicated through leaders
                  conversant with other Chinese languages or through a third language
                  such as Malay or English.</p>
              <p>The
                  nomenclature for Chinese speech groups common in Singapore and
                  Southeast Asia is confusing, partly because each group can be referred
                  to by several alternate names. Most of the names refer to places in
                  China with characteristic regional speech or dialects, and include the
                  names of provinces, counties, and major cities.</p>
              <p>The
                  distribution of Singapore's Chinese speech groups has remained fairly
                  stable since 1900. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The largest group were the Hokkien, who came from
                  the area around the trading port of Xiamen (Amoy) in southern Fujian
                  Province. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Hokkien traders and merchants had been active in Southeast
                  Asia for centuries before the foundation of Singapore. In 1980 they
                  made up 43 percent of Singapore's Chinese population. The second
                  largest group were the Teochiu (sometimes written Teochew), comprising
                  22 percent of the Chinese population. Their home area is Chaozhou, in
                  Chao'an County in northeastern Guangdong Province, which has as its
                  major port the city of Shantou (Swatow). Chaozhou is immediately south
                  of the Hokkien-speaking area of Fujian, and both Teochiu and Hokkien
                  are closely related languages of the Minnan group, mutually
                  intelligible to native speakers after sufficient practice. Hainanese,
                  from the island of Hainan south of Guangdong, made up 8 percent of the
                  population. Hainan was settled by people from southern Fujian who
                  arrived by sea, and Hainanese is a Minnan language whose native
                  speakers can understand Hokkien or Teochiu with relatively little
                  difficulty after practice.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Speakers of Minnan languages thus made up 72
                  percent of the Chinese population</strong></span>, for whom Hokkien served as a lingua
                  franca, the language of the marketplace.</p>
              <p>The
                  third most numerous group were Cantonese, from the lowlands of central
                  Guangdong Province around the port city of Guangzhou (Canton). They
                  made up 16 percent of the Chinese population.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Hakka, a group scattered
                  through the interior hills of southern China and generally considered
                  migrants from northern China, were 7 percent. Other Chinese call them
                  "guest people", and the term Hakka (Kejia in pihyih romanization) is
                  Cantonese for "guest families." </strong></span></p>
              <p>There also were small numbers of people
                  from the coastal counties of northern Fujian, called Hokchia, Hokchiu,
                  and Henghua, whose northern Fujian (Minbei) languages are quite
                  distinct from those of southern Fujian and seldom spoken outside of
                  Fujian. A final, residual category of Chinese were the "Three Rivers
                  People," who came from the provinces north of Guangdong and Fujian.
                  This group included people from northern and central China, and more
                  specifically those provinces sharing the word "river" (<em>jiang</em>)
                  in their names--Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. They would have spoken
                  southern Mandarin dialects or the Wu languages of Shanghai, Ningbo, and
                  Hangzhou. In 1980 they were 1.7 percent of the Chinese population.</p>
              <p>A
                  significant category of Chinese, although one not listed in the census
                  reports, were the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Baba Chinese or Straits Chinese. </strong></span>They were Chinese
                  who after long residence in Southeast Asia <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>spoke Malay or English as
                  their first language,</strong></span> and whose culture contained elements from China,
                  Southeast Asia, and sometimes Europe as well.</p>
              <p>An indication of the size
                  of the Baba Chinese community was provided by the 1980 census report
                  that 9 percent of Chinese families spoke English at home.
                  Stereotypically the Baba were the offspring of Chinese migrants and
                  local women. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the nineteenth century, they tended to be wealthier and
                  better educated than the mass of immigrants and to identify more with
                  Singapore and Southeast Asia than with China. </strong></span></p>
              <p>In spite of their
                  language, the Baba considered themselves Chinese, retained Chinese
                  kinship patterns and religion, and even when speaking Malay used a
                  distinct Baba dialect of Malay with many loan words from Hokkien.</p>
              <p>Never
                  a large proportion of Singapore's Chinese population, in the late
                  nineteenth century they took advantage of opportunities for education
                  in English and promoted themselves as loyal to Britain.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore,
                  many Baba families spoke English as a first language and produced many
                  of the leaders of Singapore's independent political movements,
                  including Lee Kuan Yew.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Although the Baba, in a sense, provided the
                  model for the current Singaporean who is fluent in English and
                  considers Singapore as home, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the community fragmented in the early
                  twentieth century as Chinese nationalism spread. After the 1920s its
                  members gained no advantage, economic or political, from distinguishing
                  themselves from the rest of the Chinese population and tended
                  increasingly to become Chinese again, often learning to speak Chinese
                  as adults. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span>In the 1980s, Baba culture survived largely in the form of a
                  well-known cuisine that mixed Chinese and Malay ingredients and in some
                  families who continued to use English as the language of the home.</p>
              <p>As
                  the majority of the population and the ethnic group that dominated the
                  political system and state administrative structure, Singapore's
                  Chinese exhibited the widest range of occupational, educational, and
                  class status. Those with little or no formal education occupied the
                  bottom rungs of the occupational hierarchy and led social lives
                  restricted to fellow members of the same dialect group.</p>
              <p>The level of
                  formal education and language of education--Chinese or English--divided
                  the Chinese into broad categories. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Status for those working in the
                  internationally oriented private sector or in government service
                  depended on command of English and educational qualifications. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the
                  still substantial Chinese private sector, status and security rested on
                  a position in a bounded dialect community and a network of personal
                  relations established over a lifetime. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Although the latter exclusively
                  Chinese category was shrinking, by the late 1980s it still contained
                  some quite wealthy men who helped set the international price of
                  rubber, controlled businesses with branches in Malaysia, Indonesia,
                  Hong Kong, and other countries of the region, and supported Singapore's
                  array of Chinese charities, hospitals, and education trusts.
                  Singapore's Chinese society was one with a high degree of social
                  mobility and one in which status increasingly was determined by
                  educational qualifications and command of English and Mandarin.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The largest Chinese dialect group in the late
                  nineteenth century were the Hokkien, who were traditionally involved in
                  trade, shipping, banking, and industry. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">next largest group, the
                  Teochiu,</span> </strong></span>engaged in agricultural production and processing, including
                  gambier, pepper, and rubber production, rice and lumber milling,
                  pineapple canning, and fish processing. Cantonese served as artisans
                  and laborers and a few made their fortunes in tin.</p>
              <p>The <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two smallest
                  groups, the Hakka and Hainanese, were mostly servants, sailors, or
                  unskilled laborers.</strong></span></span> Because wealth was the key to leadership and social
                  standing within the Chinese community at that time, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the Hokkien
                  dominated organizations such as the Singapore Chinese Chamber of
                  Commerce and supplied most of the Chinese members of the Legislative
                  Council and the Chinese Advisory Board. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The latter, established in 1889
                  to provide a formal link between the British government of the colony
                  and the Chinese community, served as a place to air grievances but had
                  no power.</p>
              <p>The affluent among Singapore's
                  Chinese community increasingly saw their prosperity and fortunes tied
                  to those of the crown colony and the British Empire. Western education,
                  customs, and pastimes were adopted, and the sons of Chinese businessmen
                  were often sent to Britain for university training.</p>
              <p>The Straits Chinese
                  British Association was formed in 1900 by Baba Chinese leaders to
                  promote loyalty to the British Empire as well as to advance the
                  education and welfare of Singapore's Chinese. Visiting British royalty
                  were warmly received and British causes and victories enthusiastically
                  supported. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Straits Chinese contributed generously to the British
                  war effort in World War I. </strong></span></p>
              <p>Although the Chinese
                  upper class,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">particularly the Straits-born Chinese, grew increasingly
                  Westernized</span>, the homeland exerted a continuing pull on its loyalties
                  that increased during this period.</strong></span> Visits to China by Singapore Chinese
                  became more common with the advent of steamship travel. The relaxation
                  by the 1870s of China's law forbidding emigration (repealed in 1893)
                  and the protection afforded Singaporeans by British citizenship made it
                  relatively safe for prosperous businessmen to visit their homeland and
                  return again to Singapore. Upper-class Singapore Chinese frequently
                  sent their sons to school in China and encouraged them to find brides
                  there, although they themselves had often married local women.</p>
