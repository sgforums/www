            <div class='col-md body'><p><span>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said on Monday he has enough support to topple the government and wants to meet with Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to discuss a handover. <br><br>Anwar held a mass rally on the eve of a deadline he has set to seize power with the help of defecting government lawmakers. <br><br>He arrived to rapturous applause from up to 7,000 supporters gathered at a Kuala Lumpur stadium which echoed to chants of "Reformasi" - the opposition battle cry of "Reform". <br><br>Officials from his Keadilan party said Anwar would make a speech that could shed light on his plans to topple the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, which has dominated Malaysian politics for half a century. <br><br>But there were mixed messages over whether he will on Tuesday declare he has the support of the 30 lawmakers he needs to form a new administration, and formally challenge Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. <br><br>Tian Chua, information chief of his Keadilan party, said the three-member opposition alliance had signed up enough defectors to form a simple majority in parliament and that Anwar wanted to meet with Abdullah on Tuesday to inform him. <br><br>"We want Abdullah to assure us there will be no repressive force used, like involving the police or inviting the military to take control," he told AFP. <br><br>Tian Chua said the opposition's push had been helped by a government crackdown on Saturday that saw an opposition politician, a prominent blogger and a journalist detained under draconian internal security laws. <br><br>"Abdullah's final crackdown made people lose hope that he is ever going to be a liberal reformer, which he promised," he said. <br><br>However, Keadilan vice-president Syed Husin Ali was more cautious, declining to specify how many defectors were on board and only saying that "tomorrow the beginnings of the process will happen." <br><br>"The whole process might take a month but it could be sooner," he told AFP. "You never know, he might announce something this evening. And tomorrow there will definitely be an announcement of something." <br><br>Spirits were high at the stadium, which was emblazoned with Malaysian flags and posters demanding the release of the opposition politician and the blogger - who remain in custody after the journalist was freed. <br><br>"I am sure Anwar will form the next government, as we the people have spoken as we want to see a new Malaysia led by Anwar," said 54-year-old taxi driver Yaacob Ismail. <br><br>The opposition made surprise gains in March general elections, seizing control of five states and a third of parliamentary seats in the biggest challenge ever faced by the coalition. <br><br>"My entire family is here, we want to tell Abdullah to leave now. I am confident Anwar will form a new government soon. We are very excited. I can't wait," said Juliette Ramasamy, a 24-year-old student. -</span></p></div>
