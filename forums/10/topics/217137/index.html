            <div class='col-md body'>That was a singular case of a Akha woman imprisoned in Changi Women's Prison. In fact, she should be imprisoned as she came in illegally the first time and tried to come back legally the second time.<br><br>If she was trafficked in illegally the first time, she should have made known of the fact to the immigration officers and translators in the first case. However, if she was involved in the duplicity of entering the country illegally, I doubt she wants to make it clear.</div>
