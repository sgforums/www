              <h1><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">MJIB to explain info leak to Egmont Group<br>TAIPEI, Taiwan –– The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) said yesterday that it will explain to an international anti-money laundering organization how information related to alleged money laundering by the former first family was leaked to former President Chen Shui-bian. <br>MJIB spokesman Liu Li-hsin was responding to reports by the Taipei-based China Times quoting an official from the Egmont Group who expressed shock that the information was passed on to the party involved in the case, a scenario she described as “inconceivable.”</span></h1>
              <h1><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">The official from the Toronto-based organization, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that such a scandal has not occurred since the organization was established in 1995. </span></h1>
              <h1><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">For this reason, the Egmont Group has asked Taiwan’s Money Laundering Prevention Center (MLPC) under the MJIB to give a detailed report at an annual conference of the group in October, according to the reports. </span></h1>
              <h1><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">Liu noted that “the MLPC has made great efforts over the years in preventing money laundering, “ and he promised that the center will explain the matter during the annual conference in Toronto. He added his hope that the matter “will not affect the group’s support for Taiwan.” </span></h1>
              <h1><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">Former MJIB head Yeh Sheng-mao admitted at a news conference Tuesday that he received information from the Egmont Group on possible money laundering involving Chen’s family members early this year. </span></h1>
              <h1><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">Not only did he withhold the information regarding Chen’s family’s bank accounts in the Cayman Islands, he also passed the documents to Chen during a regular monthly meeting after Egmont supplied the information Jan. 29. </span></h1>
              <h1><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">Yeh also admitted that in January 2007, he also passed to Chen a piece of information obtained from Egmont in 2006 about a bank account opened on the island of Jersey — a U.K. tax haven off the coast of France — by a member of Chen’s family. </span></h1>
              <h1><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">In response, Chen has claimed ignorance of his family’s overseas funds, saying that the family finances are handled by his wife.</span></h1>
