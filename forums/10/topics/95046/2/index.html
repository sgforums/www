Isn't there are people in the army they label them as CO or OO? So what are their roles in the army? Are they liable to saying "I donÂ’t know" when some form of propaganda is taking place? Questions &amp; more questions!<br><br>Seem like these ppl who are making a living behind those well protected military walls, are mutating into some kind of species nesting in their own dungeon.

            <div class='col-md body'>Those B******* should seriously pay full price for their actions. The whole course was an accident waiting to happen. U put a few commandos that think their too hard, in a position to abuse and "torture" trainees, sooner or later someone will die, and in this case, someone did. Torturing the helpless makes one feel powerful,and boosts one's ego. Look and Singaporeans track record of abusing maids. Seriously hope that all responsible will get what they deserve. Not just the 4 trainers, the PSOs as well. If u can't hold the responsibility, dun hold the rank.</div>

If he is not trained as a trainer, why is he deployed as one, then?<br><br>Extracted from today's Straits Times:<br><br><blockquote><strong>Accused 'not sure' if he dunked trainee </strong><br><br>A COMMANDO instructor accused of rashly causing the death of Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai, 19, yesterday said he could not say for sure if he had been involved in the dunking which led to the death of the trainee.<br><br>But Lieutenant Jeff Ng Chin Fong, 27, said he was certain he did not dunk another trainee, Captain Ho Wan Huo, 26, whose life he is accused of rashly endangering.<br><br>Yesterday, Ng, the first of the four accused commandos to take the stand, said he was very sure that none of the trainees he handled on Aug 21 last year had collapsed after being dunked.<br><br>Both 2nd Sgt Hu and Capt Ho had collapsed.<br><br>Ng said he was sure he did not dunk Capt Ho as when he saw the trainee, the man was already wet and being dragged back to the water tub by another instructor.<br><br>Ng said he asked the instructor, Staff Sergeant Ng Chong Chee, who the trainee was and if he had gone through the water phase. Staff Sgt Ng gestured that the trainee was a captain and had already been dunked.<br><br>He later found out there was only one trainee holding the rank of captain, he added.<br><br>Ng was also sure he did not dunk him as he had been wearing full gloves that day, whereas the instructor Capt Ho said had covered his face had been wearing gloves with the fingers exposed.<br><br>He denied that he used his fingers to 'dig' into trainees' mouths and nostrils while they were under water, pointing out the way he dunked soldiers did not allow him to have a free hand to do this.<br><br>The tub used in the dunkings of 2nd Sgt Hu and Capt Ho, he said, was introduced because the old way of dunking - trainees lying on their stomach and dunked in a washing bay filled with six inches of water - led to facial injuries.<br><br>Like some of the instructors who have been on the stand, Ng also testified that he had never seen the lesson plan for the course. He had asked two warrant officers for it but was told they did not have it.<br><br>In fact, said Ng, when Captain Pandiaraj Mayandi, 33 - another of the accused - took over the Commando Training Wing, he asked for all lesson plans to be handed in for an audit. But that one was not among them.<br><br>Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Wee Soon quizzed Ng on whether he had asked the supervising and conducting officers of previous courses for the lesson plan.<br><br>'It's not my position to question my superior,' replied Ng.<br><br>He disagreed when the DPP pointed out that high-ranking officers said the lesson plan was available and accessible to instructors.<br><br>'At that time, this lesson plan was not made available to me. There is a difference between being freely accessible and whether it's available to me.<br><br>'If it's not available to me, how can I access it freely?'<br><br>The trial continues.</blockquote>I wonder if this jerk is having a moeory lapse.

            <div class='col-md body'>An extract from a documented site:<br><br>'I think it's almost a rule of political science. The government will always lie about embarrassing matters. And when you are up in the Pentagon a full Colonel and have a chance to make General, and General with the chance to become Chief of Staff, there's as much politics high in the Pentagon as there is in the halls of Congress. And I think that the Army just chose to try and down play the terrible character of Army leadership in 1950.'<br><br>It is now nearly 50 years since the end of the conflict in Korea. The only major American investigation into the killing of refugees focused exclusively on the activities of the US Army over a small geographic area during one month of a conflict that lasted three years. Contradicting testimony from veterans and Korean survivors, the report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that orders to kill civilians were given at No Gun Ri. Clearly there are still many unanswered questions over American involvement in Korea, questions that were not answered by the narrow view of the US Army's investigation. Yet this burden now falls not on those responsible for giving the orders, but on the veterans and survivors alike.<br><br>So just accept it regardless whatever verdict it will be.</div>
