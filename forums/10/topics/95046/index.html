It is something that can be checked and verified even casually by all citizens or parents upon visits to camps or upon request.<br><br>Senior officers in all services can just take the initiatives to let internal processes kept in the mind come out in processes that can be seen or inspected to facilitate teamwork, coordination and habitual doing on daily basis to prevent accidents at seas, intrusions of immigrants and worksite accidents as well.<br><br>Such accountable and excellent processes can be easily displayed as good guidance without concepts, justifications or reporting. It is something in the daily doing of our works which are integrated into actual works and readily presented easily in simple supervisor's guidance or checklist. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyah the army recruit so many lowly-educated people as 'encheks' or simi lan jiao warrant officers, and they have no idea of what is humanity. If these people are not recruited by army, they will probably be out doing cleaner or driver jobs.<br><br>just look at the 4 who took delight in shaming a CAPTAIN by stripping his rank off and stamping on it. KNN...poor SOBs, that was probably the only chance they can tekan such a high ranking officer.<br><br>(WHO'S NEXT TO GET DUNKED?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> )</div>

Obviously, someone innocent was tortured to death by these men using their very own gruesome rules &amp; yet the manas a commander of a battalion, distanced himself from the tragedy by saying he knew nothing about it. What the crap is that?<br><br>Whoever here in the forum who put yourself or your own son in that decease position, how much pain do you think that person had gone through before he was being brutally &amp; openly killed. So what do people here think? What should be the appropriate verdict?<br><br>Certainly, it leaves us with a lot to ponder over!!<br><br></div></blockquote>well, wayang show mah...u got see taiwan pi li huo ? a simple story can drag until hundreds of episodes....the longer the trial, the more they can say that proper and due investigation have been done.<br><br>Person X dunked someone into the water. The person drowned as a result. Person X is found not to comply with the orders and the water dunking is not in the syllabus. Person X is in the wrong.<br><br>So whats so difficult abt the trail ? Witness (checked), evidence (checked), cause of death (checked).... this wayang show is going to drag months and even years and hopefully people forget abt it.</div>
