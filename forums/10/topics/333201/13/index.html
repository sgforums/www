              <div class="timestampHeader">Mon Oct 20, 2008 2:42am EDT</div>

              <div id="resizeableText">
              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Singapore's economy, which fell into a recession in the third quarter, will see growth remaining weak for "several quarters" though inflationary pressures will take time to ease, the country's trade minister said on Monday.</p>
              <p>Trade Minister Lim Hng Kiang said in parliament Singapore's exports and manufacturing activity have slowed on the back of the financial crisis, and that the country's jobless rate for 2008 will be higher than the 2.1 percent seen last year.</p>
              <p>"We must be prepared for weaker growth in the next few quarters, and possibly longer," Lim said.</p>
              <p>He said while Singapore's inflation, which hit a 26-year high of 7.5 percent in April, May and June, will continue to ease, it will take time for the decline in prices to be reflected in the consumer price index.</p>
              <p>"I must caution that inflation will continue to be sticky for the next few months," Lim said, adding authorities were "confident inflation will revert back to 2-3 percent" next year.</p>
              <p>Singapore's central bank said on Oct. 10 it expects inflation to remain within the 6-7 percent target for 2008, and forecast inflation to ease to 2.5-3.5 percent in 2009.</p>
              <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday the city-state had fallen into recession and the economic outlook over the next 12 months was uncertain.</p>
              <p>The Southeast Asian nation last sank into a recession -- defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contractions -- in 2002 in a global downturn after the Sept. 11, 2001 attack.</p>
              <p>The export-dependent economy will suffer from weaker demand in key export markets as global economies slow following a credit crisis that has seen the fall of banks in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
              <p>Singapore's three local banks DBS (DBSM.SI: <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=DBSM.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Quote</span></span></a>, <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=DBSM.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Profile</span></span></a>, <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=DBSM.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Research</span></span></a>, <a href="http://reuters.socialpicks.com/stock/r/DBSM"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Stock Buzz</span></span></a>), United Overseas Bank (UOBH.SI: <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=UOBH.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Quote</span></span></a>, <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=UOBH.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Profile</span></span></a>, <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=UOBH.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Research</span></span></a>, <a href="http://reuters.socialpicks.com/stock/r/UOBH"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Stock Buzz</span></span></a>) and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC.SI: <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/quote?symbol=OCBC.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Quote</span></span></a>, <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=OCBC.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Profile</span></span></a>, <a href="http://sgforums.com/stocks/researchReports?symbol=OCBC.SI"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Research</span></span></a>, <a href="http://reuters.socialpicks.com/stock/r/OCBC"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Stock Buzz</span></span></a>) are well capitalised and their asset quality remains strong despite the problems in the United States, Lim said.</p>
              <p>"Banks and insurance companies in Singapore do not have large exposures to either U.S. mortgage-related securities or to the institutions that have failed," said Lim, who is also deputy chairman of the city-state's central bank.</p>
              <p>He said the number of retrenchments in Singapore has stayed at the same level as in previous quarters, but it may climb as the economy slows further.</p>
              <p>"Moderation of employment growth is expected in the second half of 2008, and through to 2009," Lim said.</p>
              <p>In a nod that slowing growth posed a greater risk to Singapore's economy than rising prices, Singapore's central bank eased monetary policy for the first time since 2003 in October. (Reporting by Koh Gui Qing and Kevin Lim; Editing by Neil Chatterjee)</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">An Australian story - from fading uncle to economic success</span></h1>
              <p>I want to take you back to the early 1990s to the kind of nation we were then - insecure, uncertain about our economic prospects, battered by recession, suffering high unemployment and job insecurity, and scarred by the recent experience of 17 per cent mortgage interest rates.</p>
              <p>On a visit to Australia in 1994 the former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew reiterated a previous warning that Australia could become the “poor white trash of Asia”. This was partly a reflection on Australia’s economic state. It was also a reflection on the rise of the “Asian Tigers”.</p>
              <p>The dynamic growth of East Asia was in stark contrast to the economic malaise of Australia. When the government appealed for “enmeshment” in Asia it was making an economic appeal. The thinking was that if we could join a region that was successful we could overcome our own weakness.</p>

              <div>
              <p>The rise of the Asian Tigers through the ’80s and the comparative decline of Australia through the recession of the early ’90s sapped our confidence as a nation. And what is more, it sapped the respect for Australia among our neighbours and the wider international community.</p>
              <p>The Coalition Government was elected in March 1996. We laid down an economic program setting out medium-term targets on fiscal policy, monetary policy and debt management. By July 1997 we were on track to balance the budget for the first time in seven years. It was a close run.</p>
              <p>Beginning with mass capital outflow from Thailand in June-July 1997, financial contagion began spreading around the region. Those in Australia who had marvelled at the growth rates and saving rates of Asian Tigers saw these countries stagger and reel. They could only shudder to think what would happen to Australia - considered by many to have a weaker economy.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But Australia did not succumb to the Asian financial and economic collapse. In 1997-98 our growth rate was 4.5 per cent. We produced the first balanced budget in seven years. Paul Krugman writing in <em>Fortune Magazine</em> in December 1998 dubbed Australia “the miracle economy”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In March 1996 the APEC Finance Ministers met in Japan. It was the first APEC meeting I attended. We were given a polite welcome but we were not respected. Australia was tolerated much as a fading uncle is tolerated at Christmas dinner - there out of politeness and past association rather than present or future expectation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But we proved strong and resilient through the Asian economic crisis. We survived and we offered financial assistance to badly affected economies in the region.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In May 1999 APEC Finance Ministers met at Langkawi in Malaysia. We were not the fading relation at this meeting. Australia had won a great deal of respect. The region knew Australia was a success story and they wanted to learn from its experience. Now we had people talking of the “Australian model”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Since 1996 Australia has had continuous growth averaging 3.5 per cent per annum. During that period Singapore has had three recessions, Hong Kong has had three recessions, Korea has had one recession, Taiwan has had two recessions, Japan has had four recessions, and the United States went into a recession in 2001.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Over the last 10 years Australia has earned a great deal of respect amongst its neighbours and the other economies of the world. Australia’s achievements have given its people a lot more self respect. The nation feels more secure about itself. This is the Australian revival.</p>

              <p>The most recent OECD economic survey of Australia declared that in “the last decade of the 20th century Australia became a model for other OECD countries”. It is a report card which confirms that the sacrifices which went into stripping back protection and making all sectors of the Australia economy more competitive have, for the most part, been worth it.</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">A stable and competitive economy</span></h1>
              <p>Australia has recorded 17 consecutive years of economic growth since 1992 – averaging 3.3 per cent a year.</p>
              <p>It has been one of the most stable and productive periods of Australia’s modern history, and places Australia in the top echelon of developed countries in terms of sustained rates of growth.</p>
              <p>Australia is forecast to grow again at 2.75 per cent in 2008-09 which is above the average growth rate members of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of 2.2 per cent.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Australia ranks first in the Asia-Pacific region for labour, agricultural and industrial productivity per person employed, according to the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook.</p>
              <p>The 2006 OECD Economic Survey noted that living standards in Australia surpass those of all Group of Eight countries except the United States.</p>
              <h2>Sound economic management</h2>
              <p>Australia’s positive outlook is also sustained by its strong fiscal position. A sustained period of Government budget surpluses has enabled the Australian Government and many state level Governments to retire large amounts of Government debt.</p>
              <p>Net Government debt was eliminated in 2005-06 making Australia a net creditor nation. In May 2008, the Australian Government committed to a budget surplus equivalent to 1.8 per cent of GDP – some $21.7 billion.</p>
              <p>Australia’s independent central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), is responsible for monetary policy, in particular to keep consumer price inflation between two and three percent, on average, over business cycles.</p>
              <h2>Advanced economic structure</h2>
              <p>Australia has a sound and practical structure of financial regulations and institutions that provides certainty for business and is open to investment without undue delay. There is a strong, transparent corporate governance system along with business-oriented corporate regulation and insolvency regimes.</p>
              <p>Australia also has low barriers to trade and investment. Since a wave of micro-economic reform in the early 1990s, competition policy has been a key ingredient of the economy’s continuing success, including in key areas such as transport, telecommunications, electricity and gas.</p>
              <p>According to the World Bank, a new business can be established in Australia within two days compared with an OECD average of 20 days.</p>
              <p>The goods and services tax (GST) – Australia’s value-added tax – is levied at 10 per cent and applies to almost all goods and services transactions across the economy. There is no stamp duty on share transactions and a flat corporate tax rate of 30 per cent.</p>
              <p>Australia’s long and extensive period of economic growth has stretched its infrastructure capacity to the limit. Recognising the potential capacity restraints resulting from this problem, the Government committed in 2008 to creating an organisation called ‘Infrastructure Australia’ to provide a new, national approach to planning, funding and implementing the nation's future infrastructure needs.</p>
              <p>Safe, stable and prosperous, Australia is an increasingly attractive hub for global and regional business operations.</p>
              <div>
              <div>Did you know?</div>
              <p>Australia is home to citizens from some 200 countries, making it the most multilingual workforce in the Asia–Pacific region. More than 4 million Australians speak a second language.</p>
              </div>
              <h2>Knowledge-based industries</h2>
              <p>In the last century, it could be strongly argued that Australia’s economic success was based on its abundant agricultural and later mineral and fuels resources. While these sectors are still important, Australia has increasingly become a knowledge-based economy.</p>
              <p>Numerous factors have contributed to this development: the pace of technological and social change; advances in transport making travel, and the exchange of ideas, easier; and broader access to higher standards of education.</p>
              <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is a key driver of economic growth, and continuing expansion of ICT infrastructure is essential to keep pace with world standards. Australia’s ICT market is worth an estimated $89 billion with 25 000 companies employing 236 000 IT specialists.</p>
              <div>
              <div>Did you know?</div>
              <p>Australia was ranked the third most technology-savvy country in the world in the 2007 Globalisation Index (conducted for Foreign Policy by consulting firm A.T. Kearney).</p>
              </div>
              <h2>Financial markets</h2>
              <p>Australia is a major regional financial centre and a vital cog in the global financial system.</p>
              <p>The Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange merged in 2006 to form the world’s 8<sup>th</sup> largest listed exchange – the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). As at 30 June 2007, the ASX had 2,090 listed companies with a domestic market capitalisation of $1.63 trillion. Every day, some 150 000 equities and 400 000 futures and options are traded.</p>
              <p>Australia’s trading day spans the closure of the markets in the United States and the opening of markets in Europe. The ASX also has strong links with the major stock markets of Asia.</p>
              <p>Australia has one of the highest percentages of shareholders in the world. More than 50 per cent of the adult population own shares in publicly-listed companies.</p>

              <p>NOBODY likes to admit his dependence on others' goodwill. For the proud leaders of south east Asia, once so cocksure about their political and economic prowess, the experience has been especially galling. The global markets have, with a vengeance, taken a toll on their economic miracle. And, to sort out the mess, they are reduced to complaining that the rich world-the United States, Japan and Europe-is not doing enough to help. They may be right. But the financial turmoil has also shown up the inadequacy of the region's own self-help mechanisms.</p>
              <p>None of the much-touted institutions and forums designed to promote regional stability and economic health has had much to contribute, especially not the region's own club: the Association of south east Asian Nations (ASEAN). This favours carrots over sticks, consensus over breakthrough, camaraderie over formality and process over substance. Above all, ASEAN resists "interference in the internal affairs" of its members. Although this served the region well in the years after ASEAN's founding in 1967, enabling old sores to be salved and mutual confidence to be built, it has rendered the organisation incapable of providing a concerted response to the financial disaster. The "ASEAN way" no longer works.<br><br><strong>Economic sclerosis</strong></p>
              <p>THE organisation has, since last July, faced serious challenges to its effectiveness on three fronts: the economic, with the contagious effect of currency depreciations and market meltdowns; the political, from the bloody putsch in Cambodia just before it was due to join ASEAN; and the environmental, because of the poisonous smog from Indonesian forest fires. In each case the organisation's cardinal principle of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/80227aw.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">non-interference</span></span></a> has run into the reality of interdependence.</p>
              <p>One of the ironies is that the economic integration to which ASEAN has always aspired has arrived in the saddest of circumstances. The group has made some progress in economic co-operation. Intra-regional trade had been growing fast, lessening the reliance on America for exports, and a regional free-trade area is in the works. There is some co-ordination between central banks. But the speed with which the markets turned on the region as a whole exaggerated its member countries' similarities, and the unity between them.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the differences within the region made it hard to come up with an effective regional response. There have been several occasions when, had ASEAN not been so averse to meddling in its members' affairs, friendly criticism might have helped to avert calamity. Thailand, where south east Asia sprang a leak early last year, had for some time been heading for the rocks. The IMF had cautioned its government; the markets had sent warning shots across its bows; but any persuasion from fellow ASEAN members to set a new course was so discreet that it was easy to ignore.</p>
              <p>Later, after the Thai currency, the baht, had been floated and sank, and its neighbours found their own currencies and markets under siege, each country became painfully vulnerable to policy mistakes made by the others. For three months, for example, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, made repeated vitriolic attacks on speculators and on the West, and threatened to impose capital controls. Each outburst was followed by a sell-off, not just in Malaysia, but across the region. Many ASEAN leaders, as well as Malaysian businessmen, must have wished Dr Mahathir would keep his mouth shut. But it is unthinkable, in the ASEAN context, that they should tell him so.</p>
              <p>And they certainly cannot boss President Suharto of Indonesia around. The only ASEAN leader in power since the group's founding, Mr Suharto, in his quiet Javanese way, calls the shots. Indonesia is the regional giant, and has become the local bully. Containing Indonesia after the excesses of its "confrontation" with Malaysia and Singapore in the early 1960s was one of ASEAN's prime objectives and its greatest diplomatic success. Now, Mr Suharto's economic mismanagement poses the biggest threat to regional economic recovery.</p>
              <p>Other South-East Asian leaders, such as Dr Mahathir and Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister of Singapore, have visited him, presumably to coax him into implementing the sort of reforms the IMF has prescribed. But telephone calls from President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl probably did more to get Mr Suharto apparently to shelve a much-criticised plan to peg the stricken Indonesian currency, the rupiah, to the dollar by means of a currency board.</p>
              <p>Many south east Asians were alarmed. Asked about such "shock therapy", one finance minister says he is not sure that "therapy" is the right word. But he would not say so in public. That is not "the ASEAN way". When Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, suggested that Mr Suharto's apparent <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/80212st1.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">choice of a new vice-president</span></span></a> might rattle the markets, there were angry editorials in the Indonesian press.</p>
              <p>Yet the continuing economic dismemberment of Indonesia is, in a sense, the first test for the most significant initiative ASEAN has taken to deal with the crisis. The "Manila framework", agreed upon in the Philippine capital last November, envisages a regional surveillance mechanism whereby ASEAN members would pool economic data and apply "peer pressure" on those pursuing dangerous policies. This was virtually all that was left of a bold plan for an "Asian monetary fund", pursued with particular gusto by Dr Mahathir. Japan, which would have provided much of the money, pulled out, faced with the disapproval of the United States and the IMF.</p>
              <p>In the absence of a fund, ASEAN had no choice but to accept the IMF's primacy in prescribing economic cures. Although there is still talk of a "standby facility", the idea is, in the words of Lee Kuan Yew's son, Lee Hsien Loong, the head of Singapore's monetary authority, for "a kind of neighbourhood watch scheme".</p>
              <p>Although such initiatives might ease the next crisis, they come too late to help with this one. Instead, it is hoped that western governments will persuade their banks not to call in their loans; that Japan will stimulate its economy; that Europe and the United States will come up with more aid; and that China will not devalue its currency and set off a new round of regional depreciation. But as south east Asian leaders and diplomats grumble about the inadequacy of the rich countries' offers of help, and mutter about "fair-weather friends", they might think about the shortcomings of their own approach. A spot of "peer pressure" on governments causing instability would be a fine thing. But there is little sign of it; and none that it is working.<br><br><strong>Diplomatic paralysis</strong></p>
              <p>CALLS for a rethink of ASEAN's ways were first prompted, not by the economic debacle, but by a political upheaval: the savage coup mounted in Cambodia on July 5th last year, in which the country's second prime minister, Hun Sen, got rid of the first, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
              <p>Mr Hun Sen blew two holes in ASEAN's cosy style of business. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/0711smh.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Cambodia</span></span></a> was due to join on July 23rd, along with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/0714pres.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Myanmar</span></span></a> and Laos, thereby realising the founders' vision of a group including all ten countries of south east Asia. But the organisation had little choice but to defer Cambodia's accession. It had to admit that there were, after all, some limits to "non-interference", and some basic criteria for the domestic behaviour of members. But nobody could agree exactly what those criteria should be.</p>
              <p>Second, efforts to find a solution in "the ASEAN way" were thwarted by Mr Hun Sen's refusal to play by such rules. He was rude in public and private to ASEAN officials, and repeatedly pointed out the hypocrisy of their position. They had, after all, proceeded with the admission of Myanmar, despite its government's illegitimate seizure of power in 1988, its overturning of an election result in 1990, and its continued repression of dissenters. When, this month, hopes of a breakthrough in Cambodia finally emerged, it was as a result of a proposal, not from ASEAN, but from Japan.</p>
              <p>Although ASEAN diplomats express exasperation about Cambodia, they have a bigger worry. The regional crisis raises the fear of a catastrophic explosion of unrest and repression in Indonesia. Diplomatic efforts are directed at ensuring that it does not happen-largely by ensuring the rich world is aware of the potential danger, and so dips deep into its pocket to buy stability.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew laments that ASEAN can only show a "solidarity of fellow chicken-flu sufferers." On February 28th, the group's finance ministers were due to discuss measures such as Dr Mahathir's idea for greater use of local currencies in inter-regional trade, and Singapore's proposal for foreign guarantees to help finance Indonesian trade. But the important decisions are out of ASEAN's hands. As Mr Lee says: "We can't help each other."</p>

              <p><em>Singapore's exports fell the most in 17 months in May [2008] as the island's manufacturers shipped fewer electronics and other goods to the US and Europe. Non-oil domestic exports dropped 10.5% from a year earlier, the trade promotion agency said today [17 Jun 2008]. Manufacturers across Asia face easing demand amid slowing growth in the US, the region's largest overseas market. Pharmaceutical shipments dropped 48.5% in May from a year earlier, while electronics shipments slipped 8.5%, the 16th consecutive drop. Semiconductor shipments dropped 12.6%. Sales to the European Union fell 28% in May and US shipments dropped 22.3%.</em></p>
              <p>- The Singapore economy continues to be confronted by stagflation as economic weakness persists and shows signs of actually worsening, while <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/singapore_cpi_inflation_rate_for_may_2008_continues_at_26_year_high_of_7_5"><span style="color: #993311;">inflation continues to run at 26-year highs</span></a>. As I have <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/singapore_industrial_production_unexpectedly_dropped_in_apr_2008_on_drugs_electronics"><span style="color: #993311;">commented earlier</span></a>, this is as classic as it gets regarding the definition of stagflation : stagnant or slowing economic growth in a time of rising inflation.</p>
              <p>Sure, biotech manufacturing is subject to some "lumpiness" as equipment needs to be cleaned and re-setup for the next batch of medicines, but a 48.5% drop year-on-year? This is as good as "falling off the cliff", a sinking sensation that many in the peakoiler community are very, very familiar with. And electronics? 16 consecutive drops in 16 months. They could be trying for some kind of record here, together with semiconductors. A very ugly picture, especially given that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/singapore_cpi_inflation_rate_for_may_2008_continues_at_26_year_high_of_7_5"><span style="color: #993311;">inflation is still ongoing</span></a>, and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/crude_oil_hits_140_39_record_on_nymex_as_libya_warns_of_output_cut"><span style="color: #993311;">crude oil continues to set new record highs</span></a> regularly.</p>
              <p>This is the kind of situation that can lead to restlessness amongst the population, and in extreme cases descend into disorder and chaos and in fact it already has in some countries. You can be very sure that the government has got to be very concerned about it. Meanwhile, as an individual, in order to hedge against slowing economic growth, you might want to look into getting a job in a traditionally defensive sector, such as government, military, education, healthcare, and such. And as an investor, in order to hedge against inflation, what you can do is to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/a_fund_of_my_own"><span style="color: #993311;">buy into commodities</span></a>, hold on to them, and sit tight. Gold and oil and uranium and food and other resources are going higher. Much, much higher. We ain't seen nothing yet.</p>

              <p><em>Singapore's consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace last month [May 2008], reducing the need for further currency gains to rein in inflation. The consumer price index [CPI] jumped 7.5% from a year earlier, matching April's 26-year high record, the Department of Statistics said [23 Jun 2008]. The Monetary Authority of Singapore [MAS] had forecast a 5-6% inflation rate for 2008. The central bank has allowed its currency to strengthen against the US dollar, saying the exchange rate remains its most effective tool to fight inflation.</em></p>
              <p>- The Singapore inflation rate is reportedly stabilizing and analysts are already predicting that it will come down in the second half of 2008. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pDdh4Uw2rkej6LyR_3gBREQ"><span style="color: #993311;">Singapore M3 money supply</span></a> figures also appear to be stabilizing around the 12-13% level in the past half year, down from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/23_62_singapore_m3_money"><span style="color: #993311;">a high of 23.62%</span></a> in 2007. But the money supply growth rate is only half the story - the other half is its relationship to the growth of available goods and services in the economy. For the inflation rate to be stable, economic growth has to at least keep up with money supply growth. With a looming global economic slowdown and imminent worldwide recession, the economic growth factor is the big wildcard.</p>
              <p>Gold and crude oil prices may have paused from breaking new all-time record highs for the time being, but the inflationary storm is far from over as yet. We may only be passing through the eye of the hurricane here - just when people start to get lulled into complacency, the winds of inflation could well pick up with renewed force - perhaps even stronger than ever. We need to remain vigilant against inflation. This is no time to let down your guard yet.</p>

              <p>The latest Singapore money supply figures are out. For the month of Dec 2007, the Singapore M3 money supply growth has continued to slow, and it now stands at 14.14% year-on-year. However, real inflation shows no signs of abating because we are at the point where economic growth is falling (crashing) faster than M3 money supply growth is slowing. The Singapore economy is thus stuck in mud, and the stagflation formula goes as follows :</p>
              <p>14.14% M3 growth - (-4.8% economic growth) = 18.94% real inflation rate.</p>
              <p>For your reference, the money supply figures for the year of 2007 are as follows (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pDdh4Uw2rkej6LyR_3gBREQ"><span style="color: #993311;">click here for the spreadsheet</span></a> if the inline frame is not shown) :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, in 2007 we have been roaring along with an average M3 money supply growth of 20.6% year-on-year. It was only in the last 3 months (Oct-Dec 2007) that the money supply growth has slowed down considerably.</p>
              <p>However, if anything else, this is even worse than the time where it was reported on this blog when <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/23_62_singapore_m3_money"><span style="color: #993311;">M3 growth hit a high of 23.62% back in Jun 2007</span></a>. At the time, GDP growth was reported to be a still-healthy 8.6% so the M3-to-GDP differential was 23.62% - 8.6% = 15.02% then.</p>
              <p>Hence, for myself and for those of you readers who subscribe to the classic Austrian-school definition of monetary inflation as money supply growth relative to economic growth, the fight to maintain our purchasing power has just gotten a lot harder, and this stagflationary environment just makes things even worse.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Reits, in general, have fallen about 32.5 per cent in value from their peaks last year, but those with assets in inflation-prone economies, such as China, have fared even worse, according to financial portal Shareinvestor.com.</span></span></p>
              <p>CapitaRetail China Trust, for instance, has fallen 52 per cent in four months, as inflation in China galloped to 7.1 per cent - its highest level in over a decade.</p>
              <p>Reits are financial instruments investing in real estate like shopping malls, office buildings and hotels.</p>
              <p>Investors can buy units, which are much like shares, offering attractive dividend yields of 6 per cent to 8 per cent derived from rents.</p>
              <p>This is far higher than the 1.5 per cent interest on one-year fixed deposits at a bank.</p>
              <p>Historically, a low interest rate environment has been good for Reits - if accompanied by low inflation.</p>
              <p>Take CapitaMall Trust, the first Reit listed in Singapore. Its assets include the Tampines Mall and Junction 8 shopping centres.</p>
              <p>It received an overwhelming response from investors when it listed six years ago, rising from just 96 cents in July 2002 to a record high of $4.32 in July last year. Inflation played its part by staying at a benign 1 per cent.</p>
              <p>As the consumer price index, however, surged from 1.3 per cent in June to 4.4 per cent in December, CapitaMall slid 20 per cent over the period.</p>
              <p>The inflation pressure is unlikely to abate in the near future.</p>
              <p>Last week, the Government revised its estimates upwards to between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent for the year, from an earlier forecast of 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent.</p>
              <p>So, while fears of a United States recession are causing much grief among investors as they watch the value of their growth stocks evaporate, inflation is becoming a big threat to those with high dividend-yield plays like Reits.</p>
              <p>One trader explained: ‘A Reit may offer 6 per cent in dividend yield. But if inflation is running at 4.5 per cent, the actual yield an investor is getting is only 1.5 per cent.’</p>
              <p>To compensate for the lower return, an investor will demand a lower price for the Reit, which escalates the pressure on its share price.</p>
              <p>Still, analysts have not stopped promoting Reits, despite their lacklustre performance, to clients.</p>
              <p>Morgan Stanley made a case last month with a report arguing that investors had wrongly penalised Reits with concerns over acquisition growth and credit-tightening conditions.</p>
              <p>Investors have ignored the ‘organic’ boost Reits may get from higher rents as leases expire and hotel rates are jacked up during peak periods.</p>
              <p>Citigroup noted on Tuesday that while there may not be a clear growth strategy for Reits this year, some are trading at hefty discounts to their net asset values, despite offering single-digit or even double-digit dividend yields.</p>
              <p>‘This makes Reits potential takeover targets, if they have loose shareholding structures,’ it added.</p>
              <p>Its top picks include Ascendas Reit, Suntec Reit and Parkway Life Reit.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 10 - Singapore has slipped into recession and the Government has revised its 2008 growth forecast to around 3 per cent from a previous estimate of 4 to 5 per cent.</p>
              <p>The economy shrank at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 6.3 per cent in the third quarter, according to third quarter advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on Friday morning, pushing the export-dependent economy into its first recession since 2002.</p>
              <p>The government also revised down its 2008 growth forecast to around 3 per cent from a previous estimate of 4 to 5 per cent.</p>
              <p>Economists had expected the Republic to narrowly escape a recession in the third quarter by growing 1.1 per cent, lifted by a slight improvement in electronics output.</p>
              <p>A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contractions.</p>
              <p>The deepening financial crisis, which sparked banking crises in the United States, Iceland, Britain, Germany and Ireland, is threatening to drag the world economy into recession.</p>
              <p>The advance estimate, based largely on July and August data, gives an early indication of the economy's performance during the July-September period.</p>
              <p>MTI said the Singapore economy is estimated to contract by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, than a year ago.</p>
              <p>On a seasonally adjusted, annualised quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP declined by 6.3 per cent, following a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>On the outlook for the year, MTI said since the revised GDP forecast in August, "external economic conditions have deteriorated more than expected and some sectors of the economy have weakened significantly on account of industry-specific or domestic factors.</p>
              <p>"The worsening of the financial crisis in the US in recent weeks has deepened the credit crunch, making it more difficult for businesses to sustain economic activities. With unemployment on the rise and house prices continuing to fall, US consumer sentiment has weakened further and will affect demand for exports from Asia and the rest of the world."</p>
              <p>It added that Singapore's export-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing, will be affected, noting that Europe is also facing severe strains in the banking sector, tighter credit conditions, and adjustments in housing prices.</p>
              <p>Growth in major economies such as Germany, France, Italy and the UK has dipped sharply in the second quarter.</p>
              <p>Growth forecasts for several Asian economies, such as China, India and South Korea, have been revised downwards since the start of the year.</p>
              <p>The estimates showed that Singapore's manufacturing sector continued to be weighed down by the negative growth in biomedical sciences, as pharmaceutical companies are still producing a mix of pharmaceutical ingredients with values lower than compared to a year ago.</p>
              <p>The precision engineering and chemicals clusters have also slowed, because of weaker external demand.</p>
              <p>The construction sector grew by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, compared to the 18.3 per cent growth in the first half of 2008. Despite a strong pipeline of construction projects, a shortage of contractors, a tight labour market for engineers and project managers, and longer waiting times for equipment, have delayed the realisation of these projects.</p>
              <p>MTI said the financial services sector is likely to see slower growth in the coming months as the ongoing global financial crisis has heightened uncertainties for sentiment-sensitive segments such as stocks trading and fund management activities.</p>
              <p>"Taking into account the slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors, MTI has revised the 2008 GDP growth forecast to around 3 per cent. The inflation forecast of 6 - 7 per cent for 2008 remains unchanged," it said. - The Straits Times</p>

              <p>Singapore has become the first Asian economy to fall into recession, analysts said yesterday, after the government revised downward its full-year growth estimate and eased monetary policy for the first time in years.<br><br>The Ministry of Trade and Industry lowered the city-state’s full-year growth forecast to around 3 percent, citing a slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors.<br><br>The move came as the ministry released preliminary data showing that real GDP declined by 6.3 percent in the third quarter after contracting 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, the ministry said.<br><br>While it did not describe the economy as being in recession, a technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in economic output.<br><br>“Singapore will be the first Asia economy to fall into a technical recession,” DBS Group Research said in an assessment of the data.<br><br>In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) — its de facto central bank — said it was easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.<br><br>“The Singapore economy has weakened over the course of 2008, alongside an escalation in the turmoil in financial markets and a more severe deceleration in global economic activity,” MAS said.<br><br>These developments meant new uncertainties for the Singapore economy, while slower Asian growth would restrain activity in a range of service industries such as transportation and tourism, it said.<br><br>“The risks to external demand conditions continue to be on the downside and a more severe global downturn cannot be discounted,” the bank said.<br><br>Singapore is Southeast Asia’s wealthiest economy in terms of GDP per capita, but is heavily dependent on trade. This makes it sensitive to hiccups in developed economies, particularly key export markets the US and Europe.<br><br>Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP, the value of goods and services produced in the economy.<br><br>Compared with the third quarter of last year, the ministry said Singapore’s economy contracted by 0.5 percent in real terms, against the 0.8 percent expansion foreseen in the Dow Jones poll.</p>

              <div>SINGAPORE'S economy has slid into its first technical recession since 2002, as a slump in exports pushed quarterly growth into negative territory for the second quarter in a row.</div>
              <div>The economy shrank by a worse-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, according to estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) released on Friday morning.</div>
              <p>MTI has also revised its full-year growth forecast for the second time this year, lowering it to 'around 3 per cent' from 4 to 5 per cent previously. This would make it the weakest pace in seven years.</p>
              <p>Recognising growth concerns, the Monetary Authority of Singapore also changed its policy stance to zero appreciation of the Singapore dollar, reversing the gradual appreciation policy it has adopted since 2003.</p>
              <p>On a quarterly basis, third-quarter GDP contracted 6.3 per cent from the second quarter, on top of a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous three months. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of decline.</p>
              <p>Manufacturing led the slowdown again this time around, weighed down by a poor performance in the biomedical sciences segment. It was also hit by weakened global demand for exports as the United States-triggered financial crisis spreads around the world.</p>
              <p>The sector shrank by 11.5 per cent in the third quarter, after declining 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>Growth in construction and services also slowed. Construction, in particular, saw its pace of expansion halved to single-digit growth, as projects were delayed by the construction squeeze, said MTI.</p>
              <p>Services, touted as a key driver of growth this year, is likely to take a hit as well as financial services falters in the wake of the global credit crunch.</p>
              <p>Most economists expect the economy to grow even more slowly next year, with the chance of a technical recession turning into a 'real' one.</p>
              <p>'With external conditions deteriorating and the lack of domestic demand support, we expect Singapore to register no growth next year... with a muted recovery, if at all, expected only in the second half of next year at the earliest,' said Morgan Stanley economists in a report.</p>
              <p><strong>Inflation peaks</strong><br>Inflation, which reached a 26-year high earlier this year, has peaked, said MAS. Consumer prices will rise between 6 per cent and 7 per cent this year, and gains will ease to between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 2009, it predicted.</p>
              <p>'Against the backdrop of a weakening external economic environment and continuing stresses in global financial markets, the growth of the Singapore economy is expected to remain below potential in the period ahead,' said MAS.</p>
              <p>'Inflation is expected to trend down in 2009 as the global and domestic economies slow.'(Straits Times Singapore)</p>

              </div>
              <p>&lt;!-- /NOLImage --&gt;The recession-hit economy of Singapore has shrunk by a record 5.6% during July to September.</p>
              <p>The sharp contraction was expected by analysts, and the government is now forecasting that the economy will contract by 3% for the full year.</p>
              <p>"In the light of the uncertainty in the global economy, Singapore has now revised its full year growth forecast to minus 3.0%," said Trade Minister George Yeo.</p>
              <p>Previously the government had forecast 0.5-1.5% growth.</p>
              <p><strong>US ties</strong></p>
              <p>The country is suffering from its exposure to the US - its biggest trading partner - which is battling with its own economic problems.</p>
              <p>Last month's terrorist attacks on the US have also exacerbated problems by denting consumer confidence.</p>
              <p>"The appalling attacks on September 11 and the resulting train of events have probably tipped the global economy into a recession," said Mr Yeo.</p>
              <p><strong>Electronics downturn</strong></p>
              <p>The sharp contraction in the third quarter was blamed on the downturn in the electronics sector.</p>
              <p>The goods producing sector in the trade-driven country fell by 15% while manufacturing output fell by 21% compared with a year ago.</p>
              <p>This constitutes the sharpest fall since the 1985 recession.</p>
              <p>"From the data so far, it certainly describes the economy is in a far worse shape than it has ever been," said Song Seng Wun, a regional economist at GK Goh brokerage.</p>
              <p>However, Aberdeen Asset Management's Hugh Young told the BBC's World Business Report:"The feeling on the streets is not nearly as bad or as gloomy as it was when the Asian crisis hit. Certainly there is a lot of fear over job security right through Singapore at the moment."</p>

              <p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry also revised downwards full-year growth forecast to around 3pc, citing a slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors.</p>
              <p>Southeast Asia's wealthiest economy saw gross domestic product fall by 6.3pc during the third quarter having previously contracted by 5.7pc.</p>
              <p>While the ministry did not describe the economy as being in recession, a technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in economic output.</p>
              <p>In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore - its de facto central bank - said it was also easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 7.7pc last year but have been signs of a slowdown following contractions in Singapore's key manufacturing sector, which includes the country's electronic and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
              <p>Construction growth slowed to 7.8pc from 19.8pc, during the quarter, although service industries grew by 6.1pc, marginally down from 7pc in the second quarter.</p>
              <p>Singapore's last technical recession was recorded in 2002, when the economy contracted by 2.4pc during the year. The country is seen as an important indicator of economic trends in the rest of Asia due to its export-dependent economy.</p>
              <p>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Asian economies face a "rough ride" for at least the next year as weakening consumer demand from developed countries hurt the region's exports.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE manufacturers are cautious about the business prospects in the next six months, a Government survey released on Thursday showed, reflecting concerns over a slowing global economy.</p>
              <p>In the latest quarterly survey conducted by the Economic Development Board (EDB) among manufacturers, 87 per cent said the outlook for the next six months will not improve from the previous quarter when manufacturing output contracted 5.6 per cent.</p>
              <p>A separate survey by the Department of Statistics showed companies in the services sector sharing the same cautious sentiment over the six-month period.</p>
              <p>According to the survey, 24 per cent of the services firms polled expected business conditions to improve, while 22 per cent were less optimistic.</p>
              <p>The responses are weighted by operating receipts and value added.</p>
              <p>&lt;!-- show media links starting at 7th para --&gt;Chemical makers had the gloomiest outlook, with a net weighted 23 per cent of firms expecting business conditions to worsen on the back of high material costs.</p>
              <p>Producers in the general manufacturing industries, which include the food, tobacco and printing sectors, were the most optimistic, with a net weighted 11 per cent expecting business to improve.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy shrank 6.6 per cent in the second quarter after seasonal adjustments, its biggest contraction in five years amid a slowdown in key export markets the United States and the European Union.</p>
              <p>The less positive business outlook comes against a backdrop of rising unemployment in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The jobless rate in the second quarter went up to 2.3 per cent after seasonal adjustments, compared to the previous quarter's 2 per cent, according to latest estimates released by the Ministry of Manpower on Thursday morning.</p>
              <p>The data showed that employment grew by 70,600 in the second quarter this year, which is slightly lower than the increase of 73,200 in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>In his National Day message for Singaporean workers, NTUC chief Lim Swee Say on Thursday urged workers to moderate their wage expecations for this year, warning that pushing wages up to fully offset inflation is a risky move, as they will end up paying ever higher prices.</p>
              <p>'Instead of pushing wages up to fully offset inflation, we must continue to link built-in wage increase to productivity gain and help our people through various non-wage measures', he said.</p>
              <p>This will prevent a 'price-wage spiral', he said.</p>

              <p>Tourism makes up nearly to 10 per cent of Singapore total GDP and the local tourism industry will take a ‘battering’ as analyst predicts Singapore tourism to slow despite our upcoming inaugural F1 first ever night race</p>
              <p>The global credit crisis and slowing economy also didn’t help in the slowdown in Singapore tourism. Some 100,000 visitors are expected for the F1 weekend and some 40,000 of those are from overseas</p>
              <p>F1 Singapore Grand Prix is part of our nation plan to make it a more global and a unique place. Not only we’re attracting international act of F1 which will earn around S$100 million ($70 million) a year in tourism revenue, there’s also our integrated casino which will open end of next year</p>

              <p><em>a lion puppet</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who wondered what happened.</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy created a clone called "makepeace" which he used in speakers corner to further his own agenda, trying to give people the impression that there are others out there that would agree with him.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding it.</p>
              <p>This kind of behaviour is called sockpuppeting, ie. creating a false online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>A <strong>sockpuppet</strong> is an <a title="Online identity" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Online_identity"><span style="color: #0066cc;">online identity</span></a> used for purposes of deception within an <a title="Internet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Internet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Internet</span></a> community. In its earliest usage, a sockpuppet was a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a <a title="Hand puppet" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hand_puppet"><span style="color: #0066cc;">hand puppet</span></a>.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In current usage, the perception of the term has been extended beyond second identities of people who already post in a forum to include other uses of misleading online identities. For example, a <em><a title="NY Times" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/NY_Times"><span style="color: #0066cc;">NY Times</span></a></em> article claims that "sock-puppeting" is defined as "the act of creating a fake online identity to praise, defend or create the illusion of support for one’s self, allies or company."<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[2]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The key difference between a sockpuppet and a regular <a title="Pseudonym" rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0066cc;">pseudonym</span></a> (sometimes termed an "alt") is the pretense that the puppet is a third party who is not affiliated with the puppeteer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To "flame wars" and "phishing" we can now add "<strong>sock puppet</strong>." A <strong>sock puppet</strong>, for those still boning up, is a false identity through which a member of an Internet community speaks while pretending not to, like a puppeteer manipulating a hand puppet. Recently, a senior editor at The New Republic got in trouble for some particularly colorful <strong>sock puppet</strong>ry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Lee Siegel began blogging for The New Republic, he found, as many others have, that Internet posters tend to be fairly outspoken — and a good number of the posters on the blog were harshly critical. An exception was ''sprezzatura,'' who regularly offered extravagant praise. After Mr. Siegel was criticized for his writing about Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' sprezzatura wrote: ''Siegel is brave, brilliant and wittier than Stewart will ever be. Take that, you bunch of immature, abusive sheep.'' A reader charged that sprezzatura was in fact Mr. Siegel, but sprezzatura denied it.</p>
              <p>The reader turned out to be right. ...</p>

              <p>After making some lame and hasty excuse about his account being hacked, lionnoisy suddenly abandoned all this threads in which him being sockpuppeting was being mentioned. Unfortunately his excuse cannot stand up to logic as he was seen responding to and talking back TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT.</p>
              <p>This is what happened:</p>
              <p>29th April 0932hrs a "user" called "makepeace" that had never posted before created a lionnoisy-sounding titled thread called "<strong>Oz Judge ban TV drama &amp; interview glorify gangland wars</strong> "</p>
              <p>Already suspisions were raised because the structure and phrasing of the title was signature of lionnoisy. The first post by this "makepeace" was as such:</p>

              <p>Note that other then for the user name, this post is virtually indistinguishable from the countless of other lionnoisy posts we can compare it with. The excessive reliance on the media, posting of hyperlinks, using warped logic that takes issues out of their context, and most tellingly the horrible english which make typos and grammatical errors right down to what lionnoisy would EXACTLY make is exactly what you'd expect from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>Hence lionnoisy must have been someone disappointed because after 20 minutes still nobody bothered to reply to his post under makepeace. Hence he decided to bump his own thread.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; line-height: normal;"><span>But after a few lackluster replies, he finally decided to "talk" to makepeace</span></p>

              <p>Now this is the funny part, if his account was really hacked as he claimed it to be, he would certainly not be replying back to his "hacked" account so happily in such a way.</p>
              <p>But in any case when he was exposed he made this very funny, frantic and desperate post trying to suddenly divorce himself from the actions of his sockpuppetry by claiming he was hacked. Unfortunately all a basic look at the thread will reveal what really happened, and that is nothing other then lionnoisy was caught red-handed sockpuppeting.</p>

              <p><strong>LONDON - Singapore is likely to get only about $13 million in compensation even though the cost to clean up its worst-ever oil spill may hit $100 million. The pollution came from the spill of more than 25,000 tons of crude oil at sea after an Oct. 15 collision between two tankers. All the spillage came from the smaller of the two, the Cyprus-registered Evoikos, which had punctures to three tanks when the Thai-registered tanker Orapin Global rammed it broadside.</strong></p>

It was the index's lowest closing level since September 2003. <br><br>Volume was 1.36 billion shares.

There are worries over the banks' results," a trader with a local house told Dow Jones Newswires. <br><br>Japan's Nikkei index plunged more than nine per cent on Friday, coming close to its post-bubble low after the yen surged and technology giant Sony slashed its profit forecasts. <br><br>"Absolute carnage in Asia as recession fears spread like a wild fire. Risk aversion is happening on a massive scale," Knight Equity Markets vice president Ioan Smith said. <br><br>Among Singapore's leading blue chips, Singapore Airlines plunged S$1.22 to S$10.52, Singapore Telecommunications was off 22 cents to S$2.06 and Neptune Orient Lines dropped 13 cents to S$1.03. <br><br>Property stocks also closed weaker after the latest figures showed private residential property prices fell in the third quarter, the first decline in more than four years. <br><br>CapitaLand sank 19 cents to S$2.58, City Developments retreated 46 cents to S$6.10 and Keppel Land was nine cents lower at S$1.59. <br><br>As for banks, DBS gave up 94 cents to S$10.04, United Overseas Bank lost S$1.72 to S$12.08 and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp was down 61 cents at S$4.88. - AFP/ms </span></p>

What is it all about?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In theory, most of this need never be paid back - the loans are
              simply renewed, or "rolled over", whenever the loan terms expire. But,
              right now, it's difficult and expensive to roll over debt. This is
              where <span style="color: #ff0000;">RAMS got into trouble - it could not roll over $6 billion in
              loan</span>s.</p>
              <p>The problem is that the wholesale money market is frozen - banks
              don't want to lend to each other because they're scared they won't get
              the money back. <span style="color: #ff0000;">This is a big issue for Australian banks, because they
              rely more on overseas wholesale funding than do banks in other
              developed countries.</span></p>
              <p>How much are we talking? This week, NAB said it planned to raise
              between $14 billion and $19 billion from overseas to meet its lending
              needs to customers. CBA has raised about a third of its $24 billion
              wholesale funding requirements and ANZ is trying to raise about $21
              billion of long-term funding.</p>
              <p>By guaranteeing banks' wholesale funding, the Government hopes to
              reassure investors they won't lose out by lending to Australian banks.
              Hopefully, the guarantee will reduce the cost of funds to Australian
              banks, thus reducing the prices they pass on to bank customers.</p>

              line on his blog. The point of deposit guarantees was "to ensure that

              cover a fraction of the kindling in the pot. Most of the deposits are
              by large holders, businesses and, yes, the additional payments people
              have been making into their home mortgages ... Ifsomeone shouted 'fire'
              at a particular institution, those deposits would run and the bank or
              other institution would still be in trouble ... Put simply, bank runs
              are worrying because they can be self-fulfilling. This is as
              non-controversial a proposition as you get ineconomics."</blockquote>

              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Singapore's economy, which fell into a recession in the third quarter, will see growth remaining weak for "several quarters" though inflationary pressures will take time to ease, the country's trade minister said on Monday.</p>
              <p>Trade Minister Lim Hng Kiang said in parliament Singapore's exports and manufacturing activity have slowed on the back of the financial crisis, and that the country's jobless rate for 2008 will be higher than the 2.1 percent seen last year.</p>
              <p>"We must be prepared for weaker growth in the next few quarters, and possibly longer," Lim said.</p>
              <p>He said while Singapore's inflation, which hit a 26-year high of 7.5 percent in April, May and June, will continue to ease, it will take time for the decline in prices to be reflected in the consumer price index.</p>
              <p>"I must caution that inflation will continue to be sticky for the next few months," Lim said, adding authorities were "confident inflation will revert back to 2-3 percent" next year.</p>
              <p>Singapore's central bank said on Oct. 10 it expects inflation to remain within the 6-7 percent target for 2008, and forecast inflation to ease to 2.5-3.5 percent in 2009.</p>
              <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday the city-state had fallen into recession and the economic outlook over the next 12 months was uncertain.</p>
              <p>The Southeast Asian nation last sank into a recession -- defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contractions -- in 2002 in a global downturn after the Sept. 11, 2001 attack.</p>
              <p>The export-dependent economy will suffer from weaker demand in key export markets as global economies slow following a credit crisis that has seen the fall of banks in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

              <p>"Banks and insurance companies in Singapore do not have large exposures to either U.S. mortgage-related securities or to the institutions that have failed," said Lim, who is also deputy chairman of the city-state's central bank.</p>
              <p>He said the number of retrenchments in Singapore has stayed at the same level as in previous quarters, but it may climb as the economy slows further.</p>
              <p>"Moderation of employment growth is expected in the second half of 2008, and through to 2009," Lim said.</p>
              <p>In a nod that slowing growth posed a greater risk to Singapore's economy than rising prices, Singapore's central bank eased monetary policy for the first time since 2003 in October. (Reporting by Koh Gui Qing and Kevin Lim; Editing by Neil Chatterjee)</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2008, Possibly Singapore's worst economic performance ever:</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Singapore, 9 October 2008</span></strong> <span>- The Singapore Business Federation (SBF) today organised a "Business Outlook &amp; Sentiment for Q4 2008 &amp; 2009" seminar, where economists provided comprehensive insights on the local and regional economic trends for the next 15 months. This is the first of a series of quarterly seminars on economic outlook and business sentiment, which aims to provide Singapore companies with a heads up of economic trends and assess their impact on employment, consumer spending, overall demand and business confidence in Singapore.<br><br>The seminar saw a turnout of close to 100 senior and middle management staff from SMEs from diverse industries such as travel, retail, logistics and engineering. Speakers included well-known economists and finance industry experts like Ms Selena Ling of OCBC Bank, Mr Song Seng Wun of CIMB-GK Research and Jeremy Ong of KPMG, who shared their growth forecasts of Singapore and the global economy.<br><br>The following projections were unveiled at the seminar:</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span>·</span><span><span> </span> Q4 growth in most countries in Asia, Europe, as well as United States and Australia is expected to end on a weak note and 2009 growth is likely to be even lower than 2008.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span>·</span><span><span> </span> Likely downgrades to the 2008 official Singapore GDP growth forecast of 4-5%, caused largely by weakness in the manufacturing and electronics sectors and a lackluster biomedical/ pharmaceuticals industry.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span>·</span><span><span> </span> The labour market and both external and domestic demand are likely to slow down.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt; line-height: normal; text-align: justify;"><span>·</span><span><span> </span> The recession in the United States and Eurozone is likely to last longer than normal and will have a significant negative impact on Asian growth.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>·</span><span><span> </span> The fall in global trade and financial flows could lead to Singapore's worst economic performance ever.<br><br><br>Mr Lee Yi Shyan, Minister of State for Trade and Industry, is of the view that, "With rising operating costs and the slowdown in the global economy, SMEs face challenges. However, certain industry sectors continue to see sustained growth."<br><br>"With the launch of the quarterly Economic Business Outlook &amp; Sentiments series, SBF hopes to provide its members with more timely information on the local and regional landscape and their impact on the business environment", he added.<br><br>The seminar saw active participation, with businessmen eager to find out how the projected trends would impact their businesses, as well as what measures government would take to mitigate the economic slowdown. When asked by Mr Daney Lim of Shaw Towers Realty Pte Ltd what the monetary and fiscal policies would be given the worst case scenario in 2009, Mr Song Seng Wun said "From an economist's point of view, at this juncture looking into the big unknown, it would be better to be more aggressive now than later on. However, from another point of view, it may be better to adopt a wait-and see approach to see if things will get better. At this moment, costs are coming down, unemployment is not a real issue so it may be better to do some fine-tuning instead of adopting an aggressive approach."<br><br>Mr Teng Theng Dar, CEO of Singapore Business Federation said, "Today's seminar is the first of a new series of quarterly seminars on economic outlook and business sentiment to give our members a heads-up on what to expect in fourth quarter 2008 and a forecast for 2009. The challenge of the global financial crisis is real. Singapore companies, particularly smaller businesses are encouraged to participate in this quarterly program to have a better understanding on the outlook in aid of their respective business scenario planning."<br><br>"In addition to the newly launched SBF-SPRING Financial Management Series to support members' concerns on costs management, SBF is organising this series of seminars to equip companies with knowledge of the local and regional economic trends. While there is an obvious need for caution for the next few quarters, businesses should use this uncertain and challenging time to build capacity and gear up for the next wave when the global economy bounces back", he added.</span></p>

              <p>Republic up 17 places in global ranking due to higher inflation and stronger Singdollar</p>
              <p>SINGAPORE has become a more expensive place for expatriates to live, but it is still cheaper than Hong Kong, even though the gap is closing with its long-time rival.</p>
              <p>The Republic jumped 17 places to land at the 114th spot in a global survey of the costliest cities for expatriates, because of higher inflation and a stronger Singdollar in the past year.</p>

              <p>Singapore closed the gap with pricier cities such as Hong Kong, which fell in the rankings to the 97th spot, in the survey conducted by human resources firm ECA International.</p>
              <p>Within Asia, Singapore actually fell from the ninth spot six months ago to the 13th spot, partly because the cost of living in some Japanese cities had risen rapidly due to the stronger yen.</p>
              <p>The purchasing power of expats living in Singapore has been dented by higher costs such as rents, fuel and food, as well as a stronger Singdollar.</p>
              <p><a href="http://propertyforesight.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/st_080612_cost-of-living-up-for-expats-in-singapore1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3739" src="http://propertyforesight.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/st_080612_cost-of-living-up-for-expats-in-singapore1.jpg?w=307&amp;h=401" alt="" width="307" height="401"></a></p>
              <p> According to ECA’s data, the cost of fuel rose by more than 13 per cent in the last six months, while the price of foodstuffs such as egg noodles soared by almost 15 per cent.</p>
              <p>Inflation in Singapore is now at a 26-year high, after accelerating at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.5 per cent in April.</p>
              <p>This prompted the Government to raise its inflation forecast to between 5 per cent and 6 per cent, up from the 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent range.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, the Singdollar fell to about 1.374 against the greenback</p>

              <td class="quote">Life-long learning may be a national priority now, but as some students have found out, that is not enough to shield them from the double whammy of fee increases and the Goods and Services Tax hike. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: red;">Two days before the higher 7-per-cent GST kicked in on July 1, prospective students of the continuing education arm of the National University of Singapore (NUS) received news that fees for many courses had gone up — by an average 14 per cent.</span></span> <br><br>In comparison, the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM), the other big providers of lifelong learning courses, have not increased course fees for their continuing education and professional development courses this year. <br><br>One caller to the MediaCorp Hotline at 6822 2268 described the fee increase as "profiteering". A student told Today he found it unfair how the fee for NUS Extension's part-time basic Mandarin course, for example, is now $650, which is $20 more, when the course duration had been shortened to 40 hours from the original 48. <br><br>According to NUS Extension, its fee increases were to offset the "significant increase" in operating and rental costs, although it did not elaborate on how much these have increased. <br><br>NUS Extension is located at the Park Mall building, a commercial facility on Penang Road. NTU and SIM, in contrast, conduct continuing education classes on their main or satellite campuses. <br><br>NUS Extension's latest fee hike is double the average increase some courses saw in January, the last time it had adjusted its fees — also to offset an increase in operating costs, said its spokesman. <br><br>The fee adjustments for its lifelong learning courses, which may last a day or several weeks, are in contrast to the situation for undergraduate studies. NUS, like NTU and the Singapore Management University, announced in January that they would not raise tuition fees this year in view of the upcoming 2-percentage-point increase in GST. In general, undergraduate fee increases are also capped at 10 per cent a year. <br><br>Courses at NUS Extension, though, are self-funding and "do not attract any subvention", said its spokesman. "Upward and downward adjustment of course fees are done to ensure that each individual course is self-sustaining," he said, and pointed out that the fees this year for some courses had been reduced. <br><br>For some students, the issue is that the fee adjustments cut too close to the increase in GST. <br><br>NUS Extension had sent out its 18,000 catalogues in late June, leaving prospective students only a couple of days to avoid paying the higher GST rate. <br><br>"There was no warning," said one student who is taking an applied psychology course. <br><br>NUS Extension said the adjustments were aligned with the publication of its course catalogue, which is circulated at the beginning of January and July each year. The Centre for Continuing Education at NTU also reviews fees on a half-yearly basis. <br><br>NUS Extension's current students, however, were informed about the fee adjustments a few weeks earlier and could enjoy the earlier rates if they enrolled and paid for the courses by June 30. <br><br>Still, there were complaints about the introduction of non-refundable registration fees of $50 for courses which cost below $700, and $120 for those above $700. <br><br>According to NUS Extension, it had reviewed operating procedures and "realised there had been past instances where students had signed up for courses without paying a registration fee and had then dropped out or failed to show up for classes". <br><br>"This had resulted in NUS Extension bearing the expenses required to engage the external trainers, as well as other administrative and logistics charges required to conduct the courses," said the spokesman. <br><br>The registration fee is in addition to the latest fee increases. <br><br>Not all students were deterred by the higher prices, though. <br><br>"Compared to other places, it may be more expensive, but I'm getting positive feedback from colleagues. The most important thing is the learning result," said Mr Denny Hendoko, 24, who registered last week for a Mandarin class. <br><br>More than 530 students have registered for courses commencing this month, not including classes which will start later. - TODAY</td>

It also allows for reductions if the economy plunges into a deep recession. <br><br>The most recent fare increase was in October last year - then, they went up by between one and three cents per trip on buses and trains. <br><br>Back then, the operators blamed high costs - in particular the high price of fuel and manpower - for the need to raise their fares. <br><br>Today, the companies are citing the same reasons - manpower and energy - for their fare increases. <br><br>SBS Transit, part of the ComfortDelGro group, for instance, called its cost increases 'significant'. <br><br>'Energy costs, for example, rose by 20 per cent or $20.3 million last year - having already increased by 41.2 per cent in 2005,' SBS Transit spokesman Tammy Tan said. <br><br>'Manpower costs, the company's largest cost component, also increased by about $12.1 million during the year.' <br><br>SBS also pointed out that it had invested heavily in buses as well as commuter services. <br><br>It spent $135 million on new buses in the past two years. And it has rolled out an online bus arrival system, which helps commuters to plan their journeys better. <br><br>SMRT pointed out that the increase in the goods and services tax as well as the 1.5 percentage point rise in employers' CPF contributions will pull down its earnings by about $11 million a year. <br><br>It said the fare increase, if kept to this year's cap of 1.8 per cent, would only partially offset the company's total cost increases. <br><br>SBS is proposing to keep children and school student fares as well as concession pass charges unchanged. <br><br>SMRT also said it is proposing no rises for children and students. In addition, it is not asking for rises to all bus cash fares. <br><br>SMRT is also waiving any increase to the first fare band of its MRT single-trip ticket, which costs 90 cents. It added that it would extend its senior citizen concession hours to match SBS'. <br><br>Both operators said they would come up with schemes to help the poor cope with any fare rise. <br><br>The Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) was not entirely convinced. <br><br>Case executive director Seah Seng Choon pointed out that transport companies are enjoying 'good returns'. For instance, SMRT achieved a 39 per cent rise in net earnings to $37.94 million in the first quarter. <br><br>'With such significant increase in net earnings, commuters would certainly expect it to show clear justifications for any need to hike fares at this point in time,' he said.</p></div>

              <td class="quote">A TRIP to the supermarket will cost more now than it did at the beginning of the year. <br>A Straits Times check on a random basket of basic goods sold at supermarkets here revealed price increases in almost every category, from fresh chicken to coffee and milk formula. <br><br>For instance, a popular brand of luncheon meat cost $1.70 in January, but now costs $2.50. Then, fresh whole chicken sold for about $4.50; the price is now closer to $5.20. <br><br>This, on the back of news last week that noodle and bread prices were on the rise. <br><br>But Singapore is not alone: Prices of bread, pasta, potatoes and meat are going up, putting pressure on family budgets around the world. <br><br>Russia imposed Soviet-style price controls on a range of foodstuffs last month. China has released stockpiles of pork, while Bangladesh, Jordan and Egypt are raising subsidies or slashing import tariffs. <br><br>Suppliers The Straits Times spoke to said droughts in Australia, crop failures in the US, reduced milk production and higher cost of tinned food cans are all contributing factors. <br><br>Globally, prices of wheat and milk are at historic peaks. Corn and soyabean prices have also risen steeply, and international wheat prices have risen nearly 74 per cent since January. <br><br>With higher grain costs, feed will become more expensive, and suppliers say this will mean a rise in meat and milk prices. <br><br>Rising food prices have contributed to inflation here. September's overall Consumer Price Index showed that prices generally retreated by 0.3 per cent from the previous month, but the food component - the biggest item at 23 per cent - rose 3.7 per cent as the cost of fresh vegetables, fruit, seafood and milk powder, as well as hawker and restaurant food, went up. <br><br>Consumers The Straits Times spoke to said that while increases for each item may seem like a token sum, together, they add up to a much bigger grocery bill. <br><br>Housewife Cynthia Leow, 30, told The Straits Times she noticed she was paying about $10 more during her weekly supermarket trips. <br><br>Similarly, Ms Huang Ya Li, 60, said she needed to set aside an additional $20 a month for groceries, compared with the start of the year. <br><br>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, president of the Consumers Association of Singapore, said that price increases were inevitable, with the climate playing a major role in food shortages. But he said things were not as bad as they seemed. <br><br>Consumers, he said, had the option of buying house brands from supermarkets, and these were generally cheaper. Supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice said its house brand products are, on average, priced 10 per cent to 15 per cent lower than comparable national brands. <br><br>Checks revealed that bread and butter prices for FairPrice's house brands have remained steady over the past 11 months, but there have been 15 cent to 25 cent increases for coffee and cooking oil. <br><br>Besides food, prices of tyres and batteries are also going up. The past 11 months have also seen increases in the goods and services tax, public transport fares, fuel prices and rents. <br><br>And now, more hawkers are giving notice that they may not hold out on price increases much longer as they are also feeling the pinch. <br><br>The owner of a handmade noodles stall at the Gourmet Paradise foodcourt in the Toa Payoh HDB Hub said she is hoping to charge 20 cents to 30 cents more for every bowl of noodles from next year to cover costs. <br><br>She said that rental on her stall, which is now $4,500 a month, is set to rise to $5,500 at the start of next year, and then to $6,500 in 2009. <br><br>In the meantime, Ms Huang said she was doing her best to be cautious with her spending: 'If a meal at a coffee shop is $3 or more, I will look for something cheaper. I eat to fill my stomach, so it does not matter whether the food is nice or whether I am given more</td>

              <td class="quote">INFLATION may hit a record- breaking 4 per cent in the first half of next year as a red-hot economy adds more strain on the already-tight labour and property markets. <br><br>The warning from Citigroup economist Chua Hak Bin also came with a call for the Government to allow the Singdollar to appreciate faster while possibly deferring less urgent major investment projects like the Marina Bay botanic gardens. <br><br>'We maintain that overheating and inflation risks remain high,' said Dr Chua in a research report out yesterday. <br><br>'The economy is now at full employment, and the cost of hiring foreign workers has now increased considerably given higher accommodation cost.' <br><br>Despite greater uncertainty about the global economy, he said Singapore is likely to beat next year's official growth forecast of 4 per cent to 6 per cent, as it has done so in previous years. <br><br>His assessment found backing among other economists while others felt a slowing world economy will keep prices in Singapore in check. <br><br>HSBC economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde agreed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) may allow a faster strengthening of the Singdollar to curb inflation from imported goods at the next monetary policy review in April. <br><br>The tightening carried out last month is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on inflation, said Mr Prior-Wandesforde. <br><br>But Action Economics economist David Cohen brushed off overheating concerns, predicting that inflation in the first half of next year should come in at just over 3 per cent. <br><br>'The bigger concern is a potential slowing in the world economy, so it's a balanced outlook right now,' he said. <br><br>Dr Chua's report comes a month after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said while there are shortages in office space, the economy, as a whole, is not overheating and inflation is well under control. <br><br>The MAS has attributed the rise in inflation largely to a July hike in the goods and services tax rate. It is expecting prices to increase by 3.5 per cent on average in the first half of next year, before moderating in the rest of the year. <br><br>'We are probably less sanguine,' said Dr Chua. <br><br>He said global energy and food prices are rising sharply, driven by record oil prices and adverse weather conditions in farming areas. But bigger challenges lie in the domestic property and labour markets. <br><br>Dr Chua said the consumer price index (CPI) is lagging behind the steep increases in property prices and rents. <br><br>Housing CPI costs rose 0.4 per cent in September. But official indexes show that residential rents surged 11.4 per cent in the third quarter, while those for commercial space jumped 14.8 per cent. <br><br>The labour market is also at its tightest in a decade, with unemployment at 1.7 per cent. <br><br>Unlike previous years when the Government could simply let more foreigners in to work, skyrocketing rents mean their wages have to be hiked to cover their housing costs. <br><br>Labour costs are thus likely to continue rising after surging 8.5 per cent in the second quarter, said Dr Chua.</td>

Along with the rise in home prices, the taxman is revising the value of most properties upwards. <br><br>However, rebates given to offset the impact of the goods and services tax (GST) hike this year will soften the move's impact. <br><br>The annual values of all types of Housing Board (HDB) flats will be raised from Jan 1, said the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) in a statement yesterday. This means property taxes, which amount to 4 per cent of the annual values of owner-occupied homes, will rise. <br><br>Asked about private homes, Iras said: 'The annual values of most private residential properties have already been reassessed to reflect the current market rental levels during the year. The average increase for these private residential properties is about 20 per cent.' <br><br>Annual values of private residential properties in the central core area have generally increased between 20 per cent and 50 per cent this year. <br><br>The annual values will increase by an average of 18 per cent for HDB four-room and executive flats and 20 per cent for one-, two- and five-room flats. Three-room flats will face the greatest increase of 25 per cent. <br><br>Most HDB flat owners, however, will not pay higher taxes even after the revision, because of property tax rebates granted earlier this year to offset the impact of the GST hike. <br><br>Currently, owners of all one- and two-room flats, as well as 13 per cent of owners of three-room flats, do not pay property taxes because of earlier GST rebates. <br><br>The 2007 GST offset package gives all owners who are living in their property an extra $100 rebate annually for next year and 2009. <br><br>This means 90 per cent of all owners of HDB flats will not pay more property tax next year. In fact, 60 per cent of three-room flat owners will pay zero property tax, while 40 per cent will pay less tax than now. <br><br>About 15 per cent of owners of four- and five-room and executive flats face a hike in tax payable, but not more than $40. <br><br>The last time the annual values of HDB flats were raised was in 2004, and that doubled the number of home owners paying property tax. The increase brought in an extra $40 million a year for the Government.</span></span></strong></p>
