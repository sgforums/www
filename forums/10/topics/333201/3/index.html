              <p>if their CPF funds are lent to Singapore banks in this current crisis.</p>
              <p>Of course,the truths is SG gavaman issued note to CPF Board</p>

              <p>and 4% to medi and other retirement accounts.</p>
              <p>u can read that SG internal debt(in SG $$) is over 100% of GDP!!</p>
              <p>SG gavaman purposely creats this huge debt</p>
              <p>to give interst to CPF holders.</p>
              <p>During the bad years,SG gavaman  can get loans from banks</p>
              <p>as low as 0.5 %.So,the 2.5% interest paid to CPF is at a Loss!!</p>

              <div class="article-content">
              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 10 - Singapore has slipped into recession and the Government has revised its 2008 growth forecast to around 3 per cent from a previous estimate of 4 to 5 per cent.</p>
              <p>The economy shrank at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 6.3 per cent in the third quarter, according to third quarter advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on Friday morning, pushing the export-dependent economy into its first recession since 2002.</p>
              <p>The government also revised down its 2008 growth forecast to around 3 per cent from a previous estimate of 4 to 5 per cent.</p>
              <p>Economists had expected the Republic to narrowly escape a recession in the third quarter by growing 1.1 per cent, lifted by a slight improvement in electronics output.</p>
              <p>A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contractions.</p>
              <p>The deepening financial crisis, which sparked banking crises in the United States, Iceland, Britain, Germany and Ireland, is threatening to drag the world economy into recession.</p>
              <p>The advance estimate, based largely on July and August data, gives an early indication of the economy's performance during the July-September period.</p>
              <p>MTI said the Singapore economy is estimated to contract by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, than a year ago.</p>
              <p>On a seasonally adjusted, annualised quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP declined by 6.3 per cent, following a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>On the outlook for the year, MTI said since the revised GDP forecast in August, "external economic conditions have deteriorated more than expected and some sectors of the economy have weakened significantly on account of industry-specific or domestic factors.</p>
              <p>"The worsening of the financial crisis in the US in recent weeks has deepened the credit crunch, making it more difficult for businesses to sustain economic activities. With unemployment on the rise and house prices continuing to fall, US consumer sentiment has weakened further and will affect demand for exports from Asia and the rest of the world."</p>
              <p>It added that Singapore's export-oriented sectors, such as manufacturing, will be affected, noting that Europe is also facing severe strains in the banking sector, tighter credit conditions, and adjustments in housing prices.</p>
              <p>Growth in major economies such as Germany, France, Italy and the UK has dipped sharply in the second quarter.</p>
              <p>Growth forecasts for several Asian economies, such as China, India and South Korea, have been revised downwards since the start of the year.</p>
              <p>The estimates showed that Singapore's manufacturing sector continued to be weighed down by the negative growth in biomedical sciences, as pharmaceutical companies are still producing a mix of pharmaceutical ingredients with values lower than compared to a year ago.</p>
              <p>The precision engineering and chemicals clusters have also slowed, because of weaker external demand.</p>
              <p>The construction sector grew by 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, compared to the 18.3 per cent growth in the first half of 2008. Despite a strong pipeline of construction projects, a shortage of contractors, a tight labour market for engineers and project managers, and longer waiting times for equipment, have delayed the realisation of these projects.</p>
              <p>MTI said the financial services sector is likely to see slower growth in the coming months as the ongoing global financial crisis has heightened uncertainties for sentiment-sensitive segments such as stocks trading and fund management activities.</p>
              <p>"Taking into account the slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors, MTI has revised the 2008 GDP growth forecast to around 3 per cent. The inflation forecast of 6 - 7 per cent for 2008 remains unchanged," it said. - The Straits Times</p>

              <div>SINGAPORE'S economy has slid into its first technical recession since 2002, as a slump in exports pushed quarterly growth into negative territory for the second quarter in a row.</div>
              <div>The economy shrank by a worse-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, according to estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) released on Friday morning.</div>
              <p>MTI has also revised its full-year growth forecast for the second time this year, lowering it to 'around 3 per cent' from 4 to 5 per cent previously. This would make it the weakest pace in seven years.</p>
              <p>Recognising growth concerns, the Monetary Authority of Singapore also changed its policy stance to zero appreciation of the Singapore dollar, reversing the gradual appreciation policy it has adopted since 2003.</p>
              <p>On a quarterly basis, third-quarter GDP contracted 6.3 per cent from the second quarter, on top of a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous three months. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of decline.</p>
              <p>Manufacturing led the slowdown again this time around, weighed down by a poor performance in the biomedical sciences segment. It was also hit by weakened global demand for exports as the United States-triggered financial crisis spreads around the world.</p>
              <p>The sector shrank by 11.5 per cent in the third quarter, after declining 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>Growth in construction and services also slowed. Construction, in particular, saw its pace of expansion halved to single-digit growth, as projects were delayed by the construction squeeze, said MTI.</p>
              <p>Services, touted as a key driver of growth this year, is likely to take a hit as well as financial services falters in the wake of the global credit crunch.</p>
              <p>Most economists expect the economy to grow even more slowly next year, with the chance of a technical recession turning into a 'real' one.</p>
              <p>'With external conditions deteriorating and the lack of domestic demand support, we expect Singapore to register no growth next year... with a muted recovery, if at all, expected only in the second half of next year at the earliest,' said Morgan Stanley economists in a report.</p>
              <p><strong>Inflation peaks</strong><br>Inflation, which reached a 26-year high earlier this year, has peaked, said MAS. Consumer prices will rise between 6 per cent and 7 per cent this year, and gains will ease to between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 2009, it predicted.</p>
              <p>'Against the backdrop of a weakening external economic environment and continuing stresses in global financial markets, the growth of the Singapore economy is expected to remain below potential in the period ahead,' said MAS.</p>
              <p>'Inflation is expected to trend down in 2009 as the global and domestic economies slow.'(Straits Times Singapore)</p>

              </div>
              <p>The recession-hit economy of Singapore has shrunk by a record 5.6% during July to September.</p>
              <p>The sharp contraction was expected by analysts, and the government is now forecasting that the economy will contract by 3% for the full year.</p>
              <p>"In the light of the uncertainty in the global economy, Singapore has now revised its full year growth forecast to minus 3.0%," said Trade Minister George Yeo.</p>
              <p>Previously the government had forecast 0.5-1.5% growth.</p>
              <p><strong>US ties</strong></p>
              <p>The country is suffering from its exposure to the US - its biggest trading partner - which is battling with its own economic problems.</p>
              <p>Last month's terrorist attacks on the US have also exacerbated problems by denting consumer confidence.</p>
              <p>"The appalling attacks on September 11 and the resulting train of events have probably tipped the global economy into a recession," said Mr Yeo.</p>
              <p><strong>Electronics downturn</strong></p>
              <p>The sharp contraction in the third quarter was blamed on the downturn in the electronics sector.</p>
              <p>The goods producing sector in the trade-driven country fell by 15% while manufacturing output fell by 21% compared with a year ago.</p>
              <p>This constitutes the sharpest fall since the 1985 recession.</p>
              <p>"From the data so far, it certainly describes the economy is in a far worse shape than it has ever been," said Song Seng Wun, a regional economist at GK Goh brokerage.</p>
              <p>However, Aberdeen Asset Management's Hugh Young told the BBC's World Business Report:"The feeling on the streets is not nearly as bad or as gloomy as it was when the Asian crisis hit. Certainly there is a lot of fear over job security right through Singapore at the moment."</p>

              <p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry also revised downwards full-year growth forecast to around 3pc, citing a slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors.</p>
              <p>Southeast Asia's wealthiest economy saw gross domestic product fall by 6.3pc during the third quarter having previously contracted by 5.7pc.</p>
              <p>While the ministry did not describe the economy as being in recession, a technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in economic output.</p>
              <p>In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore - its de facto central bank - said it was also easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 7.7pc last year but have been signs of a slowdown following contractions in Singapore's key manufacturing sector, which includes the country's electronic and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
              <p>Construction growth slowed to 7.8pc from 19.8pc, during the quarter, although service industries grew by 6.1pc, marginally down from 7pc in the second quarter.</p>
              <p>Singapore's last technical recession was recorded in 2002, when the economy contracted by 2.4pc during the year. The country is seen as an important indicator of economic trends in the rest of Asia due to its export-dependent economy.</p>
              <p>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Asian economies face a "rough ride" for at least the next year as weakening consumer demand from developed countries hurt the region's exports.</p>

              <p>................The Singapore dollar, already battered in recent weeks, is expected to weaken further against its United States counterpart. Goldman Sachs predicts the Singapore dollar would weaken to $1.54 to the greenback in the next six months, while UBS expects it to reach $1.50 by the end of the year, according to Bloomberg. The Singapore dollar was trading at around $1.48 yesterday evening, almost 10 per cent off its recent high of $1.35 on July 16. .............</p>

              <p><br> <span>AFP, SINGAPORE</span><br> Saturday, Oct 11, 2008, Page 1</p>
              <p>Singapore has become the first Asian economy to fall into
                  recession, analysts said yesterday, after the government revised
                  downward its full-year growth estimate and eased monetary policy
                  for the first time in years.<br> <br> The Ministry of Trade and Industry lowered the city-state’s
                  full-year growth forecast to around 3 percent, citing a slowdown in
                  the global economy and key domestic sectors.<br> <br> The move came as the ministry released preliminary data showing
                  that real GDP declined by 6.3 percent in the third quarter after
                  contracting 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, the ministry
                  said.<br> <br> While it did not describe the economy as being in recession, a
                  technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive
                  quarters of contraction in economic output.<br> <br> “Singapore will be the first Asia economy to fall into a technical
                  recession,” DBS Group Research said in an assessment of the
                  data.<br> <br> In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of
                  Singapore (MAS) — its de facto central bank — said it was easing
                  monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.<br> <br> “The Singapore economy has weakened over the course of 2008,
                  alongside an escalation in the turmoil in financial markets and a
                  more severe deceleration in global economic activity,” MAS
                  said.<br> <br> These developments meant new uncertainties for the Singapore
                  economy, while slower Asian growth would restrain activity in a
                  range of service industries such as transportation and tourism, it
                  said.<br> <br> “The risks to external demand conditions continue to be on the
                  downside and a more severe global downturn cannot be discounted,”
                  the bank said.<br> <br> Singapore is Southeast Asia’s wealthiest economy in terms of GDP
                  per capita, but is heavily dependent on trade. This makes it
                  sensitive to hiccups in developed economies, particularly key
                  export markets the US and Europe.<br> <br> Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.3 percent
                  quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP, the value of goods and services
                  produced in the economy.<br> <br> Compared with the third quarter of last year, the ministry said
                  Singapore’s economy contracted by 0.5 percent in real terms,
                  against the 0.8 percent expansion foreseen in the Dow Jones
                  poll.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE manufacturers are cautious about the business prospects in the next six months, a Government survey released on Thursday showed, reflecting concerns over a slowing global economy.</p>
              <p>In the latest quarterly survey conducted by the Economic Development Board (EDB) among manufacturers, 87 per cent said the outlook for the next six months will not improve from the previous quarter when manufacturing output contracted 5.6 per cent.</p>
              <p>A separate survey by the Department of Statistics showed companies in the services sector sharing the same cautious sentiment over the six-month period.</p>
              <p>According to the survey, 24 per cent of the services firms polled expected business conditions to improve, while 22 per cent were less optimistic.</p>
              <p>The responses are weighted by operating receipts and value added.</p>
              <p>Chemical makers had the gloomiest outlook, with a net weighted 23 per cent of firms expecting business conditions to worsen on the back of high material costs.</p>
              <p>Producers in the general manufacturing industries, which include the food, tobacco and printing sectors, were the most optimistic, with a net weighted 11 per cent expecting business to improve.</p>
              <p>Singapore's economy shrank 6.6 per cent in the second quarter after seasonal adjustments, its biggest contraction in five years amid a slowdown in key export markets the United States and the European Union.</p>
              <p>The less positive business outlook comes against a backdrop of rising unemployment in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The jobless rate in the second quarter went up to 2.3 per cent after seasonal adjustments, compared to the previous quarter's 2 per cent, according to latest estimates released by the Ministry of Manpower on Thursday morning.</p>
              <p>The data showed that employment grew by 70,600 in the second quarter this year, which is slightly lower than the increase of 73,200 in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>In his National Day message for Singaporean workers, NTUC chief Lim Swee Say on Thursday urged workers to moderate their wage expecations for this year, warning that pushing wages up to fully offset inflation is a risky move, as they will end up paying ever higher prices.</p>
              <p>'Instead of pushing wages up to fully offset inflation, we must continue to link built-in wage increase to productivity gain and help our people through various non-wage measures', he said.</p>
              <p>This will prevent a 'price-wage spiral', he said.</p>

              <p>Tourism makes up nearly to 10 per cent of Singapore total GDP and the local tourism industry will take a ‘battering’ as analyst predicts Singapore tourism to slow despite our upcoming inaugural F1 first ever night race</p>
              <p>The global credit crisis and slowing economy also didn’t help in the slowdown in Singapore tourism. Some 100,000 visitors are expected for the F1 weekend and some 40,000 of those are from overseas</p>
              <p>F1 Singapore Grand Prix is part of our nation plan to make it a more global and a unique place. Not only we’re attracting international act of F1 which will earn around S$100 million ($70 million) a year in tourism revenue, there’s also our integrated casino which will open end of next year</p>

              <p>Wow, you are going to deny the many media articles that state
              Singapore is the first in Asia to go into recession?</p>
              <p>Why is SG even in recession in the first place?</p>
              <p>And first in the region as well?</p>
              <p>NZ is not considered as asia when it comes to economic analysis,
              now you not only failed english, but geography as well...</p>
              <p>What's next, you're gonna claim the south pole as part of asia
              as well?</p>
              <p>East Asia, Singapore is first in recession</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
