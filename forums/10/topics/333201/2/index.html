              <p>Don't really have to know why it dropped. If you know the Aus currency's fluctuation trend over the years, you can make a bundle.</p>
              <p>You may have to buy and hold for a few years.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>in my simpler terms, currency are affected by various factors.</p>
              <p>1. interest rate.-- central bank in australia has been cutting interest rate</p>
              <p>2. fall in commodity price. it was a impact on the AUD currency.</p>
              <p>3. risk aversion.-- ppl fund manager tend to move their currency to safer currency such as USD and Japanese yen. are you surprise why USD? coz some ppl fund manager would rather buy eg. US treasury bonds, bills even though the yield are zero. the mentality is.. it is better not to gain than to lose.</p>
              <p>the third pt could be wat TS trying to say ah, i think.</p>

              <p> Simple English and Econs for the uninitiated:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ON Wednesday evening (8 Oct 2008), the Australian dollar fell below par against the Singapore dollar.</p>
              <p>It fell to a six-year low of 96.17 cents.</p>
              <p>Late last year, the exchange rate for an Australian dollar was about $1.36.</p>

              <p>for the Ah bengs :</p>
              <p>Last year, one Aussie dollar can exchange for you $1.30+ Singapore dollars</p>
              <p>Today, One Aussie dollar can buy 96 Singapore cents....meaning you lose 40cents for every one Aussie Dollar.....compared with last year.... you catch now or not har?</p>

              <blockquote>.....................................<br></blockquote><blockquote><strong>CDS and Aussie banks</strong><br> <br> A Citibank report from mid-July shows ANZ at the top of the CDS
                      pile in Australia. It had $45.7 billion worth of CDS in its conduits.<br> <br> While all the banks used CDS to hedge their credit risk, ANZ actively traded them.<br> <br> In other words, as with its primacy in stock lending (of Opes Prime fame), it took the greater risks.<br> <br> As of March, the bank had some $23.4 billion in ``long'' CDS positions and $22.3 billion in ``short'' CDS positions.<br> <br> ``ANZ entered short CDS positions with counterparties who desired
                      credit protection whilst simultaneously purchasing offsetting
                      protection for a cheaper premium from different counterparties (we
                      understand these counterparties were "monoline" insurers on around half
                      of all occasions). The spread differential between the short premium
                      and long premium generated trading income,'' says the Citibank report.<br> <br> When one such monoline insurer, ACA, was downgraded from
                      investment grade to CCC in February 2008, ANZ was forced to recognise a
                      provision of $226 million based upon a $1.5 billion notional contract
                      value.<br> <br> ``In effect, they were saying that the long leg of the trade was
                      not suitable in terms of providing insurance - as the rating of the
                      insurer was sub-investment grade the hedge was no longer viable.''<br> <br> As with other financial stocks now underperforming their peers,
                      ANZ partied hard in the good times by indulging too much in high-yield
                      securities. Now it is clear they were not high-yield for nothing.<br> <br> Its rivals carry risk but not to the same degree.<br> <br> CBA has $5.9 billion ($3 billion bought and $2.9 billion sold),
                      Westpac has $15.6 billion ( $9.4 billion and $6.2 billion) and NAB,
                      which Citigroup rates second to ANZ on risk has $24.4 billion in CDS
                      ($13.7 billion and $10.7 billion).<br> <br> This, of course, is all before we get to CDOs, CLOs, ABS and so on.<br> <br>  There will be nasties to come, and before the banks come clean
                      and tell us who their counterparties are, the mystery will continue to
                      erode confidence.<br> <br> That said, the Federal Government's guarantee on deposits will
                      circumvent the ultimate disaster scenario of a retail run on the banks
                      and, in that, it is to be applauded.<br> <br> Times are tough, but some look for levity, as one joke doing the rounds goes:<br> <br> "This is way worse than a divorce ...I've lost half my net worth and I still have my wife."<br> <br> mwest@fairfax.com<br> <br> <strong>BusinessDay</strong></blockquote>

              <p class="byline">By (AP)<br>Published: 2008-10-12 12:00:03 <br>Location: PARIS</p>
              <p>A draft declaration by leaders of countries that use the euro currency says their governments would temporarily guarantee future bank debt to encourage lending and ease credit markets.</p>
              <p>The declaration says the governments would guarantee "for an interim period and on appropriate commercial terms" new debts caused by bank lending during the next five years.</p>
              <p>The statement says "this scheme would be limited in amount, temporary and will be applied under close scrutiny of financial authorities until Dec. 31, 2009."</p>
              <p>The leaders of the 15 euro-zone countries were meeting in Paris on Sunday in an emergency summit to find European solutions to the global financial crisis.</p>
              <p>THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.</p>
              <p>PARIS (AP) _ President Nicolas Sarkozy said he expects a meeting of 15 European leaders Sunday to produce an ambitious, coordinated plan to battle the effects of the global financial crisis.</p>
              <p>Decisions taken by the heads of countries where the euro currency is used will be submitted to the 12 remaining European Union countries at an EU summit Wednesday, the French president said.</p>
              <p>They also will be translated by individual countries into concrete measures, leaders said.</p>
              <p>"I expect an ambitious, coordinated plan that brings solutions," Sarkozy said ahead of the summit.</p>
              <p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hopes leaders can provide a "very important signal for the markets."</p>
              <p>"Our goal is to define a coordinated joint action for the eurozone, so that we can in the coming days take national measures that stabilize the financial markets, but that also don't discredit the individual member states," she said.</p>
              <p>Before the summit, Sarkozy greeted each of the other European leaders on the steps of the Elysee Palace. He met with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose partial bank nationalizations provide a potential model for decisions by the euro-zone countries. Britain does not use the euro.</p>
              <p>Some European officials said one proposal on the table was sure to be government guarantees of interbank loans in order to unfreeze credit markets locked up by fear and uncertainty among lending institutions.</p>
              <p>Such broad guarantees would follow the lead of Britain.</p>
              <p>Brown, writing in the Daily Mirror on Sunday, stressed the need for drastic action because of the essential role played by banks; "getting a mortgage, paying the bills and saving for old age."</p>
              <p>However, a comprehensive approach is needed, he wrote. "For Europe, the stakes could not be higher and this is a moment of truth."</p>
              <p>Sunday's meetings come after an exceptionally bad week on European markets, as stock indexes dived across the continent despite individual government steps.</p>
              <p>Last weekend, the leaders of Europe's four biggest economies met but failed to agree on any specific plan. And on Saturday, finance ministers of the Group of Seven met but did not commit to anything firm.</p>
              <p>The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, said he was hopeful leaders would "take an important step forward today by agreeing to a clear response for the euro area to the current crisis." Barroso was present for the meeting with Brown.</p>
              <p>An "unprecedented level of coordination" is needed to make clear to both Europeans and the markets of the ability to act with a single voice, he said.</p>
              <p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, stressing the need for a "coherent, efficient and synchronized" response, said Saturday that a "common toolbox" could be the outcome of the summit.</p>
              <p>Individual countries "could use these tools to respond to (their) particular situation," she said after a meeting outside Paris with Sarkozy.</p>
              <p>"We need a common approach in Europe, but we must be able to adapt to each national situation in a flexible way," she said.</p>
              <p>Merkel and Sarkozy stressed at a news conference Saturday that coordination is vital to taming the crisis and putting an end to the go-it-alone approach that has predominated thus far in Europe.</p>
              <p>Sarkozy said ahead of the summit that he would "announce a certain number of measures" Monday for France.</p>
              <p>The summit follows a weekend meeting in Washington of finance ministers from the Group of Seven _ Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and the United States.</p>
              <p>Ireland's unilateral move to guarantee all bank deposits caught other EU nations off balance, and led to fears of a flight of capital to the Emerald Isle.</p>
              <p>Britain then announced a 50 billion-pound (US$88 billion) plan to partly nationalize major banks and promised to guarantee a further 250 billion pounds ($438 billion) of loans to shore up the banking sector. The Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis got a bailout, and so did lender Dexia SA, helped by France, Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>
