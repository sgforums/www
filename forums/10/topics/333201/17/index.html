              <p>Friday, 19 January 2007, 12:28 am | 367 views</p>
              </div>
              <p><em>This article is taken from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/1110/nat.singapore.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Asiaweek</span></a> (For Richer Or Poorer), to allow our readers to revisit the issues of welfare, the aged, foreign workers, and wages in Singapore.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>It is quite troubling to note that this article was first published in Nov, 2000. The problems faced by those who are struggling are largely the same today - 6 years on.</em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/hk.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="238"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The article is by Roger Mitton</span></span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Lee Chong Peng is the symbol of Singapore’s broken dream. She lives alone in a one-room flat on about $3 a day. “I watch television and take short walks,” she says. “My legs ache now, so I cannot go so far.” But without fail, every Wednesday afternoon, Lee takes the lift down eight floors to the ground level of her public housing block.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">There she joins dozens of other poor folk from her district in Chinatown to sit, waiting, on concrete benches. Lee, 84, chats with friends, while others remain sullen, lacking even the warmth of comradeship. At 5 p.m. they all form into a line and shuffle forward to receive a plastic bag containing six eggs, 1.5 kg of rice, a can of baked beans, a can of sweet corn, one packet of hot chocolate, one packet of coffee, some cereal and a single toilet roll. Without this weekly donation from a charitable group, Lee and her neighbors find it tough to survive.</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">What happened to Singapore, the land of plenty?</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In its rush to forge a manufacturing, then a high-tech economy, the city-state rarely bothered to look back at those who were lagging. Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew developed a system based on hard work and government support for industry. Singaporeans were expected to earn their rewards. The results were astounding: a middle class emerged to build Asia’s second-richest country.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But with the advent of globalization and an influx of cheap foreign workers, Singapore’s economy is becoming increasingly ruthless. According to its own statistics, the nation’s rich are getting richer and the poor are falling further behind. To most Singaporeans, the mere existence of poor folk in need of care packages comes as a shock. And this realization has prompted an uncharacteristic bout of soul-searching. The rich-poor disparity strikes right at the heart of Singapore’s development model — and challenges the city’s smug self- image. Many younger Singaporeans raised in middle-class comfort are beginning to think that Lee’s ideal is outdated; they argue that the government has a responsibility to care more for the downtrodden.</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Lowest 10% of society had an average monthly income of only $75.81</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The issue burst into Singapore’s consciousness in May, when the media reported a Department of Statistics disclosure that the lowest 10% of society had an average monthly income of only $75.81. Officials said the figure (which included unemployed and retired people) had been misused to present a distorted view. Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo presented a raft of numbers in parliament to show that Singapore’s poor really were not so poor after all. “The standard of living among the lower income has gone up,” said Yeo. Nearly all had televisions and telephones, on average they had about $11,500 in the state retirement fund (CPF), and all but a quarter lived in 3-room or larger flats. “In other words, many in the bottom 10% have significant wealth in the form of CPF savings and their homes,” added Yeo. “They are not an underclass.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The hot potato might have cooled there, except that in a classic piece of mistiming the government then announced substantive pay hikes for the civil service. On average, salaries jumped 13%. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong’s wage soared to a cool $1.1 million — almost $3,000 a day. Goh says the new wage bill will cost each Singaporean about $6 a year — the equivalent of five plates of char kway teow, a popular noodle dish. But opposition legislator Chiam See Tong noted: “I think U.S. President Bill Clinton receives only about S$600,000 [about $343,000] a year. Surely that should also be enough for a minister in Singapore?”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Goh claims qualified Singaporeans are not interested in such a “poor” salary. “Several high-fliers pleaded young family or lack of interest for not coming into politics,” he says. “They never say it is because they can earn more outside, but I can tell clearly that pay is a consideration.” The ill-timed raise further exacerbated the festering subject of income divergence. Admits legislator Charles Chong: “The ratio between the top and bottom has been increasing.”</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">“They won’t starve or go homeless or be refused medical care”</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">As a result of prosperity and shifting values, attitudes toward the poor are slowly beginning to change. Singapore already is doing something to reduce the adverse effects of the income gap. For starters, the city’s poor don’t have it too badly. Says Chong, from the ruling People’s Action Party: “We look after our disadvantaged people. They won’t starve or go homeless or be refused medical care.” Adds National University of Singapore academic Mukul Asher: “By spreading the consumption of basic amenities like housing, schooling, healthcare and transport in a more equal way than other societies, the government mitigates some of the effects of large and growing income inequalities.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But helping the poor directly would go against the grain of the ruling party’s old guard. Notes veteran oppositionist J. B. Jeyaretnam: “It is Lee Kuan Yew’s dogma that nothing is free in this world. There is no free lunch, no handouts, no subsidies.” Jeyaretnam has called on the government to lessen the inequalities by providing free medical treatment, free education and old-age pensions to those in need. Younger members of the ruling party are beginning to realize that poverty is a growing problem — one that the government will have to address to stay in power. “It’s true, there is a kind of paranoia among older leaders about Singapore degenerating into a welfare state,” says legislator Chong. “But nowadays, the younger leaders are saying that if we want to be considered as a humane, civilized society we have to help these poor people more.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">How did Singapore leave its poor behind?</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In part, cheap foreign labor shoved unskilled Singaporeans aside. To achieve high growth rates, the government has increasingly allowed larger numbers of foreign workers to make up the labor shortfall caused to some extent by low birthrates. Explains academic Asher: “Singapore does not believe in redistribution of wealth. Instead, it always wants high rates of growth to reduce poverty levels.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Electrical fitter Bazlur Rahman, a Bangladeshi working in Singapore, puts up with his small salary — something few Singaporeans would be willing to do. He earns $11 a day and saves more than $170 a month, which he sends home. Bazlur lives with 3,200 other foreign workers in a cramped, tight-security compound at Kaki Bukit. Says Asher: “Singapore has been able to use these foreign workers and their low wages and conditions to maintain its competitiveness and high growth rates.”</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Reduce wages or be priced out of the market</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">To compete with Bazlur and thousands like him, Singapore workers must reduce their wage demands or be priced out of the market. Yet to keep top-end managers and professionals at home, the government and its private sector must make matching offers. Says Asher: “All round you have got a larger wage inequality; wealth is more concentrated.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Admits Prime Minister Goh: “Yes, the income gap in Singapore is widening because of globalization and the knowledge revolution, which have enhanced the value of talent dramatically and pressed down the wages of the unskilled.” Can the government do anything? It has already ruled out the idea of holding down wages at the top or artificially raising wages at the bottom.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">It is already running capable retraining programs. Says Goh: “We must not envy those who have made it rich. Rather, we must provide the opportunities for more to be like them. It means operating on the basis of meritocracy — that you can get ahead in life if you work hard, regardless of your background.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">What else can be done? As a result of growing concern about the poor, the government has set up nine community development councils, which are jointly funded and operated by local officials and charities. Community leaders draw up policies and every dollar donated to the councils is matched three-to-one by the government. This initiative has moderated attitudes. “We don’t want the government to take over the voluntary welfare organizations, but we’ll enhance their work,” says Chong. “If in this way we are seen to be helping the less well-off, there will be fewer social problems.”</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Money politics</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But where there is money, there is politics. Opposition legislators such as Chiam claim that the ruling party uses this aid for political gain — in effect, to buy votes. “The chairman of a community development council will go around like Santa Claus giving money away to the poor and unemployed,” says Chiam. “It’s the politicians who go out to give this money and of course they’ve got to get their votes. That’s the way they dish out welfare: very selectively.” The council chairman in Chiam’s constituency, the ruling party’s Andy Gan, denies that aid is used to garner votes. “Our office is open to all residents and I do not ask for their votes before seeing to their needs,” Gan says.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The circumstances of Teng Ah Mui suggest that this community-based assistance is inadequate anyway. Teng, 54, lives alone and recently began receiving charity food packages each week in order to survive. She has held various unskilled jobs, but since falling and injuring her leg six months ago she now relies on public assistance. After paying her rent and utilities bills, she is left with about $80 a month. “It’s not enough, so I have to depend on food donations and help from friends,” she says. A decade ago, it might have been easier for Teng to rejoin the workforce. These days, there is too much competition for menial work and too few opportunities.<br></span><strong><br></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Public assistance of about $115 per month.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The bottom line is that the government’s willingness to help the poor is still minimal. In Singapore, children are required by law to look after their elderly parents. But often they cannot do this, especially if they are low-income, single children. Admits Minister of State without Portfolio Matthias Yao: “Parents know what their children can afford. They don’t bring cases to court when they know that their children are too poor to look after them.” If neither friends nor family can help, and if the person is unable to get work, then — and only then — will the government step in with the barest subsistence-level help. Last year 2,238 people qualified for this public assistance (usually about $115 per month). The number has increased each year for the past three.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">So what will happen when the number of aged people quadruples in the next 30 years? They already comprise the largest chunk of Singapore’s new poor (the other major components are retrenched workers, single mothers and the disabled). Even now, rich Singapore cannot look after its older folk without drawing on the services of charity groups. Says Asher bluntly: “The government will need to do more.” If it does not, income disparities could threaten the country’s cherished social harmony. They might even eat into the ruling party’s monolithic hold on power.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The government knows this is a serious matter — perhaps the most serious socio-economic threat Singapore has faced. Despite some bluster about meritocracy, retraining and limits on foreign workers, no one really knows a surefire way to solve the problem. Says Asher: “Policy-makers are still thinking in terms of economic output and growth; while the people are increasingly thinking more and more of their welfare.” But don’t count out the ruling party. It has been skillful at adapting to meet the needs of its citizens. Adds Asher: “One can expect that they will begin to change as this issue becomes more pressing. They will have to in order to maintain their legitimacy and their support.”</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Just don’t call it welfare</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">For now, the subject remains virtually taboo. But soon Singapore will be forced to find a remedy for its new, more disparate, reality. Just don’t call it welfare.</span></span></p>

"It is essential for us to tilt the balance in favor of lower-income Singaporeans, because globalization is going to strain our social compact," Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech last fall.<br><br>Singapore's People's Action Party, founded by Mr Lee's father Lee Kuan Yew -- who is still a senior government member with the title of Minister Mentor -- has controlled the island since independence in 1965, winning nearly every seat in parliamentary elections. The country's mixed population of Chinese, Malays and Indians has accepted decades of the PAP's often authoritarian rule in exchange for phenomenal economic growth that has transformed this former British trading outpost into one of the world's most prosperous states.<br><br>While providing subsidized housing and health care, Singapore's government has long resisted calls for European-style unemployment benefits for the poor, describing welfare as a "dirty word" and rejecting the idea of a minimum wage. Instead, the government has come up with the concept of "workfare" -- a large-scale program to top off the incomes of those Singaporeans who accept low-paid work. Details of the program will likely be given in the budget presentation.<br><br>"We can't stop the income gap from widening because the wages are determined by the global competition for knowledge workers, and by the excessive supply of unskilled workers," says Mr. Lim, the minister and union leader. "But what we're trying to do is to make sure that the widening income gap doesn't necessarily translate into a widening social gap."<br><br>Most developed economies fund such social programs by redistributing wealth through progressive taxation: the top-bracket federal income tax rate is 35% in the US, and at least 40% in most of Western Europe. But Singapore is ideologically opposed to this model: the island-state has been steadily slashing its top income-tax rate, from 55% at independence in 1965 to 28% in 2000, to 20% today. Making up for the shortfall in revenue, Singapore established a general sales tax, currently at 5%.<br><br>It is the sales tax that the government is planning to tap again to pay for the "workfare" initiative. According to Mr Lee, with the new budget the sales tax is likely to rise to 7% -- a measure that, economists calculate, will generate some S$1.5 billion of extra government revenue.<br><br>The plan is far from popular. In the two months since Mr Lee in November first mentioned a likely sales-tax rise, the proposal elicited unusually vocal criticism from Singapore's corporate world and opposition leaders alike. The influential Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry complained the sales-tax increase is "likely to have an immediate and detrimental effect on local spending," undermining Singapore's long-term competitiveness.<br><br>Sylvia Lim, leader of the Singapore Workers' Party and an opposition Parliament member, also pointed out that the poor -- the ostensible beneficiaries of the proposal -- would be hurt the most. "We need to strengthen our safety nets through some redistributive policies," she asserted, adding that consumption taxes, such as the sales tax, "are generally regressive and likely to compound the underclass problem."<br><br>While the government usually ignores the minuscule opposition in this tightly regulated country, the business community's pleas found a receptive audience. Aware that corporate taxes are even lower in rival business centers such as Hong Kong and Ireland, Singapore signaled it would sweeten the pill for businesses: To compensate for the higher sales tax, the corporate tax rate, currently 20%, would be shaved by at least one percentage point.<br><br>"This is a tough and competitive world," Minister Mentor Lee told Singaporean journalists as he explained the planned corporate-tax cut. "People don't come here because they like Singapore -- they come because the returns are better."</div>

              <p>Australia's economy is based on more sound foundation than Singapore's dependence on external factors - from foreign investments to foreign government actions that affect external factors that hit Singapore in one way or the other.</p>

              <p>The currency has lost 37 per cent of its value over a period of just three months and has hit record lows against the greenback and the Japanese yen amid fears of a global recession.</p>
              <p>Mr Turnbull says the slump in the dollar's fortunes does not reflect the underlying strength of the Australian economy.</p>
              <p>"We are in the midst of a global economic storm and we'll get wet, but we won't sink," he said. "There are a lot of pressures globally and a lot of volatility.</p>
              <p>"We stand ready to work cooperatively with the Government, to work with them in a truly bipartisan way to help the Government and the country get out of the mess they have created.</p>
              <p>"I think Australians want to see both sides of politics coming together on that."</p>
              <p>The Australian dollar was trading near Friday's closing price of 61.7 US cents this morning.</p>

              <p>While the Australian Politicians have a track record of crossing Parliamentary divide to face national crisis, the Singapore Ruling Political Party has remained aloof and cock-sure of their own super talented abilities to claim success for themselves during better times, but blame external factors for the bad times that are beyond their control.</p>
              <p>PM LHL has claimed that the Government cannot guarantee anything to be 100% safe - which Singaporeans should take as including his own actions.</p>
              <p>Is the noisy lion more prepared to claim otherwise for himself and Singapore ?</p>
              <p><br>The Australian Government has allowed free market to determine its currency, what has our Singapore Government been doing ?</p>

The Singapore Dollar exchange rate has been used as a primary tool to control inflation, and has consistently manipulated by the Government through its direct control over MAS.  </a></p>
              <p>While other countries fight inflation by being more dynamic in economic performance - to be more productive, Singapore has to manage inflation by manipulating on consumption and not on the production efforts.</p>

              <p class="intro"><strong>AUSTRALIA is likely to confront a balance of payments crisis next year as the commodities boom ends with a crash.</strong></p>
              <p>Around
                  the world, nations with <span style="color: #ff0000;">current account deficits are being punished by
                  markets. Australia will be swept into the contagion, </span>which is likely to
                  choke business funding and force up market interest rates.</p>
              <p>At present, the banks are having to roll over about $<span style="color: #ff0000;">75 billio</span>n in
                  short-term foreign debt every month and raise a net $<span style="color: #ff0000;">5 billion </span>in new
                  foreign funds.</p>
              <p>Weakening export revenue will increase the volume of fresh funds
                  that must be raised offshore every month, while growing difficulty in
                  rolling over medium-term debt will increase the bank's dependence on
                  short-term funds.</p>
              <p>John Laker, chairman of the banking regulator APRA, told the
                  Senate's economics estimates committee last week that institutions that
                  previously had access to deep and mature international markets with
                  funding across a full spectrum of maturities were now finding it "<span style="color: #ff0000;">had
                  collapsed into an overnight market, and the loss of trust in that
                  market was palpable". </span></p>
              <p>The long and proud boast of former treasurer Peter Costello that the
                  Australian government had no foreign debt will be eclipsed by a new
                  reality in which the Government is forced to take responsibility for
                  debts once thought to have been safely contracted by consenting
                  private-sector adults.</p>

                  when allowed to operate freely, it has always intervened directly
                  to “fix” an outcome that benefits itself. The Singapore Dollar
                  exchange rate has been used as a primary tool to control inflation,
                  and has consistently manipulated by the Government through its
                  direct control over MAS.  </a></p>
              <p>While other countries fight inflation by being more dynamic in
                  economic performance - to be more productive, Singapore has to
                  manage inflation by manipulating on consumption and not on the
                  production efforts.</p>
              Is there any comparison to others anywhere on this earth ?</blockquote>

              <p class="first">A construction industry analyst says jobs are expected
                  to go as unit projects are deferred and development applications
                  decline.</p>
              <p>Reed Construction Data says in the last four months there has been a
                  500 per cent increase in the number of unit projects being deferred,
                  and New South Wales and Queensland are the hardest hit.</p>
              <p>Chief executive Rob Wild says in south-east Queensland there has
                  been a 20 to 30 per cent drop in the number of development applications.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>In extremis, the public sector, with its long-time horizon and<br>large balance sheet, may be able to play a role in providing necessary liquidity to<br>key asset markets, and to limit the consequences of severe market disturbances<br>driving asset prices a long way from their fundamental value.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>p 39</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In extremis, there may also be grounds for the public authorities to purchase<br>outright a very limited range of assets. However, the risk-return trade-off from<br>such purchases is, in most cases, likely to be much less attractive than the actions<br>discussed above. This means that the ‘burden of proof’ that the public sector<br>needs to meet in justifying such intervention should be set very high. One variant<br>of this approach is for the public sector to assist with the off-market transfer of<br>assets of a troubled financial firm, including possibly, in extremis, taking assets<br>directly onto the public-sector balance sheet and disposing of those assets gradually<br>over time. One argument for doing this is that in some extreme situations it is<br>in the public interest for the assets owned by a troubled institution to be sold<br>in a measured way, rather than dumped onto markets when risk and illiquidity<br>premia are at their highest.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><strong></strong> Brazil's debt crisis is over and the country has emerged as a net foreign creditor for the first time, the Central Bank said.
              <p>The nation's foreign cash reserves in January exceeded the entire
              foreign debt of Brazil's government and individual companies combined
              by about US$4 billion (€2.7 billion), the bank said in a report
              released Thursday.</p>
              <p>"It's the first time in the history of Brazil that we are not debtors," said Finance Minister Guido Mantega.</p>
              <p>Brazil's new status as a creditor could improve its debt rating to
              investment grade, which would lower Brazil's borrowing costs for future
              loans, Mantega said.</p>
