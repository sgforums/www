Taxi fares are going up.<br><br>Taxi giant ComfortDelGro Corp has notified the Public Transport Council (PTC) about an imminent fare increase. The PTC could not say more.<br><br>Commuters can expect to pay more from as early as the week before Christmas, as taxi operators have to inform the council at least two weeks before any fare changes.<br><br>For its part, ComfortDelGro again declined to comment, as it has for several weeks since speculation about a hike first started.<br><br>Sources, however, said the adjustment will include a 30-cent rise in flag-down rate. This would bring the minimum starting fare to $2.80. For newer cabs which meet the stringent Euro IV emission standard, the flag-down will go from $2.70 to $3.<br><br>Currently, ComfortDelGro has about 2,000 of such cabs in its fleet.<br><br>Commuters can expect changes to the distance and time-based charges too. Surcharges are also expected to be streamlined.<br><br>There is speculation that the operator might help cabbies defray electronic road- pricing charges to encourage them to enter the Central Business District - where demand for cabs is high.<br><br>The signs of a fare hike had been there for some time as cabbies and their associations have been lobbying for it for several months now, arguing the increase in diesel price and the goods and services tax have eroded drivers' income substantially.<br><br>The plight of cabbies is not lost on commuters. Said merchandiser Ivy Ong, 41, who takes cabs regularly: 'Will this fare adjustment be helping the taxi-drivers? If their taxi rental goes up, I don't think it would.'<br><br>Citigroup Singapore strategist Lim Jit Soon does not think ComfortDelGro would raise rental this time round as it wants to retain as many drivers as possible 'in this buoyant market'.<br><br>'What it means is that it might gradually remove some subsidies,' he said.<br><br>For instance, ComfortDelGro is still selling diesel to cabbies at 94 cents a litre, 36 cents cheaper than diesel dispensed at stations run by oil companies.<br><br></span><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:christan@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0053a2; font-family: Calibri;">christan@sph.com.sg</span></span></a></span></strong></p>

Since the launch of NETS CashCard in 1996, NETS has issued</span><br><span>over 4.5 million cards at no cost to Singapore motorists; the cost was</span><br><span>borne by the local banks.

That is because oil prices will continue to be high, and the six months from April to September tend to see higher power use nationwide.<br><br>The wholesale price is what power companies pay for electricity, plus a small amount of regulation and administrative costs and adjustments. It affects how much consumers end up paying.<br><br>Yesterday, the Energy Market Co, which runs the wholesale electricity market here, said that this price - known as the Uniform Singapore Energy Price - jumped 17.7 per cent from March to hit $173 per megawatt hour (MWh) last month.<br><br>That is the highest monthly average since 2003, when wholesale market trading began, and well up on the last high of $168.34 per MWh in August 2006. Last year, the average price was $124.57 per MWh.<br><br>The result is a corresponding spike in electricity prices consumers pay, though it is not a direct correlation.<br><br>In response to rising wholesale prices, Singapore Power Services (SPS), which supplies electricity to about 1.2 million households, has been steadily increasing electricity tariffs.<br><br>The so-called Low Tension Tariff, which is what the man-in-the-street pays, was 18.88 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh) from April to June last year.<br><br>The rate jumped to 22.62 cents per kwh by the first quarter of this year. And a month ago, the rate - which is set by SPS every quarter - rose 5.7 per cent to 23.88 cents per kwh.<br><br>For people such retiree Loh T.E., this means higher electricity bills.<br><br>Mr Loh, who lives in a five-room flat without air-conditioning, said electricity costs now make up 12 per cent of his household expenses, compared with 8 per cent last year.<br><br>EMC chief executive David Carlson said yesterday that the main reason behind the higher bills is the rising price of crude oil, which hit close to US$124 (S$170) per barrel yesterday.<br><br>And fuel oil, which is priced in tandem with crude oil, forms the largest cost component for power generating companies.<br><br>'Fuel oil prices continued to rise coming into this year, so during the first quarter, fuel costs have had to be paid by (power) generators. That had an impact on what they can offer into the market,' said Mr Carlson.<br><br>'We expect to see higher demand (for power) in the second and third quarter.'<br><br>But he declined to predict if that would translate to higher electricity prices, saying that there were other factors at play.<br><br>First, demand is heavily influenced by economic growth. If the economy slows down, then prices should ease a little.<br><br>Second, Singapore's power market has been liberalised, and new power generation companies are free to enter the market and compete, bringing down prices.<br><br>Mr Carlson said greater competition has cushioned the impact of oil prices on electricity prices in the past three years and will continue doing so.<br><br></span><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:yanghw@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0053a2; font-family: Calibri;">yanghw@sph.com.sg</span></span></a></span></strong></p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">An Australian story - from fading uncle to economic success</span></h1>
              <p>I want to take you back to the early 1990s to the kind of nation we were then - insecure, uncertain about our economic prospects, battered by recession, suffering high unemployment and job insecurity, and scarred by the recent experience of 17 per cent mortgage interest rates.</p>
              <p>On a visit to Australia in 1994 the former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew reiterated a previous warning that Australia could become the “poor white trash of Asia”. This was partly a reflection on Australia’s economic state. It was also a reflection on the rise of the “Asian Tigers”.</p>
              <p>The dynamic growth of East Asia was in stark contrast to the economic malaise of Australia. When the government appealed for “enmeshment” in Asia it was making an economic appeal. The thinking was that if we could join a region that was successful we could overcome our own weakness.</p>

              <div>
              <p>The rise of the Asian Tigers through the ’80s and the comparative decline of Australia through the recession of the early ’90s sapped our confidence as a nation. And what is more, it sapped the respect for Australia among our neighbours and the wider international community.</p>
              <p>The Coalition Government was elected in March 1996. We laid down an economic program setting out medium-term targets on fiscal policy, monetary policy and debt management. By July 1997 we were on track to balance the budget for the first time in seven years. It was a close run.</p>
              <p>Beginning with mass capital outflow from Thailand in June-July 1997, financial contagion began spreading around the region. Those in Australia who had marvelled at the growth rates and saving rates of Asian Tigers saw these countries stagger and reel. They could only shudder to think what would happen to Australia - considered by many to have a weaker economy.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But Australia did not succumb to the Asian financial and economic collapse. In 1997-98 our growth rate was 4.5 per cent. We produced the first balanced budget in seven years. Paul Krugman writing in <em>Fortune Magazine</em> in December 1998 dubbed Australia “the miracle economy”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In March 1996 the APEC Finance Ministers met in Japan. It was the first APEC meeting I attended. We were given a polite welcome but we were not respected. Australia was tolerated much as a fading uncle is tolerated at Christmas dinner - there out of politeness and past association rather than present or future expectation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But we proved strong and resilient through the Asian economic crisis. We survived and we offered financial assistance to badly affected economies in the region.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In May 1999 APEC Finance Ministers met at Langkawi in Malaysia. We were not the fading relation at this meeting. Australia had won a great deal of respect. The region knew Australia was a success story and they wanted to learn from its experience. Now we had people talking of the “Australian model”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Since 1996 Australia has had continuous growth averaging 3.5 per cent per annum. During that period Singapore has had three recessions, Hong Kong has had three recessions, Korea has had one recession, Taiwan has had two recessions, Japan has had four recessions, and the United States went into a recession in 2001.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Over the last 10 years Australia has earned a great deal of respect amongst its neighbours and the other economies of the world. Australia’s achievements have given its people a lot more self respect. The nation feels more secure about itself. This is the Australian revival.</p>

              <p><span>Di Yerbury Lecture Sydney</span></p>
              <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>The most recent OECD economic survey of Australia declared that in “the last decade of the 20th century Australia became a model for other OECD countries”. It is a report card which confirms that the sacrifices which went into stripping back protection and making all sectors of the Australia economy more competitive have, for the most part, been worth it.</p>

              </ul>
              <div>
              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">A stable and competitive economy</span></h1>
              <p>Australia has recorded 17 consecutive years of economic growth since 1992 – averaging 3.3 per cent a year.</p>
              <p>It has been one of the most stable and productive periods of Australia’s modern history, and places Australia in the top echelon of developed countries in terms of sustained rates of growth.</p>
              <p>Australia is forecast to grow again at 2.75 per cent in 2008-09 which is above the average growth rate members of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of 2.2 per cent.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Australia ranks first in the Asia-Pacific region for labour, agricultural and industrial productivity per person employed, according to the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook.</p>
              <p>The 2006 OECD Economic Survey noted that living standards in Australia surpass those of all Group of Eight countries except the United States.</p>
              <h2>Sound economic management</h2>
              <p>Australia’s positive outlook is also sustained by its strong fiscal position. A sustained period of Government budget surpluses has enabled the Australian Government and many state level Governments to retire large amounts of Government debt.</p>
              <p>Net Government debt was eliminated in 2005-06 making Australia a net creditor nation. In May 2008, the Australian Government committed to a budget surplus equivalent to 1.8 per cent of GDP – some $21.7 billion.</p>
              <p>Australia’s independent central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), is responsible for monetary policy, in particular to keep consumer price inflation between two and three percent, on average, over business cycles.</p>
              <h2>Advanced economic structure</h2>
              <p>Australia has a sound and practical structure of financial regulations and institutions that provides certainty for business and is open to investment without undue delay. There is a strong, transparent corporate governance system along with business-oriented corporate regulation and insolvency regimes.</p>
              <p>Australia also has low barriers to trade and investment. Since a wave of micro-economic reform in the early 1990s, competition policy has been a key ingredient of the economy’s continuing success, including in key areas such as transport, telecommunications, electricity and gas.</p>
              <p>According to the World Bank, a new business can be established in Australia within two days compared with an OECD average of 20 days.</p>
              <p>The goods and services tax (GST) – Australia’s value-added tax – is levied at 10 per cent and applies to almost all goods and services transactions across the economy. There is no stamp duty on share transactions and a flat corporate tax rate of 30 per cent.</p>
              <p>Australia’s long and extensive period of economic growth has stretched its infrastructure capacity to the limit. Recognising the potential capacity restraints resulting from this problem, the Government committed in 2008 to creating an organisation called ‘Infrastructure Australia’ to provide a new, national approach to planning, funding and implementing the nation's future infrastructure needs.</p>
              <p>Safe, stable and prosperous, Australia is an increasingly attractive hub for global and regional business operations.</p>
              <div>
              <div>Did you know?</div>
              <p>Australia is home to citizens from some 200 countries, making it the most multilingual workforce in the Asia–Pacific region. More than 4 million Australians speak a second language.</p>
              </div>
              <h2>Knowledge-based industries</h2>
              <p>In the last century, it could be strongly argued that Australia’s economic success was based on its abundant agricultural and later mineral and fuels resources. While these sectors are still important, Australia has increasingly become a knowledge-based economy.</p>
              <p>Numerous factors have contributed to this development: the pace of technological and social change; advances in transport making travel, and the exchange of ideas, easier; and broader access to higher standards of education.</p>
              <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is a key driver of economic growth, and continuing expansion of ICT infrastructure is essential to keep pace with world standards. Australia’s ICT market is worth an estimated $89 billion with 25 000 companies employing 236 000 IT specialists.</p>
              <div>
              <div>Did you know?</div>
              <p>Australia was ranked the third most technology-savvy country in the world in the 2007 Globalisation Index (conducted for Foreign Policy by consulting firm A.T. Kearney).</p>
              </div>
              <h2>Financial markets</h2>
              <p>Australia is a major regional financial centre and a vital cog in the global financial system.</p>
              <p>The Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange merged in 2006 to form the world’s 8<sup>th</sup> largest listed exchange – the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). As at 30 June 2007, the ASX had 2,090 listed companies with a domestic market capitalisation of $1.63 trillion. Every day, some 150 000 equities and 400 000 futures and options are traded.</p>
              <p>Australia’s trading day spans the closure of the markets in the United States and the opening of markets in Europe. The ASX also has strong links with the major stock markets of Asia.</p>
              <p>Australia has one of the highest percentages of shareholders in the world. More than 50 per cent of the adult population own shares in publicly-listed companies.</p>

              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #008000;">The Association of South-East Asian Nations used to boast of the virtues of being an easy-going club. No longer.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>NOBODY likes to admit his dependence on others' goodwill. For the proud leaders of south east Asia, once so cocksure about their political and economic prowess, the experience has been especially galling. The global markets have, with a vengeance, taken a toll on their economic miracle. And, to sort out the mess, they are reduced to complaining that the rich world-the United States, Japan and Europe-is not doing enough to help. They may be right. But the financial turmoil has also shown up the inadequacy of the region's own self-help mechanisms.</p>
              <p>None of the much-touted institutions and forums designed to promote regional stability and economic health has had much to contribute, especially not the region's own club: the Association of south east Asian Nations (ASEAN). This favours carrots over sticks, consensus over breakthrough, camaraderie over formality and process over substance. Above all, ASEAN resists "interference in the internal affairs" of its members. Although this served the region well in the years after ASEAN's founding in 1967, enabling old sores to be salved and mutual confidence to be built, it has rendered the organisation incapable of providing a concerted response to the financial disaster. The "ASEAN way" no longer works.<br><br><strong>Economic sclerosis</strong></p>
              <p>THE organisation has, since last July, faced serious challenges to its effectiveness on three fronts: the economic, with the contagious effect of currency depreciations and market meltdowns; the political, from the bloody putsch in Cambodia just before it was due to join ASEAN; and the environmental, because of the poisonous smog from Indonesian forest fires. In each case the organisation's cardinal principle of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/80227aw.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">non-interference</span></span></a> has run into the reality of interdependence.</p>
              <p>One of the ironies is that the economic integration to which ASEAN has always aspired has arrived in the saddest of circumstances. The group has made some progress in economic co-operation. Intra-regional trade had been growing fast, lessening the reliance on America for exports, and a regional free-trade area is in the works. There is some co-ordination between central banks. But the speed with which the markets turned on the region as a whole exaggerated its member countries' similarities, and the unity between them.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the differences within the region made it hard to come up with an effective regional response. There have been several occasions when, had ASEAN not been so averse to meddling in its members' affairs, friendly criticism might have helped to avert calamity. Thailand, where south east Asia sprang a leak early last year, had for some time been heading for the rocks. The IMF had cautioned its government; the markets had sent warning shots across its bows; but any persuasion from fellow ASEAN members to set a new course was so discreet that it was easy to ignore.</p>
              <p>Later, after the Thai currency, the baht, had been floated and sank, and its neighbours found their own currencies and markets under siege, each country became painfully vulnerable to policy mistakes made by the others. For three months, for example, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, made repeated vitriolic attacks on speculators and on the West, and threatened to impose capital controls. Each outburst was followed by a sell-off, not just in Malaysia, but across the region. Many ASEAN leaders, as well as Malaysian businessmen, must have wished Dr Mahathir would keep his mouth shut. But it is unthinkable, in the ASEAN context, that they should tell him so.</p>
              <p>And they certainly cannot boss President Suharto of Indonesia around. The only ASEAN leader in power since the group's founding, Mr Suharto, in his quiet Javanese way, calls the shots. Indonesia is the regional giant, and has become the local bully. Containing Indonesia after the excesses of its "confrontation" with Malaysia and Singapore in the early 1960s was one of ASEAN's prime objectives and its greatest diplomatic success. Now, Mr Suharto's economic mismanagement poses the biggest threat to regional economic recovery.</p>
              <p>Other South-East Asian leaders, such as Dr Mahathir and Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister of Singapore, have visited him, presumably to coax him into implementing the sort of reforms the IMF has prescribed. But telephone calls from President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl probably did more to get Mr Suharto apparently to shelve a much-criticised plan to peg the stricken Indonesian currency, the rupiah, to the dollar by means of a currency board.</p>
              <p>Many south east Asians were alarmed. Asked about such "shock therapy", one finance minister says he is not sure that "therapy" is the right word. But he would not say so in public. That is not "the ASEAN way". When Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, suggested that Mr Suharto's apparent <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/80212st1.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">choice of a new vice-president</span></span></a> might rattle the markets, there were angry editorials in the Indonesian press.</p>
              <p>Yet the continuing economic dismemberment of Indonesia is, in a sense, the first test for the most significant initiative ASEAN has taken to deal with the crisis. The "Manila framework", agreed upon in the Philippine capital last November, envisages a regional surveillance mechanism whereby ASEAN members would pool economic data and apply "peer pressure" on those pursuing dangerous policies. This was virtually all that was left of a bold plan for an "Asian monetary fund", pursued with particular gusto by Dr Mahathir. Japan, which would have provided much of the money, pulled out, faced with the disapproval of the United States and the IMF.</p>
              <p>In the absence of a fund, ASEAN had no choice but to accept the IMF's primacy in prescribing economic cures. Although there is still talk of a "standby facility", the idea is, in the words of Lee Kuan Yew's son, Lee Hsien Loong, the head of Singapore's monetary authority, for "a kind of neighbourhood watch scheme".</p>
              <p>Although such initiatives might ease the next crisis, they come too late to help with this one. Instead, it is hoped that western governments will persuade their banks not to call in their loans; that Japan will stimulate its economy; that Europe and the United States will come up with more aid; and that China will not devalue its currency and set off a new round of regional depreciation. But as south east Asian leaders and diplomats grumble about the inadequacy of the rich countries' offers of help, and mutter about "fair-weather friends", they might think about the shortcomings of their own approach. A spot of "peer pressure" on governments causing instability would be a fine thing. But there is little sign of it; and none that it is working.<br><br><strong>Diplomatic paralysis</strong></p>
              <p>CALLS for a rethink of ASEAN's ways were first prompted, not by the economic debacle, but by a political upheaval: the savage coup mounted in Cambodia on July 5th last year, in which the country's second prime minister, Hun Sen, got rid of the first, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
              <p>Mr Hun Sen blew two holes in ASEAN's cosy style of business. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/0711smh.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Cambodia</span></span></a> was due to join on July 23rd, along with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/0714pres.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Myanmar</span></span></a> and Laos, thereby realising the founders' vision of a group including all ten countries of south east Asia. But the organisation had little choice but to defer Cambodia's accession. It had to admit that there were, after all, some limits to "non-interference", and some basic criteria for the domestic behaviour of members. But nobody could agree exactly what those criteria should be.</p>
              <p>Second, efforts to find a solution in "the ASEAN way" were thwarted by Mr Hun Sen's refusal to play by such rules. He was rude in public and private to ASEAN officials, and repeatedly pointed out the hypocrisy of their position. They had, after all, proceeded with the admission of Myanmar, despite its government's illegitimate seizure of power in 1988, its overturning of an election result in 1990, and its continued repression of dissenters. When, this month, hopes of a breakthrough in Cambodia finally emerged, it was as a result of a proposal, not from ASEAN, but from Japan.</p>
              <p>Although ASEAN diplomats express exasperation about Cambodia, they have a bigger worry. The regional crisis raises the fear of a catastrophic explosion of unrest and repression in Indonesia. Diplomatic efforts are directed at ensuring that it does not happen-largely by ensuring the rich world is aware of the potential danger, and so dips deep into its pocket to buy stability.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew laments that ASEAN can only show a "solidarity of fellow chicken-flu sufferers." On February 28th, the group's finance ministers were due to discuss measures such as Dr Mahathir's idea for greater use of local currencies in inter-regional trade, and Singapore's proposal for foreign guarantees to help finance Indonesian trade. But the important decisions are out of ASEAN's hands. As Mr Lee says: "We can't help each other."</p>

              <p>The US Treasury spent time in Davos this week trying to persuade sovereign wealth funds to sign up to a code on transparency, to lessen the risk of a political backlash towards future deals.<br><br>The Singaporeans and Chinese will almost certainly sign up, especially if the code is based on broad guidelines and not prescriptive rules.<br><br>It can't harm their cause.<br><br>Many decision makers in the US (and in Europe) remain suspicious about the motives behind sovereign wealth investments.<br><br>The Senate banking committee has debated the issue and heard testimony from Edwin Truman, a former US government official turned senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, an influential Washington think-tank.<br><br>Mr Truman brought along his homework: a ranking of 32 sovereign wealth funds, based on an assessment of their structure, governance, transparency and behaviour. It makes grim reading for Asians.<br><br>Temasek, the other powerful Singaporean state investment agency, likes to differentiate itself from rivals. For years, and under no obligation to do so, it has published an annual report featuring details of its personnel, strategy, investment themes and its major investments.<br><br>Yet, Mr Truman ranked Temasek eleventh, below its peers in Azerbaijan, Botswana and Kazakhstan. GIC was ranked thirtieth while China's new sovereign wealth fund, which invested in Morgan Stanley, was twentieth.</p>

              <p>Singapore becomes the first Asian victim of recession</p>
              <p><br><span>AFP, SINGAPORE</span><br>Saturday, Oct 11, 2008, Page 1</p>
              <p>Singapore has become the first Asian economy to fall into recession, analysts said yesterday, after the government revised downward its full-year growth estimate and eased monetary policy for the first time in years.<br><br>The Ministry of Trade and Industry lowered the city-state’s full-year growth forecast to around 3 percent, citing a slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors.<br><br>The move came as the ministry released preliminary data showing that real GDP declined by 6.3 percent in the third quarter after contracting 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, the ministry said.<br><br>While it did not describe the economy as being in recession, a technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in economic output.<br><br>“Singapore will be the first Asia economy to fall into a technical recession,” DBS Group Research said in an assessment of the data.<br><br>In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) — its de facto central bank — said it was easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.<br><br>“The Singapore economy has weakened over the course of 2008, alongside an escalation in the turmoil in financial markets and a more severe deceleration in global economic activity,” MAS said.<br><br>These developments meant new uncertainties for the Singapore economy, while slower Asian growth would restrain activity in a range of service industries such as transportation and tourism, it said.<br><br>“The risks to external demand conditions continue to be on the downside and a more severe global downturn cannot be discounted,” the bank said.<br><br>Singapore is Southeast Asia’s wealthiest economy in terms of GDP per capita, but is heavily dependent on trade. This makes it sensitive to hiccups in developed economies, particularly key export markets the US and Europe.<br><br>Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP, the value of goods and services produced in the economy.<br><br>Compared with the third quarter of last year, the ministry said Singapore’s economy contracted by 0.5 percent in real terms, against the 0.8 percent expansion foreseen in the Dow Jones poll.</p>

              <div>SINGAPORE'S economy has slid into its first technical recession since 2002, as a slump in exports pushed quarterly growth into negative territory for the second quarter in a row.</div>
              <div>The economy shrank by a worse-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, according to estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) released on Friday morning.</div>
              <p>MTI has also revised its full-year growth forecast for the second time this year, lowering it to 'around 3 per cent' from 4 to 5 per cent previously. This would make it the weakest pace in seven years.</p>
              <p>Recognising growth concerns, the Monetary Authority of Singapore also changed its policy stance to zero appreciation of the Singapore dollar, reversing the gradual appreciation policy it has adopted since 2003.</p>
              <p>On a quarterly basis, third-quarter GDP contracted 6.3 per cent from the second quarter, on top of a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous three months. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of decline.</p>
              <p>Manufacturing led the slowdown again this time around, weighed down by a poor performance in the biomedical sciences segment. It was also hit by weakened global demand for exports as the United States-triggered financial crisis spreads around the world.</p>
              <p>The sector shrank by 11.5 per cent in the third quarter, after declining 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>Growth in construction and services also slowed. Construction, in particular, saw its pace of expansion halved to single-digit growth, as projects were delayed by the construction squeeze, said MTI.</p>
              <p>Services, touted as a key driver of growth this year, is likely to take a hit as well as financial services falters in the wake of the global credit crunch.</p>
              <p>Most economists expect the economy to grow even more slowly next year, with the chance of a technical recession turning into a 'real' one.</p>
              <p>'With external conditions deteriorating and the lack of domestic demand support, we expect Singapore to register no growth next year... with a muted recovery, if at all, expected only in the second half of next year at the earliest,' said Morgan Stanley economists in a report.</p>
              <p><strong>Inflation peaks</strong><br>Inflation, which reached a 26-year high earlier this year, has peaked, said MAS. Consumer prices will rise between 6 per cent and 7 per cent this year, and gains will ease to between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 2009, it predicted.</p>
              <p>'Against the backdrop of a weakening external economic environment and continuing stresses in global financial markets, the growth of the Singapore economy is expected to remain below potential in the period ahead,' said MAS.</p>
              <p>'Inflation is expected to trend down in 2009 as the global and domestic economies slow.'(Straits Times Singapore)</p>

              <p><strong>RISE IN NUMBER OF BEGGARS</strong></p>
              <p>By Theresa Tan</p>
              <p>THE number of beggars and vagrants rounded up by the authorities rose sharply in the first six months of this year, with many being foreigners.</p>
              <p>The foreigners, who included bogus monks and nuns and the disabled, were found begging at hawker centres, temples and MRT stations during festive periods.</p>
              <p>Most of these foreign beggars come from China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) told The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>In the first half of the year, 181 destitute persons - or beggars and vagrants - were picked up. This is a big increase over previous years, which saw an average of 207 destitute persons rounded up each year from 2005 to 2007.</p>
              <p>The MCYS said foreign beggars and vagrants played a 'significant' role in the increase, accounting for 74 of the 181 people picked up. This compares with 51 for the whole of last year, 29 in 2006, and 21 in 2005.</p>
              <p>During the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, MCYS officers see more 'women and elderly men from neighbouring countries' begging outside mosques and in Geylang Serai.</p>
              <p>Foreign beggars are a familiar sight outside the Sultan Mosque on Fridays, when it is packed with worshippers, said Ustaz Mohd Khair Rahmat, a mosque manager.</p>
              <p>About 10 to 15 beggars, mostly foreigners, will hang around on Fridays and their numbers usually double during Ramadan, he said. Most are from Malaysia and Batam, with some from Pakistan.</p>
              <p>Ustaz Mohd Khair added: 'The Pakistani beggars are more aggressive. They will ask you for money, saying they are from some orphanage or madrasah in Pakistan. And if you ignore them, they will keep following you and asking you to give.'</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, the Sultan Mosque began telling its congregation that if they wanted to help the poor, they should donate money to the mosque, which would channel it to genuinely needy cases.</p>
              <p>On Friday, The Straits Times found over 10 beggars outside the mosque, mostly women. Some had young children in tow. They would not speak to the press.</p>
              <p>The MCYS patrols about 16 times a month to pick up vagrants and beggars on the streets of Singapore. It then conducts a 'detailed social investigation' into their background.</p>
              <p>Foreign beggars and vagrants are repatriated and blacklisted by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Local destitutes who are found to be 'homeless, without means and without family support' are sent to a welfare home. There were about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1,790 destitutes living in the 10 welfare homes last month</span>.</span></strong></p>
              <p>It is an offence to beg in Singapore. Those who have at least two previous begging records can be fined up to $3,000 and jailed for up to two years.</p>
              <p>Said an MCYS spokesman: 'There is no reason for any needy Singaporean to beg or be a vagrant. If the public detects any person who needs more assistance, they should contact MCYS through the ComCare helpline at 1800-222-0000.'</p>

              <p><strong>Meet Singapore's nomad families</strong></p>
              <p>by Braema Mathi, Senior Writer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For four years,  the newly-weds lived on the beach.</p>
              <p>From 2003 to 2007, they lived off their catch from the sea, did odd jobs, and washed in public toilets.</p>
              <p>At 16, Madam Siti (not her real name), a Primary 4 dropout, married Mr Osman (not his real name), 25, despite parental objections. They were ostracised by both their families.</p>
              <p>They lived in a series of pitched tents at Changi, East Coast, then Sembawang beach. When Madam Siti gave birth, her sister and in-laws took them in for a few months before conflicts drove them out to the beach.</p>
              <p>This went on till last year.</p>
              <p>Madam Siti, now 21, and Mr Osman, now 30, and their two children aged two and five, showed up at the Ministry of Community Development Youth and Sports' Thomson Road headquarters, asking for help to end their nomadic existence.</p>
              <p>With rising living costs and property prices, the number of nomadic families is on the rise, according to nine family service centres (FSCs) here. Each of the FSCs says it sees between 10 and 30 such cases each year.</p>
              <p>Lakeside FSC counsellor Edwin Quek says: 'We are seeing more cases. The families cannot cope with mortgage loans payments and the cost of living.'</p>
              <p>His centre has already received eight calls for help between March and May this year from displaced families, up from one or two cases earlier this year.</p>
              <p>Social workers also say they see more families - with one FSC it was one case a month - sleeping at void decks, often with children in tow and showering in public toilets.</p>
              <p>This goes on till they are allotted rental flats from the HDB or till they can afford to rent or buy a unit in the open market.</p>
              <p>But the wait for an HDB rental unit is now up to 15 months - double the waiting time in 2006. The number of people applying for heavily subsidised HDB rental flats has shot up by at least 30 per cent in the past few months.</p>
              <p>Now, there are 4,000 eligible applicants in the queue, waiting for one- and two-room rental units. Depending on household income and other factors, the rents are fixed between $26 and $205 a month for a one-room flat and between $44 and $275 for a two-room unit, a fraction of the market rates.</p>
              <p>Fallible family network</p>
              <p>According to social workers, most of these transient homeless are divorcees and the down and out.</p>
              <p>In some divorce cases, after the matrimonial homes are sold, proceeds split between spouses and creditors paid off, there is often not enough cash or savings left to buy another flat.</p>
              <p>Others are caught in a swirl of bad decisions and poor planning, resulting in the banks seizing their flats over unpaid mortgage payments.</p>
              <p>The official approach taken in dealing with such families is for social workers at FSCs - as a first option - to encourage homeless families to live with relatives, friends or strangers.</p>
              <p>This is also for practical reasons, as relatives often charge less rent - from $150 for a room - compared to the $500 and above that landlords who are strangers charge.</p>
              <p>But such arrangements often do not work out. With not just one but several children and boxes of belongings in tow, the goodwill of relatives quickly crumbles under the pressures of living together in a small space.</p>
              <p>Social workers cite cases where rules imposed by relatives and landlords - that include no cooking, minimum noise levels and a cap on water usage - are difficult for families to adhere to. Before long, typically no more than a month or two, they are thrown out again or prefer to leave.</p>
              <p>When their circle of kin is exhausted, they start living in void decks, beaches, quiet stairwells in commercial buildings, bin centres and out of vans.</p>
              <p>'They just want to live on their own, without all the tension of living with others,' said a social worker with 10 years of experience, who declined to be named.</p>
              <p>The problem of nomadic families was hotly discussed in Parliament early last year. Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Inderjit Singh noted then that many residents were in negative equity and had defaulted on mortgages, which resulted in repossession of their flats by banks. He asked if these cases were increasing because of the policy change of allowing banks to handle HDB mortgages.</p>
              <p>In reply, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, Parliamentary Secretary for National Development, said families planning to take up a bank loan should understand the implications of taking on this responsibility.</p>
              <p>Each month, about 60 repossessed flats reportedly go on sale. Many of these belong to families which over-extend themselves financially, for example, by buying a bigger flat than they can afford.</p>
              <p>'Families often do not manage their budgets well and there is no planning,' said Mr Quek.</p>
              <p>Others lose their homes because of sudden illnesses or loss of jobs. Many more are victims of ignorance. They do not know, for example, that the HDB rules include a 30-month waiting period if they have sold their flat bought with certain conditions from the HDB, or that they can apply for another HDB loan or subsidy only subject to conditions, if they have already done so previously.</p>
              <p>'They go into this buying and selling of flats without knowing enough about all the policy hitches. They need more guidance,' said Mr Quek.</p>
              <p>No room at shelters</p>
              <p>The most vulnerable nomads tend to be divorced, lower-income women with children, said Mrs Rachel Lee, a social worker with Fei Yue FSC.</p>
              <p>Most landlords are reluctant to take in lone women with children. They wonder if they can pay up and fear getting drawn into their family problems.</p>
              <p>'There is also a huge constraint in space as, often, they tend to have a lot of household stuff that they have to take along, besides the children,' she said.</p>
              <p>The hardest hit are nomadic children, who need a stable environment but end up on the move all the time, showering in public toilets and witnessing endless family feuds. Many end up skipping school.</p>
              <p>Mrs Chua Yen Ching, principal of NorthLight School that caters to students who fail their Primary School Leaving Examination, said: 'It is important for a child to come to school without having such problems as a barrier to his or her learning.'</p>
              <p>But there are few long-term solutions in sight.</p>
              <p>Singapore currently has only one shelter for displaced families. New Hope Shelter for Displaced Families, run by New Hope Community Services at Yishun, has housed 41 families since it began operations a year ago.</p>
              <p>It can accommodate 22 families at any one time. It now has four families on the wait-list - which ranges from 'a few days to weeks, depending on how long it takes current residents to leave', says its centre manager, Mr Ravi Philemon.</p>
              <p>Each family can stay up to three months and has to pay $150 a month for utilities and food rations.</p>
              <p>There are three other shelters here, meant for battered women. All three - a 40-bedder run by the Good Shepherd Sisters, a 22-bed Star Shelter run by the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations, and a 50-bedder run by the Singapore Anglican Community Services - have taken in homeless families, though they are not equipped to handle children.</p>
              <p>Their social workers note that many of the families stay beyond the three months allowed, simply because they cannot afford market rate rentals.</p>
              <p>Self-catering shelters?</p>
              <p>The HDB has announced that it will build more rental flats, from the current 43,000 units to 50,000, over the next few years. It will also review the eligibility criteria for rental housing to help the 'genuinely poor'.</p>
              <p>One way forward, suggests Mr Chua Wei Bin from Ang Mo Kio FSC, is to set up a committee that includes both social workers and HDB officials to better assess options for homeless families.</p>
              <p>That way, besides the HDB's eligibility criteria, other issues like family dynamics can be factored in. For example, on paper, a nomadic family may have siblings they can stay with, but they may be estranged or feuding.</p>
              <p>Pastor Andrew Khoo of New Hope Community Services, which runs a shelter for the homeless, said that more temporary shelter space will be needed and hopes to raise funds for it.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Ngiam Tee Liang, head of the National University of Singapore's social work department, adds that although the state wants homeless families to seek refuge first with relatives and friends, those who have tried their best but failed to go down that route should not be left out in the cold.</p>
              <p>'With close monitoring, genuine families in need must be helped in getting a home,' he said.</p>
              <p>Another solution that Mr Gerard Ee, executive director of Beyond Social Services, suggests is to offer a self-catering shelter for families where they manage themselves and their finances on their own.</p>
              <p>Once they show that they are capable of moving on, they are given HDB rental units.</p>
              <p>'Shelters unfortunately institutionalise dependency. They must be short-term solutions. Families must find their own solutions. This way, we give them that opportunity and also respect their lifestyle, without going into rescue mode,' he said.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports placed Madam Siti's family in the New Hope Shelter. They stayed there from June to September last year and were given counselling, budgeting and parenting classes.</p>
              <p>Mr Osman, previously a cleaner earning $600 a month, has since landed a higher-paying job with help from the shelter. He is now a car-washer, making $800 a month.</p>
              <p>The family now lives with Madam Siti's sister in a one-room flat. They stick to a tight budget worked out by the centre for them - $50 for food, $100 for rental, $100 for transport, the rest for the children.</p>
              <p>When Madam Siti turns 21 next month, they will join the queue for an HDB rental flat, forgoing their dreams of buying a flat, as they know they cannot afford it for now and do not wish to get into debt.</p>
              <p>'I never want to go back and live at the beach. I want to live in our own house soon and build up our lives,' she said.</p>

              <div>"<em>There are no homeless, destitute or starving people [in Singapore]…Poverty has been eradicated</em>."<br>-Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's permanent representative to the UN</div>
              <br>

              <p>Everytime I work late and pass by the bus interchange near my place, I notice the growing number of homeless at the bus interchange. Each pillar at the bus interchange now as a permanent resident (PR). You ever wonder why the homeless sleep next to pillars....so that the tired people coming back from work don't step on them when they sleep. Since every pillar is now occupied, I wondered where a new homeless person would go. The Sunday Times has the answer....</p>

              <p><em>"Sleeping in void decks, Changi beach, bus interchange is also very <strong>POPULAR </strong>especially among the poor...</em>" - Lucky Tan</p>
              <p>Some of you might have criticised the govt for building the extravagant Esplanade spending hundreds of millions tax payers money on a building that hosts operas, musicals and symphonies that only the richer citizens can afford. But you are wrong, while the rich get to watch "<a class="l" href="http://www.lesmis.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Les Misérables</span></span></a>", the poor get to sleep in the underpass between Esplanade and the Citilink Mall at night. The Esplanade is indeed a very useful building both rich and poor people get to use it. <a><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5079459395130711394" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 376px; cursor: hand; height: 143px; text-align: center;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="282" height="120"></a>It seems <em>not all</em> the 'sleepers' are jobless. Why do people with jobs need to sleep in those places? The answer is very simple and logical. The real wages of some workers are now so low that after the numerous bouts of utilities increase, transport fare increase, and rental increases, there is hardly any choice but to sleep on streets. I would do it too if I make $900 a month because I can save $100 on transport because I sleep close to where I work, another $200 on rental and $50-$100 of utilities bill....in other words I can save half my income, by sleeping in public places.</p>
              <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5079462805334744434" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 267px; cursor: hand; height: 75px; text-align: center;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3ggmHJXXI/AAAAAAAAAO0/83Lp4F__PLg/s200/homeless3.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="267" height="62">As Singapore heads for top 1st world status, the cost of living can only rise relative to the wages of low income workers. We can see greater utilisation of our public buildings, MRT stations, bus interchanges and 24hr MacDonald's outlets as they double up as sleeping areas for these sleepers. It is great that our beloved govt had such great foresight to invest so much money on these beautiful buildings such as the Esplanade we now know how much vision it took.....I really couldn't imagine that the Esplanade could be actually be that useful to everyone.</div>

              <p>U just re read this for few times then u know the situation in Oz.</p>
              <p>Where do oz banks to find  funds in a year which is equal to</p>
              <p>one quarter of GDP ?</p>
              <p>GE Money pulled out from car and house loans,threatening both</p>
              <p>markets.</p>
              <p>FYI.Oz GDP is A$1000 to 1200 billion</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Australian banks have to find $1 billion a week to fund the
              ever-growing current account deficit ($50 billion a year). That is on
              top of the $600 billion in existing foreign debt that has to be
              periodically refinanced by Australian banks on international credit
              markets ($200-250 billion this year).</p>
              <p>Australia has been relying on international money markets to finance
              its consumption. But yesterday GE Money, one of the biggest funders of
              Australia's non-bank housing loans and car loans, said it was on the
              verge of quitting both businesses in Australia as its US parent sought
              to lower its risk profile by selling off unwanted and marginal business
              around the world.</p>
              <p>Yesterday it was reported that <span style="color: #ff0000;">NAB had suffered seven defaults on
              its $1.7 billion </span>portfolio of toxic synthetic collateralised debt
              obligations (SCDOs). NAB could face additional capital requirements if
              the instruments deteriorate to sub-investment grade.</p>
              <p>NAB's SCDOs are the riskiest of its $4.5 billion book of conduits -
              securities linked to risky US subprime assets, which are being managed
              by a team of 10 senior employees to reduce the portfolio's risk.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Website Crikey reported GE as telling it: "Due to the rising cost of
              finance brought on by the turmoil in world finance</span> markets, we've been
              implementing ways to reduce our exposure for a while across the
              business - including motor. As a result we have been terminating
              agreements with some retail and wholesale motor partners over the last
              few weeks."</p>
              <p>GE's car financing business in Australia is perhaps the nation's
              largest as it runs a so-called "white label" business for many car
              importers. Its size may be gauged from its website, which details its
              extensive list of NSW dealers. There are more than 80 car groups
              financed by GE in NSW alone, with Holden, Ford, Mazda, Audi and Toyota
              among the brands financed.</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Our debt is at an historic high, at 160% of gross domestic product</span>,
              presenting government and the banks with a problem that can only be
              resolved by a huge fiscal stimulus.</p>
              <p>Other problems Australian banks face are potential exposure to the
              $80 trillion credit default swap market and looming problems in the
              over-the-counter foreign exchange derivative market.</p>
              <p>Andrew Baggio, a principal of Baggio Legal in Australia and a
              leading authority on CDOs, wrote at the weekend of the potential of
              CDOs to devastate Australian banks, calling them a "critical time bomb
              within our financial system".</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sure SG banks will be affected!!</p>

Although the homeless are often “hidden” in a society like Singapore, Singapore is by no means exempted from this worldwide dilemma. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">To be sure, a homeless person obviously needs a home. But such a simple observation overlooks the reason why the homeless have no home. Simply demanding more housing for the homeless is like saying that a person with a fever can be cured with a cold bath to bring down the temperature and ignoring the infection causing the fever. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">People who are homeless are so for various reasons. Some have made poor choices in life, some are involved with alcohol or drugs, yet others are part of the system of generational poverty in which inadequate life skills are handed down from one generation to the next, resulting in an entire culture of people who do not know how to take advantage of the educational, cultural or employment advantages available to them. Some of the homeless are also those who may have had some education, a job and a place to live, but without a “safety net” of family or friends to help them through a difficult time, found themselves evicted from their homes after they lost their job or had a financial crisis. But whatever the circumstances, homelessness is but the symptom of root problems.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">In addressing the problem of homelessness, the focus has to shift from emergency shelters to prevention.<span> </span>Emergency shelters should only be temporary and transitional solutions, to provide a safe housing environment in the interim.<span> </span>The different agencies who want to focus their resources on preventive efforts should:</span></p>

              </span></p><p>Singapore’s growing homeless problem</p>
              <p><img src="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/images/medium_homeless8.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large; color: #ff0000;">I</span>T was three in the morning on a very cool Saturday. Most Singaporeans were fast asleep. So was a group of more than a dozen able-bodied men — some even snoring — on flattened cardboard boxes laid in neat rows. But unlike most of the Singaporeans who were asleep in the comfort of their homes, the group of men slept in the open — with the sky as their roof — in a secluded spot near the World Trade Centre Ferry Terminal. Most of them have been spending their nights there for the past year. They have named the place Heartbreak Hotel. Over at Toa Payoh housing estate, a thirtysomething married couple was cuddling each other under a bridge to keep themselves warm, amid the nearby tall and impressive apartment blocks. The spot under the bridge has been their home for the last one month. Like the group of men at the Heartbreak Hotel, they had rejection written all over their faces. Their meals are at coffee shops or food centres, while they answer nature's calls at public toilets. The group of men and the couple are part of the growing number of homeless in Singapore — once an unusual sight in the wealthy island of four million people. No official figures are available, but the numbers are certainly growing.</p>
              <p>Most are among the country's more than 100,000 residents who are currently unemployed, although one in the first group works as a cleaner at the Singapore General Hospital. But his monthly salary of S$600 (M$1340) is enough only for food and transport. Another member of the group owns a threeroom flat. But without a job for close to two years and without much savings, it was impossible for him to maintain the flat. He, instead, rents the flat out, and survives on the rental income of about S$700 a month.</p>
              <p>Given the absence of unemployment benefits and a lack of welfare aid, and nothing in their wallets, a growing number of Singaporeans are being forced to give up their homes and seek alternative accommodation. Also hit are those in the income bracket of S$400 a month. Their numbers, according to government data, stand at 180,650 workers or about nine per cent of the workforce. While many of the luckier ones have been able to move in with their relatives or to cheaper accommodation, there are a number that have been forced to seek shelter in the open — in parks, under bridges and vacant areas. The couple under the bridge, for instance, once had a three-room flat in the Toa Payoh Housing Estate. But since the husband lost his storekeeper job nearly three years ago, the couple had to endure life first without electricity and water, and subsequently their home. Most of the money that they received from the sale of their flats went back to their Central Provident Fund account, while the rest was used to pay for the utility bills. Like the couple, most Singaporeans have debts and are compelled to pay utility charges and mortgages on their homes each month.</p>
              <p>Given that most of the unemployed and those in the low-income bracket lack education and marketable skills, and are being frozen out of the worst job market in 17 years in a country with one of the most educated workforces in Asia, many other may soon share the fate of the couple and the residents of Heartbreak Hotel. The main reason: the country's lack of a social safety net, despite the immense wealth generated during the last three decades of prosperity. The Government does not believe in a welfare state and firmly discourages dependence on the Government. Only a few thousand people are considered poor enough to get a paltry benefit of between S$300 and S$400 per month — barely enough to live on, and that too after a tedious and long process. Instead, the Government insists that those who lack education and marketable skills retrain and upgrade their skills through its subsidised retraining programmes. Still, the presence of these homeless is posing a new problem for the Government, which is currently engrossed in seeking a solution to the country's worst economic problems in history caused by the exodus of manufacturers and multinationals to China and other low-cost regions such as Malaysia and India. A solution is needed.</p>
