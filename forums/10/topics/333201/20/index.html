              <p><em>Singapore's consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace last month [May 2008], reducing the need for further currency gains to rein in inflation. The consumer price index [CPI] jumped 7.5% from a year earlier, matching April's 26-year high record, the Department of Statistics said [23 Jun 2008]. The Monetary Authority of Singapore [MAS] had forecast a 5-6% inflation rate for 2008. The central bank has allowed its currency to strengthen against the US dollar, saying the exchange rate remains its most effective tool to fight inflation.</em></p>
              <p>- The Singapore inflation rate is reportedly stabilizing and analysts are already predicting that it will come down in the second half of 2008. <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pDdh4Uw2rkej6LyR_3gBREQ"><span style="color: #993311;">Singapore M3 money supply</span></a> figures also appear to be stabilizing around the 12-13% level in the past half year, down from <a href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/23_62_singapore_m3_money"><span style="color: #993311;">a high of 23.62%</span></a> in 2007. But the money supply growth rate is only half the story - the other half is its relationship to the growth of available goods and services in the economy. For the inflation rate to be stable, economic growth has to at least keep up with money supply growth. With a looming global economic slowdown and imminent worldwide recession, the economic growth factor is the big wildcard.</p>
              <p>Gold and crude oil prices may have paused from breaking new all-time record highs for the time being, but the inflationary storm is far from over as yet. We may only be passing through the eye of the hurricane here - just when people start to get lulled into complacency, the winds of inflation could well pick up with renewed force - perhaps even stronger than ever. We need to remain vigilant against inflation. This is no time to let down your guard yet.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/379056/1/.html"><span style="color: #993311;">channelnewsasia.com</span></a>, <a href="http://www.spservices.sg/news/PressRelease-29-Sep-08.pdf"><span style="color: #993311;">spervices.sg</span></a> (pdf):</p>
              <p><em>Singaporeans will see an increase of 21% in their electricity bills in the last quarter of this year. For the quarter 1 Oct to 31 Dec 08, the average electricity tariffs will be increased by 5.38 cents per kWh. This represents an increase of 21.46% for households. The increase is due to higher fuel oil prices. For the period 1 Oct to 31 Dec 08, tariffs are pegged to a higher forward fuel oil price of S$155.14 per barrel, which is 38.06% higher than that of S$112.35 per barrel for the current quarter [Q3 2008].</em></p>
              <p><em>The EMA feels there is more room for Singaporeans to conserve and use less energy. The EMA's surveys and findings show that nearly 40% of Singapore homes are using more energy than they require to. And the air conditioner is one of the largest energy guzzlers in homes here.</em></p>
              <p>- For residential households in Singapore, the electricity rate will increase from 25.07 to 30.45 cents per kilowatt-hour. Quarter-on-quarter that's a 21.46% increase as stated, but if you were to look back a bit further, it's a mind-blowing 89.6% increase compared to 3 years ago, as the tariffs back in Apr 2005 was 16.06 cents per KWh. This is a super-high double-digit rate of inflation, and all we need is for another further one or two rounds of increase to hit a triple-digit rate within a 3-year period. Absolutely super.</p>
              <p>The surprise here is that while NYMEX crude oil prices have been <a href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/nymex_crude_oil_drops_below_92_as_financial_market_meltdown_intensifies"><span style="color: #993311;">driven downward</span></a> in recent weeks by the ongoing <a href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/s_p_500_sinks_most_since_9_11_dow_jones_drops_504_48_points_on_financial_system_meltdown"><span style="color: #993311;">financial market meltdown</span></a>, the oil price used for electricity rate calculations isn't the historical NYMEX crude oil movements but forward fuel prices for the upcoming quarter, which are, after conversion to USD, around $110 per barrel.</p>
              <p>As for conservation measures, they will help somewhat but only up to a point. If the rates were to double, could you cut back to use half the electricity? If they were to triple? Quadruple? Would you be able to cut back 66%? 75%? The price upside is effectively unlimited, while your downside mitigation measures will naturally start to run into limits.</p>
              <p>But of course that isn't to say that we shouldn't try. In view of our own pocketbook, resource depletion and environment pollution, we should still strive towards energy conservation as much as we can. As I have <a href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/power_bill_and_other_updates"><span style="color: #993311;">chronicled earlier</span></a>, we have reduced our household power consumption from a whopping <a href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/power_bill_update"><span style="color: #993311;">700 KWh per month</span></a> down to a much more manageable 436 KWh (average over past 3 months). That's a reduction of 37.7% - not too bad, eh?</p>
              <p>Here are some of the things we did in terms of energy conservation over the past couple years or so :</p>
              <p>- configured the computers to auto-shutdown after the nightly backups<br>- replaced energy-guzzler continuous-boiling air-pot with thermos flask<br>- turned off air-con system permanently (outside main switch set to "off" position)<br>- changed to a more efficient clothes dryer model (still need that with 3 adults, 2 kids, and rainy days)<br>- replaced living room 29" CRT TV with 37" LCD TV (bigger HD screen, lower consumption)<br>- replaced all 3 CRT computer monitors with LCD monitors<br>- turned off electrical appliances when not in use (eliminates the <a href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/your_power_bill_is_standing"><span style="color: #993311;">standby power effect</span></a>)</p>
              <p>That seems like a long list of things to do and some of them cost money too. Of course all the LCD's cost money, but we had actually been hanging on to <a href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/are_crts_history"><span style="color: #993311;">CRT's</span></a> long after everyone and their grandmother had already upgraded, so there you are. Further improvements would be more incremental tweaks - perhaps I may permanently turn off the second cordless phone which is only occasionally used, replace the very last 19" CRT TV in one of the bedrooms, also occasionally used, sending the children's bathtub to the recycling bin to save on some heated water since they are too big for it anyway, things like that. We'll see how this goes.</p>

              that Australia will avoid the sorts of confidence-sapping price crashes
              that have plagued the US in the past two years.</p>
              <p>But the bad news for Labor is the price falls that have occurred in
              Australia are in the very markets needed to firewall the economy -
              Sydney, the nation's worst-performing city, and Perth, the capital most
              reliant on mining for its prosperity. In Sydney, the typical
              outer-suburban home is worth less today than it was in 2003. In Perth,
              the boom has finally ended and prices have been in retreat this year.</p>
              <p>The carnage in Sydney is concentrated in the middle- and
              outer-western suburbs, in particular the Liverpool and Fairfield areas,
              where 27 suburbs have had a slump in prices over the past five years.
              One of the worst affected is Busby, only 30km from the centre of
              Sydney, where the median house price of $233,500 is 16.5 per cent lower
              than it was in 2003.</p>
              <p>In total, 81 suburbs have recorded capital losses since 2003 - 80 of
              which are in Sydney, and just one, Cranbourne South, in Melbourne.</p>
              <p>The Australian used RP Data to pinpoint the suburbs where people
              were most likely to move to following Labor's decision a fortnight ago
              to treble the first-home owner grant to $21,000 for the purchase of new
              properties, and to double it to $14,000 for established dwellings.</p>
              <p>Those suburbs where the median house price was below $400,000 were counted as first-home owner territory.</p>
              <p>Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth have roughly the same price
              structure, with the inner city locked out to first-time buyers, The
              affordable suburbs tend to be located more than 20km beyond the city
              centre.</p>
              <p>One of the problems for new buyers is that the major banks will be less willing to lend if prices are flat, or on the way down.</p>

              <blockquote>This expansion in financing relative to GDP is not something that is 
                      unique to Australia; it has been happening across all the developed economies. 
                      As can be seen in Graph 15, in most developed countries at present the 
                      ratio of debt financing (including both intermediated and non intermediated) 
                      is in the range of about 100 per cent to 175 per cent of GDP. When assessed 
                      in this international context, there does not appear to be anything unusual 
                      about the current position of Australia.</blockquote>

                debt to GDP ratio of households and financial corporates in the UK, US and Australia 
                is around 150 per cent of GDP. The other countries – Spain, Germany, Japan, 
                France and Italy – have ratios ranging from 135 per cent to 100 per cent

              <p><em>Singapore's consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace last month [May 2008], reducing the need for further currency gains to rein in inflation. The consumer price index [CPI] jumped 7.5% from a year earlier, matching April's 26-year high record, the Department of Statistics said [23 Jun 2008]. The Monetary Authority of Singapore [MAS] had forecast a 5-6% inflation rate for 2008. The central bank has allowed its currency to strengthen against the US dollar, saying the exchange rate remains its most effective tool to fight inflation.</em></p>
              <p>- The Singapore inflation rate is reportedly stabilizing and analysts are already predicting that it will come down in the second half of 2008. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pDdh4Uw2rkej6LyR_3gBREQ"><span style="color: #993311;">Singapore M3 money supply</span></a> figures also appear to be stabilizing around the 12-13% level in the past half year, down from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/23_62_singapore_m3_money"><span style="color: #993311;">a high of 23.62%</span></a> in 2007. But the money supply growth rate is only half the story - the other half is its relationship to the growth of available goods and services in the economy. For the inflation rate to be stable, economic growth has to at least keep up with money supply growth. With a looming global economic slowdown and imminent worldwide recession, the economic growth factor is the big wildcard.</p>
              <p>Gold and crude oil prices may have paused from breaking new all-time record highs for the time being, but the inflationary storm is far from over as yet. We may only be passing through the eye of the hurricane here - just when people start to get lulled into complacency, the winds of inflation could well pick up with renewed force - perhaps even stronger than ever. We need to remain vigilant against inflation. This is no time to let down your guard yet.</p>

              <p><em>Singaporeans will see an increase of 21% in their electricity bills in the last quarter of this year. For the quarter 1 Oct to 31 Dec 08, the average electricity tariffs will be increased by 5.38 cents per kWh. This represents an increase of 21.46% for households. The increase is due to higher fuel oil prices. For the period 1 Oct to 31 Dec 08, tariffs are pegged to a higher forward fuel oil price of S$155.14 per barrel, which is 38.06% higher than that of S$112.35 per barrel for the current quarter [Q3 2008].</em></p>
              <p><em>The EMA feels there is more room for Singaporeans to conserve and use less energy. The EMA's surveys and findings show that nearly 40% of Singapore homes are using more energy than they require to. And the air conditioner is one of the largest energy guzzlers in homes here.</em></p>
              <p>- For residential households in Singapore, the electricity rate will increase from 25.07 to 30.45 cents per kilowatt-hour. Quarter-on-quarter that's a 21.46% increase as stated, but if you were to look back a bit further, it's a mind-blowing 89.6% increase compared to 3 years ago, as the tariffs back in Apr 2005 was 16.06 cents per KWh. This is a super-high double-digit rate of inflation, and all we need is for another further one or two rounds of increase to hit a triple-digit rate within a 3-year period. Absolutely super.</p>
              <p>The surprise here is that while NYMEX crude oil prices have been <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/nymex_crude_oil_drops_below_92_as_financial_market_meltdown_intensifies"><span style="color: #993311;">driven downward</span></a> in recent weeks by the ongoing <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/s_p_500_sinks_most_since_9_11_dow_jones_drops_504_48_points_on_financial_system_meltdown"><span style="color: #993311;">financial market meltdown</span></a>, the oil price used for electricity rate calculations isn't the historical NYMEX crude oil movements but forward fuel prices for the upcoming quarter, which are, after conversion to USD, around $110 per barrel.</p>
              <p>As for conservation measures, they will help somewhat but only up to a point. If the rates were to double, could you cut back to use half the electricity? If they were to triple? Quadruple? Would you be able to cut back 66%? 75%? The price upside is effectively unlimited, while your downside mitigation measures will naturally start to run into limits.</p>
              <p>But of course that isn't to say that we shouldn't try. In view of our own pocketbook, resource depletion and environment pollution, we should still strive towards energy conservation as much as we can. As I have <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/power_bill_and_other_updates"><span style="color: #993311;">chronicled earlier</span></a>, we have reduced our household power consumption from a whopping <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/power_bill_update"><span style="color: #993311;">700 KWh per month</span></a> down to a much more manageable 436 KWh (average over past 3 months). That's a reduction of 37.7% - not too bad, eh?</p>
              <p>Here are some of the things we did in terms of energy conservation over the past couple years or so :</p>
              <p>- configured the computers to auto-shutdown after the nightly backups<br>- replaced energy-guzzler continuous-boiling air-pot with thermos flask<br>- turned off air-con system permanently (outside main switch set to "off" position)<br>- changed to a more efficient clothes dryer model (still need that with 3 adults, 2 kids, and rainy days)<br>- replaced living room 29" CRT TV with 37" LCD TV (bigger HD screen, lower consumption)<br>- replaced all 3 CRT computer monitors with LCD monitors<br>- turned off electrical appliances when not in use (eliminates the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/your_power_bill_is_standing"><span style="color: #993311;">standby power effect</span></a>)</p>
              <p>That seems like a long list of things to do and some of them cost money too. Of course all the LCD's cost money, but we had actually been hanging on to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/are_crts_history"><span style="color: #993311;">CRT's</span></a> long after everyone and their grandmother had already upgraded, so there you are. Further improvements would be more incremental tweaks - perhaps I may permanently turn off the second cordless phone which is only occasionally used, replace the very last 19" CRT TV in one of the bedrooms, also occasionally used, sending the children's bathtub to the recycling bin to save on some heated water since they are too big for it anyway, things like that. We'll see how this goes.</p>

              <h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">Even expats also sian the cost of living liao</span></h3>
              <p>Interesting exchange going on in <a href="http://www.expatsingapore.com/forum/index.php/topic,34440.0.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">expatsingapore forums</span></span></a>. The forumers there are discussing if Singapore is getting too expensive for expats to stay:</p>
              <p><br>Move:</p>
              <blockquote><em>We find it is getting more expensive to live in Singapore. Rent has been skyrocketing. Also, more expenses incurred after GST increase (eg. maid asked for more pay, increase in food prices). Package is now on local deal (not expat deal as when you just first moved here). AUD is now stronger than SGD so effectively earning less than before. Some people we know of have moved back. Got told that it is unlikey that AUD will get weaker against SGD in 5 years. Wondered if people have considered a move back??</em></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are going home:</p>
              <blockquote><em>We have been here about 2 years and have decided to go home - as it's just not worth living here anymore - true, the low tax rate is great - but we will now have to pay over SGD6,000 a month for a same place we have been paying SGD2500 for the past 2 years and our paychecks have not increased by that much over 2 years. Also with strong AUD against SGD, we are not really that better off in Singapore.
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, the long working hours have started to cause a problem in our marriage (I was working almost 12 hours a day, almost every day at a bank).</p>
              </em></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>We too:</p>
              <blockquote><em>We're going home too. It's not worth it anymore.</em></blockquote>

              <p><a id="more"></a></p>
              <p>not a dollar chaser:</p>
              <blockquote><em>Singapore Inc is all about money. The people are obsessed with it, and you can't do anything without spending some of it. Most conversations here involve money and you will find that even if you think you came here to experience the "culture", your life will be consumed with the thought of money.
              <p> </p>
              <p>We're going home too. I don't want my kids growing up in a place that values cash and "prosperity" over all else.</p>
              </em></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Sensei:</p>
              <blockquote><em>To Only One.........I always say we're memory rich and cash poor. I've worked at various times through ten years, fairly well paid at local rates, but in real terms if you look at my husband's income we're now worse off financially. Circumstances have changed in that he's on a contract basis rather than company employee, but we've chosen to stay away from our home country because, just like you, it's for the experience. He's lived and worked in six Asian countries, I've been in three and we've been happy in each one. And we've been able to travel further afield several times - we think we're really lucky to have done so.
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our two kids have had amazing opportunities but have never had that Expat Brat style, we just didn't allow it. Never had a maid (just a cleaner once a week) so the kids had to pull their weight in the house. They didn't have the pocket money that many friends did but it didn't matter, they've grown up into sensible and well educated young adults. And we're comfortable but not rolling in money, despite the perception many people have that Expats are darn near millionaires. I hate it when we visit our home country and they think we're made of money.</p>
              <p>To Elizamango, I'd say think VERY carefully before committing to Singapore. I feel you'd enjoy the experience but don't compromise your standard of living. Make sure you have enough for comfortable accommodation, enough to take a few trips around Asia and to get you back to Australia to keep up family/friends ties each year, enough to have a social life without worrying about overspending. And be sure you have very good medical coverage, hospitalisation in Singapore is expensive.</p>
              <p>To the OP, we were fortunate in that we had two properties which have been rented out all the time. We'll go back eventually to a roof over our heads in a nice town, a small pension, and we'll have great memories to look back on. But starting out now - well, we'd think twice about it which is sad</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br>One year is enough:</p>
              <blockquote><em>We came to Singapore, as corny as it sounds for the experience also. We wanted to travel and that's what we did. For both of us, it was not a career move, and financially we are not that much better off here as we spend a lot more (on traveling &amp; eating out!).
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd say, if you have a chance to move here, do it - sure the working hours are crazy (I found that most Singaporeans just stayed back to look busy because that's what just everybody seemd to do here) but if you want to and try to make the best out of it, you will enjoy it.</p>
              </em></blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>professional expats:</p>
              <blockquote><em>We hold EU passports but had not lived in any country for more than 5 years for the last 30 years. There is no country that is "home" to move back to. It might be more expensive in Singapore now than in the last year but we are still saving far more than if we were to be posted back to Europe. We were just there for 4 weeks for the summer and eating out cost a fortune and taxes are a nightmare. For those who don't have an expat package and have a home to go back to, I guess leaving would be a better option for you. Having said that, I know some teachers at our children's school who are pretty content with their relatively humble packages. How big a slice of the pie does one want and when one gets it, can one have it and eat it too?</em></blockquote>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Most Expats rely on the confidence Singapore has earned to negotiate an Expat package and whatever the margins they feel sure there will be no unexpected upheavals.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Rising construction costs put squeeze on builders<br><br></span>Some manage to factor into contracts the higher risks of price fluctuations</strong><br><br>By ARTHUR SIM<br><br><br>(SINGAPORE) Construction costs have risen across the board by at least about 13 per cent in Singapore in the six months to end-March. And for the residential/ condominium segment, costs have risen even faster, by as much as 16 per cent, according to a report by construction cost consultancy Rider Levett Bucknall (RLB).<br><br>The rise comes in the light of a 23 per cent increase in the Building and Construction Authority's tender price index in Q4 2007 on a year-on-year basis, making Singapore among the most expensive in the world.<br><br>At the top end in Q1 2008, the construction cost for a luxury condominium, a five-star hotel and a 55-storey office now comes to as much as $4,000-$5,500, $5,650-$7,680 and $4,960-$5,660 psm per gross floor area (GFA) respectively, according to RLB.<br><br>Says RLB managing partner Winston Hauw: 'High demand and competition for limited resources, the lack of tendering capacity among contractors, sub-contractors and suppliers, and volatile commodity prices have contributed significantly to building price escalation.'<br><br>RLB also found that the prices of crude oil, copper and aluminium have increased by 22-26 per cent between January and April.<br><br>According to RLB's 2007 data, Singapore ranks after Macau and Hong Kong on its tender price relativity matrix. Against this index with Hong Kong at 100, Singapore is 97 while Macau is 102. London is 144, New York is 140 and Sydney is 105.<br><br>RLB also has its own tender price index. At end Q4 2007, the index rose 26.3 per cent year on year and it expects this to rise a further 15-18 per cent in 2008. Property prices have eased but RLB believes this will have a limited impact on local construction demand in the short term due to the large existing project commitments on hand from both the public and private sectors.<br><br>These 'commitments', together with rising costs, are adding strain to the industry.<br><br>United Engineers Ltd (UEL), which has operations across Asia, agrees with the growing market sentiment that Singapore could actually be the most expensive in the world in building costs. But a UEL spokesman added: 'But it is likely to be a temporary phenomenon.'<br><br>To mitigate against rising costs, some construction companies have priced in the risk of price fluctuations at higher levels. A spokesman for a construction company said that in general, this could amount to 10-20 per cent of the construction package. Saying that this has increased by at least 10 per cent over the last three years, he added, 'In fact, three years ago you might still have had to mark down to increase competitiveness.'<br><br>Straits Construction Co director Wong Chee Herng, however, says that these risk factors are still very 'material specific'. And although such contractual clauses are becoming more common, Mr Wong said these are not always adopted.<br><br>Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers president Lim Lan Yuan believes the pricing-in of risks may have increased by as much as 10-15 per cent since 2007 simply because 'prices are so uncertain'.<br><br>The filter-down effect of rising costs is that more projects could be delayed. While private sector developers have stayed largely silent about the impact, it was recently reported that the completion of the Singapore Sports Hub could be pushed back to 2012. While it was only reported that the delays were due to the 'contract's financial and legal details', it is probably safe to assume that construction costs were a factor too.<br><br>A spokesman for City Developments Ltd told BT: 'There is a significant increase in demand for construction work over the past two years. However, we are fortunate to have a team of regular contractors who continue to build our projects over this difficult period.'<br><br>A spokesman for Kajima in Singapore says that delays are also not simply due to construction costs per se but also due to the 'inability to pay' for certain materials or services. Citing the cost of steel re-bars as an example, which have doubled in price since 2007, he says: 'It's an additional cost we have had to bear. Basically, if (a construction company) can't shoulder this, it will have to default.'<br><br>Reiterating the plight of construction companies, Singapore Contractors Association (Scal) executive director Simon Lee says: 'It is not true that Singapore construction companies are pricing in high-risk factors for all contracts. They only price in high-risk factors in the demanding and unreasonable contracts.'<br><br>He added: 'Some contracts are very unforgiving and expect construction companies to take on all unforeseen risks and absorb all cost increases.'<br><br>But Mr Lee believes that construction costs are still competitive here because 'labour cost is still kept at a reasonable level'.<br><br>He also says that while costs and shortages of materials can affect the progress of projects here, 'on a case-by-case basis, the construction company and the developer will discuss the best way to resolve these issues. The parties always prefer not to nullify contracts if such issues can be amicably settled'.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2008-06-18/BT_IMAGES_RISING18.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: large; color: #ff0000;">P</span><span>OOR in Singapore? You have to look hard in a nation with a reputation for being affluent and tech-savvy. </span></p>
              <p><span>But the opposition Workers' Party has labelled the city state's middle class 'the New Poor' and hopes this will win them votes in Saturday's election. </span></p>
              <p><span>Elections are often bombastic affairs but the slogan rings a bell with the unemployed and disenfranchised as Singapore suffers its worst recession since 1964. </span></p>
              <p><span>"No point shouting down the concept of New Poor," said Sinapan Samydorai, executive director of the non-partisan Think Centre. "This is a new reality that is coming up. No point saying we will only deal with the financially very poor." </span></p>
              <p><span>Per capita income of about US$24,000 puts the city state on a par with Belgium and Britain but does not necessarily reflect the pay packet of the average Singaporean. </span></p>
              <p><span>A monthly salary of S$5000 (US$2750) is considered high and many workers make do with a third or a quarter of that. For the 25,000 people expected to lose their jobs this year, there is little welfare or unemployment benefits to fall back on. </span></p>
              <p><span>Singapore has few destitute people sleeping on the streets but rising costs and competition are making many feel they are the middle "sandwiched" class. </span></p>
              <p><span>Philip Ang, a 40-year-old buyer of mechanical equipment for a multinational company, has been worried about losing his job since early this year and knows the prospects for new positions are getting dimmer. </span></p>
              <p><span>"Ever since September 11, there has not been much work in this region," he said. </span></p>
              <p><span>"The chances of being called up for an interview are much less now. There are no positions to fill, companies are freezing employment. The only way for people my age is to upgrade."</span></p>
              <p><strong><span>BLEAKER PROSPECTS AHEAD </span></strong></p>
              <p><span>The image of Singapore is one of expensive cars, shopping malls, mobile phones and consumers cruising fancy boutiques but this is not the reality for thousands without education or skills. </span></p>
              <p><span>After 9.9 percent growth last year, Singapore slumped into recession even before the September 11 attacks on the United States and is expected to stay in negative terrain until at least the middle of next year. </span></p>
              <p><span>Unemployment is likely to hit 4.5 percent by the end of this year and the country of four million people has been told to brace for a deep, long recession. </span></p>
              <p><span>The long-ruling People's Action Party (PAP) effectively won another term last week as the splintered opposition contested only 29 of 84 seats for the November 3 poll. </span></p>
              <p><span>But the opposition is making jobs, healthcare and the cost of living into an issue as hard times encroach on all segments of society through corporate layoffs, restructuring and mergers. </span></p>
              <p><span>The gap between the haves and have-nots is getting wider, underscored by the fact that some 70 percent of Singaporeans do not pay income tax because they earn less than the minimum taxable income or else come in for other benefits. </span></p>
              <p><span>Poverty is relative and can mean a loss of security -- like the white collar worker who has lost a steady job and is having difficulty meeting basic expenses. </span></p>
              <p><span>"It is a relativistic definition which relates poverty not only to physical needs but also to the norms and expectations of society," said James Gomez of the Workers' Party. </span></p>
              <p><span>He said some economists argue that the island nation, while having attained a first world per capita income, has an income structure closer to that of a third world country. </span></p>
              <p><span>Strapped for cash, thousands lined up for hours last week to get some relief from the S$2.7 billion in New Singapore Shares handed out by the government as part of a S$11.3 billion stimulus package to help</span></p>

              <h1>Uniquely Singapore, F1 or F9 - helping the poor?</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p>Saturday, 26 January 2008, 8:52 am | 654 views</p>
              </div>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor4rs.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="210" height="160" align="right"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">By<strong> Leong Sze Hian</strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I refer to the article “Second shot at ComCare for needy families” (ST, Jan 13), and media reports about the setting up of a ComCare Supervisory Committee to reconsider borderline cases that do not qualify for ComCare assistance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The report said that since 2005, the Citizens Consultative Committee ComCare funds have spent close to $4 million helping 24,481 needy cases. Each case received an average of $136 a month.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I think there appears to be something wrong with the statistics, as $136 a month times 12 months, multiplied by 24,481 needy cases is $40 million. And “since 2005”, means that the total for the last three years should be $120 million. This is 30 times the $4 million figure.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p><strong>Govt assistance declining?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Charity%20F1%20or%20F9/singapore.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="200" height="150" align="left"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why is it that Government Development Expenditure on Community Development, Youth and Sports, has dropped by 46 per cent from $120 million to $65 million from 2005 to 2006, according to the MCYS web site’s “Singapore Social Statistics In Brief” (<a href="http://app.mcys.gov.sg/web/GeneralStatistics.asp"><span style="color: #990000;">MCYS</span></a>)?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Also, why has Government Operating Revenue over Government Operating Expenditure on Community Development, Youth and Sports, declined from 2.921 per cent in 2005 to 2.896 per cent in 2006 ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Despite record job creation, lower unemployment rate, record investments, and higher economic growth, from 2005 to 2006, the Number of Kindergarten Financial Assistance, Student Care Fee Assistance, and Home Ownership Plus Education Scheme cases, grew by 20, 5 and 5 per cent, respectively.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In contrast, the Number of destitutes in Government Funded Homes and the percentage of Employed Among Total Employable Disabled Registered with Bizlink, declined by 0.5 and 24 per cent, respectively.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The above statistics may raise the question as to whether the 8.2 per cent growth in GDP from $194 to $210 billion from 2005 to 2006, has filtered through enough to lower-income needy Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p><strong>Homeless Singaporeans</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://theonlinecitizen.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/homeless-1a.jpg?w=220&amp;h=170" border="5" alt="" width="200" height="150" align="right"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I was also quite alarmed and saddened to read in media reports, that the homeless accounted for 10 per cent of the 4,157 calls received by the new ComCare hotline, in November and December, according to MCYS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">How many Singaporeans are homeless ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the launch of the unofficial shelter for the homeless spearheaded by MCYS and the HDB last year, how may Singaporeans have been housed by it ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to the Straits Times article, “Help the kids of families in distress” on <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">18 January, 2008</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, there are no homeless people in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, because the state provides shelter for them :</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“For example, no one is homeless in </span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, because this society long ago decided that all Singaporeans should have a roof over their heads, regardless of ability to earn an income. The state builds and funds shelters for those who have nowhere to live”.</span></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Elderly/ST_IMAGES_JECOST.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="200" height="150" align="left"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> At the announcement of the setting up of the ComCare Fund on </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">19 January 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, it was said that the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) handled 35,000 hardship cases in 2004, granting almost $ 40 million in assistance. (”New fund to keep the needy afloat - Govt to channel aid through CDCs as they know the ground best”, ST, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Jan 20, 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why is it that it would appear that about two years later in 2006, according to MCYS, the amount of assistance given out has only increased by 70 per cent, against an increase of 157 per cent in the number of needy families?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In September 2007, a press statement from the CDCs, in conjunction with its tenth anniversary, said that they managed to give out $45.7 million in the form of food rations, vouchers and bursaries to help the less fortunate last year. In the same year, more than 51,000 families and individuals received social assistance via the CDCs – more than four times the number of cases assisted in 2001.</span></p>
              <p><strong>MCYS vs CDC statistics - why the discrepancy?<br></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="150" height="200" align="right"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">With reference to the article “ComCare has spent $68m to help 90,000 individuals, families” (ST, Feb 7, 2007), which said that: <em>“So far, 90,000 individuals and families have benefited through ComCare and a total of $68 million has been committed to help the country’s disadvantaged”</em>, why does the MCYS past statistics appear to be different from the CDCs’ current statistics - $68 million to 90,000 beneficiaries (MCYS) against $45.7 million to 51,000 beneficiaries (CDCs) ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The per beneficiary financial assistance as computed from the above statistics is $1,143 a year in 2004, $756 in 2006 according to MCYS data, and $896 in 2006 according to CDCs’ data.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, about 3 months after the CDCs data was announced in conjunction with its tenth anniversary, the MCYS “numbers made available to The Straits Times show”, according to the article:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Govt aid for the needy triples to $140m: Amount, up from $50m six years ago, is likely to be raised further given the rising cost of living”, (ST, Jan 25). </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“The amount the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports spends on the needy has increased nearly threefold over the past six years - from about $50 million in March 2002 to about $140 million now”.</span></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Charity%20F1%20or%20F9/ThePoor-2.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="147" height="136" align="right"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"> Since “Thanks to a greater diversity of schemes, the number of individuals and families helped also soared from 15,000 in 2002 to 64,000 early last year”, the assistance per beneficiary person or family was $1,047 ($67 million divided by 64,000 beneficiaries) last year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">This amount ($1,047) is lower than the amount ($1,143)</span> computed from the data announced at the setting up of the ComCare Fund on <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">19 January 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">. So, despite more help for the needy and inflation, why does the average assistance amount appears to have declined by about 8 per cent from 2004 to 2007?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I am quite confused - MCYS’s announcement reported in the media last year was $68 million to 90,000 beneficiaries - and now it is $67 million to 64,000 beneficiaries?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Even using the latest available figure of 64,000 beneficiaries, it means that spending still only increased by 346 per cent against an increase of 327 per cent from 2002 to 2007.</span></p>
              <p><strong>GST hike to help the poor?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor2rs.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="150" height="200" align="left"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I also refer to the article “GST hike adds $990m to govt revenue so far” (BT, Jan 23) and media reports about the Parliamentary debate on </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">22 January, 2008</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">If “about 180 destitute persons are “committed to welfare homes annually”, why is it that according to MCYS’s “Singapore Social Statistics In Brief”, the “number of destitutes in government funded homes” declined from 1,738 to 1,726 from 2005 to 2006?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Also, since “there are now about 1,750 residents in the 10 welfare homes”, why is it that the number of destitute residents appears to have increased by only 24 persons (1,726 to 1,750), from 2006 to 2007?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since inflation started to rise rapidly almost immediately after the GST was increased in July, why is it that after about 6 months, “A review is currently ongoing and is to be completed at the end this year”?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the PA sum was not pegged to inflation rates - and MCYS was monitoring the impact of escalating costs on Singapore’s poor – the ministry monitors the cost of items which the typical PA recipient will need, and a review is currently ongoing and is likely to be completed this year, why is it taking so long to do a “currently ongoing review” when “the Ministry was monitoring the impact of escalating costs on Singapore’s poor” all along?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I would like to suggest that this review be given a sense of greater urgency, as the financial plight of these PA receipients may by rising by the month, with inflation hitting a 25-year high.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to “For the first nine months of last year, $1.1 million was disbursed to 6,514 cases”, does it mean that only an average of $169 ($1.1 million divided by 6,514 cases) was disbursed to each case for 9 months?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Does it mean that there was an average of about 2 cases (6,514 cases divided by over 3,000 PA receipients) of PA receipients requiring extra help?</span></p>
              <p><strong>One year for review to increase PA by $23?<br></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor3rs.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="220" height="170" align="right"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Against the estimated $1.98 billion a year from the two-percentage point hike in Goods and Services tax, , for which the reason given for the hike was to help the poor, acceding to MPs Seah Kian Peng and Halimah Yacob’s request to increase the PA allowance by only $23 a month from $290 to $313, is only 828,000 ($23 x 12 months x 3,000 PA receipients), which is only 0.04 per cent of the $1.98 billion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other countries, schemes for the needy are almost invariably always adjusted for inflation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, I would like to suggest that our financial assistance schemes be automatically indexed for inflation, just like public transport fares are adjusted for inflation in the fare increase formula.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When was the last time the $ 1,500 monthly household income criteria generally used for financial assistance revised ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I try to put myself in the shoes of the over 3,000 Singaporeans on Public Assistance, and I think they may find it hard to understand why it takes more than a year to conduct an “ongoing review” to pay them just $23 more a month, when they are reeling from the effects of high inflation. </span></p>

              <p>The success of Singapore's development has drawn much discussions among scholars (Nyaw and Chan, 1982; Pang, 1985; Lira 1988; Chng, Low and Toh, 1988; Lee 1996b). However, amid its modern structures and clean streets some Singaporeans are living in poverty. Certain groups of people, such as the working poor, have been left out of the success of the city state. Others have concluded that income and racial inequality have risen (Pang, 1975; Islam and Kirkpatrick, 1986; Lee, 1992; 1995a; 1995b; 1996a). Like many industrialized and affluent societies, public policy in Singapore has not been successful in eradicating such social ills. As Singapore's population ages, elderly with inadequate financial resources will likely slip into poverty. The state strongly upholds meritocracy, and only provides education and training to enable its citizen to achieve in society. Individual economic well-being is entirely dependent upon an individual's efforts. Hence, in comparison to other affluent societies, Singapore has very little to offer in terms of social assistance to those living in or near poverty.(1) Little is known of Singapore's poor and for that matter how Singapore deals with them. This article examines the changing nature and causes of poverty in Singapore and the anti-poverty measures that are in place.</p>

              <p>The 1995 General Household Survey shows that Singapore has a population of about 3 million people of which 79% of the population were Chinese, 14% Malay and 6% Indian. Government officials acknowledge that Malays are over represented in the bottom of the Singapore economy. In terms of income, a 1991 survey showed that 45.8% of working Malays earned between S$200-S$599 per month, while only 29.7% and 38.3% of Chinese and Indians, respectively, were in this income bracket (Chiew, 1991). More recent statistics show that about 30% of working Malays are in the income bracket of below S$500-S$999 per month compared to 19% and 25%</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Affluent Singapore feels pinch of inflation at 26-year highs</span></h1>
              <p><br><br>Singapore (ANTARA News) - From taking fewer taxi rides to eating out less and shortening shower time, residents of affluent Singapore are trying to cope with inflation, which has soared to 26-year highs.<br><br>Rising costs of housing, food, and transport have eaten into family budgets of Singaporeans as well as the large number of expatriates working in the city-state, consumers and analysts said.<br><br>Except for the ultra-rich, the impact of the sharp price increases has cut across social classes in one of Asia's wealthiest nations, they said.<br><br>Government figures show Singapore's annual inflation was at 6.7 percent in March, the highest since 1982, boosted by higher costs of food, transport, communications and housing.<br><br>The figure is more than double the inflation rate in Malaysia and higher than that of the Philippines, Hong Kong and Australia. Unlike bigger countries in the region, Singapore imports most of its needs.<br><br>"When the inflation rate is high, it affects everybody," said Serena, a businesswoman who lives near the prime Orchard Road shopping and would only give her first name.<br><br>Serena said even affluent families like hers have had to adjust to the rising costs by eyeing grocery prices more closely, using the car less and eating in fancy restaurants only on special occasions.<br><br>"You have to differentiate between needs and wants, what is necessary and what is not necessary. If you can get something cheaper, you don't have to go for branded (luxury) items," she told AFP.<br><br>While soaring inflation in developing countries, amid a global food crisis, has left many struggling to feed their families, Singaporeans are dealing with the impact of price hikes in their own ways.<br><br>For Janice Tan, 35, who works at a travel agency, the soaring prices have forced members of her family to shower only once a day to cut their water bill.<br><br>Water used to rinse vegetables is recycled to flush the toilet.<br><br>To reduce the electric bill, Tan said she told her maid to iron only office clothes -- and just the parts that are visible.<br><br>"It's a big deal for Singapore in that we have never had inflation higher than three percent," said Euston Quah, head of the economics division at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>"It hits the poor badly because the poor spend maybe 40, 50 percent of their income on food," he said.<br><br>Quah sees inflation eventually easing to around 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year, while the government has forecast 2008 economic growth forecast of 4.0 to 6.0 percent.<br><br><br><strong>Harder for those earning less</strong><br><br>Amin Sorr, 65, who works with a shipping firm, said life has become harder, especially for those earning less.<br><br>With a monthly salary of 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,200 US), Sorr said he can cope, but friends pulling in 2,000 dollars or less are struggling.<br><br>"I know a lot of friends who have problems with their water bills... and even personal credit lines."<br><br>Local charities say rising food prices are also driving more Singaporeans, especially poor senior citizens, to join queues for free meals.<br><br>Salamah Salim, 40, who runs a food stall on the fringes of the business district, said: "Our expenses on food and rice have more than doubled over the past year. Rice and oil have risen tremendously."<br><br>Even expatriate professionals, particularly those with less generous housing allowances and other benefits, have been hit.<br><br>As apartment rents surged, some moved their families from condominiums that come with swimming pools, gyms and barbecue pits to cheaper government-built flats without such resort-style amenities.<br><br>"They raised our rent by 150 percent after our contract expired late last year," said a Filipino computer engineer, who transferred from a gated condominium to a government-built high-rise in the suburbs.<br><br>"I know several friends who have also made similar moves or are planning to move out once their leases expire," he said, requesting anonymity.<br><br>Dee Pritchard, who works at the Australian International School, said that except for being more careful with the grocery shopping and giving the children fewer treats, nothing much has changed in her lifestyle.<br><br>"I'm lucky I'm not in the lower income (group) which would be suffering a lot more than I do really. But at the end of the week, the cash is less. There is less savings." (*)</p>

              <p>Singapore, the only Southeast Asian country to avert a recession during the Asian Crisis, became the only Southeast Asian country to fall into a recession, or to quote the Trade &amp; Industry Ministry on 18 May 2001, a “technical recession”. The city-state enjoyed a prolonged period of economic growth between 1986 and 1997 averaging 8.6 percent per annum. However, after the Asian financial crisis, Singapore’s GDP is more volatile -</p>
              <p><img src="http://amrc.org.hk/files/Image/alu01.gif" alt="" width="279" height="214"></p>
              <p>According to quarterly reports by the government, unemployment has been steadily increasing in the run up to the recession. By June 2001, unemployment had reached 3.4 percent, breaching the internationally accepted unemployment level of three percent. The official unemployment rate worsened to 4.7 percent in December 2001, the highest in 15 years, as companies retrenched workers. The rate exceeds the 4.4 percent recorded in December 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. The Manpower Research and Statistics Department published a report, Labour Market 2001, in March 2002 in which the overall unemployment rate was projected to reach about 5.5 - six percent by the second half of 2002. The record rate of six percent was in March 1986 resulting from a recession.1</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the cost of living in Singapore has not been reduced by much even in the economic downturn. During the second half of 2001, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5 percent for households in the lowest 20 percent income group but fell by 0.3 percent for the top 20 percent income group. For households in the middle 60 percent income group, the CPI remained stable in this period. Households in the lowest 20 percent and middle 60 percent income groups registered lower inflation rates of 1.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively in 2001, the rises being due to dearer cooked food and higher electricity tariffs. The CPI for households in the top 20 percent income group dipped by 0.2 percent in 2001, due largely to lower car prices.2 In a study done by the Relocation Journal &amp; Real Estate News in August 2000, Singapore was the fifth most expensive city to live in after New York, Seoul, Tokyo, and London.</p>
              <p>It is with this backdrop that one should understand the wage situation and the impact on workers. Except for unionised companies in Singapore, there is no legal minimum wage. Therefore there is really no jurisdiction over how much an employer should pay an employee or offer a job-seeker.</p>
              <p>Between an employer and employee, there exists a contract of service and the terms and conditions cannot run contrary to the Employment Act, which stipulates the minimum standards for an employee, e.g. overtime, annual leave, and maternity benefit, but nothing governs the actual salary that should be paid to an employee, apart from compensation calculations in the Third Schedule of the Employment Act and that employees who earn more than S$1,600 (US$869)3 are not entitled to overtime etc.</p>
              <p>In unionised corporations, the minimum wage is spelt out in a collective agreement (CA) between company and union, legally endorsed and renewed once every two to three years. It also provides for an annual increment, being negotiable on an annual basis after National Wages Council (NWC) recommendations. But if the company can prove that it is not doing too well, any agreed increment can be smaller or even waived for the year, and the CA can be re-negotiated before it expires. There is also an Industrial Arbitration Court if employers refuse to up salaries in the CA to a reasonable level.</p>
              <p>However, wage negotiations between employer and union rest on the employer’s right to a final say, and typically in Singapore, success rests much on the usual day to day ‘good relations’ between employers and unions, that help foster the possibility of securing better benefits for workers. Direct confrontation between employer and employees, using the courts, is generally frowned upon.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower in December 2001 backed a call from the NWC for severe restraint or cuts in wages. Citing worsening economic conditions and uncertainty in 2002, the government urged companies to freeze or cut wages in the city-state’s worst recession yet. A survey quoted in the Straits Times revealed that 18 percent of Singapore-based companies had already frozen pay levels in 2001 and 28 percent planned to do so in 2002. During the financial crisis in 1998, the NWC asked workers to accept wage cuts of between five and eight percent.</p>
              <p>At the height of the 1998 financial crisis, the government announced a blanket policy of cutting the employers’ share of monthly Central Provident Fund (CPF) payments to employees from 20 percent to 10 percent. This policy was aimed as a cost saving package to revive the economy but it placed the burden on ordinary wage earners and not on the state’s coffers. This 10 percent cut was applied to all companies regardless of profitability and financial situation. It penalised workers even in companies that were breaking profit records. Overnight, many workers had trouble keeping up their mortgage payments that were serviced through the CPF. Instead they had to dig into their salaries to make up the difference. There was a public outcry and some quick fix measures were assembled to assist those who were unable to continue paying mortgages.</p>
              <p>It was then that the NWC recommended the monthly variable component (MVC), to allow companies to adjust monthly wage bills quickly to remain competitive and minimise job losses. This move exempted the government from involvement and becoming the target of bad publicity and collective unhappiness of the workers whose wages are cut. Over the years the number of companies that use the MVC has increased and wages in general have become more flexible. For instance the variable component of total wages was 15-16 percent in 2000 compared to 11 percent in 1997. The Ministry of Manpower is now seeking to speed up the implementation of the MVC even further and to promote performance-based pay structures to replace seniority-based systems. In addition, other components of the employment benefits system, including implementing medical co-payment and changing retrenchment compensation so that companies have greater flexibility in managing wage costs.</p>
              <p>The central issue in introducing and operating the MVC is how to define a justifiable cut in each industry, especially in large MNCs where profit transfer between countries could be easily carried out. Since financial situations and management capabilities vary from company to company, it is unclear whether the Ministry of Manpower and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) are sufficiently informed about the technical details of industries to function as a watchdog against unjust wage-cuts or to set out intelligent guidelines for a MVC cut.</p>
              <p>Major concerns are, how much to allow companies/government to cut the MVC? How to calculate and define a cut? Does a well managed economy require frequent MVC wage-cut to rank and file workers to keep employment levels? Can a company convert part of a worker’s present salary into MVC?</p>
              <p>As cited earlier, Singapore is the fifth most expensive city to live in. Of all components of cost, workers’ wages are not the highest contributing cost factor. Workers’ wage levels have actually fallen behind other Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. If factors other than workers’ wages are the biggest contributors to high costs, it is not logical to pursue wage cuts as a priority. More should be done to lower government charges and duties.</p>
              <p>There is a concern that adjusting the workers’ wage structure for the sake of keeping business costs low may be abused, leaving workers more vulnerable. For instance, it is not usual for government wage surveys to show that since the Asian crisis wage growth has reached pre-crisis levels. However a comparison of pay increases of rank-and-file employees shows that throughout the 1990s average annual wage growth declined from eight to ten percent in the early half to between five and seven percent in the latter. This is largely due to attempts to keep business costs down, and wage cuts are one way of doing this.</p>
              <p>Employers are suspected of using the economic crisis as an excuse to restrain wage increases, creating an employer’s market. For instance, the starting salary of university graduates in the latter half of 2001 fell to pre-1997 secondary school-leaver levels. Without a minimum wage, employers, even when making profits, can offer graduates salaries below what used to be the graduate benchmark of $1,600.</p>
              <p>Wage issues remain problematic as they are not regulated by law. The NTUC is said to play a pragmatic role, but a tame one in the perception of some. Part of the problem is that the NTUC is aligned with the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and therefore its independence is questionable. Changes arising from economic restructuring, which included job cuts and new forms of employment relationships, are unsettling workers and testing worker-employer relations. But the PAP wants to deepen the tripartite partnership between its administration, the employers, and the NTUC, to preserve ‘harmonious’ industrial relations.</p>
              <p>The push for more MVC is in the name of minimising retrenchment in a volatile economy. The increasing attack on wages is explained in part as a result of a drop in workers’ productivity. So workers are presented as receiving less wages because they are less productive and not because the PAP administration has introduced a policy that penalises workers first.</p>
              <p>The MVC is a political solution to a political problem. It is of no help in saving jobs at all. It is unclear whether MNCs will stay in Singapore simply because they can cut wage costs by five to ten percent when wages constitute less than ten percent of total costs to most MNCs. Such cuts are increasingly painful for workers when the CPI does not fall in the same period. If workers’ wages are cut by more than ten percent without corresponding reductions in other living costs, more people will find it difficult to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>A thorough review of all other aspects of the Employment Act is thus urgently required to meet the fast changing job environment. It is worrisome that historically the government has a tendency to chant policies that favour large MNCs and government linked companies (GLC) and ignores the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Tremendous efforts have to be made to regain the balance where SMEs can co-exist with MNCs and GLCs for a more balanced and sustainable economy.</p>
              <p>Because Singapore is small, housing space, land use, transportation, water, and electric supply, must become more efficient. But they are increasingly costly and without subsidies. Additionally, health care, education, food, and recreation are also becoming expensive. There is increasing public pressure to review policies to include further concessions on state subsidies and relief.</p>
              <p>With increasing anxiety to make ends meet, more workers are treated for depression as Singapore slips into its deepest recession. The Institute of Mental Health reports that the number of patients has almost doubled since April 2001. Psychiatrists confirm that more people are now treated for depression. Men, especially 30 to 49 year-olds, feel the most heat in the current economic meltdown.</p>
              <p>The government has long rejected the notion of a welfare state, preferring short-term incentives to those in need to avoid relying on welfare. In Singapore, families shoulder part of the responsibility and more than 260 private welfare organisations take up the rest, some aided by public money. However the challenge is for the government to provide a safety net for people when the global economy is volatile, impacting the local one, and family and community support is gradually being eroded.</p>
              <p>In the run up to the general election in November 2001, the government announced budget measures that included tax relief and rebates for conservation charges and utilities. To boost PAP chances in the elections it introduced New Singapore Shares which is essentially a staggered cash handout. However, such rebates and handouts are not efficient ways to redistribute accumulated state wealth and are not targeted to reduce basic household needs or to create jobs. Most see them as short-term stop gap measures motivated by electoral politics.</p>
              <p>There has been some decentralised and delegated social service through the government administered Community Development Councils (CDC) aimed at identifying and helping the poor. Short-term loan schemes have also been introduced. The budget for CDCs grew from S$19 million in 1997 to S$153 million in 2001, largely due to social assistance schemes. But eligibility for government assistance is stringent so as not to encourage a dependence mentality. The Ministry of Community Development and Sports, together with other agencies link short-term financial assistance closely with job counselling, job seeking, training, and placement.</p>
              <p>However, short-term assistance is generally judged as not guaranteeing that the unemployed can become economically stable. Job placement services have on many occasions not been successful. A Jobs Task Force has been set up to give training, job assistance, and counselling to those affected by economic restructuring. There have also been promises of jobs in new ‘growth areas’. But what ‘growth areas’ are, how many they will employ, and when, is not clear. Areas such as wafer fabrication and biotechnology that were celebrated as the way forward are high-tech and need specialists so their contribution to job creation is questionable. The promise that more Singaporean companies operating world-wide will facilitate Singaporeans to work overseas is also speculative. Most Singaporean companies overseas are GLCs and it is unclear how good they are at creating new jobs at home.</p>
              <p>In this context, there is a need to review the CPF scheme, to ensure that in addition to providing members with adequate savings for housing, medical, and retirement, that there is a scheme where some form of social security is available for sudden job loss and a means to tide over times when jobs are scarce. In the absence of new jobs for older and retrenched workers, rules need relaxing to allow the growth of a ‘regulated informal sector’. Singaporean workers need to be able to operate from home to keep costs down and at the same time to be gainfully employed to make a contribution to the economy and society.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Specifically, there are two risks in Australian banks. First, they
                  depend far too much on wholesale funding. Something like 60 percent of
                  bank funding in that country comes from debt markets, and almost half
                  of that figure comes from international debt markets (which is an
                  increasingly meaningless distinction). According to the IMF, Australian
                  banks <span style="color: #ff0000;">have $222billion in sh</span>ort-term debt which must be turned over
                  every 90 days. Admittedly, these are banks with far fewer stresses than
                  your average Icelandic bank, say, but with short-term credit markets
                  studying their collective navel for a month or three, turning over that
                  debt at anything other than usurious terms is going to be effing hard.
                  In short, the Australian banks have a mismatch between their funding
                  and their obligations, and as we have learned to our collective dismay,
                  that sort of things bites when you least like it.</p>
              <p>The second
                  problem with Australian banks is their reliance on mortgages. Over the
                  last twenty years debt has gone from less than half of average income
                  in the country to more like 1.5 times income. At the same time housing
                  affordability remains crummy, and the country's housing prices have
                  gone into a second boom without correcting for one back in 2002. So,
                  what if house prices fall, which isn't inconceivable given how far
                  they've run in recent years, and given a global recession banging on
                  the door (which will hit Australia harder than it thinks, despite the
                  absurd mantra there that "what China doesn't buy, India will")? A 15%
                  decline in house prices would, according to the IMF, increase defaults
                  to 2 percent, but that strikes me as low given what we're seeing
                  elsewhere, and given a weakening economy. What about a 25% decline and
                  a long-ish recession? The numbers change dramatically.</p>

              <p><strong>MCYS vs CDC statistics - why the discrepancy?<br></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">With reference to the article “ComCare has spent $68m to help 90,000 individuals, families” (ST, Feb 7, 2007), which said that: <em>“So far, 90,000 individuals and families have benefited through ComCare and a total of $68 million has been committed to help the country’s disadvantaged”</em>, why does the MCYS past statistics appear to be different from the CDCs’ current statistics - $68 million to 90,000 beneficiaries (MCYS) against $45.7 million to 51,000 beneficiaries (CDCs) ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The per beneficiary financial assistance as computed from the above statistics is $1,143 a year in 2004, $756 in 2006 according to MCYS data, and $896 in 2006 according to CDCs’ data.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, about 3 months after the CDCs data was announced in conjunction with its tenth anniversary, the MCYS “numbers made available to The Straits Times show”, according to the article:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Govt aid for the needy triples to $140m: Amount, up from $50m six years ago, is likely to be raised further given the rising cost of living”, (ST, Jan 25).</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“The amount the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports spends on the needy has increased nearly threefold over the past six years - from about $50 million in March 2002 to about $140 million now”.</span></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Charity%20F1%20or%20F9/ThePoor-2.jpg" alt="" width="147" height="136"> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since “Thanks to a greater diversity of schemes, the number of individuals and families helped also soared from 15,000 in 2002 to 64,000 early last year”, the assistance per beneficiary person or family was $1,047 ($67 million divided by 64,000 beneficiaries) last year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">This amount ($1,047) is lower than the amount ($1,143)</span> computed from the data announced at the setting up of the ComCare Fund on <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">19 January 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">. So, despite more help for the needy and inflation, why does the average assistance amount appears to have declined by about 8 per cent from 2004 to 2007?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I am quite confused - MCYS’s announcement reported in the media last year was $68 million to 90,000 beneficiaries - and now it is $67 million to 64,000 beneficiaries?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Even using the latest available figure of 64,000 beneficiaries, it means that spending still only increased by 346 per cent against an increase of 327 per cent from 2002 to 2007.</span></p>
              <p><strong>GST hike to help the poor?</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor2rs.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I also refer to the article “GST hike adds $990m to govt revenue so far” (BT, Jan 23) and media reports about the Parliamentary debate on</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">22 January, 2008</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">If “about 180 destitute persons are “committed to welfare homes annually”, why is it that according to MCYS’s “Singapore Social Statistics In Brief”, the “number of destitutes in government funded homes” declined from 1,738 to 1,726 from 2005 to 2006?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Also, since “there are now about 1,750 residents in the 10 welfare homes”, why is it that the number of destitute residents appears to have increased by only 24 persons (1,726 to 1,750), from 2006 to 2007?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since inflation started to rise rapidly almost immediately after the GST was increased in July, why is it that after about 6 months, “A review is currently ongoing and is to be completed at the end this year”?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the PA sum was not pegged to inflation rates - and MCYS was monitoring the impact of escalating costs on Singapore’s poor – the ministry monitors the cost of items which the typical PA recipient will need, and a review is currently ongoing and is likely to be completed this year, why is it taking so long to do a “currently ongoing review” when “the Ministry was monitoring the impact of escalating costs on Singapore’s poor” all along?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I would like to suggest that this review be given a sense of greater urgency, as the financial plight of these PA receipients may by rising by the month, with inflation hitting a 25-year high.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to “For the first nine months of last year, $1.1 million was disbursed to 6,514 cases”, does it mean that only an average of $169 ($1.1 million divided by 6,514 cases) was disbursed to each case for 9 months?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Does it mean that there was an average of about 2 cases (6,514 cases divided by over 3,000 PA receipients) of PA receipients requiring extra help?</span></p>
              <p><strong>One year for review to increase PA by $23?<br></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor3rs.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="170"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Against the estimated $1.98 billion a year from the two-percentage point hike in Goods and Services tax, , for which the reason given for the hike was to help the poor, acceding to MPs Seah Kian Peng and Halimah Yacob’s request to increase the PA allowance by only $23 a month from $290 to $313, is only 828,000 ($23 x 12 months x 3,000 PA receipients), which is only 0.04 per cent of the $1.98 billion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other countries, schemes for the needy are almost invariably always adjusted for inflation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, I would like to suggest that our financial assistance schemes be automatically indexed for inflation, just like public transport fares are adjusted for inflation in the fare increase formula.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When was the last time the $ 1,500 monthly household income criteria generally used for financial assistance revised ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I try to put myself in the shoes of the over 3,000 Singaporeans on Public Assistance, and I think they may find it hard to understand why it takes more than a year to conduct an “ongoing review” to pay them just $23 more a month, when they are reeling from the effects of high inflation.</span></p>

              <p>The success of Singapore's development has drawn much discussions among scholars (Nyaw and Chan, 1982; Pang, 1985; Lira 1988; Chng, Low and Toh, 1988; Lee 1996b). However, amid its modern structures and clean streets some Singaporeans are living in poverty. Certain groups of people, such as the working poor, have been left out of the success of the city state. Others have concluded that income and racial inequality have risen (Pang, 1975; Islam and Kirkpatrick, 1986; Lee, 1992; 1995a; 1995b; 1996a). Like many industrialized and affluent societies, public policy in Singapore has not been successful in eradicating such social ills. As Singapore's population ages, elderly with inadequate financial resources will likely slip into poverty. The state strongly upholds meritocracy, and only provides education and training to enable its citizen to achieve in society. Individual economic well-being is entirely dependent upon an individual's efforts. Hence, in comparison to other affluent societies, Singapore has very little to offer in terms of social assistance to those living in or near poverty.(1) Little is known of Singapore's poor and for that matter how Singapore deals with them. This article examines the changing nature and causes of poverty in Singapore and the anti-poverty measures that are in place.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The 1995 General Household Survey shows that Singapore has a population of about 3 million people of which 79% of the population were Chinese, 14% Malay and 6% Indian. Government officials acknowledge that Malays are over represented in the bottom of the Singapore economy. In terms of income, a 1991 survey showed that 45.8% of working Malays earned between S$200-S$599 per month, while only 29.7% and 38.3% of Chinese and Indians, respectively, were in this income bracket (Chiew, 1991). More recent statistics show that about 30% of working Malays are in the income bracket of below S$500-S$999 per month compared to 19% and 25%</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Affluent Singapore feels pinch of inflation at 26-year highs</span></h1>
              <p><br><br>&lt;!-- google_ad_section_start --&gt;Singapore (ANTARA News) - From taking fewer taxi rides to eating out less and shortening shower time, residents of affluent Singapore are trying to cope with inflation, which has soared to 26-year highs.<br><br>Rising costs of housing, food, and transport have eaten into family budgets of Singaporeans as well as the large number of expatriates working in the city-state, consumers and analysts said.<br><br>Except for the ultra-rich, the impact of the sharp price increases has cut across social classes in one of Asia's wealthiest nations, they said.<br><br>Government figures show Singapore's annual inflation was at 6.7 percent in March, the highest since 1982, boosted by higher costs of food, transport, communications and housing.<br><br>The figure is more than double the inflation rate in Malaysia and higher than that of the Philippines, Hong Kong and Australia. Unlike bigger countries in the region, Singapore imports most of its needs.<br><br>"When the inflation rate is high, it affects everybody," said Serena, a businesswoman who lives near the prime Orchard Road shopping and would only give her first name.<br><br>Serena said even affluent families like hers have had to adjust to the rising costs by eyeing grocery prices more closely, using the car less and eating in fancy restaurants only on special occasions.<br><br>"You have to differentiate between needs and wants, what is necessary and what is not necessary. If you can get something cheaper, you don't have to go for branded (luxury) items," she told AFP.<br><br>While soaring inflation in developing countries, amid a global food crisis, has left many struggling to feed their families, Singaporeans are dealing with the impact of price hikes in their own ways.<br><br>For Janice Tan, 35, who works at a travel agency, the soaring prices have forced members of her family to shower only once a day to cut their water bill.<br><br>Water used to rinse vegetables is recycled to flush the toilet.<br><br>To reduce the electric bill, Tan said she told her maid to iron only office clothes -- and just the parts that are visible.<br><br>"It's a big deal for Singapore in that we have never had inflation higher than three percent," said Euston Quah, head of the economics division at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>"It hits the poor badly because the poor spend maybe 40, 50 percent of their income on food," he said.<br><br>Quah sees inflation eventually easing to around 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year, while the government has forecast 2008 economic growth forecast of 4.0 to 6.0 percent.<br><br><br><strong>Harder for those earning less</strong><br><br>Amin Sorr, 65, who works with a shipping firm, said life has become harder, especially for those earning less.<br><br>With a monthly salary of 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,200 US), Sorr said he can cope, but friends pulling in 2,000 dollars or less are struggling.<br><br>"I know a lot of friends who have problems with their water bills... and even personal credit lines."<br><br>Local charities say rising food prices are also driving more Singaporeans, especially poor senior citizens, to join queues for free meals.<br><br>Salamah Salim, 40, who runs a food stall on the fringes of the business district, said: "Our expenses on food and rice have more than doubled over the past year. Rice and oil have risen tremendously."<br><br>Even expatriate professionals, particularly those with less generous housing allowances and other benefits, have been hit.<br><br>As apartment rents surged, some moved their families from condominiums that come with swimming pools, gyms and barbecue pits to cheaper government-built flats without such resort-style amenities.<br><br>"They raised our rent by 150 percent after our contract expired late last year," said a Filipino computer engineer, who transferred from a gated condominium to a government-built high-rise in the suburbs.<br><br>"I know several friends who have also made similar moves or are planning to move out once their leases expire," he said, requesting anonymity.<br><br>Dee Pritchard, who works at the Australian International School, said that except for being more careful with the grocery shopping and giving the children fewer treats, nothing much has changed in her lifestyle.<br><br>"I'm lucky I'm not in the lower income (group) which would be suffering a lot more than I do really. But at the end of the week, the cash is less. There is less savings." (*)</p>

              <p>Singapore, the only Southeast Asian country to avert a recession during the Asian Crisis, became the only Southeast Asian country to fall into a recession, or to quote the Trade &amp; Industry Ministry on 18 May 2001, a “technical recession”. The city-state enjoyed a prolonged period of economic growth between 1986 and 1997 averaging 8.6 percent per annum. However, after the Asian financial crisis, Singapore’s GDP is more volatile -</p>
              <p><img src="http://amrc.org.hk/files/Image/alu01.gif" alt="" width="279" height="214"></p>
              <p>According to quarterly reports by the government, unemployment has been steadily increasing in the run up to the recession. By June 2001, unemployment had reached 3.4 percent, breaching the internationally accepted unemployment level of three percent. The official unemployment rate worsened to 4.7 percent in December 2001, the highest in 15 years, as companies retrenched workers. The rate exceeds the 4.4 percent recorded in December 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. The Manpower Research and Statistics Department published a report, Labour Market 2001, in March 2002 in which the overall unemployment rate was projected to reach about 5.5 - six percent by the second half of 2002. The record rate of six percent was in March 1986 resulting from a recession.1</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the cost of living in Singapore has not been reduced by much even in the economic downturn. During the second half of 2001, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5 percent for households in the lowest 20 percent income group but fell by 0.3 percent for the top 20 percent income group. For households in the middle 60 percent income group, the CPI remained stable in this period. Households in the lowest 20 percent and middle 60 percent income groups registered lower inflation rates of 1.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively in 2001, the rises being due to dearer cooked food and higher electricity tariffs. The CPI for households in the top 20 percent income group dipped by 0.2 percent in 2001, due largely to lower car prices.2 In a study done by the Relocation Journal &amp; Real Estate News in August 2000, Singapore was the fifth most expensive city to live in after New York, Seoul, Tokyo, and London.</p>
              <p>It is with this backdrop that one should understand the wage situation and the impact on workers. Except for unionised companies in Singapore, there is no legal minimum wage. Therefore there is really no jurisdiction over how much an employer should pay an employee or offer a job-seeker.</p>
              <p>Between an employer and employee, there exists a contract of service and the terms and conditions cannot run contrary to the Employment Act, which stipulates the minimum standards for an employee, e.g. overtime, annual leave, and maternity benefit, but nothing governs the actual salary that should be paid to an employee, apart from compensation calculations in the Third Schedule of the Employment Act and that employees who earn more than S$1,600 (US$869)3 are not entitled to overtime etc.</p>
              <p>In unionised corporations, the minimum wage is spelt out in a collective agreement (CA) between company and union, legally endorsed and renewed once every two to three years. It also provides for an annual increment, being negotiable on an annual basis after National Wages Council (NWC) recommendations. But if the company can prove that it is not doing too well, any agreed increment can be smaller or even waived for the year, and the CA can be re-negotiated before it expires. There is also an Industrial Arbitration Court if employers refuse to up salaries in the CA to a reasonable level.</p>
              <p>However, wage negotiations between employer and union rest on the employer’s right to a final say, and typically in Singapore, success rests much on the usual day to day ‘good relations’ between employers and unions, that help foster the possibility of securing better benefits for workers. Direct confrontation between employer and employees, using the courts, is generally frowned upon.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower in December 2001 backed a call from the NWC for severe restraint or cuts in wages. Citing worsening economic conditions and uncertainty in 2002, the government urged companies to freeze or cut wages in the city-state’s worst recession yet. A survey quoted in the Straits Times revealed that 18 percent of Singapore-based companies had already frozen pay levels in 2001 and 28 percent planned to do so in 2002. During the financial crisis in 1998, the NWC asked workers to accept wage cuts of between five and eight percent.</p>
              <p>At the height of the 1998 financial crisis, the government announced a blanket policy of cutting the employers’ share of monthly Central Provident Fund (CPF) payments to employees from 20 percent to 10 percent. This policy was aimed as a cost saving package to revive the economy but it placed the burden on ordinary wage earners and not on the state’s coffers. This 10 percent cut was applied to all companies regardless of profitability and financial situation. It penalised workers even in companies that were breaking profit records. Overnight, many workers had trouble keeping up their mortgage payments that were serviced through the CPF. Instead they had to dig into their salaries to make up the difference. There was a public outcry and some quick fix measures were assembled to assist those who were unable to continue paying mortgages.</p>
              <p>It was then that the NWC recommended the monthly variable component (MVC), to allow companies to adjust monthly wage bills quickly to remain competitive and minimise job losses. This move exempted the government from involvement and becoming the target of bad publicity and collective unhappiness of the workers whose wages are cut. Over the years the number of companies that use the MVC has increased and wages in general have become more flexible. For instance the variable component of total wages was 15-16 percent in 2000 compared to 11 percent in 1997. The Ministry of Manpower is now seeking to speed up the implementation of the MVC even further and to promote performance-based pay structures to replace seniority-based systems. In addition, other components of the employment benefits system, including implementing medical co-payment and changing retrenchment compensation so that companies have greater flexibility in managing wage costs.</p>
              <p>The central issue in introducing and operating the MVC is how to define a justifiable cut in each industry, especially in large MNCs where profit transfer between countries could be easily carried out. Since financial situations and management capabilities vary from company to company, it is unclear whether the Ministry of Manpower and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) are sufficiently informed about the technical details of industries to function as a watchdog against unjust wage-cuts or to set out intelligent guidelines for a MVC cut.</p>
              <p>Major concerns are, how much to allow companies/government to cut the MVC? How to calculate and define a cut? Does a well managed economy require frequent MVC wage-cut to rank and file workers to keep employment levels? Can a company convert part of a worker’s present salary into MVC?</p>
              <p>As cited earlier, Singapore is the fifth most expensive city to live in. Of all components of cost, workers’ wages are not the highest contributing cost factor. Workers’ wage levels have actually fallen behind other Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. If factors other than workers’ wages are the biggest contributors to high costs, it is not logical to pursue wage cuts as a priority. More should be done to lower government charges and duties.</p>
              <p>There is a concern that adjusting the workers’ wage structure for the sake of keeping business costs low may be abused, leaving workers more vulnerable. For instance, it is not usual for government wage surveys to show that since the Asian crisis wage growth has reached pre-crisis levels. However a comparison of pay increases of rank-and-file employees shows that throughout the 1990s average annual wage growth declined from eight to ten percent in the early half to between five and seven percent in the latter. This is largely due to attempts to keep business costs down, and wage cuts are one way of doing this.</p>
              <p>Employers are suspected of using the economic crisis as an excuse to restrain wage increases, creating an employer’s market. For instance, the starting salary of university graduates in the latter half of 2001 fell to pre-1997 secondary school-leaver levels. Without a minimum wage, employers, even when making profits, can offer graduates salaries below what used to be the graduate benchmark of $1,600.</p>
              <p>Wage issues remain problematic as they are not regulated by law. The NTUC is said to play a pragmatic role, but a tame one in the perception of some. Part of the problem is that the NTUC is aligned with the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and therefore its independence is questionable. Changes arising from economic restructuring, which included job cuts and new forms of employment relationships, are unsettling workers and testing worker-employer relations. But the PAP wants to deepen the tripartite partnership between its administration, the employers, and the NTUC, to preserve ‘harmonious’ industrial relations.</p>
              <p>The push for more MVC is in the name of minimising retrenchment in a volatile economy. The increasing attack on wages is explained in part as a result of a drop in workers’ productivity. So workers are presented as receiving less wages because they are less productive and not because the PAP administration has introduced a policy that penalises workers first.</p>
              <p>The MVC is a political solution to a political problem. It is of no help in saving jobs at all. It is unclear whether MNCs will stay in Singapore simply because they can cut wage costs by five to ten percent when wages constitute less than ten percent of total costs to most MNCs. Such cuts are increasingly painful for workers when the CPI does not fall in the same period. If workers’ wages are cut by more than ten percent without corresponding reductions in other living costs, more people will find it difficult to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>A thorough review of all other aspects of the Employment Act is thus urgently required to meet the fast changing job environment. It is worrisome that historically the government has a tendency to chant policies that favour large MNCs and government linked companies (GLC) and ignores the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Tremendous efforts have to be made to regain the balance where SMEs can co-exist with MNCs and GLCs for a more balanced and sustainable economy.</p>
              <p>Because Singapore is small, housing space, land use, transportation, water, and electric supply, must become more efficient. But they are increasingly costly and without subsidies. Additionally, health care, education, food, and recreation are also becoming expensive. There is increasing public pressure to review policies to include further concessions on state subsidies and relief.</p>
              <p>With increasing anxiety to make ends meet, more workers are treated for depression as Singapore slips into its deepest recession. The Institute of Mental Health reports that the number of patients has almost doubled since April 2001. Psychiatrists confirm that more people are now treated for depression. Men, especially 30 to 49 year-olds, feel the most heat in the current economic meltdown.</p>
              <p>The government has long rejected the notion of a welfare state, preferring short-term incentives to those in need to avoid relying on welfare. In Singapore, families shoulder part of the responsibility and more than 260 private welfare organisations take up the rest, some aided by public money. However the challenge is for the government to provide a safety net for people when the global economy is volatile, impacting the local one, and family and community support is gradually being eroded.</p>
              <p>In the run up to the general election in November 2001, the government announced budget measures that included tax relief and rebates for conservation charges and utilities. To boost PAP chances in the elections it introduced New Singapore Shares which is essentially a staggered cash handout. However, such rebates and handouts are not efficient ways to redistribute accumulated state wealth and are not targeted to reduce basic household needs or to create jobs. Most see them as short-term stop gap measures motivated by electoral politics.</p>
              <p>There has been some decentralised and delegated social service through the government administered Community Development Councils (CDC) aimed at identifying and helping the poor. Short-term loan schemes have also been introduced. The budget for CDCs grew from S$19 million in 1997 to S$153 million in 2001, largely due to social assistance schemes. But eligibility for government assistance is stringent so as not to encourage a dependence mentality. The Ministry of Community Development and Sports, together with other agencies link short-term financial assistance closely with job counselling, job seeking, training, and placement.</p>
              <p>However, short-term assistance is generally judged as not guaranteeing that the unemployed can become economically stable. Job placement services have on many occasions not been successful. A Jobs Task Force has been set up to give training, job assistance, and counselling to those affected by economic restructuring. There have also been promises of jobs in new ‘growth areas’. But what ‘growth areas’ are, how many they will employ, and when, is not clear. Areas such as wafer fabrication and biotechnology that were celebrated as the way forward are high-tech and need specialists so their contribution to job creation is questionable. The promise that more Singaporean companies operating world-wide will facilitate Singaporeans to work overseas is also speculative. Most Singaporean companies overseas are GLCs and it is unclear how good they are at creating new jobs at home.</p>
              <p>In this context, there is a need to review the CPF scheme, to ensure that in addition to providing members with adequate savings for housing, medical, and retirement, that there is a scheme where some form of social security is available for sudden job loss and a means to tide over times when jobs are scarce. In the absence of new jobs for older and retrenched workers, rules need relaxing to allow the growth of a ‘regulated informal sector’. Singaporean workers need to be able to operate from home to keep costs down and at the same time to be gainfully employed to make a contribution to the economy and society.</p>

              <p><span>The image of Singapore is one of expensive cars, shopping malls, mobile phones and consumers cruising fancy boutiques but this is not the reality for thousands without education or skills.</span></p>
              <p><span>After 9.9 percent growth last year, Singapore slumped into recession even before the September 11 attacks on the United States and is expected to stay in negative terrain until at least the middle of next year.</span></p>
              <p><span>Unemployment is likely to hit 4.5 percent by the end of this year and the country of four million people has been told to brace for a deep, long recession.</span></p>
              <p><span>The long-ruling People's Action Party (PAP) effectively won another term last week as the splintered opposition contested only 29 of 84 seats for the November 3 poll.</span></p>
              <p><span>But the opposition is making jobs, healthcare and the cost of living into an issue as hard times encroach on all segments of society through corporate layoffs, restructuring and mergers.</span></p>
              <p><span>The gap between the haves and have-nots is getting wider, underscored by the fact that some 70 percent of Singaporeans do not pay income tax because they earn less than the minimum taxable income or else come in for other benefits.</span></p>
              <p><span>Poverty is relative and can mean a loss of security -- like the white collar worker who has lost a steady job and is having difficulty meeting basic expenses.</span></p>
              <p><span>"It is a relativistic definition which relates poverty not only to physical needs but also to the norms and expectations of society," said James Gomez of the Workers' Party.</span></p>
              <p><span>He said some economists argue that the island nation, while having attained a first world per capita income, has an income structure closer to that of a third world country.</span></p>
              <p><span>Strapped for cash, thousands lined up for hours last week to get some relief from the S$2.7 billion in New Singapore Shares handed out by the government as part of a S$11.3 billion stimulus package to help</span></p>

              <p><strong>Homeless Singaporeans</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://theonlinecitizen.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/homeless-1a.jpg?w=220&amp;amp;h=170" alt="" width="200" height="150"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I was also quite alarmed and saddened to read in media reports, that the homeless accounted for 10 per cent of the 4,157 calls received by the new ComCare hotline, in November and December, according to MCYS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">How many Singaporeans are homeless ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the launch of the unofficial shelter for the homeless spearheaded by MCYS and the HDB last year, how may Singaporeans have been housed by it ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to the Straits Times article, “Help the kids of families in distress” on <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">18 January, 2008</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, there are no homeless people in</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, because the state provides shelter for them :</span></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“For example, no one is homeless in</span></em> <em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, because this society long ago decided that all Singaporeans should have a roof over their heads, regardless of ability to earn an income. The state builds and funds shelters for those who have nowhere to live”.</span></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Elderly/ST_IMAGES_JECOST.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150"> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the announcement of the setting up of the ComCare Fund on</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">19 January 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, it was said that the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) handled 35,000 hardship cases in 2004, granting almost $ 40 million in assistance. (”New fund to keep the needy afloat - Govt to channel aid through CDCs as they know the ground best”, ST,</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Jan 20, 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why is it that it would appear that about two years later in 2006, according to MCYS, the amount of assistance given out has only increased by 70 per cent, against an increase of 157 per cent in the number of needy families?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In September 2007, a press statement from the CDCs, in conjunction with its tenth anniversary, said that they managed to give out $45.7 million in the form of food rations, vouchers and bursaries to help the less fortunate last year. In the same year, more than 51,000 families and individuals received social assistance via the CDCs – more than four times the number of cases assisted in 2001.</span></p>
