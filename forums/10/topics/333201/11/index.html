              <h3><a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporeshortstories.blogspot.com/2008/04/ricing-rising-cost.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">‘Ricing’ (Rising) cost</span></a></h3>
              <div>The topic of ‘Rice’ hogged the headlines of local news this week following its soaring price all over Asia, including Singapore.<br><br>Reasons for the increase in price boils down to these three main factors:<br><br>1) Higher fuel costs, with crude soaring above US $100 a barrel and threatening to stay that way, have been a major factor in the crisis, making fertilizer more expensive and increasing transport costs.<br>2) In Southeast Asia, disease, pests and an unparalleled 45-day cold snap that extended from China to Vietnam in January and February have also hurt harvests. Flooding in the Philippines and Vietnam has added to the growing crisis.<br>3) Medium-grade rice exported from Thailand, the world’s biggest rice exporter, reached $760 a metric ton, up from $360 a ton at the end of last year.<br><br>Singaporeans, including me are feeling the pinch when we witness our forking of extra few hard-earned dollars for the same kilogram of rice.<br><br>Some hawkers in Singapore may also be capitalising on this surge of rice price to increase the price of their rice dishes by a few cents. I patron regularly a food stall which sell reasonably-priced ‘chap chai ben’ but now for the same few dishes and the same amount of rice, the hawker charges me an additional 20 cents!<br><br>I asked the hawker why the price increases, he replied me that it was ‘a natural thing’ to do and he had ‘no choice’ but to increase his price following the surge in price of rice.<br><br>Well, he certainly has other alternatives, not all the hawkers in Singapore are increasing the prices of their rice dishes to defray the rising cost of rice. This hawker is certainly killing his business and disappointing his ‘loyal customer’ by his price-increase feat. I would think twice before buying food from him again in future.<br><br>How apt is the man’s lament ‘This rising, that rising’ in the recent ad by the retailer Courts.<br><br>Meanwhile, governments of rice importing countries, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, are expressing concern that rising prices could spark unrest.</div>

              <div id="post-body-8497671" class="body">
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>During the past three years, the four top host countries - Australia, Canada, US and New Zealand - reported an upsurge of Singaporean permanent residents.</strong><br><br></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>Australia<br>2001 - 1,786<br>2002 - 2,064 (up 15.5%)<br>2003 - 2,656 (up 28.6%)<br>Canada<br>2001 - 666<br>2003 - 991 (up 49%)<br>USA<br>2000 - 671<br>2002 - 1,036 (up 54.4%)<br>New Zealand<br>2001 - 437<br>2002 - 278 (down 30%)<br>2003 - 369 (up 32.7%)</strong><br><br>Most are the "desirable" graduates that large, under-populated countries like Australia and Canada prefer.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The majority worries about the long-term prospects of living in a city, however developed, whose small size restricts opportunities and ambitions with a hectic pace of life.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Some are concerned about job security and their children's future. Other push factors are strong government control and a relative lack of personal liberties.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Population shift is not unique to Singapore, but outward migration poses a special problem because of national service (NS).</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">It depends on its "people's" army to defend itself. In any war, these reservists who have served 2½ years' training, become frontline soldiers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Foreigners don't undergo NS and, it is feared, lack the commitment and training to defend Singapore.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">For most, a complete uprooting is not the objective. They want a foreign PR but without abandoning their citizenship. Few are ready to burn bridges.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Some 60% select Australia because of its nearness to home. It serves as job insurance. It is unclear how many who are given these PRs actually migrate.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The government has moved to try to draw benefits from a bad situation. It has formed "Singapore clubs" in many receiving cities to tap these people to help develop the business ties.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The desire to leave appears to be growing. One migration consultant told the Straits Times that he was receiving at least 20 enquiries a day, twice the number in 2001. They included Singaporeans who held high-paying jobs.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">"We get people in their 30s, holding good jobs but terribly worried about restructuring and retrenchment," said the manager.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Others are 40-plus professionals who find it hard to get meaningful jobs.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">A former lawyer who moved to Sydney to do his masters in public health said he wanted to get out of the rat race. "In Singapore, you have to work so hard to save up a retirement sum. By the time you manage to save that amount, will you be in any shape to enjoy it?"</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The government finds itself caught in a bind. The more Singaporeans leave, the more foreigners it has to bring in to close the gap, which in turn contributes to the exodus.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The newspapers and Internet are reflecting some of the resentment and worry about foreign workers.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">A few are lashing out in blind fury at foreign PRs, ranging from medal-winning sportsmen to students.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">One frequent complaint is the giving of perks to foreign PRs at the expense of locals, including exemption from national service, scholarship and housing subsidy.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Some Singaporeans want the government to distinguish between naturalised citizens (with full rights) and PRs, who should have no more than residential rights until they become citizens.<br>The authorities reject this. They want more, not less, foreign talent because it fills skills that Singapore's new high-tech investors need.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Last week, Singapore's economy shed a strong ray of light in a long dark tunnel. The first quarter GDP grew by a strong 7.3%, three times the previous rate, catching even the government by surprise. It augurs well for next year or two.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">What will happen from now? It is hoped it will resemble what happened to Taiwan and Hong Kong in the 1990s, when large numbers who had fled to the West out of worries about China, flocked back when their economies took off.</span></span></p>

By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Sep 6, 2008</span></span></span></em></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">A BAFFLING aspect of affluent Singapore, with all its economic finery, is the large – and growing – exodus of its citizens over the past 10 years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">While the hot economy has attracted more than a million foreigners to its shores, its own citizens have been leaving in record numbers to settle down abroad.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Their exit seemed to have taken on a new life in recent years, ironically when the economic growth and the job market were at their best.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In fact, one survey has placed Singapore’s outflow at 26.11 migrants per 1,000 citizens – the second highest in the world. Only Timor Leste (51.07) fares worse.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The explanation is, of course, globalisation, the new borderless economy, which is offering more job options for skilled Singaporeans who want a better life in bigger countries.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">But the reason doesn’t end there.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Other comparable city-populations have similarly been affected, but Singapore seems to have been hit hardest of all.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The explanation must involve a higher non-economic priority strong enough to propel Singaporeans away from a stable, comfortable living towards the uncertainties of a new life elsewhere.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Yet this is what is happening, as new statistics have shown.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">More educated Singaporeans – many taking their children with them – are leaving or are planning to leave their country, which is itself a traditional haven for outsiders fleeing from trouble.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">A recent indication of the scope of the dilemma was the rising number of Singaporeans who asked for a document needed to apply for permanent residency overseas.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">It has exceeded 1,000 a month to reach 12,707 last year from 4,996 in 1998, or a rise of 170% over 10 years, said Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">These people, over the age of 16, could be leaving for good, but they also included students and businessmen, who may eventually return.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">In 10 years, they totalled 97,990 Singaporeans (a far greater number if children were included).</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The government says about 140,000 Singaporeans are studying, working or in business in foreign countries, which by itself is not a bad thing, given Singapore’s global ambitions. The trouble is many of them may not return.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">All the current statistics point to an upward emigration among Singaporeans who apply for PR or citizenship abroad. Some of the PRs, it is feared, may keep their citizenship but have no intention of returning home.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">“After coming back, I find that other countries have much more to offer than Singapore, which is very boring,” one youth remarked.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The number of Singaporeans who gave up their citizenship, Wong said, averaged 1,000 a year in the last three years.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Other negative trends that reflect the tenuous link between many citizens and their country are:</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">* Two-thirds of Singaporeans (aged 21-34) said in a survey that they had considered retiring in another country with a slower pace of life and lower cost of living.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">* Among youths (15-29 years of age), 53% are considering emigration. Despite having gone through national education, 37% say they are not patriotic. (Indian youths are the most ready to emigrate – at 67%, compared with 60% of Malays and 49% of Chinese).</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">* Six out of 10 undergraduates said they wanted to go abroad to live or work, mostly to enjoy a higher quality of life with less stress.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">* An ACNielsen poll showed 21% of Singaporeans, mainly professionals, were considering emigration, half opting for Australia and New Zealand.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">For this small state with a short history, the steady exit is not just a ‘numbers’ problem which can be – and is being – resolved by substituting Singaporeans with foreigners.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">It has a serious security dimension, since the island is defended by its own reservist soldiers after a two-year mandatory national service (NS).</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Fewer true-blue Singaporeans means fewer soldiers because permanent residents are not required to serve NS (only their 18-year-old sons are).</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">A bigger impediment to nation-building is the looser physical bond between today’s generation of Singaporeans and their country. Nearly half of them do not think they need to reside here to be emotionally rooted to the country.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">It is estimated that half the Singaporeans who annually apply for foreign PRs – 6,000 to 7,000 – eventually settle down overseas.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">The brain drain is serious.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Even if 0.5% of its brightest minds were to leave, it would hit Singapore hard, said Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">“These are bright young people, children of very well-educated Singaporeans. They study overseas now, and the very good ones are right away green harvested by companies,” Goh said.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">So why is Asia’s second wealthiest state losing its youths at a higher rate than its poorer neighbours?</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">“Many Singaporeans leave because of the stifling atmosphere of the country and the political and intellectual lock-step enforced by the government,” said one analyst.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">“It would reverse if the government would begin to democratise, and to allow its people to develop their talents – in Singapore, not abroad.”</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Importing large numbers of migrants from China and India, most of whom treat it as a study or transit point, is not a solution.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew once admitted: “They come in here, they get an English education ? and they're off to America.”</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;">However, he seems resigned to it. Recently he told his political party youth members: “As a government, and personally for me and my colleagues, my responsibility is to look after those who cannot migrate.”</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">With one-third of the population now making up of foreigners, that task is becoming harder to achieve.</span></span></p>

              <p><em>It has been a new spring that left me with mixed feelings about what it really means to be a native-born Singaporean. I realised that two of my cousins' families have migrated without saying a word or leaving any contacts. One has gone to the United States and the other to Australia after living in Hong Kong for two years.</em></p>
              <p><em>Why are so many middle-aged university-educated professional Singaporeans leaving? Is it the National Service, our education system or the changes in our society that are pushing them away? Has the influx of foreign "talents" from India and China made them feel that being citizens count for very little nowadays or is it the pull of greener pastures where life is less pressurised and less stressful?</em></p>
              <p><em>That my cousins left quietly the soil where they were born and educated without any fanfare or leaving any form of contacts can only mean one thing - they are cutting all ties with their motherland for good. Are our policies inadvertently driving our own talents away while taking in foreigners as new citizens? This vicious cycle cannot be good for Singapore.</em></p>
              <p>2. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/98956print.asp"><span style="color: #993311;">Brain drain in our backyard</span></a> (3 Feb 2006)</p>
              <p><em>While visiting relatives in the United States and Canada, I had the opportunity to chat with some elderly Asians, including Singaporeans. Most migrated when they were in their 20s and 30s, and they never looked back. Why should they when they are well taken of in terms of healthcare and welfare?</em></p>
              <p><em>I know of some young people who choose to remain there after their studies. Most secure good jobs and do not encounter any discrimination at work. They have no intention of returning to Singapore, and it is not because they do not miss home or want to cut ties with their motherland. One reason is they find it difficult to adapt to our environment when they have a lot of breathing space where they are now. Also, they do not wish to compete with much sought-after foreign talent in Singapore. We must not be over-zealous in our pursuit of foreign talent that we lose sight of our own people. Persuading one local talent not to leave Singapore is far better than encouraging two or three foreign talents to come here.</em></p>

              <p><em>I refer to the letter, "Puzzle of migrating S'poreans' (Feb 2). I'm 38 and am migrating to Australia in three months' time. Despite being a degree-holder armed with 10 years of working experience, having upgraded my skills a year ago and lowered my pay expectations, I still have not found a job for almost two years. I have tried switching careers but have not met an employer willing to give me a chance to even start from the bottom.</em></p>
              <p><em>My brother and his family emigrated to New Zealand six years ago and have no intention of coming back. He disliked the work stress, government policies and the education system here.</em></p>
              <p><em>In short, gloomy job prospects for the middle-aged and professionals, work stress and an inflexible education system are driving us out of Singapore.</em></p>
              <p>4. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/99388print.asp"><span style="color: #993311;">Can you blame them for leaving?</span></a> (6 Feb 2006)</p>
              <p><em>A hopeful graduate, fresh from his victory in the educational system, may be in for a rude shock when he discovers that the job market - with its plentiful supply of foreign talent - is not prepared to pay him enough for a decent lifestyle. When setting up a family, most couples will learn that the house they buy will probably cost them a lifelong mortgage. The middle-aged professionals, when they are retrenched, will have to decide whether to "upgrade" themselves - taking up menial jobs despite their immense experience in white-collared posts - or to throw their savings into entrepreneurship, for which the chances of success are slim.</em></p>
              <p><em>Unemployment fell to a low of 2.5 per cent last quarter. However, wages have yet to recover to the level they were at in the previous cycle. In other words, jobs were created but at lower value added as a whole. The private sector has been asked not to discriminate based on age when hiring, yet public organisations continue to recruit based on age limits.</em></p>
              <p><em>The biggest issue may be the refusal to acknowledge that the problems exist - let alone working on solving them. Given such an environment, is it any wonder that some Singaporeans choose to migrate? As I hear someone saying in a coffeeshop say: "Stayers are people who do not have the means to quit!"</em></p>
              <p><em>If Singaporeans feel that they are not given priority over foreign talent because they are more expensive, would it not be natural for them to seek greener pastures elsewhere? Many qualified Singaporeans have given up good jobs here and moved to countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States in their families because they think these countries can offer a better quality of life. In the 1940s and '50s, our forebears left their homes and came here to seek a better life. Likewise, Singaporeans may choose to emigrate to escape the ratrace and tough competition for jobs.</em></p>

              <p><em>I refer to the letter, "Gloomy job prospects for the middle-aged professionals" (Feb 4-5). I am 32 and am considering emigrating to Australia for good. Although I am not quite a middle-aged professional, I am getting there very soon. I agree with previous writers on their views about the prospect of living in Singapore getting gloomier.</em></p>
              <p><em>Some say that Singapore will eventually develop into a more creative society. For now however, there are many middle-aged professionals who are jobless at the same time. Others speak of Singapore's grand policies and "vision" to be a creative society. Having the experience of both as a professional and an educator, I have first-hand experience that such grand visions do not translate into real practice.</em></p>
              <p><em>It is sad to admit that the only "stayers" are the ones who are tied down by their families and dependents, and not passion. The "leavers", like myself, are the ones who will be separated from their family and loved ones, in search for the truly creative society and place.</em></p>
              <p>- My comments : well, what do you think I'm doing staying here in Singapore? (and continuing to blog on such "gloom and doom" topics all this while). I'm now 33 and on my way to falling into similar circumstances as the other 30+ folks above. My friends and colleagues are mostly in a similar age range and we share some of the same concerns. What irony. Software R&amp;D engineers - we're supposed to be doing pretty well - at least, in theory. But, at least for myself, the reality is just that I'm biding my time. Most likely, I can't (won't? shouldn't?!) stay here forever. The only questions remaining now are money and timing. I'm working on the money part, and my blog entries chronicle the timing part somewhat.</p>
              <p>And, in response to Akikonomu's recent comment, of course I don't buy the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/191855/1/.html"><span style="color: #993311;">happy talk</span></a> of achieving some "European standard of living".

              <p>In the next 25 years, global peak oil would have long arrived and gone by. Game over, one way or another.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A Singaporean speaks:</span></strong></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://kitana.wordpress.com/2006/09/19/why-i-would-like-to-leave/"><strong><span style="color: #0b6d90;">Why I Would Like to Leave</span></strong></a>, by Kitana</p>
              <p><span>Before I went to Canada for a year, I had to go for a medical check-up. During that check-up, the doctor told me that I would love Canada. And he had said that most of the people he knew that went to Canada, either never came back; or when they did, they’d returned to Canada shortly after. Few ever stayed in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span>At the time, I wondered why. I don’t anymore.</span></p>
              <p><span>The government asks us why we leave. They calls us quitters and deserters, for leaving our country, our homeland, for some other place that we perceive to be greener pastures. Why leave Singapore, where we rank tops for good governance (save for voice and accountability, where we scored a low of 38.2% this year), where we are so clean and safe and secure, and where we are so <em>efficient</em>?</span></p>
              <p><span>The fact of the matter is, that there are people who will give up all of the above, for more freedom.</span></p>
              <p><span>I was happy in Canada. Sure, it was expensive, and taxes were a killer. With a 14% combination of GST and PST on all consumer items, and income taxes hitting a high of 40%; it was definitely difficult to make ends meet for someone who did not work there. And of course, on days where the buses went on strike, I’d be stuck in campus and not be able to go to town. Also, we did have a bit of a furor when Parliament was dissolved late last year, only to have the Conservatives voted in after 13 years under the Liberals. Oh and before I forget, yes it was definitely more inefficient. Expect to wait when you queue up to pay for something; the cashier will inevitably engage everyone before you as to how their day was (and their kids, and their parents, and what they think of the weather; etc). Expect to wait for the buses because the bus driver might have stopped somewhere to grab a cup of Starbucks while doing his rounds (yes, with passengers in the bus). Oh, and how can I forget the drug problem: you can get drugs anywhere off the street if you know where to look; marijuana is about as commonplace as cigarettes and alcohol.</span></p>
              <p><span>But for all the possible gripes that I might have about that place, the benefits far outweighed all the detriments (if you even saw them as that) combined. Firstly, we were <em>really</em> free. I’m not just talking about freedom with regard to political freedom to vote, to protest, to strike, to demonstrate, or to have a point of view; but also real freedom of the mind and the body. You can think differently, dress differently, live differently. Society is <em>inclusive</em>.</span></p>
              <p><span>The city that I lived in had a whole mix of races and nationalities. I’ve met everyone from locals to the Koreans, Japs and Chinese, Iranians, Iraqis, Philippinos, Latin Americans, French, Africans, Indians etc etc etc. It’s as much a cultural mix, if not more so, than Singapore. And the best part is: everyone more or less gets along. There is no need for the implementation of “Racial Harmony Day” or racial quotas for HDB flats. Everyone just does – because prejudice just does not exist there.</span></p>
              <p><span>And it wasn’t just about race and religion; you could be a conservative or a liberal, be it cerebral or waist-down. It didn’t matter. Such criteria was just not a measure of your worth. You could be thin or fat. It didn’t matter too. People weren’t as image-conscious. You could walk down the streets dressed in goth punk outfits with multiple piercings in your face and people would still talk to you normally, and not avoid you. And in Village area, men held hands with men; they kissed on buses, and no one even batted an eye lid.</span></p>
              <p><span>In Singapore, can you comprehend this inclusiveness? The majority of Singaporeans are notably close-minded and inflexible. Even if a straight couple were to kiss on the bus, there would be chitters regarding the offensiveness of public displays of affection. When the gay community wishes to throw a party, they get turned down because the overly-conservative majority decides that this is a justification for the prevention of AIDS. Singapore is one of the few countries, if not the only, where drug trafficking attracts a mandatory death penalty, such that the courts do not even have the discretion to pardon the poor 18 year old Nigerian who became a drug mule without him realizing the folly of his error.</span></p>
              <p><span>If you decide to stage a demonstration, you require a permit that will always be turned down on the vague notions of security; if you support a party other than the one in power, you risk getting asked for your particulars and photographed. If you hold a view other than the one in the local papers (which is so effectively-controlled, all for the sake of “the national interest”), you are forced to keep that view to yourself. If you attempt to post that view up on a platform, such as a blog, you might be sent a warning letter especially with a threat of defamation. If you decide to print out that view and distribute it on a phamplet, you may get investigated under s 151 of the Penal Code. Oh, and you can’t do podcasts with political content, unless you are the party in power.</span></p>
              <p><span>In Singapore, besides the overwhelming humidity, there is a notorious lack of personal space. There are too many people in Singapore. It’s so difficult to find a place which isn’t swarming with people. The roads are full of cars, the buses are packed to full capacity at various times of the day; Raffles Place strikes me as a factory churning out goods as people chope seats with tissue packets on busy lunch hours. And everyone is always in a rush. There is always this inane need to do something, be somewhere, get caught up in this inexplicable rat race, and just work and work and work until you succeed… and then realize that you don’t even know what the fuck ‘success’ really means.</span></p>
              <p><span>The stress is crazy; the pressure unfightable. It starts from the time we enter primary school; the education system does prepare us for the real world in that sense – we get exposed to pressure cooker type stress and a level of competition that makes having a life outside of academia almost impossible, unlike in other countries whose universities also produce Nobel laureates. Our parents push us, our schools push us; society pushes us… And our goal is this:</span></p>
              <p><span>Money. Money and the economy.</span></p>
              <p><span>In Singapore, this is the definition of the good life. Some people may subscribe to religion as what defines a good life, particularly in reaction to the imposition of money as the new god; but for the most part, Singaporeans are a consumeristic and materialistic lot. So many girlfriends see the Mango and Zara sales as the defining point of their lives; or believe that sipping lychee martinis at Zouk Wine Bar is the epitome of class. Everyone wants to get more money, buy more items, be more powerful; be it career success or material possession, this is all that most Singaporeans dream of and spend their entire lives clamouring towards.</span></p>
              <p><span>And this works great for Singapore, because all of Singapore’s objectives are geared towards only 1 thing and one thing alone: money. Or in the case of this country, the economy. Everything we do, we do it for the sake of our economy. We have no minimum wage; we have no protection against the ills that globalization necessarily brings us. We have no protection for the rising income equality (all we have is an article in the newspapers telling us to disbelieve the Gini-coefficient), we have no solutions for our elderly except to either dump them in Johor or Batam, or to encourage our young to bring more babies into this pressure cooker life.</span></p>
              <p><span>Someone told me that this was not a bad thing. Because we have different races and religions, the economy is the one thing that can unite us. I told him that he was a mere subject of years of successful indoctrination. He talked like just another average Singaporean.</span></p>
              <p><span>“Money unites us.”</span></p>
              <p><span>In a country where I would like to live, it is not money, but dreams that unite. Dreams that transcend the material; dreams of ideals of maybe caring for a family; caring for the environment within which we live; dreams of bettering oneself, or dreams or learning for the sake of learning; dreams to be whatever I want to be; that unite people.</span></p>
              <p><span>In Singapore, it is difficult to dream. Difficult to dream of anything beyond the material. I don’t wish for a future where I am stuck in my dead end job wondering what the fuck I want in my life. I don’t want a future where I die to myself, murder my idealism and my dreams of being different, simply because ‘different’ is a bad word in Singapore.</span></p>
              <p><span>And because Singapore is not a place where such dreams flourish, Singapore is just not a place where I envision myself realizing these dreams.</span></p>
