              <blockquote>Last month NAB reported a 10.7 per cent slump in full-year cash
              earnings to $3.9 billion, mainly due to a $1 billion provision for
              troubled collaterised debt obligations that contributed to a trebling
              in the bad debt expense from $790 million to $2.5 billion.</blockquote>

              <p>Singapore, the only Southeast Asian country to avert a recession during the Asian Crisis, became the only Southeast Asian country to fall into a recession, or to quote the Trade &amp; Industry Ministry on 18 May 2001, a “technical recession”. The city-state enjoyed a prolonged period of economic growth between 1986 and 1997 averaging 8.6 percent per annum. However, after the Asian financial crisis, Singapore’s GDP is more volatile -</p>
              <p><img src="http://amrc.org.hk/files/Image/alu01.gif" alt="" width="279" height="214"></p>
              <p>According to quarterly reports by the government, unemployment has been steadily increasing in the run up to the recession. By June 2001, unemployment had reached 3.4 percent, breaching the internationally accepted unemployment level of three percent. The official unemployment rate worsened to 4.7 percent in December 2001, the highest in 15 years, as companies retrenched workers. The rate exceeds the 4.4 percent recorded in December 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. The Manpower Research and Statistics Department published a report, Labour Market 2001, in March 2002 in which the overall unemployment rate was projected to reach about 5.5 - six percent by the second half of 2002. The record rate of six percent was in March 1986 resulting from a recession.1</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the cost of living in Singapore has not been reduced by much even in the economic downturn. During the second half of 2001, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5 percent for households in the lowest 20 percent income group but fell by 0.3 percent for the top 20 percent income group. For households in the middle 60 percent income group, the CPI remained stable in this period. Households in the lowest 20 percent and middle 60 percent income groups registered lower inflation rates of 1.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively in 2001, the rises being due to dearer cooked food and higher electricity tariffs. The CPI for households in the top 20 percent income group dipped by 0.2 percent in 2001, due largely to lower car prices.2 In a study done by the Relocation Journal &amp; Real Estate News in August 2000, Singapore was the fifth most expensive city to live in after New York, Seoul, Tokyo, and London.</p>
              <p>It is with this backdrop that one should understand the wage situation and the impact on workers. Except for unionised companies in Singapore, there is no legal minimum wage. Therefore there is really no jurisdiction over how much an employer should pay an employee or offer a job-seeker.</p>
              <p>Between an employer and employee, there exists a contract of service and the terms and conditions cannot run contrary to the Employment Act, which stipulates the minimum standards for an employee, e.g. overtime, annual leave, and maternity benefit, but nothing governs the actual salary that should be paid to an employee, apart from compensation calculations in the Third Schedule of the Employment Act and that employees who earn more than S$1,600 (US$869)3 are not entitled to overtime etc.</p>
              <p>In unionised corporations, the minimum wage is spelt out in a collective agreement (CA) between company and union, legally endorsed and renewed once every two to three years. It also provides for an annual increment, being negotiable on an annual basis after National Wages Council (NWC) recommendations. But if the company can prove that it is not doing too well, any agreed increment can be smaller or even waived for the year, and the CA can be re-negotiated before it expires. There is also an Industrial Arbitration Court if employers refuse to up salaries in the CA to a reasonable level.</p>
              <p>However, wage negotiations between employer and union rest on the employer’s right to a final say, and typically in Singapore, success rests much on the usual day to day ‘good relations’ between employers and unions, that help foster the possibility of securing better benefits for workers. Direct confrontation between employer and employees, using the courts, is generally frowned upon.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower in December 2001 backed a call from the NWC for severe restraint or cuts in wages. Citing worsening economic conditions and uncertainty in 2002, the government urged companies to freeze or cut wages in the city-state’s worst recession yet. A survey quoted in the Straits Times revealed that 18 percent of Singapore-based companies had already frozen pay levels in 2001 and 28 percent planned to do so in 2002. During the financial crisis in 1998, the NWC asked workers to accept wage cuts of between five and eight percent.</p>
              <p>At the height of the 1998 financial crisis, the government announced a blanket policy of cutting the employers’ share of monthly Central Provident Fund (CPF) payments to employees from 20 percent to 10 percent. This policy was aimed as a cost saving package to revive the economy but it placed the burden on ordinary wage earners and not on the state’s coffers. This 10 percent cut was applied to all companies regardless of profitability and financial situation. It penalised workers even in companies that were breaking profit records. Overnight, many workers had trouble keeping up their mortgage payments that were serviced through the CPF. Instead they had to dig into their salaries to make up the difference. There was a public outcry and some quick fix measures were assembled to assist those who were unable to continue paying mortgages.</p>
              <p>It was then that the NWC recommended the monthly variable component (MVC), to allow companies to adjust monthly wage bills quickly to remain competitive and minimise job losses. This move exempted the government from involvement and becoming the target of bad publicity and collective unhappiness of the workers whose wages are cut. Over the years the number of companies that use the MVC has increased and wages in general have become more flexible. For instance the variable component of total wages was 15-16 percent in 2000 compared to 11 percent in 1997. The Ministry of Manpower is now seeking to speed up the implementation of the MVC even further and to promote performance-based pay structures to replace seniority-based systems. In addition, other components of the employment benefits system, including implementing medical co-payment and changing retrenchment compensation so that companies have greater flexibility in managing wage costs.</p>
              <p>The central issue in introducing and operating the MVC is how to define a justifiable cut in each industry, especially in large MNCs where profit transfer between countries could be easily carried out. Since financial situations and management capabilities vary from company to company, it is unclear whether the Ministry of Manpower and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) are sufficiently informed about the technical details of industries to function as a watchdog against unjust wage-cuts or to set out intelligent guidelines for a MVC cut.</p>
              <p>Major concerns are, how much to allow companies/government to cut the MVC? How to calculate and define a cut? Does a well managed economy require frequent MVC wage-cut to rank and file workers to keep employment levels? Can a company convert part of a worker’s present salary into MVC?</p>
              <p>As cited earlier, Singapore is the fifth most expensive city to live in. Of all components of cost, workers’ wages are not the highest contributing cost factor. Workers’ wage levels have actually fallen behind other Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. If factors other than workers’ wages are the biggest contributors to high costs, it is not logical to pursue wage cuts as a priority. More should be done to lower government charges and duties.</p>
              <p>There is a concern that adjusting the workers’ wage structure for the sake of keeping business costs low may be abused, leaving workers more vulnerable. For instance, it is not usual for government wage surveys to show that since the Asian crisis wage growth has reached pre-crisis levels. However a comparison of pay increases of rank-and-file employees shows that throughout the 1990s average annual wage growth declined from eight to ten percent in the early half to between five and seven percent in the latter. This is largely due to attempts to keep business costs down, and wage cuts are one way of doing this.</p>
              <p>Employers are suspected of using the economic crisis as an excuse to restrain wage increases, creating an employer’s market. For instance, the starting salary of university graduates in the latter half of 2001 fell to pre-1997 secondary school-leaver levels. Without a minimum wage, employers, even when making profits, can offer graduates salaries below what used to be the graduate benchmark of $1,600.</p>
              <p>Wage issues remain problematic as they are not regulated by law. The NTUC is said to play a pragmatic role, but a tame one in the perception of some. Part of the problem is that the NTUC is aligned with the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and therefore its independence is questionable. Changes arising from economic restructuring, which included job cuts and new forms of employment relationships, are unsettling workers and testing worker-employer relations. But the PAP wants to deepen the tripartite partnership between its administration, the employers, and the NTUC, to preserve ‘harmonious’ industrial relations.</p>
              <p>The push for more MVC is in the name of minimising retrenchment in a volatile economy. The increasing attack on wages is explained in part as a result of a drop in workers’ productivity. So workers are presented as receiving less wages because they are less productive and not because the PAP administration has introduced a policy that penalises workers first.</p>
              <p>The MVC is a political solution to a political problem. It is of no help in saving jobs at all. It is unclear whether MNCs will stay in Singapore simply because they can cut wage costs by five to ten percent when wages constitute less than ten percent of total costs to most MNCs. Such cuts are increasingly painful for workers when the CPI does not fall in the same period. If workers’ wages are cut by more than ten percent without corresponding reductions in other living costs, more people will find it difficult to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>A thorough review of all other aspects of the Employment Act is thus urgently required to meet the fast changing job environment. It is worrisome that historically the government has a tendency to chant policies that favour large MNCs and government linked companies (GLC) and ignores the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Tremendous efforts have to be made to regain the balance where SMEs can co-exist with MNCs and GLCs for a more balanced and sustainable economy.</p>
              <p>Because Singapore is small, housing space, land use, transportation, water, and electric supply, must become more efficient. But they are increasingly costly and without subsidies. Additionally, health care, education, food, and recreation are also becoming expensive. There is increasing public pressure to review policies to include further concessions on state subsidies and relief.</p>
              <p>With increasing anxiety to make ends meet, more workers are treated for depression as Singapore slips into its deepest recession. The Institute of Mental Health reports that the number of patients has almost doubled since April 2001. Psychiatrists confirm that more people are now treated for depression. Men, especially 30 to 49 year-olds, feel the most heat in the current economic meltdown.</p>
              <p>The government has long rejected the notion of a welfare state, preferring short-term incentives to those in need to avoid relying on welfare. In Singapore, families shoulder part of the responsibility and more than 260 private welfare organisations take up the rest, some aided by public money. However the challenge is for the government to provide a safety net for people when the global economy is volatile, impacting the local one, and family and community support is gradually being eroded.</p>
              <p>In the run up to the general election in November 2001, the government announced budget measures that included tax relief and rebates for conservation charges and utilities. To boost PAP chances in the elections it introduced New Singapore Shares which is essentially a staggered cash handout. However, such rebates and handouts are not efficient ways to redistribute accumulated state wealth and are not targeted to reduce basic household needs or to create jobs. Most see them as short-term stop gap measures motivated by electoral politics.</p>
              <p>There has been some decentralised and delegated social service through the government administered Community Development Councils (CDC) aimed at identifying and helping the poor. Short-term loan schemes have also been introduced. The budget for CDCs grew from S$19 million in 1997 to S$153 million in 2001, largely due to social assistance schemes. But eligibility for government assistance is stringent so as not to encourage a dependence mentality. The Ministry of Community Development and Sports, together with other agencies link short-term financial assistance closely with job counselling, job seeking, training, and placement.</p>
              <p>However, short-term assistance is generally judged as not guaranteeing that the unemployed can become economically stable. Job placement services have on many occasions not been successful. A Jobs Task Force has been set up to give training, job assistance, and counselling to those affected by economic restructuring. There have also been promises of jobs in new ‘growth areas’. But what ‘growth areas’ are, how many they will employ, and when, is not clear. Areas such as wafer fabrication and biotechnology that were celebrated as the way forward are high-tech and need specialists so their contribution to job creation is questionable. The promise that more Singaporean companies operating world-wide will facilitate Singaporeans to work overseas is also speculative. Most Singaporean companies overseas are GLCs and it is unclear how good they are at creating new jobs at home.</p>
              <p>In this context, there is a need to review the CPF scheme, to ensure that in addition to providing members with adequate savings for housing, medical, and retirement, that there is a scheme where some form of social security is available for sudden job loss and a means to tide over times when jobs are scarce. In the absence of new jobs for older and retrenched workers, rules need relaxing to allow the growth of a ‘regulated informal sector’. Singaporean workers need to be able to operate from home to keep costs down and at the same time to be gainfully employed to make a contribution to the economy and society.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: large; color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I</span></span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">T was three in the morning on a very cool Saturday. Most Singaporeans were fast asleep. So was a group of more than a dozen able-bodied men — some even snoring — on flattened cardboard boxes laid in neat rows. But unlike most of the Singaporeans who were asleep in the comfort of their homes, the group of men slept in the open — with the sky as their roof — in a secluded spot near the World Trade Centre Ferry Terminal. Most of them have been spending their nights there for the past year. They have named the place Heartbreak Hotel. Over at Toa Payoh housing estate, a thirtysomething married couple was cuddling each other under a bridge to keep themselves warm, amid the nearby tall and impressive apartment blocks. The spot under the bridge has been their home for the last one month. Like the group of men at the Heartbreak Hotel, they had rejection written all over their faces. Their meals are at coffee shops or food centres, while they answer nature's calls at public toilets. The group of men and the couple are part of the growing number of homeless in Singapore — once an unusual sight in the wealthy island of four million people. No official figures are available, but the numbers are certainly growing.</span></span></p>
              <p>Most are among the country's more than 100,000 residents who are currently unemployed, although one in the first group works as a cleaner at the Singapore General Hospital. But his monthly salary of S$600 (M$1340) is enough only for food and transport. Another member of the group owns a threeroom flat. But without a job for close to two years and without much savings, it was impossible for him to maintain the flat. He, instead, rents the flat out, and survives on the rental income of about S$700 a month.</p>
              <p>Given the absence of unemployment benefits and a lack of welfare aid, and nothing in their wallets, a growing number of Singaporeans are being forced to give up their homes and seek alternative accommodation. Also hit are those in the income bracket of S$400 a month. Their numbers, according to government data, stand at 180,650 workers or about nine per cent of the workforce. While many of the luckier ones have been able to move in with their relatives or to cheaper accommodation, there are a number that have been forced to seek shelter in the open — in parks, under bridges and vacant areas. The couple under the bridge, for instance, once had a three-room flat in the Toa Payoh Housing Estate. But since the husband lost his storekeeper job nearly three years ago, the couple had to endure life first without electricity and water, and subsequently their home. Most of the money that they received from the sale of their flats went back to their Central Provident Fund account, while the rest was used to pay for the utility bills. Like the couple, most Singaporeans have debts and are compelled to pay utility charges and mortgages on their homes each month.</p>
              <p>Given that most of the unemployed and those in the low-income bracket lack education and marketable skills, and are being frozen out of the worst job market in 17 years in a country with one of the most educated workforces in Asia, many other may soon share the fate of the couple and the residents of Heartbreak Hotel. The main reason: the country's lack of a social safety net, despite the immense wealth generated during the last three decades of prosperity. The Government does not believe in a welfare state and firmly discourages dependence on the Government. Only a few thousand people are considered poor enough to get a paltry benefit of between S$300 and S$400 per month — barely enough to live on, and that too after a tedious and long process. Instead, the Government insists that those who lack education and marketable skills retrain and upgrade their skills through its subsidised retraining programmes. Still, the presence of these homeless is posing a new problem for the Government, which is currently engrossed in seeking a solution to the country's worst economic problems in history caused by the exodus of manufacturers and multinationals to China and other low-cost regions such as Malaysia and India. A solution is needed.</p>

Each pillar at the bus interchange now as a permanent resident (PR). You ever wonder why the homeless sleep next to pillars....so that the tired people coming back from work don't step on them when they sleep. Since every pillar is now occupied, I wondered where a new homeless person would go. The Sunday Times has the answer....</p>

But you are wrong, while the rich get to watch "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lesmis.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Les Misérables</span></span></a>", the poor get to sleep in the underpass between Esplanade and the Citilink Mall at night. The Esplanade is indeed a very useful building both rich and poor people get to use it. <a rel="nofollow"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 376px; cursor: hand; height: 143px; text-align: center;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="109"></a>It seems <em>not all</em> the 'sleepers' are jobless. Why do people with jobs need to sleep in those places? The answer is very simple and logical. The real wages of some workers are now so low that after the numerous bouts of utilities increase, transport fare increase, and rental increases, there is hardly any choice but to sleep on streets. I would do it too if I make $900 a month because I can save $100 on transport because I sleep close to where I work, another $200 on rental and $50-$100 of utilities bill....in other words I can save half my income, by sleeping in public places.</p>
              <img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 267px; cursor: hand; height: 75px; text-align: center;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3ggmHJXXI/AAAAAAAAAO0/83Lp4F__PLg/s200/homeless3.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="62">As Singapore heads for top 1st world status, the cost of living can only rise relative to the wages of low income workers. We can see greater utilisation of our public buildings, MRT stations, bus interchanges and 24hr MacDonald's outlets as they double up as sleeping areas for these sleepers. It is great that our beloved govt had such great foresight to invest so much money on these beautiful buildings such as the Esplanade we now know how much vision it took.....I really couldn't imagine that the Esplanade could be actually be that useful to everyone.</div>
              <p><strong>Meet Singapore's nomad families</strong></p>
              <p>by Braema Mathi, Senior Writer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For four years,  the newly-weds lived on the beach.</p>
              <p>From 2003 to 2007, they lived off their catch from the sea, did odd jobs, and washed in public toilets.</p>
              <p>At 16, Madam Siti (not her real name), a Primary 4 dropout, married Mr Osman (not his real name), 25, despite parental objections. They were ostracised by both their families.</p>
              <p>They lived in a series of pitched tents at Changi, East Coast, then Sembawang beach. When Madam Siti gave birth, her sister and in-laws took them in for a few months before conflicts drove them out to the beach.</p>
              <p>This went on till last year.</p>
              <p>Madam Siti, now 21, and Mr Osman, now 30, and their two children aged two and five, showed up at the Ministry of Community Development Youth and Sports' Thomson Road headquarters, asking for help to end their nomadic existence.</p>
              <p>With rising living costs and property prices, the number of nomadic families is on the rise, according to nine family service centres (FSCs) here. Each of the FSCs says it sees between 10 and 30 such cases each year.</p>
              <p>Lakeside FSC counsellor Edwin Quek says: 'We are seeing more cases. The families cannot cope with mortgage loans payments and the cost of living.'</p>
              <p>His centre has already received eight calls for help between March and May this year from displaced families, up from one or two cases earlier this year.</p>
              <p>Social workers also say they see more families - with one FSC it was one case a month - sleeping at void decks, often with children in tow and showering in public toilets.</p>
              <p>This goes on till they are allotted rental flats from the HDB or till they can afford to rent or buy a unit in the open market.</p>
              <p>But the wait for an HDB rental unit is now up to 15 months - double the waiting time in 2006. The number of people applying for heavily subsidised HDB rental flats has shot up by at least 30 per cent in the past few months.</p>
              <p>Now, there are 4,000 eligible applicants in the queue, waiting for one- and two-room rental units. Depending on household income and other factors, the rents are fixed between $26 and $205 a month for a one-room flat and between $44 and $275 for a two-room unit, a fraction of the market rates.</p>
              <p>Fallible family network</p>
              <p>According to social workers, most of these transient homeless are divorcees and the down and out.</p>
              <p>In some divorce cases, after the matrimonial homes are sold, proceeds split between spouses and creditors paid off, there is often not enough cash or savings left to buy another flat.</p>
              <p>Others are caught in a swirl of bad decisions and poor planning, resulting in the banks seizing their flats over unpaid mortgage payments.</p>
              <p>The official approach taken in dealing with such families is for social workers at FSCs - as a first option - to encourage homeless families to live with relatives, friends or strangers.</p>
              <p>This is also for practical reasons, as relatives often charge less rent - from $150 for a room - compared to the $500 and above that landlords who are strangers charge.</p>
              <p>But such arrangements often do not work out. With not just one but several children and boxes of belongings in tow, the goodwill of relatives quickly crumbles under the pressures of living together in a small space.</p>
              <p>Social workers cite cases where rules imposed by relatives and landlords - that include no cooking, minimum noise levels and a cap on water usage - are difficult for families to adhere to. Before long, typically no more than a month or two, they are thrown out again or prefer to leave.</p>
              <p>When their circle of kin is exhausted, they start living in void decks, beaches, quiet stairwells in commercial buildings, bin centres and out of vans.</p>
              <p>'They just want to live on their own, without all the tension of living with others,' said a social worker with 10 years of experience, who declined to be named.</p>
              <p>The problem of nomadic families was hotly discussed in Parliament early last year. Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Inderjit Singh noted then that many residents were in negative equity and had defaulted on mortgages, which resulted in repossession of their flats by banks. He asked if these cases were increasing because of the policy change of allowing banks to handle HDB mortgages.</p>
              <p>In reply, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, Parliamentary Secretary for National Development, said families planning to take up a bank loan should understand the implications of taking on this responsibility.</p>
              <p>Each month, about 60 repossessed flats reportedly go on sale. Many of these belong to families which over-extend themselves financially, for example, by buying a bigger flat than they can afford.</p>
              <p>'Families often do not manage their budgets well and there is no planning,' said Mr Quek.</p>
              <p>Others lose their homes because of sudden illnesses or loss of jobs. Many more are victims of ignorance. They do not know, for example, that the HDB rules include a 30-month waiting period if they have sold their flat bought with certain conditions from the HDB, or that they can apply for another HDB loan or subsidy only subject to conditions, if they have already done so previously.</p>
              <p>'They go into this buying and selling of flats without knowing enough about all the policy hitches. They need more guidance,' said Mr Quek.</p>
              <p>No room at shelters</p>
              <p>The most vulnerable nomads tend to be divorced, lower-income women with children, said Mrs Rachel Lee, a social worker with Fei Yue FSC.</p>
              <p>Most landlords are reluctant to take in lone women with children. They wonder if they can pay up and fear getting drawn into their family problems.</p>
              <p>'There is also a huge constraint in space as, often, they tend to have a lot of household stuff that they have to take along, besides the children,' she said.</p>
              <p>The hardest hit are nomadic children, who need a stable environment but end up on the move all the time, showering in public toilets and witnessing endless family feuds. Many end up skipping school.</p>
              <p>Mrs Chua Yen Ching, principal of NorthLight School that caters to students who fail their Primary School Leaving Examination, said: 'It is important for a child to come to school without having such problems as a barrier to his or her learning.'</p>
              <p>But there are few long-term solutions in sight.</p>
              <p>Singapore currently has only one shelter for displaced families. New Hope Shelter for Displaced Families, run by New Hope Community Services at Yishun, has housed 41 families since it began operations a year ago.</p>
              <p>It can accommodate 22 families at any one time. It now has four families on the wait-list - which ranges from 'a few days to weeks, depending on how long it takes current residents to leave', says its centre manager, Mr Ravi Philemon.</p>
              <p>Each family can stay up to three months and has to pay $150 a month for utilities and food rations.</p>
              <p>There are three other shelters here, meant for battered women. All three - a 40-bedder run by the Good Shepherd Sisters, a 22-bed Star Shelter run by the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations, and a 50-bedder run by the Singapore Anglican Community Services - have taken in homeless families, though they are not equipped to handle children.</p>
              <p>Their social workers note that many of the families stay beyond the three months allowed, simply because they cannot afford market rate rentals.</p>
              <p>Self-catering shelters?</p>
              <p>The HDB has announced that it will build more rental flats, from the current 43,000 units to 50,000, over the next few years. It will also review the eligibility criteria for rental housing to help the 'genuinely poor'.</p>
              <p>One way forward, suggests Mr Chua Wei Bin from Ang Mo Kio FSC, is to set up a committee that includes both social workers and HDB officials to better assess options for homeless families.</p>
              <p>That way, besides the HDB's eligibility criteria, other issues like family dynamics can be factored in. For example, on paper, a nomadic family may have siblings they can stay with, but they may be estranged or feuding.</p>
              <p>Pastor Andrew Khoo of New Hope Community Services, which runs a shelter for the homeless, said that more temporary shelter space will be needed and hopes to raise funds for it.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Ngiam Tee Liang, head of the National University of Singapore's social work department, adds that although the state wants homeless families to seek refuge first with relatives and friends, those who have tried their best but failed to go down that route should not be left out in the cold.</p>
              <p>'With close monitoring, genuine families in need must be helped in getting a home,' he said.</p>
              <p>Another solution that Mr Gerard Ee, executive director of Beyond Social Services, suggests is to offer a self-catering shelter for families where they manage themselves and their finances on their own.</p>
              <p>Once they show that they are capable of moving on, they are given HDB rental units.</p>
              <p>'Shelters unfortunately institutionalise dependency. They must be short-term solutions. Families must find their own solutions. This way, we give them that opportunity and also respect their lifestyle, without going into rescue mode,' he said.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports placed Madam Siti's family in the New Hope Shelter. They stayed there from June to September last year and were given counselling, budgeting and parenting classes.</p>
              <p>Mr Osman, previously a cleaner earning $600 a month, has since landed a higher-paying job with help from the shelter. He is now a car-washer, making $800 a month.</p>
              <p>The family now lives with Madam Siti's sister in a one-room flat. They stick to a tight budget worked out by the centre for them - $50 for food, $100 for rental, $100 for transport, the rest for the children.</p>
              <p>When Madam Siti turns 21 next month, they will join the queue for an HDB rental flat, forgoing their dreams of buying a flat, as they know they cannot afford it for now and do not wish to get into debt.</p>
              <p>'I never want to go back and live at the beach. I want to live in our own house soon and build up our lives,' she said.</p>

              <p><strong>Homeless Singaporeans</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://theonlinecitizen.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/homeless-1a.jpg?w=220&amp;amp;amp;h=170" alt="" width="200" height="150"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I was also quite alarmed and saddened to read in media reports, that the homeless accounted for 10 per cent of the 4,157 calls received by the new ComCare hotline, in November and December, according to MCYS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">How many Singaporeans are homeless ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the launch of the unofficial shelter for the homeless spearheaded by MCYS and the HDB last year, how may Singaporeans have been housed by it ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">According to the Straits Times article, “Help the kids of families in distress” on <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">18 January, 2008</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, there are no homeless people in</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, because the state provides shelter for them :</span></span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“For example, no one is homeless in</span></em> <em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Singapore</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, because this society long ago decided that all Singaporeans should have a roof over their heads, regardless of ability to earn an income. The state builds and funds shelters for those who have nowhere to live”.</span></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Elderly/ST_IMAGES_JECOST.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150"> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">At the announcement of the setting up of the ComCare Fund on</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">19 January 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">, it was said that the five Community Development Councils (CDCs) handled 35,000 hardship cases in 2004, granting almost $ 40 million in assistance. (”New fund to keep the needy afloat - Govt to channel aid through CDCs as they know the ground best”, ST,</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Jan 20, 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why is it that it would appear that about two years later in 2006, according to MCYS, the amount of assistance given out has only increased by 70 per cent, against an increase of 157 per cent in the number of needy families?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In September 2007, a press statement from the CDCs, in conjunction with its tenth anniversary, said that they managed to give out $45.7 million in the form of food rations, vouchers and bursaries to help the less fortunate last year. In the same year, more than 51,000 families and individuals received social assistance via the CDCs – more than four times the number of cases assisted in 2001.</span></p>

              <p><strong>MCYS vs CDC statistics - why the discrepancy?<br></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">With reference to the article “ComCare has spent $68m to help 90,000 individuals, families” (ST, Feb 7, 2007), which said that: <em>“So far, 90,000 individuals and families have benefited through ComCare and a total of $68 million has been committed to help the country’s disadvantaged”</em>, why does the MCYS past statistics appear to be different from the CDCs’ current statistics - $68 million to 90,000 beneficiaries (MCYS) against $45.7 million to 51,000 beneficiaries (CDCs) ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The per beneficiary financial assistance as computed from the above statistics is $1,143 a year in 2004, $756 in 2006 according to MCYS data, and $896 in 2006 according to CDCs’ data.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, about 3 months after the CDCs data was announced in conjunction with its tenth anniversary, the MCYS “numbers made available to The Straits Times show”, according to the article:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Govt aid for the needy triples to $140m: Amount, up from $50m six years ago, is likely to be raised further given the rising cost of living”, (ST, Jan 25).</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“The amount the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports spends on the needy has increased nearly threefold over the past six years - from about $50 million in March 2002 to about $140 million now”.</span></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Charity%20F1%20or%20F9/ThePoor-2.jpg" alt="" width="147" height="136"> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since “Thanks to a greater diversity of schemes, the number of individuals and families helped also soared from 15,000 in 2002 to 64,000 early last year”, the assistance per beneficiary person or family was $1,047 ($67 million divided by 64,000 beneficiaries) last year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">This amount ($1,047) is lower than the amount ($1,143)</span> computed from the data announced at the setting up of the ComCare Fund on <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">19 January 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">. So, despite more help for the needy and inflation, why does the average assistance amount appears to have declined by about 8 per cent from 2004 to 2007?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I am quite confused - MCYS’s announcement reported in the media last year was $68 million to 90,000 beneficiaries - and now it is $67 million to 64,000 beneficiaries?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Even using the latest available figure of 64,000 beneficiaries, it means that spending still only increased by 346 per cent against an increase of 327 per cent from 2002 to 2007.</span></p>
              <p><strong>GST hike to help the poor?</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor2rs.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I also refer to the article “GST hike adds $990m to govt revenue so far” (BT, Jan 23) and media reports about the Parliamentary debate on</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">22 January, 2008</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">If “about 180 destitute persons are “committed to welfare homes annually”, why is it that according to MCYS’s “Singapore Social Statistics In Brief”, the “number of destitutes in government funded homes” declined from 1,738 to 1,726 from 2005 to 2006?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Also, since “there are now about 1,750 residents in the 10 welfare homes”, why is it that the number of destitute residents appears to have increased by only 24 persons (1,726 to 1,750), from 2006 to 2007?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since inflation started to rise rapidly almost immediately after the GST was increased in July, why is it that after about 6 months, “A review is currently ongoing and is to be completed at the end this year”?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the PA sum was not pegged to inflation rates - and MCYS was monitoring the impact of escalating costs on Singapore’s poor – the ministry monitors the cost of items which the typical PA recipient will need, and a review is currently ongoing and is likely to be completed this year, why is it taking so long to do a “currently ongoing review” when “the Ministry was monitoring the impact of escalating costs on Singapore’s poor” all along?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I would like to suggest that this review be given a sense of greater urgency, as the financial plight of these PA receipients may by rising by the month, with inflation hitting a 25-year high.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to “For the first nine months of last year, $1.1 million was disbursed to 6,514 cases”, does it mean that only an average of $169 ($1.1 million divided by 6,514 cases) was disbursed to each case for 9 months?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Does it mean that there was an average of about 2 cases (6,514 cases divided by over 3,000 PA receipients) of PA receipients requiring extra help?</span></p>
              <p><strong>One year for review to increase PA by $23?<br></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor3rs.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="170"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Against the estimated $1.98 billion a year from the two-percentage point hike in Goods and Services tax, , for which the reason given for the hike was to help the poor, acceding to MPs Seah Kian Peng and Halimah Yacob’s request to increase the PA allowance by only $23 a month from $290 to $313, is only 828,000 ($23 x 12 months x 3,000 PA receipients), which is only 0.04 per cent of the $1.98 billion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other countries, schemes for the needy are almost invariably always adjusted for inflation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, I would like to suggest that our financial assistance schemes be automatically indexed for inflation, just like public transport fares are adjusted for inflation in the fare increase formula.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When was the last time the $ 1,500 monthly household income criteria generally used for financial assistance revised ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I try to put myself in the shoes of the over 3,000 Singaporeans on Public Assistance, and I think they may find it hard to understand why it takes more than a year to conduct an “ongoing review” to pay them just $23 more a month, when they are reeling from the effects of high inflation.</span></p>

              <p>The success of Singapore's development has drawn much discussions among scholars (Nyaw and Chan, 1982; Pang, 1985; Lira 1988; Chng, Low and Toh, 1988; Lee 1996b). However, amid its modern structures and clean streets some Singaporeans are living in poverty. Certain groups of people, such as the working poor, have been left out of the success of the city state. Others have concluded that income and racial inequality have risen (Pang, 1975; Islam and Kirkpatrick, 1986; Lee, 1992; 1995a; 1995b; 1996a). Like many industrialized and affluent societies, public policy in Singapore has not been successful in eradicating such social ills. As Singapore's population ages, elderly with inadequate financial resources will likely slip into poverty. The state strongly upholds meritocracy, and only provides education and training to enable its citizen to achieve in society. Individual economic well-being is entirely dependent upon an individual's efforts. Hence, in comparison to other affluent societies, Singapore has very little to offer in terms of social assistance to those living in or near poverty.(1) Little is known of Singapore's poor and for that matter how Singapore deals with them. This article examines the changing nature and causes of poverty in Singapore and the anti-poverty measures that are in place.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The 1995 General Household Survey shows that Singapore has a population of about 3 million people of which 79% of the population were Chinese, 14% Malay and 6% Indian. Government officials acknowledge that Malays are over represented in the bottom of the Singapore economy. In terms of income, a 1991 survey showed that 45.8% of working Malays earned between S$200-S$599 per month, while only 29.7% and 38.3% of Chinese and Indians, respectively, were in this income bracket (Chiew, 1991). More recent statistics show that about 30% of working Malays are in the income bracket of below S$500-S$999 per month compared to 19% and 25%</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Affluent Singapore feels pinch of inflation at 26-year highs</span></h1>
              <p><br><br>&lt;!-- google_ad_section_start --&gt;Singapore (ANTARA News) - From taking fewer taxi rides to eating out less and shortening shower time, residents of affluent Singapore are trying to cope with inflation, which has soared to 26-year highs.<br><br>Rising costs of housing, food, and transport have eaten into family budgets of Singaporeans as well as the large number of expatriates working in the city-state, consumers and analysts said.<br><br>Except for the ultra-rich, the impact of the sharp price increases has cut across social classes in one of Asia's wealthiest nations, they said.<br><br>Government figures show Singapore's annual inflation was at 6.7 percent in March, the highest since 1982, boosted by higher costs of food, transport, communications and housing.<br><br>The figure is more than double the inflation rate in Malaysia and higher than that of the Philippines, Hong Kong and Australia. Unlike bigger countries in the region, Singapore imports most of its needs.<br><br>"When the inflation rate is high, it affects everybody," said Serena, a businesswoman who lives near the prime Orchard Road shopping and would only give her first name.<br><br>Serena said even affluent families like hers have had to adjust to the rising costs by eyeing grocery prices more closely, using the car less and eating in fancy restaurants only on special occasions.<br><br>"You have to differentiate between needs and wants, what is necessary and what is not necessary. If you can get something cheaper, you don't have to go for branded (luxury) items," she told AFP.<br><br>While soaring inflation in developing countries, amid a global food crisis, has left many struggling to feed their families, Singaporeans are dealing with the impact of price hikes in their own ways.<br><br>For Janice Tan, 35, who works at a travel agency, the soaring prices have forced members of her family to shower only once a day to cut their water bill.<br><br>Water used to rinse vegetables is recycled to flush the toilet.<br><br>To reduce the electric bill, Tan said she told her maid to iron only office clothes -- and just the parts that are visible.<br><br>"It's a big deal for Singapore in that we have never had inflation higher than three percent," said Euston Quah, head of the economics division at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>"It hits the poor badly because the poor spend maybe 40, 50 percent of their income on food," he said.<br><br>Quah sees inflation eventually easing to around 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year, while the government has forecast 2008 economic growth forecast of 4.0 to 6.0 percent.<br><br><br><strong>Harder for those earning less</strong><br><br>Amin Sorr, 65, who works with a shipping firm, said life has become harder, especially for those earning less.<br><br>With a monthly salary of 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,200 US), Sorr said he can cope, but friends pulling in 2,000 dollars or less are struggling.<br><br>"I know a lot of friends who have problems with their water bills... and even personal credit lines."<br><br>Local charities say rising food prices are also driving more Singaporeans, especially poor senior citizens, to join queues for free meals.<br><br>Salamah Salim, 40, who runs a food stall on the fringes of the business district, said: "Our expenses on food and rice have more than doubled over the past year. Rice and oil have risen tremendously."<br><br>Even expatriate professionals, particularly those with less generous housing allowances and other benefits, have been hit.<br><br>As apartment rents surged, some moved their families from condominiums that come with swimming pools, gyms and barbecue pits to cheaper government-built flats without such resort-style amenities.<br><br>"They raised our rent by 150 percent after our contract expired late last year," said a Filipino computer engineer, who transferred from a gated condominium to a government-built high-rise in the suburbs.<br><br>"I know several friends who have also made similar moves or are planning to move out once their leases expire," he said, requesting anonymity.<br><br>Dee Pritchard, who works at the Australian International School, said that except for being more careful with the grocery shopping and giving the children fewer treats, nothing much has changed in her lifestyle.<br><br>"I'm lucky I'm not in the lower income (group) which would be suffering a lot more than I do really. But at the end of the week, the cash is less. There is less savings." (*)</p>

              <p>Singapore, the only Southeast Asian country to avert a recession during the Asian Crisis, became the only Southeast Asian country to fall into a recession, or to quote the Trade &amp; Industry Ministry on 18 May 2001, a “technical recession”. The city-state enjoyed a prolonged period of economic growth between 1986 and 1997 averaging 8.6 percent per annum. However, after the Asian financial crisis, Singapore’s GDP is more volatile -</p>
              <p><img src="http://amrc.org.hk/files/Image/alu01.gif" alt="" width="279" height="214"></p>
              <p>According to quarterly reports by the government, unemployment has been steadily increasing in the run up to the recession. By June 2001, unemployment had reached 3.4 percent, breaching the internationally accepted unemployment level of three percent. The official unemployment rate worsened to 4.7 percent in December 2001, the highest in 15 years, as companies retrenched workers. The rate exceeds the 4.4 percent recorded in December 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. The Manpower Research and Statistics Department published a report, Labour Market 2001, in March 2002 in which the overall unemployment rate was projected to reach about 5.5 - six percent by the second half of 2002. The record rate of six percent was in March 1986 resulting from a recession.1</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the cost of living in Singapore has not been reduced by much even in the economic downturn. During the second half of 2001, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5 percent for households in the lowest 20 percent income group but fell by 0.3 percent for the top 20 percent income group. For households in the middle 60 percent income group, the CPI remained stable in this period. Households in the lowest 20 percent and middle 60 percent income groups registered lower inflation rates of 1.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively in 2001, the rises being due to dearer cooked food and higher electricity tariffs. The CPI for households in the top 20 percent income group dipped by 0.2 percent in 2001, due largely to lower car prices.2 In a study done by the Relocation Journal &amp; Real Estate News in August 2000, Singapore was the fifth most expensive city to live in after New York, Seoul, Tokyo, and London.</p>
              <p>It is with this backdrop that one should understand the wage situation and the impact on workers. Except for unionised companies in Singapore, there is no legal minimum wage. Therefore there is really no jurisdiction over how much an employer should pay an employee or offer a job-seeker.</p>
              <p>Between an employer and employee, there exists a contract of service and the terms and conditions cannot run contrary to the Employment Act, which stipulates the minimum standards for an employee, e.g. overtime, annual leave, and maternity benefit, but nothing governs the actual salary that should be paid to an employee, apart from compensation calculations in the Third Schedule of the Employment Act and that employees who earn more than S$1,600 (US$869)3 are not entitled to overtime etc.</p>
              <p>In unionised corporations, the minimum wage is spelt out in a collective agreement (CA) between company and union, legally endorsed and renewed once every two to three years. It also provides for an annual increment, being negotiable on an annual basis after National Wages Council (NWC) recommendations. But if the company can prove that it is not doing too well, any agreed increment can be smaller or even waived for the year, and the CA can be re-negotiated before it expires. There is also an Industrial Arbitration Court if employers refuse to up salaries in the CA to a reasonable level.</p>
              <p>However, wage negotiations between employer and union rest on the employer’s right to a final say, and typically in Singapore, success rests much on the usual day to day ‘good relations’ between employers and unions, that help foster the possibility of securing better benefits for workers. Direct confrontation between employer and employees, using the courts, is generally frowned upon.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower in December 2001 backed a call from the NWC for severe restraint or cuts in wages. Citing worsening economic conditions and uncertainty in 2002, the government urged companies to freeze or cut wages in the city-state’s worst recession yet. A survey quoted in the Straits Times revealed that 18 percent of Singapore-based companies had already frozen pay levels in 2001 and 28 percent planned to do so in 2002. During the financial crisis in 1998, the NWC asked workers to accept wage cuts of between five and eight percent.</p>
              <p>At the height of the 1998 financial crisis, the government announced a blanket policy of cutting the employers’ share of monthly Central Provident Fund (CPF) payments to employees from 20 percent to 10 percent. This policy was aimed as a cost saving package to revive the economy but it placed the burden on ordinary wage earners and not on the state’s coffers. This 10 percent cut was applied to all companies regardless of profitability and financial situation. It penalised workers even in companies that were breaking profit records. Overnight, many workers had trouble keeping up their mortgage payments that were serviced through the CPF. Instead they had to dig into their salaries to make up the difference. There was a public outcry and some quick fix measures were assembled to assist those who were unable to continue paying mortgages.</p>
              <p>It was then that the NWC recommended the monthly variable component (MVC), to allow companies to adjust monthly wage bills quickly to remain competitive and minimise job losses. This move exempted the government from involvement and becoming the target of bad publicity and collective unhappiness of the workers whose wages are cut. Over the years the number of companies that use the MVC has increased and wages in general have become more flexible. For instance the variable component of total wages was 15-16 percent in 2000 compared to 11 percent in 1997. The Ministry of Manpower is now seeking to speed up the implementation of the MVC even further and to promote performance-based pay structures to replace seniority-based systems. In addition, other components of the employment benefits system, including implementing medical co-payment and changing retrenchment compensation so that companies have greater flexibility in managing wage costs.</p>
              <p>The central issue in introducing and operating the MVC is how to define a justifiable cut in each industry, especially in large MNCs where profit transfer between countries could be easily carried out. Since financial situations and management capabilities vary from company to company, it is unclear whether the Ministry of Manpower and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) are sufficiently informed about the technical details of industries to function as a watchdog against unjust wage-cuts or to set out intelligent guidelines for a MVC cut.</p>
              <p>Major concerns are, how much to allow companies/government to cut the MVC? How to calculate and define a cut? Does a well managed economy require frequent MVC wage-cut to rank and file workers to keep employment levels? Can a company convert part of a worker’s present salary into MVC?</p>
              <p>As cited earlier, Singapore is the fifth most expensive city to live in. Of all components of cost, workers’ wages are not the highest contributing cost factor. Workers’ wage levels have actually fallen behind other Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. If factors other than workers’ wages are the biggest contributors to high costs, it is not logical to pursue wage cuts as a priority. More should be done to lower government charges and duties.</p>
              <p>There is a concern that adjusting the workers’ wage structure for the sake of keeping business costs low may be abused, leaving workers more vulnerable. For instance, it is not usual for government wage surveys to show that since the Asian crisis wage growth has reached pre-crisis levels. However a comparison of pay increases of rank-and-file employees shows that throughout the 1990s average annual wage growth declined from eight to ten percent in the early half to between five and seven percent in the latter. This is largely due to attempts to keep business costs down, and wage cuts are one way of doing this.</p>
              <p>Employers are suspected of using the economic crisis as an excuse to restrain wage increases, creating an employer’s market. For instance, the starting salary of university graduates in the latter half of 2001 fell to pre-1997 secondary school-leaver levels. Without a minimum wage, employers, even when making profits, can offer graduates salaries below what used to be the graduate benchmark of $1,600.</p>
              <p>Wage issues remain problematic as they are not regulated by law. The NTUC is said to play a pragmatic role, but a tame one in the perception of some. Part of the problem is that the NTUC is aligned with the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and therefore its independence is questionable. Changes arising from economic restructuring, which included job cuts and new forms of employment relationships, are unsettling workers and testing worker-employer relations. But the PAP wants to deepen the tripartite partnership between its administration, the employers, and the NTUC, to preserve ‘harmonious’ industrial relations.</p>
              <p>The push for more MVC is in the name of minimising retrenchment in a volatile economy. The increasing attack on wages is explained in part as a result of a drop in workers’ productivity. So workers are presented as receiving less wages because they are less productive and not because the PAP administration has introduced a policy that penalises workers first.</p>
              <p>The MVC is a political solution to a political problem. It is of no help in saving jobs at all. It is unclear whether MNCs will stay in Singapore simply because they can cut wage costs by five to ten percent when wages constitute less than ten percent of total costs to most MNCs. Such cuts are increasingly painful for workers when the CPI does not fall in the same period. If workers’ wages are cut by more than ten percent without corresponding reductions in other living costs, more people will find it difficult to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>A thorough review of all other aspects of the Employment Act is thus urgently required to meet the fast changing job environment. It is worrisome that historically the government has a tendency to chant policies that favour large MNCs and government linked companies (GLC) and ignores the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Tremendous efforts have to be made to regain the balance where SMEs can co-exist with MNCs and GLCs for a more balanced and sustainable economy.</p>
              <p>Because Singapore is small, housing space, land use, transportation, water, and electric supply, must become more efficient. But they are increasingly costly and without subsidies. Additionally, health care, education, food, and recreation are also becoming expensive. There is increasing public pressure to review policies to include further concessions on state subsidies and relief.</p>
              <p>With increasing anxiety to make ends meet, more workers are treated for depression as Singapore slips into its deepest recession. The Institute of Mental Health reports that the number of patients has almost doubled since April 2001. Psychiatrists confirm that more people are now treated for depression. Men, especially 30 to 49 year-olds, feel the most heat in the current economic meltdown.</p>
              <p>The government has long rejected the notion of a welfare state, preferring short-term incentives to those in need to avoid relying on welfare. In Singapore, families shoulder part of the responsibility and more than 260 private welfare organisations take up the rest, some aided by public money. However the challenge is for the government to provide a safety net for people when the global economy is volatile, impacting the local one, and family and community support is gradually being eroded.</p>
              <p>In the run up to the general election in November 2001, the government announced budget measures that included tax relief and rebates for conservation charges and utilities. To boost PAP chances in the elections it introduced New Singapore Shares which is essentially a staggered cash handout. However, such rebates and handouts are not efficient ways to redistribute accumulated state wealth and are not targeted to reduce basic household needs or to create jobs. Most see them as short-term stop gap measures motivated by electoral politics.</p>
              <p>There has been some decentralised and delegated social service through the government administered Community Development Councils (CDC) aimed at identifying and helping the poor. Short-term loan schemes have also been introduced. The budget for CDCs grew from S$19 million in 1997 to S$153 million in 2001, largely due to social assistance schemes. But eligibility for government assistance is stringent so as not to encourage a dependence mentality. The Ministry of Community Development and Sports, together with other agencies link short-term financial assistance closely with job counselling, job seeking, training, and placement.</p>
              <p>However, short-term assistance is generally judged as not guaranteeing that the unemployed can become economically stable. Job placement services have on many occasions not been successful. A Jobs Task Force has been set up to give training, job assistance, and counselling to those affected by economic restructuring. There have also been promises of jobs in new ‘growth areas’. But what ‘growth areas’ are, how many they will employ, and when, is not clear. Areas such as wafer fabrication and biotechnology that were celebrated as the way forward are high-tech and need specialists so their contribution to job creation is questionable. The promise that more Singaporean companies operating world-wide will facilitate Singaporeans to work overseas is also speculative. Most Singaporean companies overseas are GLCs and it is unclear how good they are at creating new jobs at home.</p>
              <p>In this context, there is a need to review the CPF scheme, to ensure that in addition to providing members with adequate savings for housing, medical, and retirement, that there is a scheme where some form of social security is available for sudden job loss and a means to tide over times when jobs are scarce. In the absence of new jobs for older and retrenched workers, rules need relaxing to allow the growth of a ‘regulated informal sector’. Singaporean workers need to be able to operate from home to keep costs down and at the same time to be gainfully employed to make a contribution to the economy and society.</p>

              <p><em>Singapore's consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace last month [May 2008], reducing the need for further currency gains to rein in inflation. The consumer price index [CPI] jumped 7.5% from a year earlier, matching April's 26-year high record, the Department of Statistics said [23 Jun 2008]. The Monetary Authority of Singapore [MAS] had forecast a 5-6% inflation rate for 2008. The central bank has allowed its currency to strengthen against the US dollar, saying the exchange rate remains its most effective tool to fight inflation.</em></p>
              <p>- The Singapore inflation rate is reportedly stabilizing and analysts are already predicting that it will come down in the second half of 2008. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pDdh4Uw2rkej6LyR_3gBREQ"><span style="color: #993311;">Singapore M3 money supply</span></a> figures also appear to be stabilizing around the 12-13% level in the past half year, down from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/23_62_singapore_m3_money"><span style="color: #993311;">a high of 23.62%</span></a> in 2007. But the money supply growth rate is only half the story - the other half is its relationship to the growth of available goods and services in the economy. For the inflation rate to be stable, economic growth has to at least keep up with money supply growth. With a looming global economic slowdown and imminent worldwide recession, the economic growth factor is the big wildcard.</p>
              <p>Gold and crude oil prices may have paused from breaking new all-time record highs for the time being, but the inflationary storm is far from over as yet. We may only be passing through the eye of the hurricane here - just when people start to get lulled into complacency, the winds of inflation could well pick up with renewed force - perhaps even stronger than ever. We need to remain vigilant against inflation. This is no time to let down your guard yet.</p>

              <p><em>Singaporeans will see an increase of 21% in their electricity bills in the last quarter of this year. For the quarter 1 Oct to 31 Dec 08, the average electricity tariffs will be increased by 5.38 cents per kWh. This represents an increase of 21.46% for households. The increase is due to higher fuel oil prices. For the period 1 Oct to 31 Dec 08, tariffs are pegged to a higher forward fuel oil price of S$155.14 per barrel, which is 38.06% higher than that of S$112.35 per barrel for the current quarter [Q3 2008].</em></p>
              <p><em>The EMA feels there is more room for Singaporeans to conserve and use less energy. The EMA's surveys and findings show that nearly 40% of Singapore homes are using more energy than they require to. And the air conditioner is one of the largest energy guzzlers in homes here.</em></p>
              <p>- For residential households in Singapore, the electricity rate will increase from 25.07 to 30.45 cents per kilowatt-hour. Quarter-on-quarter that's a 21.46% increase as stated, but if you were to look back a bit further, it's a mind-blowing 89.6% increase compared to 3 years ago, as the tariffs back in Apr 2005 was 16.06 cents per KWh. This is a super-high double-digit rate of inflation, and all we need is for another further one or two rounds of increase to hit a triple-digit rate within a 3-year period. Absolutely super.</p>
              <p>The surprise here is that while NYMEX crude oil prices have been <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/nymex_crude_oil_drops_below_92_as_financial_market_meltdown_intensifies"><span style="color: #993311;">driven downward</span></a> in recent weeks by the ongoing <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/s_p_500_sinks_most_since_9_11_dow_jones_drops_504_48_points_on_financial_system_meltdown"><span style="color: #993311;">financial market meltdown</span></a>, the oil price used for electricity rate calculations isn't the historical NYMEX crude oil movements but forward fuel prices for the upcoming quarter, which are, after conversion to USD, around $110 per barrel.</p>
              <p>As for conservation measures, they will help somewhat but only up to a point. If the rates were to double, could you cut back to use half the electricity? If they were to triple? Quadruple? Would you be able to cut back 66%? 75%? The price upside is effectively unlimited, while your downside mitigation measures will naturally start to run into limits.</p>
              <p>But of course that isn't to say that we shouldn't try. In view of our own pocketbook, resource depletion and environment pollution, we should still strive towards energy conservation as much as we can. As I have <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/power_bill_and_other_updates"><span style="color: #993311;">chronicled earlier</span></a>, we have reduced our household power consumption from a whopping <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/power_bill_update"><span style="color: #993311;">700 KWh per month</span></a> down to a much more manageable 436 KWh (average over past 3 months). That's a reduction of 37.7% - not too bad, eh?</p>
              <p>Here are some of the things we did in terms of energy conservation over the past couple years or so :</p>
              <p>- configured the computers to auto-shutdown after the nightly backups<br>- replaced energy-guzzler continuous-boiling air-pot with thermos flask<br>- turned off air-con system permanently (outside main switch set to "off" position)<br>- changed to a more efficient clothes dryer model (still need that with 3 adults, 2 kids, and rainy days)<br>- replaced living room 29" CRT TV with 37" LCD TV (bigger HD screen, lower consumption)<br>- replaced all 3 CRT computer monitors with LCD monitors<br>- turned off electrical appliances when not in use (eliminates the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/your_power_bill_is_standing"><span style="color: #993311;">standby power effect</span></a>)</p>
              <p>That seems like a long list of things to do and some of them cost money too. Of course all the LCD's cost money, but we had actually been hanging on to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/are_crts_history"><span style="color: #993311;">CRT's</span></a> long after everyone and their grandmother had already upgraded, so there you are. Further improvements would be more incremental tweaks - perhaps I may permanently turn off the second cordless phone which is only occasionally used, replace the very last 19" CRT TV in one of the bedrooms, also occasionally used, sending the children's bathtub to the recycling bin to save on some heated water since they are too big for it anyway, things like that. We'll see how this goes.</p>

              <p>Interesting exchange going on in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.expatsingapore.com/forum/index.php/topic,34440.0.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">expatsingapore forums</span></span></a>. The forumers there are discussing if Singapore is getting too expensive for expats to stay:</p>
              <p><br>Move:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>We find it is getting more expensive to live in Singapore. Rent has been skyrocketing. Also, more expenses incurred after GST increase (eg. maid asked for more pay, increase in food prices). Package is now on local deal (not expat deal as when you just first moved here). AUD is now stronger than SGD so effectively earning less than before. Some people we know of have moved back. Got told that it is unlikey that AUD will get weaker against SGD in 5 years. Wondered if people have considered a move back??</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are going home:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>We have been here about 2 years and have decided to go home - as it's just not worth living here anymore - true, the low tax rate is great - but we will now have to pay over SGD6,000 a month for a same place we have been paying SGD2500 for the past 2 years and our paychecks have not increased by that much over 2 years. Also with strong AUD against SGD, we are not really that better off in Singapore.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>Also, the long working hours have started to cause a problem in our marriage (I was working almost 12 hours a day, almost every day at a bank).</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Sensei:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>To Only One.........I always say we're memory rich and cash poor. I've worked at various times through ten years, fairly well paid at local rates, but in real terms if you look at my husband's income we're now worse off financially. Circumstances have changed in that he's on a contract basis rather than company employee, but we've chosen to stay away from our home country because, just like you, it's for the experience. He's lived and worked in six Asian countries, I've been in three and we've been happy in each one. And we've been able to travel further afield several times - we think we're really lucky to have done so.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>Our two kids have had amazing opportunities but have never had that Expat Brat style, we just didn't allow it. Never had a maid (just a cleaner once a week) so the kids had to pull their weight in the house. They didn't have the pocket money that many friends did but it didn't matter, they've grown up into sensible and well educated young adults. And we're comfortable but not rolling in money, despite the perception many people have that Expats are darn near millionaires. I hate it when we visit our home country and they think we're made of money.</p>
              <p>To Elizamango, I'd say think VERY carefully before committing to Singapore. I feel you'd enjoy the experience but don't compromise your standard of living. Make sure you have enough for comfortable accommodation, enough to take a few trips around Asia and to get you back to Australia to keep up family/friends ties each year, enough to have a social life without worrying about overspending. And be sure you have very good medical coverage, hospitalisation in Singapore is expensive.</p>
              <p>To the OP, we were fortunate in that we had two properties which have been rented out all the time. We'll go back eventually to a roof over our heads in a nice town, a small pension, and we'll have great memories to look back on. But starting out now - well, we'd think twice about it which is sad</p>

              <p><em>We came to Singapore, as corny as it sounds for the experience also. We wanted to travel and that's what we did. For both of us, it was not a career move, and financially we are not that much better off here as we spend a lot more (on traveling &amp; eating out!).</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>I'd say, if you have a chance to move here, do it - sure the working hours are crazy (I found that most Singaporeans just stayed back to look busy because that's what just everybody seemd to do here) but if you want to and try to make the best out of it, you will enjoy it.</p>

              <p><br>professional expats:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>We hold EU passports but had not lived in any country for more than 5 years for the last 30 years. There is no country that is "home" to move back to. It might be more expensive in Singapore now than in the last year but we are still saving far more than if we were to be posted back to Europe. We were just there for 4 weeks for the summer and eating out cost a fortune and taxes are a nightmare. For those who don't have an expat package and have a home to go back to, I guess leaving would be a better option for you. Having said that, I know some teachers at our children's school who are pretty content with their relatively humble packages. How big a slice of the pie does one want and when one gets it, can one have it and eat it too?</em></p>

              <p><em>professional expats, you miss the point.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>Most Expats accept their package and those who do not materially benefit greatly, accept the trade-offs which gives them a beautiful country, lifestyle, security, first-rate services etc.</p>
              <p>Most Expats rely on the confidence Singapore has earned to negotiate an Expat package and whatever the margins they feel sure there will be no unexpected upheavals.</p>
              <p>Similarly with business, contract negotiations require confidence or stability in many things such as currency, interest rates, exchange rates etc.</p>
              <p>When during the course of one year we get "stiffed" for 40-100% rent increases and we have really no option, then that is underhanded and unfair and shakes ones confidence in the infrastructure here. Particularly when a small minority benefit compared to an overwhelming majority of people who are relatively poorer (that includes 99.9% local population).</p>
              <p>Its not the quantum of the loss but the principle.</p>

              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>There is a strong denial in government circles - the view is that there is more cash coming from tourists than from expats... but there is also a very limited understanding of market dynamics... once people start leaving, replacing them won't happen - companies will post people elsewhere. We've already stopped bringing families here due to the cost increase of both rental and schools... and this is not the end of it...</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Well said! Ask any foreigner here today (renting, ie, most) how they feel and the answer will be anything from 'shocked and amazed' to 'disappointed'. Foreigners aren't going to accept the 100% increase in living costs that has happened in under 12months. The majority are planning to leave based on my conversations.</em></p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Affluent Singapore feels pinch of inflation at 26-year highs</span></h1>
              <p><br><br>&lt;!-- google_ad_section_start --&gt;Singapore (ANTARA News) - From taking fewer taxi rides to eating out less and shortening shower time, residents of affluent Singapore are trying to cope with inflation, which has soared to 26-year highs.<br><br>Rising costs of housing, food, and transport have eaten into family budgets of Singaporeans as well as the large number of expatriates working in the city-state, consumers and analysts said.<br><br>Except for the ultra-rich, the impact of the sharp price increases has cut across social classes in one of Asia's wealthiest nations, they said.<br><br>Government figures show Singapore's annual inflation was at 6.7 percent in March, the highest since 1982, boosted by higher costs of food, transport, communications and housing.<br><br>The figure is more than double the inflation rate in Malaysia and higher than that of the Philippines, Hong Kong and Australia. Unlike bigger countries in the region, Singapore imports most of its needs.<br><br>"When the inflation rate is high, it affects everybody," said Serena, a businesswoman who lives near the prime Orchard Road shopping and would only give her first name.<br><br>Serena said even affluent families like hers have had to adjust to the rising costs by eyeing grocery prices more closely, using the car less and eating in fancy restaurants only on special occasions.<br><br>"You have to differentiate between needs and wants, what is necessary and what is not necessary. If you can get something cheaper, you don't have to go for branded (luxury) items," she told AFP.<br><br>While soaring inflation in developing countries, amid a global food crisis, has left many struggling to feed their families, Singaporeans are dealing with the impact of price hikes in their own ways.<br><br>For Janice Tan, 35, who works at a travel agency, the soaring prices have forced members of her family to shower only once a day to cut their water bill.<br><br>Water used to rinse vegetables is recycled to flush the toilet.<br><br>To reduce the electric bill, Tan said she told her maid to iron only office clothes -- and just the parts that are visible.<br><br>"It's a big deal for Singapore in that we have never had inflation higher than three percent," said Euston Quah, head of the economics division at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>"It hits the poor badly because the poor spend maybe 40, 50 percent of their income on food," he said.<br><br>Quah sees inflation eventually easing to around 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year, while the government has forecast 2008 economic growth forecast of 4.0 to 6.0 percent.<br><br><br><strong>Harder for those earning less</strong><br><br>Amin Sorr, 65, who works with a shipping firm, said life has become harder, especially for those earning less.<br><br>With a monthly salary of 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,200 US), Sorr said he can cope, but friends pulling in 2,000 dollars or less are struggling.<br><br>"I know a lot of friends who have problems with their water bills... and even personal credit lines."<br><br>Local charities say rising food prices are also driving more Singaporeans, especially poor senior citizens, to join queues for free meals.<br><br>Salamah Salim, 40, who runs a food stall on the fringes of the business district, said: "Our expenses on food and rice have more than doubled over the past year. Rice and oil have risen tremendously."<br><br>Even expatriate professionals, particularly those with less generous housing allowances and other benefits, have been hit.<br><br>As apartment rents surged, some moved their families from condominiums that come with swimming pools, gyms and barbecue pits to cheaper government-built flats without such resort-style amenities.<br><br>"They raised our rent by 150 percent after our contract expired late last year," said a Filipino computer engineer, who transferred from a gated condominium to a government-built high-rise in the suburbs.<br><br>"I know several friends who have also made similar moves or are planning to move out once their leases expire," he said, requesting anonymity.<br><br>Dee Pritchard, who works at the Australian International School, said that except for being more careful with the grocery shopping and giving the children fewer treats, nothing much has changed in her lifestyle.<br><br>"I'm lucky I'm not in the lower income (group) which would be suffering a lot more than I do really. But at the end of the week, the cash is less. There is less savings." (*)</p>

              Infrastructure spokesman Andrew Robb
                  today accused the Government of "manipulation" after a split emerged
                  between the Reserve Bank and the Treasury over whether economic growth

                  Minister's prediction in the mid-year budget update. <br><br>But the
                  Reserve Bank confirmed yesterday it expects growth this year will slow
                  to 1.5 per cent, with its outlook on jobs suggesting the rate of

              <p>this article critized oz 6 billion to brain dead car manufacturing industry,</p>
              <p>written by a australian!!</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This is ALP tradition at its very worst. Because of the financial
              generosity and strength of the manufacturing unions, because of John
              Button’s legacy, and because, almost certainly, of an absurd left-wing
              conviction that only the manufacture of physical objects is somehow a
              real economic activity, Australian consumers and taxpayers are
              condemned to continue paying too much for imported cars and subsidising
              60,000 jobs. Other industries should be furious that this rort, this
              scam, this extended exercise in economic and fiscal vandalism, is being
              continued and exacerbated by a supposedly free market government.</p>
              <p>What’s
              the bet, though, that they’ll stay silent in the hope of attracting
              some assistance of their own? When it comes to rent-seeking, <em>everyone</em> is a strategic industry.</p>
              <p>The
              Government’s package is an exercise in keeping a <span style="color: #ff0000;">brain-dead body
              ticking over.</span> It’s brain-dead because it has failed to meet the
              changing needs of Australian consumers over the past decade and relied
              on assistance as its primary commercial strategy. And even with
              assistance, parts of the body have routinely died. It’s time to cut off

              <p><strong>MCYS vs CDC statistics - why the discrepancy?<br></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">With reference to the article “ComCare has spent $68m to help 90,000 individuals, families” (ST, Feb 7, 2007), which said that: <em>“So far, 90,000 individuals and families have benefited through ComCare and a total of $68 million has been committed to help the country’s disadvantaged”</em>, why does the MCYS past statistics appear to be different from the CDCs’ current statistics - $68 million to 90,000 beneficiaries (MCYS) against $45.7 million to 51,000 beneficiaries (CDCs) ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">The per beneficiary financial assistance as computed from the above statistics is $1,143 a year in 2004, $756 in 2006 according to MCYS data, and $896 in 2006 according to CDCs’ data.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, about 3 months after the CDCs data was announced in conjunction with its tenth anniversary, the MCYS “numbers made available to The Straits Times show”, according to the article:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“Govt aid for the needy triples to $140m: Amount, up from $50m six years ago, is likely to be raised further given the rising cost of living”, (ST, Jan 25).</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">And:</span></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">“The amount the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports spends on the needy has increased nearly threefold over the past six years - from about $50 million in March 2002 to about $140 million now”.</span></em></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/Charity%20F1%20or%20F9/ThePoor-2.jpg" alt="" width="147" height="136"> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since “Thanks to a greater diversity of schemes, the number of individuals and families helped also soared from 15,000 in 2002 to 64,000 early last year”, the assistance per beneficiary person or family was $1,047 ($67 million divided by 64,000 beneficiaries) last year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: black;">This amount ($1,047) is lower than the amount ($1,143)</span> computed from the data announced at the setting up of the ComCare Fund on <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">19 January 2005</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">. So, despite more help for the needy and inflation, why does the average assistance amount appears to have declined by about 8 per cent from 2004 to 2007?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I am quite confused - MCYS’s announcement reported in the media last year was $68 million to 90,000 beneficiaries - and now it is $67 million to 64,000 beneficiaries?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Even using the latest available figure of 64,000 beneficiaries, it means that spending still only increased by 346 per cent against an increase of 327 per cent from 2002 to 2007.</span></p>
              <p><strong>GST hike to help the poor?</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor2rs.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I also refer to the article “GST hike adds $990m to govt revenue so far” (BT, Jan 23) and media reports about the Parliamentary debate on</span> <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">22 January, 2008</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">If “about 180 destitute persons are “committed to welfare homes annually”, why is it that according to MCYS’s “Singapore Social Statistics In Brief”, the “number of destitutes in government funded homes” declined from 1,738 to 1,726 from 2005 to 2006?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Also, since “there are now about 1,750 residents in the 10 welfare homes”, why is it that the number of destitute residents appears to have increased by only 24 persons (1,726 to 1,750), from 2006 to 2007?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since inflation started to rise rapidly almost immediately after the GST was increased in July, why is it that after about 6 months, “A review is currently ongoing and is to be completed at the end this year”?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Since the PA sum was not pegged to inflation rates - and MCYS was monitoring the impact of escalating costs on Singapore’s poor – the ministry monitors the cost of items which the typical PA recipient will need, and a review is currently ongoing and is likely to be completed this year, why is it taking so long to do a “currently ongoing review” when “the Ministry was monitoring the impact of escalating costs on Singapore’s poor” all along?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I would like to suggest that this review be given a sense of greater urgency, as the financial plight of these PA receipients may by rising by the month, with inflation hitting a 25-year high.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">As to “For the first nine months of last year, $1.1 million was disbursed to 6,514 cases”, does it mean that only an average of $169 ($1.1 million divided by 6,514 cases) was disbursed to each case for 9 months?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Does it mean that there was an average of about 2 cases (6,514 cases divided by over 3,000 PA receipients) of PA receipients requiring extra help?</span></p>
              <p><strong>One year for review to increase PA by $23?<br></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/The%20Poor/poor3rs.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="170"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Against the estimated $1.98 billion a year from the two-percentage point hike in Goods and Services tax, , for which the reason given for the hike was to help the poor, acceding to MPs Seah Kian Peng and Halimah Yacob’s request to increase the PA allowance by only $23 a month from $290 to $313, is only 828,000 ($23 x 12 months x 3,000 PA receipients), which is only 0.04 per cent of the $1.98 billion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In other countries, schemes for the needy are almost invariably always adjusted for inflation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In this connection, I would like to suggest that our financial assistance schemes be automatically indexed for inflation, just like public transport fares are adjusted for inflation in the fare increase formula.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">When was the last time the $ 1,500 monthly household income criteria generally used for financial assistance revised ?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">I try to put myself in the shoes of the over 3,000 Singaporeans on Public Assistance, and I think they may find it hard to understand why it takes more than a year to conduct an “ongoing review” to pay them just $23 more a month, when they are reeling from the effects of high inflation.</span></p>

              <p>The success of Singapore's development has drawn much discussions among scholars (Nyaw and Chan, 1982; Pang, 1985; Lira 1988; Chng, Low and Toh, 1988; Lee 1996b). However, amid its modern structures and clean streets some Singaporeans are living in poverty. Certain groups of people, such as the working poor, have been left out of the success of the city state. Others have concluded that income and racial inequality have risen (Pang, 1975; Islam and Kirkpatrick, 1986; Lee, 1992; 1995a; 1995b; 1996a). Like many industrialized and affluent societies, public policy in Singapore has not been successful in eradicating such social ills. As Singapore's population ages, elderly with inadequate financial resources will likely slip into poverty. The state strongly upholds meritocracy, and only provides education and training to enable its citizen to achieve in society. Individual economic well-being is entirely dependent upon an individual's efforts. Hence, in comparison to other affluent societies, Singapore has very little to offer in terms of social assistance to those living in or near poverty.(1) Little is known of Singapore's poor and for that matter how Singapore deals with them. This article examines the changing nature and causes of poverty in Singapore and the anti-poverty measures that are in place.</p>

              <p>Incidence of Poverty in Singapore</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 1995 General Household Survey shows that Singapore has a population of about 3 million people of which 79% of the population were Chinese, 14% Malay and 6% Indian. Government officials acknowledge that Malays are over represented in the bottom of the Singapore economy. In terms of income, a 1991 survey showed that 45.8% of working Malays earned between S$200-S$599 per month, while only 29.7% and 38.3% of Chinese and Indians, respectively, were in this income bracket (Chiew, 1991). More recent statistics show that about 30% of working Malays are in the income bracket of below S$500-S$999 per month compared to 19% and 25%</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">Affluent Singapore feels pinch of inflation at 26-year highs</span></h1>
              <p><br><br>&lt;!-- google_ad_section_start --&gt;Singapore (ANTARA News) - From taking fewer taxi rides to eating out less and shortening shower time, residents of affluent Singapore are trying to cope with inflation, which has soared to 26-year highs.<br><br>Rising costs of housing, food, and transport have eaten into family budgets of Singaporeans as well as the large number of expatriates working in the city-state, consumers and analysts said.<br><br>Except for the ultra-rich, the impact of the sharp price increases has cut across social classes in one of Asia's wealthiest nations, they said.<br><br>Government figures show Singapore's annual inflation was at 6.7 percent in March, the highest since 1982, boosted by higher costs of food, transport, communications and housing.<br><br>The figure is more than double the inflation rate in Malaysia and higher than that of the Philippines, Hong Kong and Australia. Unlike bigger countries in the region, Singapore imports most of its needs.<br><br>"When the inflation rate is high, it affects everybody," said Serena, a businesswoman who lives near the prime Orchard Road shopping and would only give her first name.<br><br>Serena said even affluent families like hers have had to adjust to the rising costs by eyeing grocery prices more closely, using the car less and eating in fancy restaurants only on special occasions.<br><br>"You have to differentiate between needs and wants, what is necessary and what is not necessary. If you can get something cheaper, you don't have to go for branded (luxury) items," she told AFP.<br><br>While soaring inflation in developing countries, amid a global food crisis, has left many struggling to feed their families, Singaporeans are dealing with the impact of price hikes in their own ways.<br><br>For Janice Tan, 35, who works at a travel agency, the soaring prices have forced members of her family to shower only once a day to cut their water bill.<br><br>Water used to rinse vegetables is recycled to flush the toilet.<br><br>To reduce the electric bill, Tan said she told her maid to iron only office clothes -- and just the parts that are visible.<br><br>"It's a big deal for Singapore in that we have never had inflation higher than three percent," said Euston Quah, head of the economics division at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.<br><br>"It hits the poor badly because the poor spend maybe 40, 50 percent of their income on food," he said.<br><br>Quah sees inflation eventually easing to around 4.5 to 5.5 percent this year, while the government has forecast 2008 economic growth forecast of 4.0 to 6.0 percent.<br><br><br><strong>Harder for those earning less</strong><br><br>Amin Sorr, 65, who works with a shipping firm, said life has become harder, especially for those earning less.<br><br>With a monthly salary of 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,200 US), Sorr said he can cope, but friends pulling in 2,000 dollars or less are struggling.<br><br>"I know a lot of friends who have problems with their water bills... and even personal credit lines."<br><br>Local charities say rising food prices are also driving more Singaporeans, especially poor senior citizens, to join queues for free meals.<br><br>Salamah Salim, 40, who runs a food stall on the fringes of the business district, said: "Our expenses on food and rice have more than doubled over the past year. Rice and oil have risen tremendously."<br><br>Even expatriate professionals, particularly those with less generous housing allowances and other benefits, have been hit.<br><br>As apartment rents surged, some moved their families from condominiums that come with swimming pools, gyms and barbecue pits to cheaper government-built flats without such resort-style amenities.<br><br>"They raised our rent by 150 percent after our contract expired late last year," said a Filipino computer engineer, who transferred from a gated condominium to a government-built high-rise in the suburbs.<br><br>"I know several friends who have also made similar moves or are planning to move out once their leases expire," he said, requesting anonymity.<br><br>Dee Pritchard, who works at the Australian International School, said that except for being more careful with the grocery shopping and giving the children fewer treats, nothing much has changed in her lifestyle.<br><br>"I'm lucky I'm not in the lower income (group) which would be suffering a lot more than I do really. But at the end of the week, the cash is less. There is less savings." (*)</p>

              <p>Singapore, the only Southeast Asian country to avert a recession during the Asian Crisis, became the only Southeast Asian country to fall into a recession, or to quote the Trade &amp; Industry Ministry on 18 May 2001, a “technical recession”. The city-state enjoyed a prolonged period of economic growth between 1986 and 1997 averaging 8.6 percent per annum. However, after the Asian financial crisis, Singapore’s GDP is more volatile -</p>
              <p><img src="http://amrc.org.hk/files/Image/alu01.gif" alt="" width="279" height="214"></p>
              <p>According to quarterly reports by the government, unemployment has been steadily increasing in the run up to the recession. By June 2001, unemployment had reached 3.4 percent, breaching the internationally accepted unemployment level of three percent. The official unemployment rate worsened to 4.7 percent in December 2001, the highest in 15 years, as companies retrenched workers. The rate exceeds the 4.4 percent recorded in December 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. The Manpower Research and Statistics Department published a report, Labour Market 2001, in March 2002 in which the overall unemployment rate was projected to reach about 5.5 - six percent by the second half of 2002. The record rate of six percent was in March 1986 resulting from a recession.1</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the cost of living in Singapore has not been reduced by much even in the economic downturn. During the second half of 2001, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.5 percent for households in the lowest 20 percent income group but fell by 0.3 percent for the top 20 percent income group. For households in the middle 60 percent income group, the CPI remained stable in this period. Households in the lowest 20 percent and middle 60 percent income groups registered lower inflation rates of 1.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively in 2001, the rises being due to dearer cooked food and higher electricity tariffs. The CPI for households in the top 20 percent income group dipped by 0.2 percent in 2001, due largely to lower car prices.2 In a study done by the Relocation Journal &amp; Real Estate News in August 2000, Singapore was the fifth most expensive city to live in after New York, Seoul, Tokyo, and London.</p>
              <p>It is with this backdrop that one should understand the wage situation and the impact on workers. Except for unionised companies in Singapore, there is no legal minimum wage. Therefore there is really no jurisdiction over how much an employer should pay an employee or offer a job-seeker.</p>
              <p>Between an employer and employee, there exists a contract of service and the terms and conditions cannot run contrary to the Employment Act, which stipulates the minimum standards for an employee, e.g. overtime, annual leave, and maternity benefit, but nothing governs the actual salary that should be paid to an employee, apart from compensation calculations in the Third Schedule of the Employment Act and that employees who earn more than S$1,600 (US$869)3 are not entitled to overtime etc.</p>
              <p>In unionised corporations, the minimum wage is spelt out in a collective agreement (CA) between company and union, legally endorsed and renewed once every two to three years. It also provides for an annual increment, being negotiable on an annual basis after National Wages Council (NWC) recommendations. But if the company can prove that it is not doing too well, any agreed increment can be smaller or even waived for the year, and the CA can be re-negotiated before it expires. There is also an Industrial Arbitration Court if employers refuse to up salaries in the CA to a reasonable level.</p>
              <p>However, wage negotiations between employer and union rest on the employer’s right to a final say, and typically in Singapore, success rests much on the usual day to day ‘good relations’ between employers and unions, that help foster the possibility of securing better benefits for workers. Direct confrontation between employer and employees, using the courts, is generally frowned upon.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower in December 2001 backed a call from the NWC for severe restraint or cuts in wages. Citing worsening economic conditions and uncertainty in 2002, the government urged companies to freeze or cut wages in the city-state’s worst recession yet. A survey quoted in the Straits Times revealed that 18 percent of Singapore-based companies had already frozen pay levels in 2001 and 28 percent planned to do so in 2002. During the financial crisis in 1998, the NWC asked workers to accept wage cuts of between five and eight percent.</p>
              <p>At the height of the 1998 financial crisis, the government announced a blanket policy of cutting the employers’ share of monthly Central Provident Fund (CPF) payments to employees from 20 percent to 10 percent. This policy was aimed as a cost saving package to revive the economy but it placed the burden on ordinary wage earners and not on the state’s coffers. This 10 percent cut was applied to all companies regardless of profitability and financial situation. It penalised workers even in companies that were breaking profit records. Overnight, many workers had trouble keeping up their mortgage payments that were serviced through the CPF. Instead they had to dig into their salaries to make up the difference. There was a public outcry and some quick fix measures were assembled to assist those who were unable to continue paying mortgages.</p>
              <p>It was then that the NWC recommended the monthly variable component (MVC), to allow companies to adjust monthly wage bills quickly to remain competitive and minimise job losses. This move exempted the government from involvement and becoming the target of bad publicity and collective unhappiness of the workers whose wages are cut. Over the years the number of companies that use the MVC has increased and wages in general have become more flexible. For instance the variable component of total wages was 15-16 percent in 2000 compared to 11 percent in 1997. The Ministry of Manpower is now seeking to speed up the implementation of the MVC even further and to promote performance-based pay structures to replace seniority-based systems. In addition, other components of the employment benefits system, including implementing medical co-payment and changing retrenchment compensation so that companies have greater flexibility in managing wage costs.</p>
              <p>The central issue in introducing and operating the MVC is how to define a justifiable cut in each industry, especially in large MNCs where profit transfer between countries could be easily carried out. Since financial situations and management capabilities vary from company to company, it is unclear whether the Ministry of Manpower and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) are sufficiently informed about the technical details of industries to function as a watchdog against unjust wage-cuts or to set out intelligent guidelines for a MVC cut.</p>
              <p>Major concerns are, how much to allow companies/government to cut the MVC? How to calculate and define a cut? Does a well managed economy require frequent MVC wage-cut to rank and file workers to keep employment levels? Can a company convert part of a worker’s present salary into MVC?</p>
              <p>As cited earlier, Singapore is the fifth most expensive city to live in. Of all components of cost, workers’ wages are not the highest contributing cost factor. Workers’ wage levels have actually fallen behind other Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. If factors other than workers’ wages are the biggest contributors to high costs, it is not logical to pursue wage cuts as a priority. More should be done to lower government charges and duties.</p>
              <p>There is a concern that adjusting the workers’ wage structure for the sake of keeping business costs low may be abused, leaving workers more vulnerable. For instance, it is not usual for government wage surveys to show that since the Asian crisis wage growth has reached pre-crisis levels. However a comparison of pay increases of rank-and-file employees shows that throughout the 1990s average annual wage growth declined from eight to ten percent in the early half to between five and seven percent in the latter. This is largely due to attempts to keep business costs down, and wage cuts are one way of doing this.</p>
              <p>Employers are suspected of using the economic crisis as an excuse to restrain wage increases, creating an employer’s market. For instance, the starting salary of university graduates in the latter half of 2001 fell to pre-1997 secondary school-leaver levels. Without a minimum wage, employers, even when making profits, can offer graduates salaries below what used to be the graduate benchmark of $1,600.</p>
              <p>Wage issues remain problematic as they are not regulated by law. The NTUC is said to play a pragmatic role, but a tame one in the perception of some. Part of the problem is that the NTUC is aligned with the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) and therefore its independence is questionable. Changes arising from economic restructuring, which included job cuts and new forms of employment relationships, are unsettling workers and testing worker-employer relations. But the PAP wants to deepen the tripartite partnership between its administration, the employers, and the NTUC, to preserve ‘harmonious’ industrial relations.</p>
              <p>The push for more MVC is in the name of minimising retrenchment in a volatile economy. The increasing attack on wages is explained in part as a result of a drop in workers’ productivity. So workers are presented as receiving less wages because they are less productive and not because the PAP administration has introduced a policy that penalises workers first.</p>
              <p>The MVC is a political solution to a political problem. It is of no help in saving jobs at all. It is unclear whether MNCs will stay in Singapore simply because they can cut wage costs by five to ten percent when wages constitute less than ten percent of total costs to most MNCs. Such cuts are increasingly painful for workers when the CPI does not fall in the same period. If workers’ wages are cut by more than ten percent without corresponding reductions in other living costs, more people will find it difficult to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>A thorough review of all other aspects of the Employment Act is thus urgently required to meet the fast changing job environment. It is worrisome that historically the government has a tendency to chant policies that favour large MNCs and government linked companies (GLC) and ignores the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME). Tremendous efforts have to be made to regain the balance where SMEs can co-exist with MNCs and GLCs for a more balanced and sustainable economy.</p>
              <p>Because Singapore is small, housing space, land use, transportation, water, and electric supply, must become more efficient. But they are increasingly costly and without subsidies. Additionally, health care, education, food, and recreation are also becoming expensive. There is increasing public pressure to review policies to include further concessions on state subsidies and relief.</p>
              <p>With increasing anxiety to make ends meet, more workers are treated for depression as Singapore slips into its deepest recession. The Institute of Mental Health reports that the number of patients has almost doubled since April 2001. Psychiatrists confirm that more people are now treated for depression. Men, especially 30 to 49 year-olds, feel the most heat in the current economic meltdown.</p>
              <p>The government has long rejected the notion of a welfare state, preferring short-term incentives to those in need to avoid relying on welfare. In Singapore, families shoulder part of the responsibility and more than 260 private welfare organisations take up the rest, some aided by public money. However the challenge is for the government to provide a safety net for people when the global economy is volatile, impacting the local one, and family and community support is gradually being eroded.</p>
              <p>In the run up to the general election in November 2001, the government announced budget measures that included tax relief and rebates for conservation charges and utilities. To boost PAP chances in the elections it introduced New Singapore Shares which is essentially a staggered cash handout. However, such rebates and handouts are not efficient ways to redistribute accumulated state wealth and are not targeted to reduce basic household needs or to create jobs. Most see them as short-term stop gap measures motivated by electoral politics.</p>
              <p>There has been some decentralised and delegated social service through the government administered Community Development Councils (CDC) aimed at identifying and helping the poor. Short-term loan schemes have also been introduced. The budget for CDCs grew from S$19 million in 1997 to S$153 million in 2001, largely due to social assistance schemes. But eligibility for government assistance is stringent so as not to encourage a dependence mentality. The Ministry of Community Development and Sports, together with other agencies link short-term financial assistance closely with job counselling, job seeking, training, and placement.</p>
              <p>However, short-term assistance is generally judged as not guaranteeing that the unemployed can become economically stable. Job placement services have on many occasions not been successful. A Jobs Task Force has been set up to give training, job assistance, and counselling to those affected by economic restructuring. There have also been promises of jobs in new ‘growth areas’. But what ‘growth areas’ are, how many they will employ, and when, is not clear. Areas such as wafer fabrication and biotechnology that were celebrated as the way forward are high-tech and need specialists so their contribution to job creation is questionable. The promise that more Singaporean companies operating world-wide will facilitate Singaporeans to work overseas is also speculative. Most Singaporean companies overseas are GLCs and it is unclear how good they are at creating new jobs at home.</p>
              <p>In this context, there is a need to review the CPF scheme, to ensure that in addition to providing members with adequate savings for housing, medical, and retirement, that there is a scheme where some form of social security is available for sudden job loss and a means to tide over times when jobs are scarce. In the absence of new jobs for older and retrenched workers, rules need relaxing to allow the growth of a ‘regulated informal sector’. Singaporean workers need to be able to operate from home to keep costs down and at the same time to be gainfully employed to make a contribution to the economy and society.</p>

              <p>Everytime I work late and pass by the bus interchange near my place, I notice the growing number of homeless at the bus interchange. Each pillar at the bus interchange now as a permanent resident (PR). You ever wonder why the homeless sleep next to pillars....so that the tired people coming back from work don't step on them when they sleep. Since every pillar is now occupied, I wondered where a new homeless person would go. The Sunday Times has the answer....</p>

              <p>Some of you might have criticised the govt for building the extravagant Esplanade spending hundreds of millions tax payers money on a building that hosts operas, musicals and symphonies that only the richer citizens can afford. But you are wrong, while the rich get to watch "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lesmis.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Les Misérables</span></span></a>", the poor get to sleep in the underpass between Esplanade and the Citilink Mall at night. The Esplanade is indeed a very useful building both rich and poor people get to use it. <a rel="nofollow"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"></a><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 376px; cursor: hand; height: 143px; text-align: center;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3daGHJXWI/AAAAAAAAAOs/rkooYE79OQI/s200/homeless2.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="109"></a>It seems <em>not all</em> the 'sleepers' are jobless. Why do people with jobs need to sleep in those places? The answer is very simple and logical. The real wages of some workers are now so low that after the numerous bouts of utilities increase, transport fare increase, and rental increases, there is hardly any choice but to sleep on streets. I would do it too if I make $900 a month because I can save $100 on transport because I sleep close to where I work, another $200 on rental and $50-$100 of utilities bill....in other words I can save half my income, by sleeping in public places.</p>
              <img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 267px; cursor: hand; height: 75px; text-align: center;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/Rn3ggmHJXXI/AAAAAAAAAO0/83Lp4F__PLg/s200/homeless3.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="62">As Singapore heads for top 1st world status, the cost of living can only rise relative to the wages of low income workers. We can see greater utilisation of our public buildings, MRT stations, bus interchanges and 24hr MacDonald's outlets as they double up as sleeping areas for these sleepers. It is great that our beloved govt had such great foresight to invest so much money on these beautiful buildings such as the Esplanade we now know how much vision it took.....I really couldn't imagine that the Esplanade could be actually be that useful to everyone.</div>
              <p><strong>Meet Singapore's nomad families</strong></p>
              <p>by Braema Mathi, Senior Writer</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For four years,  the newly-weds lived on the beach.</p>
              <p>From 2003 to 2007, they lived off their catch from the sea, did odd jobs, and washed in public toilets.</p>
              <p>At 16, Madam Siti (not her real name), a Primary 4 dropout, married Mr Osman (not his real name), 25, despite parental objections. They were ostracised by both their families.</p>
              <p>They lived in a series of pitched tents at Changi, East Coast, then Sembawang beach. When Madam Siti gave birth, her sister and in-laws took them in for a few months before conflicts drove them out to the beach.</p>
              <p>This went on till last year.</p>
              <p>Madam Siti, now 21, and Mr Osman, now 30, and their two children aged two and five, showed up at the Ministry of Community Development Youth and Sports' Thomson Road headquarters, asking for help to end their nomadic existence.</p>
              <p>With rising living costs and property prices, the number of nomadic families is on the rise, according to nine family service centres (FSCs) here. Each of the FSCs says it sees between 10 and 30 such cases each year.</p>
              <p>Lakeside FSC counsellor Edwin Quek says: 'We are seeing more cases. The families cannot cope with mortgage loans payments and the cost of living.'</p>
              <p>His centre has already received eight calls for help between March and May this year from displaced families, up from one or two cases earlier this year.</p>
              <p>Social workers also say they see more families - with one FSC it was one case a month - sleeping at void decks, often with children in tow and showering in public toilets.</p>
              <p>This goes on till they are allotted rental flats from the HDB or till they can afford to rent or buy a unit in the open market.</p>
              <p>But the wait for an HDB rental unit is now up to 15 months - double the waiting time in 2006. The number of people applying for heavily subsidised HDB rental flats has shot up by at least 30 per cent in the past few months.</p>
              <p>Now, there are 4,000 eligible applicants in the queue, waiting for one- and two-room rental units. Depending on household income and other factors, the rents are fixed between $26 and $205 a month for a one-room flat and between $44 and $275 for a two-room unit, a fraction of the market rates.</p>
              <p>Fallible family network</p>
              <p>According to social workers, most of these transient homeless are divorcees and the down and out.</p>
              <p>In some divorce cases, after the matrimonial homes are sold, proceeds split between spouses and creditors paid off, there is often not enough cash or savings left to buy another flat.</p>
              <p>Others are caught in a swirl of bad decisions and poor planning, resulting in the banks seizing their flats over unpaid mortgage payments.</p>
              <p>The official approach taken in dealing with such families is for social workers at FSCs - as a first option - to encourage homeless families to live with relatives, friends or strangers.</p>
              <p>This is also for practical reasons, as relatives often charge less rent - from $150 for a room - compared to the $500 and above that landlords who are strangers charge.</p>
              <p>But such arrangements often do not work out. With not just one but several children and boxes of belongings in tow, the goodwill of relatives quickly crumbles under the pressures of living together in a small space.</p>
              <p>Social workers cite cases where rules imposed by relatives and landlords - that include no cooking, minimum noise levels and a cap on water usage - are difficult for families to adhere to. Before long, typically no more than a month or two, they are thrown out again or prefer to leave.</p>
              <p>When their circle of kin is exhausted, they start living in void decks, beaches, quiet stairwells in commercial buildings, bin centres and out of vans.</p>
              <p>'They just want to live on their own, without all the tension of living with others,' said a social worker with 10 years of experience, who declined to be named.</p>
              <p>The problem of nomadic families was hotly discussed in Parliament early last year. Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Inderjit Singh noted then that many residents were in negative equity and had defaulted on mortgages, which resulted in repossession of their flats by banks. He asked if these cases were increasing because of the policy change of allowing banks to handle HDB mortgages.</p>
              <p>In reply, Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, Parliamentary Secretary for National Development, said families planning to take up a bank loan should understand the implications of taking on this responsibility.</p>
              <p>Each month, about 60 repossessed flats reportedly go on sale. Many of these belong to families which over-extend themselves financially, for example, by buying a bigger flat than they can afford.</p>
              <p>'Families often do not manage their budgets well and there is no planning,' said Mr Quek.</p>
              <p>Others lose their homes because of sudden illnesses or loss of jobs. Many more are victims of ignorance. They do not know, for example, that the HDB rules include a 30-month waiting period if they have sold their flat bought with certain conditions from the HDB, or that they can apply for another HDB loan or subsidy only subject to conditions, if they have already done so previously.</p>
              <p>'They go into this buying and selling of flats without knowing enough about all the policy hitches. They need more guidance,' said Mr Quek.</p>
              <p>No room at shelters</p>
              <p>The most vulnerable nomads tend to be divorced, lower-income women with children, said Mrs Rachel Lee, a social worker with Fei Yue FSC.</p>
              <p>Most landlords are reluctant to take in lone women with children. They wonder if they can pay up and fear getting drawn into their family problems.</p>
              <p>'There is also a huge constraint in space as, often, they tend to have a lot of household stuff that they have to take along, besides the children,' she said.</p>
              <p>The hardest hit are nomadic children, who need a stable environment but end up on the move all the time, showering in public toilets and witnessing endless family feuds. Many end up skipping school.</p>
              <p>Mrs Chua Yen Ching, principal of NorthLight School that caters to students who fail their Primary School Leaving Examination, said: 'It is important for a child to come to school without having such problems as a barrier to his or her learning.'</p>
              <p>But there are few long-term solutions in sight.</p>
              <p>Singapore currently has only one shelter for displaced families. New Hope Shelter for Displaced Families, run by New Hope Community Services at Yishun, has housed 41 families since it began operations a year ago.</p>
              <p>It can accommodate 22 families at any one time. It now has four families on the wait-list - which ranges from 'a few days to weeks, depending on how long it takes current residents to leave', says its centre manager, Mr Ravi Philemon.</p>
              <p>Each family can stay up to three months and has to pay $150 a month for utilities and food rations.</p>
              <p>There are three other shelters here, meant for battered women. All three - a 40-bedder run by the Good Shepherd Sisters, a 22-bed Star Shelter run by the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations, and a 50-bedder run by the Singapore Anglican Community Services - have taken in homeless families, though they are not equipped to handle children.</p>
              <p>Their social workers note that many of the families stay beyond the three months allowed, simply because they cannot afford market rate rentals.</p>
              <p>Self-catering shelters?</p>
              <p>The HDB has announced that it will build more rental flats, from the current 43,000 units to 50,000, over the next few years. It will also review the eligibility criteria for rental housing to help the 'genuinely poor'.</p>
              <p>One way forward, suggests Mr Chua Wei Bin from Ang Mo Kio FSC, is to set up a committee that includes both social workers and HDB officials to better assess options for homeless families.</p>
              <p>That way, besides the HDB's eligibility criteria, other issues like family dynamics can be factored in. For example, on paper, a nomadic family may have siblings they can stay with, but they may be estranged or feuding.</p>
              <p>Pastor Andrew Khoo of New Hope Community Services, which runs a shelter for the homeless, said that more temporary shelter space will be needed and hopes to raise funds for it.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Ngiam Tee Liang, head of the National University of Singapore's social work department, adds that although the state wants homeless families to seek refuge first with relatives and friends, those who have tried their best but failed to go down that route should not be left out in the cold.</p>
              <p>'With close monitoring, genuine families in need must be helped in getting a home,' he said.</p>
              <p>Another solution that Mr Gerard Ee, executive director of Beyond Social Services, suggests is to offer a self-catering shelter for families where they manage themselves and their finances on their own.</p>
              <p>Once they show that they are capable of moving on, they are given HDB rental units.</p>
              <p>'Shelters unfortunately institutionalise dependency. They must be short-term solutions. Families must find their own solutions. This way, we give them that opportunity and also respect their lifestyle, without going into rescue mode,' he said.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports placed Madam Siti's family in the New Hope Shelter. They stayed there from June to September last year and were given counselling, budgeting and parenting classes.</p>
              <p>Mr Osman, previously a cleaner earning $600 a month, has since landed a higher-paying job with help from the shelter. He is now a car-washer, making $800 a month.</p>
              <p>The family now lives with Madam Siti's sister in a one-room flat. They stick to a tight budget worked out by the centre for them - $50 for food, $100 for rental, $100 for transport, the rest for the children.</p>
              <p>When Madam Siti turns 21 next month, they will join the queue for an HDB rental flat, forgoing their dreams of buying a flat, as they know they cannot afford it for now and do not wish to get into debt.</p>
              <p>'I never want to go back and live at the beach. I want to live in our own house soon and build up our lives,' she said.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">Why is it that it would appear that about two years later in 2006, according to MCYS, the amount of assistance given out has only increased by 70 per cent, against an increase of 157 per cent in the number of needy families?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;">In September 2007, a press statement from the CDCs, in conjunction with its tenth anniversary, said that they managed to give out $45.7 million in the form of food rations, vouchers and bursaries to help the less fortunate last year. In the same year, more than 51,000 families and individuals received social assistance via the CDCs – more than four times the number of cases assisted in 2001.</span></p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">What happened to Singapore, the land of plenty?</span></h1>
              <p><em>This article is taken from <a href="http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/1110/nat.singapore.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Asiaweek</span></a> (For Richer Or Poorer), to allow our readers to revisit the issues of welfare, the aged, foreign workers, and wages in Singapore.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>It is quite troubling to note that this article was first published in Nov, 2000. The problems faced by those who are struggling are largely the same today - 6 years on.</em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/hk.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="160" height="238" align="right">The article is by Roger Mitton</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Lee Chong Peng is the symbol of Singapore’s broken dream. She lives alone in a one-room flat on about $3 a day. “I watch television and take short walks,” she says. “My legs ache now, so I cannot go so far.” But without fail, every Wednesday afternoon, Lee takes the lift down eight floors to the ground level of her public housing block.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There she joins dozens of other poor folk from her district in Chinatown to sit, waiting, on concrete benches. Lee, 84, chats with friends, while others remain sullen, lacking even the warmth of comradeship. At 5 p.m. they all form into a line and shuffle forward to receive a plastic bag containing six eggs, 1.5 kg of rice, a can of baked beans, a can of sweet corn, one packet of hot chocolate, one packet of coffee, some cereal and a single toilet roll. Without this weekly donation from a charitable group, Lee and her neighbors find it tough to survive. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What happened to Singapore, the land of plenty?</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In its rush to forge a manufacturing, then a high-tech economy, the city-state rarely bothered to look back at those who were lagging. Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew developed a system based on hard work and government support for industry. Singaporeans were expected to earn their rewards. The results were astounding: a middle class emerged to build Asia’s second-richest country. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But with the advent of globalization and an influx of cheap foreign workers, Singapore’s economy is becoming increasingly ruthless. According to its own statistics, the nation’s rich are getting richer and the poor are falling further behind. To most Singaporeans, the mere existence of poor folk in need of care packages comes as a shock. And this realization has prompted an uncharacteristic bout of soul-searching. The rich-poor disparity strikes right at the heart of Singapore’s development model — and challenges the city’s smug self- image. Many younger Singaporeans raised in middle-class comfort are beginning to think that Lee’s ideal is outdated; they argue that the government has a responsibility to care more for the downtrodden. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Lowest 10% of society had an average monthly income of only $75.81</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The issue burst into Singapore’s consciousness in May, when the media reported a Department of Statistics disclosure that the lowest 10% of society had an average monthly income of only $75.81. Officials said the figure (which included unemployed and retired people) had been misused to present a distorted view. Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo presented a raft of numbers in parliament to show that Singapore’s poor really were not so poor after all. “The standard of living among the lower income has gone up,” said Yeo. Nearly all had televisions and telephones, on average they had about $11,500 in the state retirement fund (CPF), and all but a quarter lived in 3-room or larger flats. “In other words, many in the bottom 10% have significant wealth in the form of CPF savings and their homes,” added Yeo. “They are not an underclass.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The hot potato might have cooled there, except that in a classic piece of mistiming the government then announced substantive pay hikes for the civil service. On average, salaries jumped 13%. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong’s wage soared to a cool $1.1 million — almost $3,000 a day. Goh says the new wage bill will cost each Singaporean about $6 a year — the equivalent of five plates of char kway teow, a popular noodle dish. But opposition legislator Chiam See Tong noted: “I think U.S. President Bill Clinton receives only about S$600,000 [about $343,000] a year. Surely that should also be enough for a minister in Singapore?” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Goh claims qualified Singaporeans are not interested in such a “poor” salary. “Several high-fliers pleaded young family or lack of interest for not coming into politics,” he says. “They never say it is because they can earn more outside, but I can tell clearly that pay is a consideration.” The ill-timed raise further exacerbated the festering subject of income divergence. Admits legislator Charles Chong: “The ratio between the top and bottom has been increasing.”</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">“They won’t starve or go homeless or be refused medical care”</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As a result of prosperity and shifting values, attitudes toward the poor are slowly beginning to change. Singapore already is doing something to reduce the adverse effects of the income gap. For starters, the city’s poor don’t have it too badly. Says Chong, from the ruling People’s Action Party: “We look after our disadvantaged people. They won’t starve or go homeless or be refused medical care.” Adds National University of Singapore academic Mukul Asher: “By spreading the consumption of basic amenities like housing, schooling, healthcare and transport in a more equal way than other societies, the government mitigates some of the effects of large and growing income inequalities.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But helping the poor directly would go against the grain of the ruling party’s old guard. Notes veteran oppositionist J. B. Jeyaretnam: “It is Lee Kuan Yew’s dogma that nothing is free in this world. There is no free lunch, no handouts, no subsidies.” Jeyaretnam has called on the government to lessen the inequalities by providing free medical treatment, free education and old-age pensions to those in need. Younger members of the ruling party are beginning to realize that poverty is a growing problem — one that the government will have to address to stay in power. “It’s true, there is a kind of paranoia among older leaders about Singapore degenerating into a welfare state,” says legislator Chong. “But nowadays, the younger leaders are saying that if we want to be considered as a humane, civilized society we have to help these poor people more.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>How did Singapore leave its poor behind?</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In part, cheap foreign labor shoved unskilled Singaporeans aside. To achieve high growth rates, the government has increasingly allowed larger numbers of foreign workers to make up the labor shortfall caused to some extent by low birthrates. Explains academic Asher: “Singapore does not believe in redistribution of wealth. Instead, it always wants high rates of growth to reduce poverty levels.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Electrical fitter Bazlur Rahman, a Bangladeshi working in Singapore, puts up with his small salary — something few Singaporeans would be willing to do. He earns $11 a day and saves more than $170 a month, which he sends home. Bazlur lives with 3,200 other foreign workers in a cramped, tight-security compound at Kaki Bukit. Says Asher: “Singapore has been able to use these foreign workers and their low wages and conditions to maintain its competitiveness and high growth rates.”</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Reduce wages or be priced out of the market</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To compete with Bazlur and thousands like him, Singapore workers must reduce their wage demands or be priced out of the market. Yet to keep top-end managers and professionals at home, the government and its private sector must make matching offers. Says Asher: “All round you have got a larger wage inequality; wealth is more concentrated.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Admits Prime Minister Goh: “Yes, the income gap in Singapore is widening because of globalization and the knowledge revolution, which have enhanced the value of talent dramatically and pressed down the wages of the unskilled.” Can the government do anything? It has already ruled out the idea of holding down wages at the top or artificially raising wages at the bottom. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It is already running capable retraining programs. Says Goh: “We must not envy those who have made it rich. Rather, we must provide the opportunities for more to be like them. It means operating on the basis of meritocracy — that you can get ahead in life if you work hard, regardless of your background.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What else can be done? As a result of growing concern about the poor, the government has set up nine community development councils, which are jointly funded and operated by local officials and charities. Community leaders draw up policies and every dollar donated to the councils is matched three-to-one by the government. This initiative has moderated attitudes. “We don’t want the government to take over the voluntary welfare organizations, but we’ll enhance their work,” says Chong. “If in this way we are seen to be helping the less well-off, there will be fewer social problems.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Money politics</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But where there is money, there is politics. Opposition legislators such as Chiam claim that the ruling party uses this aid for political gain — in effect, to buy votes. “The chairman of a community development council will go around like Santa Claus giving money away to the poor and unemployed,” says Chiam. “It’s the politicians who go out to give this money and of course they’ve got to get their votes. That’s the way they dish out welfare: very selectively.” The council chairman in Chiam’s constituency, the ruling party’s Andy Gan, denies that aid is used to garner votes. “Our office is open to all residents and I do not ask for their votes before seeing to their needs,” Gan says.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The circumstances of Teng Ah Mui suggest that this community-based assistance is inadequate anyway. Teng, 54, lives alone and recently began receiving charity food packages each week in order to survive. She has held various unskilled jobs, but since falling and injuring her leg six months ago she now relies on public assistance. After paying her rent and utilities bills, she is left with about $80 a month. “It’s not enough, so I have to depend on food donations and help from friends,” she says. A decade ago, it might have been easier for Teng to rejoin the workforce. These days, there is too much competition for menial work and too few opportunities.<br><strong><br></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Public assistance of about $115 per month.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The bottom line is that the government’s willingness to help the poor is still minimal. In Singapore, children are required by law to look after their elderly parents. But often they cannot do this, especially if they are low-income, single children. Admits Minister of State without Portfolio Matthias Yao: “Parents know what their children can afford. They don’t bring cases to court when they know that their children are too poor to look after them.” If neither friends nor family can help, and if the person is unable to get work, then — and only then — will the government step in with the barest subsistence-level help. Last year 2,238 people qualified for this public assistance (usually about $115 per month). The number has increased each year for the past three.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">So what will happen when the number of aged people quadruples in the next 30 years? They already comprise the largest chunk of Singapore’s new poor (the other major components are retrenched workers, single mothers and the disabled). Even now, rich Singapore cannot look after its older folk without drawing on the services of charity groups. Says Asher bluntly: “The government will need to do more.” If it does not, income disparities could threaten the country’s cherished social harmony. They might even eat into the ruling party’s monolithic hold on power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The government knows this is a serious matter — perhaps the most serious socio-economic threat Singapore has faced. Despite some bluster about meritocracy, retraining and limits on foreign workers, no one really knows a surefire way to solve the problem. Says Asher: “Policy-makers are still thinking in terms of economic output and growth; while the people are increasingly thinking more and more of their welfare.” But don’t count out the ruling party. It has been skillful at adapting to meet the needs of its citizens. Adds Asher: “One can expect that they will begin to change as this issue becomes more pressing. They will have to in order to maintain their legitimacy and their support.” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Just don’t call it welfare</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For now, the subject remains virtually taboo. But soon Singapore will be forced to find a remedy for its new, more disparate, reality. Just don’t call it welfare.</span></p>

              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">No poverty in S'pore? Think again.<br><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Singapore's poor emerge as delicate political issue</span></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Asian Wall Street Journal</span><br>January 30, 2007<br>SINGAPORE<br><br>By YAROSLAV TROFIMOV<br><br>DURING rush hour in Singapore's ultramodern subway system, wrinkled old ladies squat on the underpass floor with handfuls of small tissue packets that they sell at one Singapore dollar, or 65 US cents, apiece.<br><br>These are the poor of Singapore, left behind by the boom that has transformed this tropical island of 4.5 million people into a regional business, finance and technology hub. Poverty here isn't nearly as desperate as in its Asian neighbors, or even many Western societies. But it has become an increasingly sensitive political issue, prompting new tax and social policies that the government is expected to unveil in the annual budget presentation Feb 15.<br><br>According to official statistics, at least 40% of Singapore's households saw their real incomes decrease from 2000-2005 -- while the overall economy posted some of the world's highest growth rates, surging by 7.7% last year.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"The question is, who is all this growth for?" says Manu Bhaskaran, an adjunct fellow at Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies and a partner at the Centennial Group, an advisory firm. "Shouldn't the government be aiming for lower growth, but better distribution? "</span><br><br>The government's strategy so far is to pursue a balancing act of generating more revenue for helping the poor without scaring off the global investors who have long been attracted by the city-state's low-tax regime. "The dual objective is to ensure that the Singaporean economy continues to remain competitive, and to strengthen the inclusiveness of Singaporean society," says Lim Swee Say, secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress and a government minister.<br><br>Most of Singapore's poor are in their 50s or older, and many are onetime manufacturing workers who lost their jobs to cheaper competitors in China, Vietnam or India. Many lack education and English-language skills that are needed to prosper in expanding sectors such as services and finance.<br><br>It is only in recent months that senior officials began to speak out on the problem of structural poverty, recognizing the potential perils for a multiracial, multireligious society such as Singapore's. "It is essential for us to tilt the balance in favor of lower-income Singaporeans, because globalization is going to strain our social compact," Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech last fall.<br><br>Singapore's People's Action Party, founded by Mr Lee's father Lee Kuan Yew -- who is still a senior government member with the title of Minister Mentor -- has controlled the island since independence in 1965, winning nearly every seat in parliamentary elections. The country's mixed population of Chinese, Malays and Indians has accepted decades of the PAP's often authoritarian rule in exchange for phenomenal economic growth that has transformed this former British trading outpost into one of the world's most prosperous states.<br><br>While providing subsidized housing and health care, Singapore's government has long resisted calls for European-style unemployment benefits for the poor, describing welfare as a "dirty word" and rejecting the idea of a minimum wage. Instead, the government has come up with the concept of "workfare" -- a large-scale program to top off the incomes of those Singaporeans who accept low-paid work. Details of the program will likely be given in the budget presentation.<br><br>"We can't stop the income gap from widening because the wages are determined by the global competition for knowledge workers, and by the excessive supply of unskilled workers," says Mr. Lim, the minister and union leader. "But what we're trying to do is to make sure that the widening income gap doesn't necessarily translate into a widening social gap."<br><br>Most developed economies fund such social programs by redistributing wealth through progressive taxation: the top-bracket federal income tax rate is 35% in the US, and at least 40% in most of Western Europe. But Singapore is ideologically opposed to this model: the island-state has been steadily slashing its top income-tax rate, from 55% at independence in 1965 to 28% in 2000, to 20% today. Making up for the shortfall in revenue, Singapore established a general sales tax, currently at 5%.<br><br>It is the sales tax that the government is planning to tap again to pay for the "workfare" initiative. According to Mr Lee, with the new budget the sales tax is likely to rise to 7% -- a measure that, economists calculate, will generate some S$1.5 billion of extra government revenue.<br><br>The plan is far from popular. In the two months since Mr Lee in November first mentioned a likely sales-tax rise, the proposal elicited unusually vocal criticism from Singapore's corporate world and opposition leaders alike. The influential Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry complained the sales-tax increase is "likely to have an immediate and detrimental effect on local spending," undermining Singapore's long-term competitiveness.<br><br>Sylvia Lim, leader of the Singapore Workers' Party and an opposition Parliament member, also pointed out that the poor -- the ostensible beneficiaries of the proposal -- would be hurt the most. "We need to strengthen our safety nets through some redistributive policies," she asserted, adding that consumption taxes, such as the sales tax, "are generally regressive and likely to compound the underclass problem."<br><br>While the government usually ignores the minuscule opposition in this tightly regulated country, the business community's pleas found a receptive audience. Aware that corporate taxes are even lower in rival business centers such as Hong Kong and Ireland, Singapore signaled it would sweeten the pill for businesses: To compensate for the higher sales tax, the corporate tax rate, currently 20%, would be shaved by at least one percentage point.<br><br>"This is a tough and competitive world," Minister Mentor Lee told Singaporean journalists as he explained the planned corporate-tax cut. "People don't come here because they like Singapore -- they come because the returns are better."</div>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The gainful employment of the Fresh Graduate is one of Singapore's emerging areas of policy concern. With news that the economy contracted by 2.0 percent in 2001, driven down by a slump in external demand, and with unemployment at 4.7% (for the first quarter of 2002?), already at a 15-year high, Singapore's Fresh Graduates face a grim reality ahead. With about 20,000 students graduating from universities in 2001, the largest graduate cohort to date, the Fresh Graduate can suddenly become an overnight "New Poor".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Fresh Graduate is likely to have completed his or her studies recently at a local or foreign university. He/she is in the early 20s and comes from a middle-income family background (ie monthly gross family income between S$2,500 to S$5,000). Having been schooled in Singapore education system from kindergarten right through to junior college or polytechnic. The majority is both financially and academically competent and will have had enrolled in local varsities. Others, whose family wealth can afford, would have returned from stints at overseas universities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Not having to worry about finances to fund his/her education from kindergarten to university, the Fresh Graduate would have worked solely to earn extra pocket money during the academic terms and especially, during the school vacation. "Giving tuition" is the most common, followed by part-time work such as selling life insurance. Wearing branded clothes and togged with latest fashion accessories, the hip and IT-savvy Fresh Graduate indulges in heavily in movies, Internet and occasional pubbing and clubbing. However, there are a significant number with humbler backgrounds to whom tertiary education was an expensive endeavour. The Fresh Graduate or their parents would have taken out loans that require paying back.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">ASPIRATIONS</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Fresh Graduate, having led a much-sheltered life, may aspire lofty goals or bold ambitions for his/her future. He/she expects to graduate from University with at least a basic Degree and enter the workforce thereafter. He/she is looking to getting a well-paying job that pays above S$2,000 for entry-level starters. As he/she matures in the workforce, he-she will be looking for higher remuneration and better employment benefits elsewhere if his/her employer cannot meet their inflated salary demands.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Fresh Graduate sees education and necessary paper qualifications as the leveler of social equity and individual wealth. The ability to excel in studies are justified by the meritocratic ideology of the political leadership. The myriads of state-sponsored and corporate scholarships further perpetuate meritocracy's myth of academic achievements as the key to improving one's destiny and social status.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Fresh Graduate looks towards further education after getting his/her first degree. Finances and academic results permitting, 10% would have done his/her Masters/Ph.D or gotten a second degree straight after graduation without joining the workforce. Next 60% would hope to save up through their working years as they go back to school in their late twenties or early thirties for their MBA or Doctorate thereafter. The remaining 30% would not return to school because they are on scholarships, financially burdened,lack academic interest, well-to-do enough with no impetus to upgrade, or a combination of the aforementioned.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Fresh Graduate does not aspire to marry and settle down early. He/she places career as No. 1 priority and forming a family at No.2. He/she is likely to be pre-occupied with eking out a niche upon joining the workforce and sets the timeline of 30 years old to attain his/her goals. Often, the strive for career exploits would be long-drawn such that the majority would only be able to actualize their goals in their mid-thirties. As such, majority of those who already developed relationships along the way in their careers, would only settle down with the final partner in their thirties. Otherwise, relationships or potential partners usually do not last beyond the early working years.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">DEBTS &amp; LIABILITIES</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Fresh Graduate is likely to have been put through costly tertiary education by virtue of bank loans or using parental Central Provident Fund (CPF) to pay. As total fees for local studies amount to around S$20,000 for a 3-yr degree programme, he/she would depend on bank loans/CPF funds that pay up to 70% of the total cost less necessary Government subsidies thrown in. Upon completing his/her studies and obtaining that degree, the debt starts to take its toll. Monthly bank interest rates pegged to the prevailing prime rates would be chargable unto the respective loans from the month of July upon the Fresh Graduate's discharge from tertiary studies. Thus, he/she will want to repay the principal sum in the shortest time to avoid excessive incurrence of prime interest rates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Fresh Graduate would have to face this burden head-on immediately upon graduation. The means of repaying the loan is through a gainful employment that pays above S$2,000 per month in order to relieve parental workload, to repay the loan, to sustain the family and in some cases, to finance the schooling of younger sibling(s). Worse still, the purchase, maintenance and fuel costs of private transport as well as the sustenance of insurance policies, would sap a significant portion of finances that the Fresh Graduate can earn.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For a minority involved in relationships, the psychological burden could be increased. Fresh Graduates who contemplate getting married would be saddled with the usual wedding costs as well as housing costs. The property market has seen increasing HDB prices in the last decade as the costs of owning an apartment flat oft eat into the CPF and whatever reserves of the newly-weds. Most would be indebted until they reach their thirties to pay off incessant bills, assuming dual-income nuclear family that is. Coupled with current falling property re-sale prices, the total costs of owning a HDB flat outweigh the benefits reaped from possible cashing in on the property market.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">ETHNIC MINORITIES</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another phenomenon in Singapore among the Fresh Graduates is the issues that affect minority students. Singapore has an ethnic composition of 80% Chinese, 14% Malay and 5% Indians and 1% Others. Malay and Indian students generally state they have a tougher time than their Chinese counterparts in finding jobs. It is not unusual for minority graduates of local and foreign universities to remain a long time unemployed while looking for a job in the private sector. Often they complain that most jobs require prospective applicants to be able to speak Mandarin, the language of the majority.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Many often opt to enter the public sector. Those who do find employment in this sector find themselves as civil servants in the teaching profession and uniformed services. But increasing even civil service jobs are becoming competitive as more graduates are turning to the public sector as jobs are shed in the private sector. A small number, eventually end up in ethnic based welfare and cultural organisations, but the number of positions available in these institutions is minimal.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">WHAT LIES AHEAD</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The job market has been saturated by young, enthusiastic aspirants fresh out of polytechnics, local and foreign universities competing with the retrenched and foreign talent for a shrinking employment pie. In the National University of Singapore alone, there are estimated to be 20,000 foreign students. Out of this, Malaysians and Mainland Chinese constitute one-third each. The recent increase in the number of Asean Scholarships given by the government reflects an uncomforting preference for influx of foreign talents into a tightening labour market at saturation point.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Singaporean Fresh Graduate is unhappy with state-sponsored scholarships to foreign students who compete with them in the University as well as in the job market. These foreign students are awarded prestigious scholarships inclusive of academic cost subsidies and living allowances. Free from any financial obligations or local bills to pay, such foreign students graduate together with the Singaporean Fresh Graduate need only to work in Singapore for 5 years to repay their dues. Those who provide documentary evidence of 100 rejection letters of employment applications are also deemed to have served out their bond.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mature foreign talent may be useful to certain sectors of Singapore's embattled economy only. The PAP administration's revised policy of allowing in foreign talents who earn above S$2,500 in monthly pay or hold minimum NTC-3 (secondary school equivalent) qualifications may not be adequate in sieving out the real and indispensable foreign talents and the real McCoys. Nowadays, many foreign talents are undercutting the wage market by accepting graduate appointments with less-than-equitable pay. Given a strong Singapore Dollar relative to their home currencies, such foreign talents have no problems with lowered remuneration in Singaporean terms despite the disparity in level of expertise, skills with matching rewards required. The Fresh Graduate hence has limited job opportunities for himself/herself. Prospective employers thus rather choose such "value-for-money" foreign talents, thereby depriving aspiring local graduates of their rightful jobs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Giving private tuition, doing relief teaching, taking temp/short-term contract jobs, taking enrichment courses and finding money to continue post-graduate education have become common stop-gap measures. The Fresh Graduate faces a private sector that is downsizing and a public sector that practices selective recruitment. Add on the proposed starting of the fourth university not too far from now, the problem may be worsened.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Job creation has not been able to keep pace with the production of thousands of graduates, undermining the principle of supposed social leveling via paper qualifications. While only the service industry provide undisputed job openings, such hiring sources have selective employment criteria and its remuneration is at the lower-end of the market rate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Certainly, the Fresh Graduate may then be forced to eat the stale humble pie rather than remain as a literal New Poor?</span></p>

              <p class="headline"><strong>Help for the poor: So close, yet so far</strong></p>
              <p class="bylineM gap">By Vivi Zainol, For The Straits Times</p>
              <p>WHY do needy Singaporeans continue to fall through the cracks despite the Government’s array of public aid schemes?</p>
              <p>To tackle this question, 18 of my students at Ngee Ann Polytechnic interviewed more than 30 low-income households for a vacation module. They found the biggest barriers to be education and language.</p>
              <p>Many are illiterate. With little knowledge or understanding of schemes to help them, it’s not surprising that some say they know the Government is helping them, but they feel it is not doing enough.</p>
              <p>Some would rather get an extra job than ask for help. Others struggle to make themselves understood and say they do not have the time, money or energy to make return trips to their MP or Community Development Councils (CDCs) to ask for more help.</p>
              <p>For those who did bother, a common complaint heard by students was that the CDC officers are rude.</p>
              <p>Several years ago, as a Straits Times community reporter, I had heard the same comment when I asked a woman with three children, and whose husband was in jail for a drug offence, why she did not ask for help. Describing how her experience with CDCs turned her off, she said a CDC officer had sarcastically asked her: ‘Didn’t your husband leave you any money?’</p>
              <p>‘If he had, why would I be asking for help?’ said the troubled woman, who had contemplated suicide.</p>
              <p>One group of Ngee Ann students decided to observe CDC officers in action after receiving the feedback. At one CDC, officers were unfailingly polite - it was the low-income group which was being demanding and uncooperative. However, all the CDC officers were Chinese - help-seekers speaking Malay and Indian had to struggle to make themselves understood.</p>
              <p>At another CDC, student Nurlina Fatima Shafrin, 18, recalled how a CDC officer was heard commenting loudly to another officer nearby on how ‘irritating’ the people who had come to ask for help were, even when the latter, who were filling up forms, could hear them.</p>
              <p>What is interesting to note is that interviews by students uncovered a perception among low-income earners that the higher-educated tend to look down on them and are arrogant. Formally attired CDC officers also unintentionally give the impression that they are less approachable.</p>
              <p>Not all CDC officers are trained social workers - there are not enough social workers to go around in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Also, some members of the low-income group can be downright prickly, believing they have a right to receive handouts from the state.</p>
              <p>But surely everybody deserves good customer service regardless of income group? The poor have their pride too.</p>
              <p><strong>Could CDCs perhaps train their staff to understand the sensitivities and psyche of the lower-income group? Steps could also be taken to ensure that staff on duty speak different languages and dialects. Members from the low-income group could even be employed to help.</strong></p>
              <p>It’s good news indeed to hear that the Government has raised public assistance spending from $96 million to $140 million, and ComCare funding from $43 million to $67 million. With that much money allocated to the needy, it makes sense to ensure these funds reach the ones who need immediate assistance.</p>
              <p>Take Mr Ramasamy Ratran, a 52-year-old Indian man, who was a pitiful sight when my students and I chanced upon him. He was lying on the dusty floor in his rented two-room flat, having been discharged from hospital just two weeks earlier.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, a former female neighbour and a male friend had taken it upon themselves to look after Mr Ramasamy, who is epileptic and living on his own. Medical social workers had settled his hospital bills, but he was getting no financial help while he was recuperating and unable to work.</p>
              <p>‘Can you please help him? He needs help. When I first came two weeks ago, there was no electricity. His flat was in total darkness,’ pleaded the former neighbour, who had helped to top up his prepaid utilities smart key to get the electricity back on.</p>
              <p>Mr Ramasamy was not the only one my students and I found in need of assistance. When barber Yahya Pinghani, 39, was hospitalised for a kidney problem, he could not work and had no daily income for weeks. His children skipped school that week because there was no money for the bus fare.</p>
              <p>Mr Pinghani’s wife Murni, 41, complained how, after three weeks, her single friend who had applied for help with her at a CDC had already received assistance while she and her family were still waiting. She revealed that her family owed a whopping $4,000 in utilities bills.</p>
              <p>CDCs do give $200 once-off emergency assistance, after which the needy wait six to eight weeks for CDCs to respond. So what do they do when help is a long time coming? Many see their MPs, getting a $50 cheque for their trouble, or resort to collecting food from voluntary welfare organisations. How many know that they can get immediate assistance from your Citizens Consultative Committee? I did not either, for that matter, till I asked around.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is time that bulletin boards in HDB flats were put to better use. They could advertise where the poor can get help and give details of the schemes. Many low-income earners are illiterate, but the ones who are not will surely help to spread the word around.</p>
              <p>It could also be made mandatory for medical social workers in hospitals to inform social workers or CDCs when a person who is from the low-income group is discharged so they will give him temporary financial assistance during his recovery period.</p>
              <p>Last year, the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) set up a community care network for the elderly in Ang Mo Kio. Under this scheme, grassroots leaders are trained by family service centres to identify needy households.</p>
              <p>Perhaps if this outreach scheme is formally extended to include all needy Singaporeans, not just the elderly, it could be used to ensure no one falls through the cracks and to explain the help schemes available to the needy.</p>
              <p>MCYS minister Vivian Balakrishnan recently called on Singaporeans to be eyes and ears on the ground, saying ‘we need the whole of society’ and not ‘an army of bureaucratic civil servants’, when he outlined $140 million worth of initiatives for the low-income group.</p>
              <p>The findings of the 18 Ngee Ann polytechnic students who ventured out of their classroom may not be conclusive, but simple observations like theirs should not be belittled. Like any jigsaw puzzle enthusiast will tell you, even one small piece makes a difference.</p>

              This paper identifies and discusses the challenges of social cohesion in Singapore. It argues that a generation of materialistic orientated policies of the incumbent People?s Action Party government has resulted in certain social costs which Singaporeans now have to bear. This is the phenomenon of relative poverty identified as the ?new poor? in Singapore which has lead to an absence of bonds between people and a loss of ownership over the policy making process. It suggests initiating wide public consultation to find out what Singaporeans want and how they would like to rectify the problem.</p>

              <p><strong>Introduction: Social Cohesion under the PAP</strong><br>In Singapore, social cohesion is always viewed in terms of race relations and not social class relation. The city-state has a multiracial population, with a Chinese majority of nearly 77%, Malays about 14%, Indians about 8%, and others 1.7% (Department of Statistics, 2003). Hence nation-building or national identity construction exercises were undertaken to overcome the racial and cultural divide.</p>
              <p>The aim has been to search for that formula that would allow people to stay as a nation. This search has included symbols such as the national flower ? the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid; the floral-motif shirts and dresses; the Merlion; the national carrier Singapore Airlines and the republic?s economic competitiveness. As well as processes such as the national school system, national service for men and an ethnic quota to match the national demography for public housing living.</p>
              <p>By and large, this approach to social cohesion is seen as having been unsuccessful given concurrent ethnic policies such as compulsory second language in schools and presenting Singaporean society strictly along ethnic lines have prevented the emergence of any kind of shared identity and processes that goes beyond the natural emergence of colloquial English ? Singlish. But more importantly, its failure can also be attributed to the fact that ?unity? or ?tolerance? in maintaining harmony in multicultural relations are not valued on their own right as opposed to being important pre-requisites for ensuring societal stability to enable economic success.</p>
              <p>Popular political participation is also severely regulated for the same reason ? to ensure social cohesion. The primary concern is economic development hence strict control was placed over civil liberties and organised political action. The government has a full set of laws and practices that restrict the opposition and government critics. These include: defamation law suits, the Internal Security Act, the Public Entertainment and Meetings Act, the Societies Act, the Undesirable Publications Act, the Political Donations Act and government ownership of the media. Further the government controls the election machinery, determines the timing of elections and boundaries and continuously amendments the electoral rules (National Democratic Institute, 2001).</p>
              <p>Government policies under the PAP since Singapore?s independence in 1965 have instead emphasised asset accumulation as a measure of success, prosperity and social cohesion. Economic development was to provide the focus and common building block for a disparate migrant community to evolve into a nation. Social cohesion in this context is a narrow definition, where being united means being united in support of the PAP in order to secure a material advantage. In fact the PAP tries to pass itself as a national movement and as the only entity capable of ensuring economic prosperity and ensuring cohesion in a multicultural society. On the basis of this argument the PAP has demanded that the people unite behind it, and with the people responding to this carrot, it has enabled the PAP to stay in power for over forty years.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans as a result find that they are caught in a system where the language of materialism is the prominent yardstick of success. The continuous pursuit of a higher standard of material living, even at times of difficulty, is equated with the meaning of life. This extreme emphasis on materialism has been at the expense of social cohesion where being a people and achieving a sense of community has been lost.</p>
              <p>Ever since the PAP took office in 1959, it has systematically promoted elitism and put in place a highly paid elite class in positions of control with limited accountability to the people. Elitism has been fostered by the scholarship system where a number of top students are sponsored by the government and sent to the best universities abroad, and after they graduate they are channeled into the civil service, statutory boards, armed forces, and government linked companies (Seah, 2003). Through a mechanism of co-option and rotation, many find themselves involved directly or indirectly with the PAP. This has led to the emergence of a singular and incestuous elite which has resulted in a lack of transparency and accountability in the way the country is run, especially in fiscal matters (Restall, 2000).  </p>
              <p>As a consequence, Singapore of today is run by an elite class and not by the people. Ordinary Singaporeans who earn so much less and now struggling on a daily basis do not have the guarantee that their views on policy matters will be taken seriously. The PAP elite class system has created a situation where there can be a Singapore without Singaporeans. The people find that their ownership over the policy making process has been surrendered to a few.</p>
              <p>The PAP?s elite management of the economy has resulted in increasing the burden of Singaporeans. Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, Singaporeans have been through a series of "poverty waves". Many have seen the value of their assets fluctuate drastically as the global economy grapples with the dot.com bubble burst, consequences of September 11, the US led war in Iraq and the aftermath of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Asia.</p>
              <p>For most Singaporeans there has been no significant improvement in economic conditions, and many face deepening structural poverty. This is poverty caused by changes in the structure of society such as the emergence of the knowledge society, which builds on education and lifelong learning for the integration of all members into social and economic life. Retrenchments continue, many businesses either continue to post losses, down size or relocate elsewhere, job prospects look bleak, the cost of living and doing business in Singapore remain relatively high, our young people joining the work force for the first time find it harder to secure jobs and start at much lower salaries. More families and individuals are unable to pay their mortgages, utilities and other bills.  A principle cause in the deterioration of the present economic situation is in part the absence of checks and balances and part in the elite management of the Singapore economy.</p>
              <p>In light of these inadequacies, there is a need to put forward different policy options through ideas and solutions derived from Singaporeans and provide those essential checks and balances and non-elitist practices to ensure social cohesion and to repossess ownership over the policy making process. One way to achieve this is by initiating wide public consultation to find out what Singaporeans want and how they would like to rectify the problem.</p>
              <p><br><strong>PAP?s middle-class materialism and its social cost</strong>   <br>The ability to purchase has been touted as the material success that the ruling People?s Action Party has bequeathed to the people, especially the middle-class. Singaporeans are told that to ensure such material gain they have to continue to return them to power. To entice the voter, election after election, material rewards are held up - including upgrading of public housing for which the residents have to pay. This material carrot is the PAP?s operating principle for Singapore. Over the years, Singaporeans have internalized placing a dollar value on everything, including relationships between people. Bonds that tie people together, especially in a multicultural society, are artificially manufactured thereby preventing the emergence of a true national and social conscience.</p>
