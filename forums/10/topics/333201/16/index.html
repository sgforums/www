              <blockquote>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the million-dollar paychecks of ministers and top civil servants must be raised to close a 55 percent gap with private-sector income levels.<br><a href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/images/medium_homeless8.jpg"><img style="float: right; margin: 0.2em 0px 1.4em 0.7em; border-width: 0px;" src="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/images/thumb_homeless8.jpg" alt="medium_homeless8.jpg"></a><br>Lee said the current S$1.2 million (US$790,000; €590,000) salary a minister currently draws is outdated, remaining unchanged since 2000, and is 55 percent of a 2.2 million Singapore dollars (US$1.4 million; €1.1 million) a year benchmark.<img style="float: left; margin: 0.2em 1.4em 0.7em 0px; border-width: 0px;" src="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/images/thumb_OurGlobalHome.jpg" alt="medium_OurGlobalHome.jpg"><br><br>The salary benchmark for ministers and top civil servants is pegged at two-thirds of the median income of the top eight earners in each of six private sector professions including bankers, lawyers and engineers, he said.<br><br>"We have to close this gap," the prime minister said at an annual Administrative Service dinner Thursday evening.<a href="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/images/medium_malay_family3.jpg"><img style="float: right; margin: 0.2em 0px 1.4em 0.7em; border-width: 0px;" src="http://singabloodypore.rsfblog.org/images/thumb_malay_family3.jpg" alt="medium_malay_family3.jpg"></a><br><br>The high salaries for ministers have caused grumbling in the wealthy, tightly controlled city-state, but the ruling People's Action Party has said ministers' and civil servants' pay must be high enough to attract the best talent and prevent corruption.<br><br>Parliament approved the benchmarks in 1994, according to the Straits Times newspaper.<br><br>"We do not expect (public servants) to make <strong>unreasonable financial sacrifices</strong> to be in the public sector, but they must feel a sense of idealism, of duty and responsibility, and of a larger purpose," Lee said.</blockquote>

You were lowly-educated, but you had a job, a small but steady income. You bought a flat from HDB (quite cheaply too) and you could afford the mortgage payments.<br></span></span></p>
              <div></div>
              <br>
              <div><span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">15 years later, you fell on hard times. You lost your job. Your savings ran out. You begged and borrowed. Finally you sold your flat, took the money and repaid the loan sharks, and you stayed with relatives. </span></span></div>
              <br>
              <div><span style="font-size: 85%;"></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">You kept on looking for jobs, but except for the occasional odd job as a cleaner or dishwasher, you failed - you became just another one of those "structurally unemployable" Singaporeans. Finally, you couldn't even get the cleaner/dishwasher job anymore, because the foreign workers from Bangladesh beat you to it. </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 85%;"></span></div>
              <br>
              <div><span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Another year passed, and then your relatives kicked you out. They said that they couldn't go on feeding you forever. They aren't rich themselves. So you decided to rent a one-room HDB flat.</span></span></div>

              <br>

              <div><span style="font-size: 85%;"></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The reason?

When he applied for a subsidised Housing Board rental flat, he was rejected because he could not meet the eligibility conditions.<br><br>The second person, added Dr Maliki, defaulted on the mortgage payments on his flat, which he had purchased from the open market with a housing grant.<br><br>When the bank repossessed his flat, he applied to HDB for a subsidised rental flat, but was also rejected because he could not meet the eligibility conditions.<br><br>HDB advised him to consider buying a smaller flat or to live with his siblings, or to stay at temporary shelters run by volunteer organisations, but he declined all these suggestions.<br><br>Dr Maliki highlighted three options for families who have trouble finding a roof over their heads: subsidised rental flats, open-market rental flats, and living with extended families.<br><br>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio GRC) asked: 'Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that there are also many cases of residents who are in negative equity and, as a result of that, the banks are forcing a sale and therefore they actually don't have excess cash to help them rent a flat, buy a flat?<br><br>'And that these cases are increasing because of the policy change of allowing banks to handle HDB mortgages?'<br><br>Families planning to take up a bank loan should understand the implications of taking on this responsibility, said Dr Maliki. </span></span>

Who knows, Mas <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_9" class="blsp-spelling-error">Selamat</span> may well have gotten out of Singapore in the same way that these cigarette hawkers got in.<br><br>It's quite likely that at least some of these cigarette hawkers are illegal immigrants. If they had entered Singapore legally on a work permit, they'd have a job and probably wouldn't risk it by selling contraband cigarettes in broad daylight. They'd have to be at work anyway.</p>

              <blockquote><span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="font-size: 180%;">2 years on, employers still skirt day-off clause</span><br></span>Should there be a law to get employers to comply?<br>Friday • April 25, 2008<br><br>NEWLY arrived, a maid asked her employer if she could get a rest day. Her employer was incredulous.<br><br>"If I wanted to give my maid a day off, I would have hired one from another country," said the employer, who had signed her up on the assumption that maids of some nationalities were more pliant than others.<br><br>Faced with an employment contract that requires them to either give their maids a rest day, or compensate them accordingly for working, some Singaporean employers have sought ways to get around the terms or extract the most from their workers.<br><br>And this begs the question of how much has truly changed for the 170,000 foreign domestic workers in our midst — two years after the industry association put together a standard contract requiring employers to give maids at least one day off a month.<br><br>A Today straw poll of 50 employers found that only 62 per cent gave their maids a rest day.<br><br>With some industry watchers criticising the rest-day clause as being too flexible, should legislation be put in place to mandate the issue? ....</blockquote>
              <p>There are several simple reasons why many Singaporean employers are reluctant to give their maids a day off.<br><br>You see, the maid's work permit comes with numerous conditions. For example, she cannot prostitute herself. She cannot have sex with a boyfriend. She cannot get pregnant. And she cannot (of course) commit any crimes such as shoplifting.<br><br>If she does any of the above, then she has breached her work permit conditions and the employer has to repatriate her. And if the maid runs away before the employer can do that, the government will fine the employer $5,000. For that matter, the government will fine the employer $5,000, if the maid runs away for <em>any</em> reason.<br><br>If you didn't know any of the above, then either you do not employ a maid, or you didn't read the small print of the Manpower Ministry's work permit conditions.<br><br>(On a positive note, maids running away is such a common occurrence that it is possible to buy insurance for it. On a negative note, maids running away <em>is</em> a common occurrence).<br><br>Many employers are afraid that if their maid has a day off and gets herself into trouble, the employer will not only have to solve the trouble, but also have to fork out $5,000 as a free gift to the government.<br><br>(Not that the government will then help you solve the trouble. It's just a fine, plain &amp; simple).<br><br>Intuitively, this smacks of gross unfairness. The employer gets punished not for something he did, but for something that somebody else (the maid) did. Furthermore, once the maid leaves the employer's residence, the employer has no way of monitoring where the maid goes and what she does there.<br><br>To encourage employers to give their maids a day off, the government needs to change these ridiculous rules.<br><br>I agree that employers should be fined and punished, if they fail to perform their responsibilities as employers - for example, paying the maid's salary on time; providing adequate food and accommodation; and ensuring a safe, secure working environment.<br><br>But employers should not be held responsible, for things that a maid may do, of her own free will. When the maid goes out on her rest day, the employer simply has no viable way to ensure that she will not do anything that breaches her work permit conditions.<br><br>(Which, by the way, are quite extensive and onerous).<br><br>We may draw a curious parallel with Mas Selamat's escape, and PM Lee's determined, if muddled, defence of Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng in Parliament.<br><br>Mas Selamat ran away. But PM Lee said that Wong Kan Seng was not at fault and should not be punished in any way. The reason being that Wong Kan Seng personally did not do anything which allowed Mas Selamat to escape.<br><br>Strangely, if your maid runs away, it IS your fault and you SHOULD be punished. Even if you did not personally do anything to let her run away (apart from giving her a day off).<br><br>Similarly, if your maid becomes pregnant, it IS your fault and you SHOULD be punished. Even if you did not personally do anything to make her pregnant.<br><br>Oh well. What can I say? Maids are not terrorists. But then you are not Wong Kan Seng. So the rules remain stacked against you. Wong Kan Seng gets off lightly, but you won't. Even if his lapse has far greater, and graver, implications than yours.<br><br>Your runaway maid wouldn't blow up Changi Airport, would she?</p>

              <p>I was at Raffles City today. A man was standing at the entrance handing out flyers to passers-by. He handed two to me. Here they are:<br><br></p>

Basically, they help you to emigrate to other countries. Click <a href="http://www.ocscglobal.com/?task=static&amp;PID=2"><span style="color: #de7008;">here</span></a> to see some of the services they provide.<br><br>I'm not sure how many such companies there are in Singapore. If there are more than a few, then it's really quite sad. It means that so many Singaporeans want to leave their country that a viable mini-industry has sprung up to help them do so.<br><br>Interestingly, OCSC is targetting Singaporeans who work in trades and occupations such as welding, fabrication, motor mechanics and so on. This is in sharp contrast to the typical profile that the Singapore government likes to paint of emigrating Singaporeans.<br><br>For example, in April last year, Lee Kuan Yew <a href="http://mrwangsaysso.blogspot.com/2007/04/lee-kuan-yew-on-emigration.html"><span style="color: #de7008;">said</span></a> that most Singaporeans are not actually able to leave. According to LKY, those Singaporeans who <em>are</em> able to leave are the "better-educated and talented ones", who represent the "top 20 to 30 per cent of educated Singaporeans".</p>
              <p>It seems that this isn't quite true. For example, Australia does give priority to would-be immigrants who belong to a "skilled occupation". However, "skilled occupation" does not mean "higher education qualifications", but refers instead to skills which are actually in demand in Australia.</p>
              <p>Australia's point system is described <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/1121i.pdf"><span style="color: #de7008;">here</span></a>. Motor mechanics, cooks and plumbers are awarded the same priority as accountants, engineers and lawyers .... and higher priority than life scientists, economists and mathematicians.</p>

              <p>The Straits Times reported a shocking piece of news yesterday. The article itself did not really highlight the point, but tucked it away somewhere near the end of the article (see bold text below).</p>
              <p>  <img id="fullSizedImage" class="media" style="width: 360px; height: 540px;" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y29/vnc2005/Swiss_Standard_of_Living/vag01.jpg" alt="vag01.jpg picture by vnc2005"></p>
              <blockquote>ST Feb 26, 2008<br>BUDGET DEBATE<br><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 130%">Rising costs, price hikes top concerns of MPs</span><br></span>They back strategies to keep inflation in check but say individuals and businesses need help to cope<br>By Lydia Lim<br><br>RISING costs and their impact on people's ability to make ends meet dominated the start of this year's parliamentary debate on the Government's Budget.<br><br>Many of the 19 MPs who spoke during the five-hour session praised the Budget for being forward-looking and generous, but 13 also voiced concern over a slew of recent price hikes.<br><br>MPs from the People's Action Party, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Michael Palmer, recited a litany of these increases in the past year alone.<br><br>Taking last December as an example, Mr Palmer said: 'The price of luncheon meat went up from $1 to $3, taxi fares went up, school bus fares went up and even the opposition's Potong Pasir Town Council added to the list with an increase in its service and conservancy charges.'<br><br>MPs said that businesses have been hard hit by steep hikes in office rents, and asked for tax reliefs to help them cope.<br><br>For individuals, Mr Palmer suggested that part of the Budget surplus of $6.45 billion be used to set up a contingency fund to help low-income families should inflation worsen.<br><br>Mr Singh, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and Industry, urged a review of the Government's avowed strategy to grow the economy as fast as possible in good years. This had contributed to the current situation of overheating and high prices, he said.<br><br>'The 'grow-at-all-costs' policy, with the cost increases triggered or allowed by the Government, have worsened the income divide,' he said.<br><br>At the same time, MPs threw their support behind the Government's five strategies to keep inflation in check.<br><br>These include allowing a gradual appreciation of the Singapore dollar to rein in imported inflation, and growing the economy so that wages for most workers go up by more than costs.<br><br>Nominated MP Cham Hui Fong of the National Trades Union Congress pointed out that last year had indeed been a good year for workers.<br><br>Those in the unionised sector enjoyed the highest bonuses since 1990 and the lowest retrenchment rate since 1994, she said.<br><br>But fellow NMP Eunice Olsen stressed that in tackling inflation, 'preaching' to Singaporeans to buy cheaper house brands was not a solution, as many people were already buying the lowest-priced options available.<br><br><strong>Four MPs - Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang, NMPs Gautam Banerjee and Ms Olsen, and Mr Singh - took issue with the wide gap between the Government's projected $0.7 billion deficit and the actual $6.45 billion surplus.<br><br>This showed that the Government's 'Budget marksmanship' had worsened, said Ms Olsen.<br><br>The four MPs also questioned whether the Government had been hasty in raising the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 5 per cent to 7 per cent last July, since it did not really need the revenue it generated. </strong><br><br>Both Mr Low and Mr Banerjee asked for the GST to be restored to 5 per cent.<br><br>But Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor warned against assuming that the economy would prosper and produce a surplus every year.<br><br>She said: 'The Finance Minister has been judicious in balancing competing priorities and seeking to invest in the medium- and long-term future, while dealing with the immediate concerns of citizens.'<br><br>More than 20 MPs are expected to speak when the debate resumes today.</blockquote>So early last year, the Government had projected a budget deficit of $0.7 billion. This means that according to the Government's own estimates, in 2007 it would collect $0.7 billion (via taxes etc) less than what it would actually need to spend.<br><br>It turns out that the Government scored a massive miss. In 2007, instead of collecting $0.7 billion less than it needed, the Government collected $6.45 billion more than it needed. From who?<br><br>You, the people. Of course.<br><br>Among other things, it becomes quite evident that the GST need not have been raised in July last year.<br><br>In his Budget Speech 2008, the Finance Minister is very quick to try to <a href="http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/speech_p1/p1.html#s1"><span style="color: #de7008;">explain away last year's massive miscalculation</span></a>: <blockquote>"We started the year expecting a growth rate of 4.5% to 6.5%, which was also in line with market forecasts. With actual growth at 7.7%, Corporate and Personal Income Taxes came in some $1.0 billion higher than projected. GST revenues also exceeded our projection by about $1.2 billion, mostly from higher consumption.<br><br>GST collection arising from the 2 percentage point hike in July is estimated at about $1.4 billion in total, which now just matches the size of the GST Offset Package and Workfare Income Supplement tranches that were distributed in FY2007.<br><br>However, the largest boost to revenues came from the exceptionally buoyant property market last year. Prices of private residential units rose by over 30%, much higher than industry forecasts of around 10% to 15% at the beginning of the year. The volume of property transactions went up by over 60%. Stamp duties consequently rose to an unprecedented $3.8 billion, $2.3 billion higher than expected. Other property related revenues were around $1.1 billion above projections. These were large gains, out of the ordinary, and which we cannot expect to see very often.<br><br>The overall budget surplus of $6.4 billion was therefore the result of a strong economy and property market."</blockquote>What is he saying? That the three biggest reasons that the Government collected so much more extra money from the people are:<br><blockquote>(1) the property market performed unexpectedly well, leading to a unexpectedly large increase in property-related tax collection;<br><br>(2) Singaporeans and companies made an unexpectedly large amount of money, learning to an unexpectedly large increase in income tax collection;<br><br>(3) Singaporeans spent an unexpectedly large amount of money, leading to an unexpectedly large increase in GST collection.</blockquote>By this time, you will conclude that the Singapore government is unexpectedly stupid at managing its own money and making its own financial estimates.<br><br>Either that, or you are a very kind person, and always willing to give the benefit of the doubt, and you will say that indeed, the property boom and rapid economic growth in 2007 could not reasonably have been foreseen.<br><br>But wait, I have more to say.<br><br>Click here for the Government's <a href="http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/revenue_expenditure/attachment/Revenue_Estimates.pdf"><span style="color: #de7008;">revenue estimates</span></a>. You'll see that the Government gets its money by collecting nine different classes of tax, namely:<br><br>B10. Income Tax<br>B20. Assets Taxes<br>B30. Customs and Excise Taxes<br>B40. Motor Vehicles Taxes<br>B50. GST<br>B60. Betting Taxes<br>B70. Stamp Duty<br>B80. Selective Consumption Taxes<br>B90. Other Taxes<br><br>Tharman has told you that in 2007, the Government collected much more money than projected, for B10, B50 and B70.<br><br>But there's something interesting which Tharman conveniently didn't tell you. The Government had over-collected money, not just for B10, B50 and B70. But for <strong><em>every single category of taxes</em></strong>, from B10 to B90.<br><br>Now how could the Government be so completely off the mark?<br><br>Personally, I see two possible explanations:<br><br>(1) The Singapore government is unexpectedly stupid at managing its own money and making its financial estimates.<br><br>(2) In early 2007, it was the deliberate intention of the Singapore government to make low projections for its revenue, so that it could publicly claim that there would be a budget deficit of $0.7 billion. Therefore more Singaporeans would be willing to believe that the 2% GST hike in July 2007 was necessary.<br><br>Which explanation do you prefer?

              <p>(Treasuer)Swan announced the cap, or threshold, during Question Time on
                          Wednesday. A little later, in the Senate committee rooms, Abetz told(Secretary)
                          Henry: "Can I advise you that the Government, in fact, has made a
                          decision in relation to the threshold?''</p>
              <p>To which Henry, quite visibly taken aback replied: "I'm sorry?''</p>
              <p>Abetz then said: "I thought this might surprise you. And it shows how these decisions are being made on the run.''</p>
              <p>Henry, again: "I'm sorry?''</p>
              <p>Abetz, again: "The Government has made a decision, Dr Henry.''</p>
              <p>Henry replied: "Has it?''</p>
              <p>Abetz continued: "And it's quite clear that you don't know about it
                          but during Question Time today, during Question Time today, the
                          Treasurer said and allow me to quote, "Because the Government believe
                          in a comprehensive guarantee for everyone we are going to put in place
                          a charge above a threshold. That charge or that fee above a threshold
                          will be about $1 million.</p>
              <p>"And you, secretary, were not aware of the Government's decision
                          until I just announced it to you courtesy of Senate Estimates. It
                          confirms to me, it confirms to me, that all this is being done on the

              <p>SINGAPORE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Singapore's parliament voted on Tuesday to amend the city-state's constitution to allow the government more access to the country's reserves to cope with a faltering economy, local media reported. <br><br>The changes to the constitution will allow the government to draw on more returns from investing the reserves, so that its income can keep pace with rising expenditure, reported the pro-government newspaper The Straits Times on its website. <br><br>Official flash estimates showed this month that Singapore's economy contracted at an annualised rate of 6.3 percent in the third quarter after seasonal adjustments, pushing the export dependent economy into recession for the first time since 2002. <br><br>'We have the resources to do this and we have the resilience to see ourselves through,' Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was quoted by The Straits Times as telling parliament. <br><br>Lee also said that the government was preparing measures to help businesses, families and workers cope with the downturn. <br><br>State broadcaster ChannelNewsAsia reported that the extra funds would be spent on research and development projects and medical care for the aged. <br><br>CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the move gave the government more options to deal with a gloomy economic outlook. <br><br>'It will give them the flexibility to use the funds for a rainy day and I think a rainy day may be upon us,' Song said. <br><br>The global financial crisis has led Singapore to announce last week it will guarantee all local and foreign currency deposits in banks, finance companies and investment banks operating in the city-state with immediate effect, backed by S$150 billion ($101.5 billion) government reserves. <br><br>Economies across <a class="iAs" style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal! important; FONT-SIZE: 100%! important; PADDING-BOTTOM: 1px! important; COLOR: darkgreen! important; BORDER-BOTTOM: darkgreen 0.07em solid; BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent! important; TEXT-DECORATION: underline! important" href="/forums/10/topics/">Asia</a> are set to slow this year as the financial crisis threatens to push developed nations into recession, depressing demand for Asian exports.</p>

              <p>Since Singapore became independent in 1965 - after being evicted from Malaysia - the country was under the leadership of PAP's LKY for more then 20 over years, followed by the annointed PAP's GCT.</p>
              <p>Throughout the 40 odd years of PAP rule, and through the economic downturn of 1987, as well as 1997 - and even 2002 - there was sufficient annual Government surplusses under the guidance of Finance Ministers : Dr Goh Keng Swee, Lim Kim San, Hon Hsui Sen, and Dr Richard Hu - to help tide Singapore over those critical periods.</p>
              <p>Why is it critical now that this Government had to dip into the Reserves to face the current economic downturn ?</p>
              <p>Why were questions not asked concerning the whereabouts of all the accumulated annual Goverment Budgetary Surplusses since the 1970s and transferred to the GIC and Temasek ?</p>
              <p>Has the investments made by the GIC and Temasek resulted in losses so severe that the Reserves must be drawn now - even with all the verbal assurances given by PM LHL that the approval is made now even though the chance of drawing is slim ?</p>

              <h1>Swiss Fight against Tax Cheats<br>Aids Singapore's Banking Quest</h1>
              <h3>Island Seeks Foreign Deposits to Diversify<br>Its Economy; Denies Wanting 'Evaders'</h3>
              <h2>By Edward Taylor and Cris Prystay</h2>
              </span><strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/home/us"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Wall Street Journal</span></span></em></a> <br>February 6, 2006</strong>
              <p>For decades, the ultrarich looking for discreet banking services gravitated to Switzerland, where account secrecy was sacrosanct. But when Swiss authorities acceded to pressure from the European Union to discourage tax evasion, the door opened for a new challenger to woo the world's wealthy: Singapore. The tiny Asian nation has beefed up account secrecy protections, has changed trust laws and has begun allowing foreigners who meet minimum wealth requirements to purchase land and become residents.</p>
              <p>Now private-banking money is flooding in from at least three sources: Asians who have grown rich from the booming Asia-Pacific economy, foreigners seeking to invest and do business in Asia, and Europeans moving money from Switzerland for tax purposes. Swiss banks are expanding in Singapore to get in on the action. The money flow demonstrates how one nation, in the borderless world of international banking, can use banking regulation as an economic development tool -- and how complicated it is for tax authorities around the world to plug revenue leaks.</p>
              <p>"While tax authorities have increased surveillance and regulation in a bid to stem the flow of investment capital and profits to low-tax jurisdictions, it's easier to shift money around than it used to be thanks to technology," says Chris Edwards, director of tax policy at Cato Institute, a Washington think tank that favors free trade. "Both legal avoidance and illegal evasion techniques have become more accessible."</p>
              <p>In Singapore's asset-management business, which includes private-banking, total funds under management rose to more than $356 billion at the end of 2004, from $94 billion at the end of 1998, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the nation's financial regulator. Roman Scott, a director of Boston Consulting Group in Singapore, estimates private-banking assets account for about $125 billion of the total.</p>
              <p>Singaporean officials involved in the private-banking push say the new foreign depositors are attracted by Singapore's sound legal system, lack of corruption and transparent financial systems. Some Swiss private bankers also have been billing Singapore as a way around new taxes in Switzerland, Luxembourg and tax havens such as Jersey in the English Channel. Under pressure from the EU to crack down on tax evasion, Switzerland imposed a withholding tax last July on some accounts held by EU citizens.</p>
              <p>"Singapore is one way of getting around the withholding tax," said Raymond J. Baer, chairman of Zurich private bank Julius Baer Holding Ltd., in a September interview following the announced purchase of Banco di Lugano, a small Swiss bank with private-banking operations in Singapore. Last week, Mr. Baer said that being in multiple jurisdictions enables the bank to serve an international clientele, and that the Singapore office was a platform for growth in Asia. "Singapore also offers a tax-friendly environment," he noted. A spokeswoman for the Monetary Authority says Singapore "does not seek to attract tax evaders."</p>
              <p>The number of private banks operating in Singapore jumped to 35 at the end of 2005, from 20 in 2000. International banks such as Swiss giants Credit Suisse Group and UBS AG have expanded private-banking operations in Singapore to cater to new demand from Asians and Europeans. Private banks typically provide customers holding at least $1 million of liquid assets with advice on investments, estate planning and taxes. They also often help the wealthy move assets abroad, which some use to avoid domestic taxes.</p>
              <p>Singapore has taken various steps to attract wealthy foreigners. Under legal changes made in 2004, foreigners with assets of at least $13 million now can apply for residency if they place $3.1 million in a financial institution in Singapore. Those applying for residency can use as much as $1.25 million of the $3.1 million to buy property in a government-backed resort-style residential development on Singapore's Sentosa Island. New residents are entitled to take advantage of Singapore's income-tax rate of about 20%. (Americans, however, face U.S. tax liability on their income regardless of where they live.)</p>
              <p>The incentives are prompting some private-banking customers to actually move there. Helmut Widdeck, an Austrian who owns a company in Hong Kong that makes leather shoe uppers, heard about the new policy from his private bankers at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong and decided Singapore would be a good place to semiretire. After Singaporean authorities conducted an audit to verify the source of his wealth, he says, he transferred the required amount to an account in Singapore, then bought a 8,557-square-foot oceanfront property at Sentosa Cove. He and his wife are planning their dream home, which they expect to cost $3.8 million.</p>
              <p>"For me, it's an interesting plan. I can invest the money into a property I want, and with that I get residency in a place I'd like to live in," says Mr. Widdeck, who is 63 years old. He says he will gain no tax benefit from the move because taxes in Hong Kong, where he used to live for eight months each year, are even lower.</p>
              <p>Last summer, Gianpiero Fiorani, former chief executive of Banca Popolare Italiana Scarl, shifted some assets to Singapore from Jersey, an offshore banking center that also came under EU pressure. He had assets with various banks and used Banco di Lugano, the Swiss bank now called Banca Julius Baer (Lugano) SA, to move the assets. Mr. Fiorani was arrested in December in Milan and remains jailed pending an investigation into suspected market manipulation and misuse of corporate funds. When he was questioned by prosecutors, he told them he had shifted the funds "to better protect the money" and for "peace of mind," according to a person familiar with the matter. His lawyers declined to comment, as did the spokeswoman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore. A spokesman for Julius Baer said the bank is cooperating with investigators.</p>
              <p>Singapore's private-banking expansion is part of a broad effort to diversify its economy away from electronics manufacturing, which faces increasing competition from lower-cost countries such as China. The government is trying to foster growth in biotechnology, and in chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing. In 1998, after the Asian financial crisis, it drew up a plan to turn Singapore into an investment-banking, mutual-fund and private-banking hub.</p>
              <p>Switzerland's private-banking industry, currently home to about 30% of offshore assets globally, was a model. Banking confidentiality has been a feature of Swiss law since 1934. For decades, foreigners could hold personal accounts recorded within the banks merely by numbers. Tax evasion is an administrative offense, not a crime. Swiss authorities refuse to cooperate with other countries' tax investigations, although they lift confidentiality in criminal matters.</p>
              <p><strong>Stiffer Laws</strong></p>
              <p>In 2001, Singapore stiffened laws against breaching the confidentiality of bank customers, making penalties for violators even tougher than in Switzerland. It imposed fines of $78,000, imprisonment for as long as three years, or both. In Switzerland, a similar breach could result in a prison term of six months or a fine of about $38,600.</p>
              <p>Singapore's private-banking initiative aimed to capture some of the new wealth created by Asia's economic boom. China's rapid economic growth has created fortunes throughout Asia. Liquid assets held by individuals in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan, are projected to increase 8.9% annually from 2004 through 2008, according to UBS, far exceeding the global annual average of 5.5%. Credit Suisse customers domiciled in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for $47.8 billion in private-banking assets as of September, compared with $105 billion in such assets from customers domiciled in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>While Singapore was bidding for new private-banking business, the EU was pressuring authorities in Switzerland and other offshore banking centers to take a tougher line with EU citizens who move money to reduce the taxes they pay. In 2000, EU finance ministers proposed ending client confidentiality in tax havens in Europe, including Switzerland. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, of Paris, also had pushed for an "exchange of information" on tax matters in an effort to suppress "harmful tax competition."</p>
              <p>Although Switzerland, Jersey and other offshore centers aren't EU members, they are dependent on EU nations for trade. Swiss authorities agreed to compromise. The new withholding tax compels Swiss banks to withhold a portion of interest earned on personal savings accounts held by EU citizens living outside of Switzerland, and to hand over some of that money to national tax authorities. The withholding tax applies to account holders who haven't reported all of their assets to their own tax authorities.</p>
              <p>Swiss bankers say the withholding tax and the continuing push to further restrict client confidentiality are discouraging wealthy Europeans from keeping money in Switzerland. Singapore isn't a member of either the EU or the OECD, so it hasn't faced the same pressure. By keeping money in Singapore, Europeans can avoid the new tax, some bankers say.</p>
              <p>Tax evasion in Singapore is a crime. But Singaporean authorities tend to respond to requests from other countries for information about tax evaders only when evasion of Singaporean taxes is at stake, says Jeffrey Owens, director at the center for tax policy and administration at the OECD.</p>
              <p>In a written response to questions about its policies, Singapore's Finance Ministry said requests for information from tax authorities in other nations are considered under the terms of international agreements designed to avoid double taxation. Singapore has such agreements with 50 countries, a Finance Ministry spokesman says.</p>
              <p><strong>'Open and Transparent'</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore bills itself as being tough on crime and free of corruption. Like Switzerland, Singapore says it cooperates with foreign authorities investigating money laundering and terrorism financing. "Our banking and financial system is open and transparent, and our rules are strictly enforced," the Monetary Authority of Singapore said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Singaporean officials traveled repeatedly to Switzerland to describe Singapore's private-banking capabilities to wealthy customers of Swiss banks, to Swiss bankers themselves and to lawyers specializing in wealth management. In February 2002, for example, Alison Lim, an executive at the Monetary Authority of Singapore, appeared at a seminar in Geneva. According to written promotional materials, the program touted Singapore as a "jurisdiction that protects clients' interests." Ms. Lim says she spoke about Singapore's role as a financial center and some trends in Asian investments.</p>
              <p>To become better versed in private banking, Ms. Lim completed an internship at UBS in late 2003, according to UBS. Ms. Lim declines to comment on the internship, but says the Monetary Authority routinely places staffers with various types of banks for short-term stints so they can learn about the industry.</p>
              <p>Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's prime minister and finance minister, has personally overseen the city-state's private-banking push. Before becoming prime minister last year, he served as deputy prime minister, finance minister and chairman of Singapore's Monetary Authority. Under Mr. Lee, the government set up working groups of bankers, consultants and ministry officials to drum up ideas for creating a global banking hub. In that capacity, Mr. Lee met regularly with Swiss and other international bankers to discuss how to structure a bank-friendly regulatory environment, according to some bankers who attended.</p>
              <p>One suggestion from the bankers: make Singapore's trust laws more attractive. Many European nations practice a concept known as "forced heirship," in which the state dictates the proportions of an estate that must pass to certain family members. These laws supersede wills and trusts. In December 2004, Singapore adopted new trust laws that let foreigners who set up trusts in Singapore avoid these limitations. Assets placed in trusts in Singapore have increased to almost $50 billion in 2004 from just under $25 billion in 2002, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore is now Credit Suisse's largest private-banking center after Switzerland. In 2005, the bank moved its head of international private banking to Singapore from Zurich and hired 150 additional staffers, bringing its total there to 450. By 2007, Credit Suisse aims to hire an extra 100 client advisers to serve the Asia-Pacific region. "Singapore is run like a company, and regulators want to help you win business," said Joachim Straehle, Credit Suisse's head of international private banking who relocated to Singapore from Zurich in April 2005.</p>
              <p>Credit Suisse runs a "eurodesk" in Singapore where bankers versed in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish work until almost midnight Singapore time to serve European clients. Credit Suisse now has at least $4.6 billion of European private-banking assets booked in Singapore, according to someone with knowledge of the figures. UBS has at least $3.1 billion of such assets, according to another person familiar with that bank. Representatives of both banks declined comment on those numbers.</p>
              <p>Clariden Bank, a Swiss private bank controlled by Credit Suisse, opened a Singapore office at the end of November. "Singapore will be the fastest growing offshore private-banking center in the next five years," says Roland Knecht, a member of Clariden's executive board of management. He estimates that within three years about 20% of private-banking assets booked at the bank in Singapore will come from Europe.</p>
              <p>Already Clariden has started assembling staff for a eurodesk, and a number of Clariden's clients, including some Russians, have flown to Singapore for a visit, he says. Several clients have inquired about becoming Singaporean residents.</p>

              <p>Before deriding the Australian Dollar, have you understood the status of the Australian Dollar compared to the Singapore Dollar on the international stage that is accepted as an alternative currency ?</p>

              <p>While the Australian Government was daring enough to allow the Australian Dollar to be internationalised, the Singapore Government has done its best to prevent its control over the Singapore Dollar from being lost and has tried very hard in preventing the Singapore Dollar from being "internationalised".</p>
              <p>The Australian Dollar is the sixth most popular currency used in trading beyond its region of use, and is positioned behind the US Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Yen, and the Swiss Franc.</p>
              <p>While the Singapore Government has a load of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mas.gov.sg/news_room/parliamentary_questions/1998/Internationalisation_of_the_Singapore_dollar__19_Feb_1998.html">‘reasons for not internationalizing the Singapore Dollar’  </a>- even as the Singapore leaders claim extra-ordinary talent and make more efforts to argue for themselves wages that are higher than that paid to the Governments of the six most popularly traded international currencies.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/category/currencies/">‘The Aussie Dollar Goes Down Under’  </a>for a number of reasons - and without understanding the nature behind the currency strengths and weaknesses, can anyone be qualified to make snide remarks on the Aussies ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Australian dollar has taken a big hit in the foreign exchange markets <strong><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122033429689889983.html?mod=hps_asia_whats_news"><span style="color: #0253b7;">after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates</span></a></strong> for the first time in seven years. The decline isn’t necessarily the result of the rate cut, which was expected, <strong>but trader positioning prior to the meeting</strong>, and the deterioration in commodities prices, which have helped the Aussie, among other currencies.</p>
              <p><strong>“There were people who were trapped in the Australian dollar, which explains some of the violent move today,” </strong>says Marc Chandler, head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.</p>
              <p>According to weekly data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as of Friday, large non-commercial traders (large speculators) on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange held a slight long position in the Australian dollar, suggesting a bit of bullishness. That’s not necessarily all that significant, but it’s telling that this <strong>position exists at a time when large speculators are at their shortest position in the euro in the last 52 weeks</strong>.</p>
              <p>“They were looking for a bounce and didn’t get it,” says Mr. Chandler. “They were doing a post-rate-cut ’sell the rumor and buy the fact,’ but that did not materialize either.”</p>
              <p>The Australian dollar was worth $0.8353, down from $0.8506 Friday, having at one point fallen as far as $0.8270. Other so-called commodity currencies, such as the Canadian dollar and New Zealand dollar, were weaker Tuesday. While oil has fallen below $110 a barrel, the price of gold has also declined, dropping through $800 an ounce.</p>
              <p>The Aussie “has a tighter correlation with gold than oil right now,” says Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT. The RBA dropped its key interest rate to 7% from 7.25%, the first cut in seven years, and the release highlighted economic uncertainty.</p>
              <p>The Australian currency had, for a time, also been the beneficiary of so-called carry trades, where investors borrow in a low-yielding currency to buy assets in a higher-yielding currency. Australia had some of the highest yields among the major forex markets. However, has volatility increased, those trades have become less popular, sapping some of the Aussie’s strength.</p>

              <div>
              <p>The Straits Times reported a shocking piece of news yesterday. The article itself did not really highlight the point, but tucked it away somewhere near the end of the article (see bold text below).</p>
              <p>  <a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y29/vnc2005/Swiss_Standard_of_Living/vag01.jpg"></a><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y29/vnc2005/Swiss_Standard_of_Living/vag01.jpg"><img style="width: 360px; height: 540px;" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y29/vnc2005/Swiss_Standard_of_Living/vag01.jpg" alt="vag01.jpg picture by vnc2005" width="288" height="432"></a></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>ST Feb 26, 2008<br>BUDGET DEBATE<br><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: 130%;">Rising costs, price hikes top concerns of MPs</span><br></span></span>They back strategies to keep inflation in check but say individuals and businesses need help to cope<br>By Lydia Lim<br><br>RISING costs and their impact on people's ability to make ends meet dominated the start of this year's parliamentary debate on the Government's Budget.<br><br>Many of the 19 MPs who spoke during the five-hour session praised the Budget for being forward-looking and generous, but 13 also voiced concern over a slew of recent price hikes.<br><br>MPs from the People's Action Party, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Michael Palmer, recited a litany of these increases in the past year alone.<br><br>Taking last December as an example, Mr Palmer said: 'The price of luncheon meat went up from $1 to $3, taxi fares went up, school bus fares went up and even the opposition's Potong Pasir Town Council added to the list with an increase in its service and conservancy charges.'<br><br>MPs said that businesses have been hard hit by steep hikes in office rents, and asked for tax reliefs to help them cope.<br><br>For individuals, Mr Palmer suggested that part of the Budget surplus of $6.45 billion be used to set up a contingency fund to help low-income families should inflation worsen.<br><br>Mr Singh, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and Industry, urged a review of the Government's avowed strategy to grow the economy as fast as possible in good years. This had contributed to the current situation of overheating and high prices, he said.<br><br>'The 'grow-at-all-costs' policy, with the cost increases triggered or allowed by the Government, have worsened the income divide,' he said.<br><br>At the same time, MPs threw their support behind the Government's five strategies to keep inflation in check.<br><br>These include allowing a gradual appreciation of the Singapore dollar to rein in imported inflation, and growing the economy so that wages for most workers go up by more than costs.<br><br>Nominated MP Cham Hui Fong of the National Trades Union Congress pointed out that last year had indeed been a good year for workers.<br><br>Those in the unionised sector enjoyed the highest bonuses since 1990 and the lowest retrenchment rate since 1994, she said.<br><br>But fellow NMP Eunice Olsen stressed that in tackling inflation, 'preaching' to Singaporeans to buy cheaper house brands was not a solution, as many people were already buying the lowest-priced options available.<br><br><strong>Four MPs - Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang, NMPs Gautam Banerjee and Ms Olsen, and Mr Singh - took issue with the wide gap between the Government's projected $0.7 billion deficit and the actual $6.45 billion surplus.<br><br>This showed that the Government's 'Budget marksmanship' had worsened, said Ms Olsen.<br><br>The four MPs also questioned whether the Government had been hasty in raising the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 5 per cent to 7 per cent last July, since it did not really need the revenue it generated.</strong><br><br>Both Mr Low and Mr Banerjee asked for the GST to be restored to 5 per cent.<br><br>But Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor warned against assuming that the economy would prosper and produce a surplus every year.<br><br>She said: 'The Finance Minister has been judicious in balancing competing priorities and seeking to invest in the medium- and long-term future, while dealing with the immediate concerns of citizens.'<br><br>More than 20 MPs are expected to speak when the debate resumes today.</p>
              </blockquote>So early last year, the Government had projected a budget deficit of $0.7 billion. This means that according to the Government's own estimates, in 2007 it would collect $0.7 billion (via taxes etc) less than what it would actually need to spend.<br><br>It turns out that the Government scored a massive miss. In 2007, instead of collecting $0.7 billion less than it needed, the Government collected $6.45 billion more than it needed. From who?<br><br>You, the people. Of course.<br><br>Among other things, it becomes quite evident that the GST need not have been raised in July last year.<br><br>In his Budget Speech 2008, the Finance Minister is very quick to try to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/speech_p1/p1.html#s1"><span style="color: #de7008;">explain away last year's massive miscalculation</span></a>: <blockquote>
              <p>"We started the year expecting a growth rate of 4.5% to 6.5%, which was also in line with market forecasts. With actual growth at 7.7%, Corporate and Personal Income Taxes came in some $1.0 billion higher than projected. GST revenues also exceeded our projection by about $1.2 billion, mostly from higher consumption.<br><br>GST collection arising from the 2 percentage point hike in July is estimated at about $1.4 billion in total, which now just matches the size of the GST Offset Package and Workfare Income Supplement tranches that were distributed in FY2007.<br><br>However, the largest boost to revenues came from the exceptionally buoyant property market last year. Prices of private residential units rose by over 30%, much higher than industry forecasts of around 10% to 15% at the beginning of the year. The volume of property transactions went up by over 60%. Stamp duties consequently rose to an unprecedented $3.8 billion, $2.3 billion higher than expected. Other property related revenues were around $1.1 billion above projections. These were large gains, out of the ordinary, and which we cannot expect to see very often.<br><br>The overall budget surplus of $6.4 billion was therefore the result of a strong economy and property market."</p>
              </blockquote>What is he saying? That the three biggest reasons that the Government collected so much more extra money from the people are:<br><blockquote>
              <p>(1) the property market performed unexpectedly well, leading to a unexpectedly large increase in property-related tax collection;<br><br>(2) Singaporeans and companies made an unexpectedly large amount of money, learning to an unexpectedly large increase in income tax collection;<br><br>(3) Singaporeans spent an unexpectedly large amount of money, leading to an unexpectedly large increase in GST collection.</p>
              </blockquote>By this time, you will conclude that the Singapore government is unexpectedly stupid at managing its own money and making its own financial estimates.<br><br>Either that, or you are a very kind person, and always willing to give the benefit of the doubt, and you will say that indeed, the property boom and rapid economic growth in 2007 could not reasonably have been foreseen.<br><br>But wait, I have more to say.<br><br>Click here for the Government's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/revenue_expenditure/attachment/Revenue_Estimates.pdf"><span style="color: #de7008;">revenue estimates</span></a>. You'll see that the Government gets its money by collecting nine different classes of tax, namely:<br><br>B10. Income Tax<br>B20. Assets Taxes<br>B30. Customs and Excise Taxes<br>B40. Motor Vehicles Taxes<br>B50. GST<br>B60. Betting Taxes<br>B70. Stamp Duty<br>B80. Selective Consumption Taxes<br>B90. Other Taxes<br><br>Tharman has told you that in 2007, the Government collected much more money than projected, for B10, B50 and B70.<br><br>But there's something interesting which Tharman conveniently didn't tell you. The Government had over-collected money, not just for B10, B50 and B70. But for <strong><em>every single category of taxes</em></strong>, from B10 to B90.<br><br>Now how could the Government be so completely off the mark?<br><br>Personally, I see two possible explanations:<br><br>(1) The Singapore government is unexpectedly stupid at managing its own money and making its financial estimates.<br><br>(2) In early 2007, it was the deliberate intention of the Singapore government to make low projections for its revenue, so that it could publicly claim that there would be a budget deficit of $0.7 billion. Therefore more Singaporeans would be willing to believe that the 2% GST hike in July 2007 was necessary.<br><br>Which explanation do you prefer?

              </blockquote>
              <p>There are several simple reasons why many Singaporean employers are reluctant to give their maids a day off.<br><br>You see, the maid's work permit comes with numerous conditions. For example, she cannot prostitute herself. She cannot have sex with a boyfriend. She cannot get pregnant. And she cannot (of course) commit any crimes such as shoplifting.<br><br>If she does any of the above, then she has breached her work permit conditions and the employer has to repatriate her. And if the maid runs away before the employer can do that, the government will fine the employer $5,000. For that matter, the government will fine the employer $5,000, if the maid runs away for <em>any</em> reason.<br><br>If you didn't know any of the above, then either you do not employ a maid, or you didn't read the small print of the Manpower Ministry's work permit conditions.<br><br>(On a positive note, maids running away is such a common occurrence that it is possible to buy insurance for it. On a negative note, maids running away <em>is</em> a common occurrence).<br><br>Many employers are afraid that if their maid has a day off and gets herself into trouble, the employer will not only have to solve the trouble, but also have to fork out $5,000 as a free gift to the government.<br><br>(Not that the government will then help you solve the trouble. It's just a fine, plain &amp; simple).<br><br>Intuitively, this smacks of gross unfairness. The employer gets punished not for something he did, but for something that somebody else (the maid) did. Furthermore, once the maid leaves the employer's residence, the employer has no way of monitoring where the maid goes and what she does there.<br><br>To encourage employers to give their maids a day off, the government needs to change these ridiculous rules.<br><br>I agree that employers should be fined and punished, if they fail to perform their responsibilities as employers - for example, paying the maid's salary on time; providing adequate food and accommodation; and ensuring a safe, secure working environment.<br><br>But employers should not be held responsible, for things that a maid may do, of her own free will. When the maid goes out on her rest day, the employer simply has no viable way to ensure that she will not do anything that breaches her work permit conditions.<br><br>(Which, by the way, are quite extensive and onerous).<br><br>We may draw a curious parallel with Mas Selamat's escape, and PM Lee's determined, if muddled, defence of Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng in Parliament.<br><br>Mas Selamat ran away. But PM Lee said that Wong Kan Seng was not at fault and should not be punished in any way. The reason being that Wong Kan Seng personally did not do anything which allowed Mas Selamat to escape.<br><br>Strangely, if your maid runs away, it IS your fault and you SHOULD be punished. Even if you did not personally do anything to let her run away (apart from giving her a day off).<br><br>Similarly, if your maid becomes pregnant, it IS your fault and you SHOULD be punished. Even if you did not personally do anything to make her pregnant.<br><br>Oh well. What can I say? Maids are not terrorists. But then you are not Wong Kan Seng. So the rules remain stacked against you. Wong Kan Seng gets off lightly, but you won't. Even if his lapse has far greater, and graver, implications than yours.<br><br>Your runaway maid wouldn't blow up Changi Airport, would she?</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">What happened to Singapore, the land of plenty?</span></h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p>Friday, 19 January 2007, 12:28 am | 367 views</p>
              </div>
              <p><em>This article is taken from <a href="http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/magazine/2000/1110/nat.singapore.html"><span style="color: #990000;">Asiaweek</span></a> (For Richer Or Poorer), to allow our readers to revisit the issues of welfare, the aged, foreign workers, and wages in Singapore.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>It is quite troubling to note that this article was first published in Nov, 2000. The problems faced by those who are struggling are largely the same today - 6 years on.</em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><img src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/hk.jpg" border="5" alt="" width="160" height="238" align="right">The article is by Roger Mitton</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Lee Chong Peng is the symbol of Singapore’s broken dream. She lives alone in a one-room flat on about $3 a day. “I watch television and take short walks,” she says. “My legs ache now, so I cannot go so far.” But without fail, every Wednesday afternoon, Lee takes the lift down eight floors to the ground level of her public housing block.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There she joins dozens of other poor folk from her district in Chinatown to sit, waiting, on concrete benches. Lee, 84, chats with friends, while others remain sullen, lacking even the warmth of comradeship. At 5 p.m. they all form into a line and shuffle forward to receive a plastic bag containing six eggs, 1.5 kg of rice, a can of baked beans, a can of sweet corn, one packet of hot chocolate, one packet of coffee, some cereal and a single toilet roll. Without this weekly donation from a charitable group, Lee and her neighbors find it tough to survive. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What happened to Singapore, the land of plenty?</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In its rush to forge a manufacturing, then a high-tech economy, the city-state rarely bothered to look back at those who were lagging. Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew developed a system based on hard work and government support for industry. Singaporeans were expected to earn their rewards. The results were astounding: a middle class emerged to build Asia’s second-richest country. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But with the advent of globalization and an influx of cheap foreign workers, Singapore’s economy is becoming increasingly ruthless. According to its own statistics, the nation’s rich are getting richer and the poor are falling further behind. To most Singaporeans, the mere existence of poor folk in need of care packages comes as a shock. And this realization has prompted an uncharacteristic bout of soul-searching. The rich-poor disparity strikes right at the heart of Singapore’s development model — and challenges the city’s smug self- image. Many younger Singaporeans raised in middle-class comfort are beginning to think that Lee’s ideal is outdated; they argue that the government has a responsibility to care more for the downtrodden. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Lowest 10% of society had an average monthly income of only $75.81</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The issue burst into Singapore’s consciousness in May, when the media reported a Department of Statistics disclosure that the lowest 10% of society had an average monthly income of only $75.81. Officials said the figure (which included unemployed and retired people) had been misused to present a distorted view. Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo presented a raft of numbers in parliament to show that Singapore’s poor really were not so poor after all. “The standard of living among the lower income has gone up,” said Yeo. Nearly all had televisions and telephones, on average they had about $11,500 in the state retirement fund (CPF), and all but a quarter lived in 3-room or larger flats. “In other words, many in the bottom 10% have significant wealth in the form of CPF savings and their homes,” added Yeo. “They are not an underclass.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The hot potato might have cooled there, except that in a classic piece of mistiming the government then announced substantive pay hikes for the civil service. On average, salaries jumped 13%. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong’s wage soared to a cool $1.1 million — almost $3,000 a day. Goh says the new wage bill will cost each Singaporean about $6 a year — the equivalent of five plates of char kway teow, a popular noodle dish. But opposition legislator Chiam See Tong noted: “I think U.S. President Bill Clinton receives only about S$600,000 [about $343,000] a year. Surely that should also be enough for a minister in Singapore?” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Goh claims qualified Singaporeans are not interested in such a “poor” salary. “Several high-fliers pleaded young family or lack of interest for not coming into politics,” he says. “They never say it is because they can earn more outside, but I can tell clearly that pay is a consideration.” The ill-timed raise further exacerbated the festering subject of income divergence. Admits legislator Charles Chong: “The ratio between the top and bottom has been increasing.”</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">“They won’t starve or go homeless or be refused medical care”</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As a result of prosperity and shifting values, attitudes toward the poor are slowly beginning to change. Singapore already is doing something to reduce the adverse effects of the income gap. For starters, the city’s poor don’t have it too badly. Says Chong, from the ruling People’s Action Party: “We look after our disadvantaged people. They won’t starve or go homeless or be refused medical care.” Adds National University of Singapore academic Mukul Asher: “By spreading the consumption of basic amenities like housing, schooling, healthcare and transport in a more equal way than other societies, the government mitigates some of the effects of large and growing income inequalities.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But helping the poor directly would go against the grain of the ruling party’s old guard. Notes veteran oppositionist J. B. Jeyaretnam: “It is Lee Kuan Yew’s dogma that nothing is free in this world. There is no free lunch, no handouts, no subsidies.” Jeyaretnam has called on the government to lessen the inequalities by providing free medical treatment, free education and old-age pensions to those in need. Younger members of the ruling party are beginning to realize that poverty is a growing problem — one that the government will have to address to stay in power. “It’s true, there is a kind of paranoia among older leaders about Singapore degenerating into a welfare state,” says legislator Chong. “But nowadays, the younger leaders are saying that if we want to be considered as a humane, civilized society we have to help these poor people more.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>How did Singapore leave its poor behind?</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In part, cheap foreign labor shoved unskilled Singaporeans aside. To achieve high growth rates, the government has increasingly allowed larger numbers of foreign workers to make up the labor shortfall caused to some extent by low birthrates. Explains academic Asher: “Singapore does not believe in redistribution of wealth. Instead, it always wants high rates of growth to reduce poverty levels.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Electrical fitter Bazlur Rahman, a Bangladeshi working in Singapore, puts up with his small salary — something few Singaporeans would be willing to do. He earns $11 a day and saves more than $170 a month, which he sends home. Bazlur lives with 3,200 other foreign workers in a cramped, tight-security compound at Kaki Bukit. Says Asher: “Singapore has been able to use these foreign workers and their low wages and conditions to maintain its competitiveness and high growth rates.”</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Reduce wages or be priced out of the market</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To compete with Bazlur and thousands like him, Singapore workers must reduce their wage demands or be priced out of the market. Yet to keep top-end managers and professionals at home, the government and its private sector must make matching offers. Says Asher: “All round you have got a larger wage inequality; wealth is more concentrated.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Admits Prime Minister Goh: “Yes, the income gap in Singapore is widening because of globalization and the knowledge revolution, which have enhanced the value of talent dramatically and pressed down the wages of the unskilled.” Can the government do anything? It has already ruled out the idea of holding down wages at the top or artificially raising wages at the bottom. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It is already running capable retraining programs. Says Goh: “We must not envy those who have made it rich. Rather, we must provide the opportunities for more to be like them. It means operating on the basis of meritocracy — that you can get ahead in life if you work hard, regardless of your background.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What else can be done? As a result of growing concern about the poor, the government has set up nine community development councils, which are jointly funded and operated by local officials and charities. Community leaders draw up policies and every dollar donated to the councils is matched three-to-one by the government. This initiative has moderated attitudes. “We don’t want the government to take over the voluntary welfare organizations, but we’ll enhance their work,” says Chong. “If in this way we are seen to be helping the less well-off, there will be fewer social problems.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Money politics</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But where there is money, there is politics. Opposition legislators such as Chiam claim that the ruling party uses this aid for political gain — in effect, to buy votes. “The chairman of a community development council will go around like Santa Claus giving money away to the poor and unemployed,” says Chiam. “It’s the politicians who go out to give this money and of course they’ve got to get their votes. That’s the way they dish out welfare: very selectively.” The council chairman in Chiam’s constituency, the ruling party’s Andy Gan, denies that aid is used to garner votes. “Our office is open to all residents and I do not ask for their votes before seeing to their needs,” Gan says.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The circumstances of Teng Ah Mui suggest that this community-based assistance is inadequate anyway. Teng, 54, lives alone and recently began receiving charity food packages each week in order to survive. She has held various unskilled jobs, but since falling and injuring her leg six months ago she now relies on public assistance. After paying her rent and utilities bills, she is left with about $80 a month. “It’s not enough, so I have to depend on food donations and help from friends,” she says. A decade ago, it might have been easier for Teng to rejoin the workforce. These days, there is too much competition for menial work and too few opportunities.<br><strong><br></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Public assistance of about $115 per month.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The bottom line is that the government’s willingness to help the poor is still minimal. In Singapore, children are required by law to look after their elderly parents. But often they cannot do this, especially if they are low-income, single children. Admits Minister of State without Portfolio Matthias Yao: “Parents know what their children can afford. They don’t bring cases to court when they know that their children are too poor to look after them.” If neither friends nor family can help, and if the person is unable to get work, then — and only then — will the government step in with the barest subsistence-level help. Last year 2,238 people qualified for this public assistance (usually about $115 per month). The number has increased each year for the past three.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">So what will happen when the number of aged people quadruples in the next 30 years? They already comprise the largest chunk of Singapore’s new poor (the other major components are retrenched workers, single mothers and the disabled). Even now, rich Singapore cannot look after its older folk without drawing on the services of charity groups. Says Asher bluntly: “The government will need to do more.” If it does not, income disparities could threaten the country’s cherished social harmony. They might even eat into the ruling party’s monolithic hold on power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The government knows this is a serious matter — perhaps the most serious socio-economic threat Singapore has faced. Despite some bluster about meritocracy, retraining and limits on foreign workers, no one really knows a surefire way to solve the problem. Says Asher: “Policy-makers are still thinking in terms of economic output and growth; while the people are increasingly thinking more and more of their welfare.” But don’t count out the ruling party. It has been skillful at adapting to meet the needs of its citizens. Adds Asher: “One can expect that they will begin to change as this issue becomes more pressing. They will have to in order to maintain their legitimacy and their support.” </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Just don’t call it welfare</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #333333; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For now, the subject remains virtually taboo. But soon Singapore will be forced to find a remedy for its new, more disparate, reality. Just don’t call it welfare.</span></p>

              <div class="post-body">
              <p> </p>
              Singapore announced 7.7% economic growth for 2006. Many of us are surprised not because the growth is so high but because it was hardly felt by the average Singaporean. In 2006, Singapore had the highest per capita growth in the number of millionaires and someone said we probably have the highest per capita deaths in MRT stations. One country, 2 realities.<br><br><br><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/RbHRqBjygNI/AAAAAAAAABY/rINGlAB0lTg/s1600-h/underclass.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5022025579398070482" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; width: 371px; cursor: hand; height: 189px; text-align: center;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_XtsjYwdj2Ic/RbHRqBjygNI/AAAAAAAAABY/rINGlAB0lTg/s320/underclass.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="436" height="146"></a><br><br><br>This is what happens when our determined leaders measure themselves on a single KPI (Key Performance Indicator) known as the GDP. You can see their sense of achievement when they announced last year's GDP growth and following that well deserved rewards/bonus to the civil servants. A growing GDP doesn't mean everyone gets more because there is no guarantee that it will be equally distributed, the PAP did not concern themselves with the distribution problem - they reduced retrenchment benefits to a minimum, imported hundreds of thousands of foreign labor to depress wages, cut taxes for high income earners and raise GST for everyone.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Over the years, policies have been formulated to keep this single number GDP growing. As our demographics became unfavorable, they had this ingenious idea to import foreign workers for this economy- more input to the economy = higher growth. Unlike many countries who faced the same problem and preferred to suffer slowdowns than to import foreign labor, Singapore averted a slowdown by importing 800,000 foreign workers and converting a large number of them to new citizens. One problem with this strategy is saturation....the new citizens will also grow old and you need to import even more people to this little island to keep your demographics favorable. I guess faced with this, the PAP decided that building IRs will help to pick up the slack....what great idea will the PAP think of next?....<br><br><br><br><br>There were a few rascals who very early on warned about the rising poverty in what seems to be an outwardly affluent society. One of them, an opposition politician was was critcised for engaging in politics of jealousy and was subsequently made a bankrupt so that he will better understand that being poor in Singapore is actually not so bad. Another <a href="http://www.jamesgomeznews.com/article.php?AID=13"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">wrote alot about the "</span></span></a><em><a href="http://www.jamesgomeznews.com/article.php?AID=13"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">new poor</span></span></a>" </em>but the PAP paid no attention to him until he wagged his finger at a CCTV at a civil servant over a matter concerning some forms. Another guy who felt that "<a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/127762.asp"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Singaporeans are fed up with progress" </span></span></a>was accused of spreading despondency and lost his job as a freelance writer for one of our newspapers whose role is to make us feel good. Thanks to the PAP's style of govt which is : <em>there is no problem until the PAP says there is a problem</em>, we can all relax and believe our lives are getting better. ...let us rejoice when we see those wonderful GDP numbers.....

              <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">No poverty in S'pore? Think again.<br><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Singapore's poor emerge as delicate political issue</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Asian Wall Street Journal</span><br>January 30, 2007<br>SINGAPORE<br><br>By YAROSLAV TROFIMOV<br><br>DURING rush hour in Singapore's ultramodern subway system, wrinkled old ladies squat on the underpass floor with handfuls of small tissue packets that they sell at one Singapore dollar, or 65 US cents, apiece.<br><br>These are the poor of Singapore, left behind by the boom that has transformed this tropical island of 4.5 million people into a regional business, finance and technology hub. Poverty here isn't nearly as desperate as in its Asian neighbors, or even many Western societies. But it has become an increasingly sensitive political issue, prompting new tax and social policies that the government is expected to unveil in the annual budget presentation Feb 15.<br><br>According to official statistics, at least 40% of Singapore's households saw their real incomes decrease from 2000-2005 -- while the overall economy posted some of the world's highest growth rates, surging by 7.7% last year.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"The question is, who is all this growth for?" says Manu Bhaskaran, an adjunct fellow at Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies and a partner at the Centennial Group, an advisory firm. "Shouldn't the government be aiming for lower growth, but better distribution? "</span><br><br>The government's strategy so far is to pursue a balancing act of generating more revenue for helping the poor without scaring off the global investors who have long been attracted by the city-state's low-tax regime. "The dual objective is to ensure that the Singaporean economy continues to remain competitive, and to strengthen the inclusiveness of Singaporean society," says Lim Swee Say, secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress and a government minister.<br><br>Most of Singapore's poor are in their 50s or older, and many are onetime manufacturing workers who lost their jobs to cheaper competitors in China, Vietnam or India. Many lack education and English-language skills that are needed to prosper in expanding sectors such as services and finance.<br><br>It is only in recent months that senior officials began to speak out on the problem of structural poverty, recognizing the potential perils for a multiracial, multireligious society such as Singapore's. "It is essential for us to tilt the balance in favor of lower-income Singaporeans, because globalization is going to strain our social compact," Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech last fall.<br><br>Singapore's People's Action Party, founded by Mr Lee's father Lee Kuan Yew -- who is still a senior government member with the title of Minister Mentor -- has controlled the island since independence in 1965, winning nearly every seat in parliamentary elections. The country's mixed population of Chinese, Malays and Indians has accepted decades of the PAP's often authoritarian rule in exchange for phenomenal economic growth that has transformed this former British trading outpost into one of the world's most prosperous states.<br><br>While providing subsidized housing and health care, Singapore's government has long resisted calls for European-style unemployment benefits for the poor, describing welfare as a "dirty word" and rejecting the idea of a minimum wage. Instead, the government has come up with the concept of "workfare" -- a large-scale program to top off the incomes of those Singaporeans who accept low-paid work. Details of the program will likely be given in the budget presentation.<br><br>"We can't stop the income gap from widening because the wages are determined by the global competition for knowledge workers, and by the excessive supply of unskilled workers," says Mr. Lim, the minister and union leader. "But what we're trying to do is to make sure that the widening income gap doesn't necessarily translate into a widening social gap."<br><br>Most developed economies fund such social programs by redistributing wealth through progressive taxation: the top-bracket federal income tax rate is 35% in the US, and at least 40% in most of Western Europe. But Singapore is ideologically opposed to this model: the island-state has been steadily slashing its top income-tax rate, from 55% at independence in 1965 to 28% in 2000, to 20% today. Making up for the shortfall in revenue, Singapore established a general sales tax, currently at 5%.<br><br>It is the sales tax that the government is planning to tap again to pay for the "workfare" initiative. According to Mr Lee, with the new budget the sales tax is likely to rise to 7% -- a measure that, economists calculate, will generate some S$1.5 billion of extra government revenue.<br><br>The plan is far from popular. In the two months since Mr Lee in November first mentioned a likely sales-tax rise, the proposal elicited unusually vocal criticism from Singapore's corporate world and opposition leaders alike. The influential Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry complained the sales-tax increase is "likely to have an immediate and detrimental effect on local spending," undermining Singapore's long-term competitiveness.<br><br>Sylvia Lim, leader of the Singapore Workers' Party and an opposition Parliament member, also pointed out that the poor -- the ostensible beneficiaries of the proposal -- would be hurt the most. "We need to strengthen our safety nets through some redistributive policies," she asserted, adding that consumption taxes, such as the sales tax, "are generally regressive and likely to compound the underclass problem."<br><br>While the government usually ignores the minuscule opposition in this tightly regulated country, the business community's pleas found a receptive audience. Aware that corporate taxes are even lower in rival business centers such as Hong Kong and Ireland, Singapore signaled it would sweeten the pill for businesses: To compensate for the higher sales tax, the corporate tax rate, currently 20%, would be shaved by at least one percentage point.<br><br>"This is a tough and competitive world," Minister Mentor Lee told Singaporean journalists as he explained the planned corporate-tax cut. "People don't come here because they like Singapore -- they come because the returns are better."</div>
