              <blockquote>
              <p>On Saturday, Mr Rudd said he would pump $2 billion of public money
              into a credit fund accessible by owners of commercial property such as
              <span style="color: #ff0000;">shopping centres and office buildings </span>if they lost access to foreign
              loans.</p>
              <p>With up to $<span style="color: #ff0000;">75 billion in offshore loans due to be rolled over in
              the next two years</span>, Mr Rudd said a third of the 150,000 jobs in the
              commercial property sector would be at risk if he failed to act to
              preserve stability and maintain property values.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry backed
              Mr Rudd's plan, Mr Turnbull claimed Mr Rudd was misleading the public.</p>
              <p>The lawyer and former merchant banker said the fund, which would be
              supplemented by a further $2 billion from banks, was more about
              maintaining asset values and bank profits than protecting jobs.</p>

                                      percent of GDP,despite the commodity boom (Figure 5, Tables 3 and
                                      4). The trade deficit deteriorated, as export volume growth was
                                      constrained by drought disrupting rural exports and bottlenecks in
                                      the export supply chain. Imports also grew strongly owing to
                                      buoyant domestic demand and an appreciation of the real effective
                                      exchange rate (REER). In addition, the investment income deficit

              <blockquote>Dr Morgan, who chaired a stream of Kevin Rudd's 2020 Summit last year,
              said he believed the strength of the Australian banking system would
              help to cushion the economy from the global crisis. <br><br>"Nobody
              knows how this is going to work out.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> But I am very confident that
              Australia will do better than almost anywhere else in the world,"</span> he
              said. "We have got a much less impaired banking system, which is the
              single most important reason." <br><br>He said that Australia still
              had more "shots in our fiscal and monetary policy locker to fire off
              than most other countries" and that the economy was tied more to the
              fortunes of the Asian countries, particularly China, than to the US. <br><br>"The
              rest of the world's banking system is looking a good deal worse. In the
              US, the UK and Europe, banks are materially worse than the Australian
              banking system. <br><br>"There was adventurism offshore and they got too complacent about risk." <br><br><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,24961868-643,00.html">Read the full story in <em>The Australian</em></a>. </blockquote>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FUNDINGS</span></strong></p>
              <p>Does NSW get funds to pay?</p>
              <p><em>NSW Health says it intends reducing this debt to $10 million by the
              end of tomorrow, but admits the state's area health services will still
              owe <span style="color: #ff0000;">$117.5 million in unpaid bills</span>.</em></p>
              <p><em>But the situation is likely
              to deteriorate. The Government confirmed last night that a
              PricewaterhouseCoopers report last month showed this year's health
              budget would blow out by $900 million by March unless urgent action was
              taken.</em></p>
              <p><em>The report said a $600 million blowout was expected on top of a $300 million shortfall announced in September.</em></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO man power to pay money</strong></span></p>
              <p>I found this reason</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>''reduced its
              administrators by 17 per cent''</em></span></p>
              <p>is very funny.but this is the official reasons of late payment!!</p>
              <p>i think NSW Health better fire all finance and admin staff.</p>
              <p>Then NSW Health no need to pay at all!!</p>
              <p>NSW is one of the richest,if not the richest state in oz!!Why like that??</p>
              <p><em>The Director-General of NSW Health, Debora Picone, said the health
              service had made improvements since it was ordered in June to pay its
              creditors, but spiralling costs and recruitment problems had made it
              difficult to get debts under control. "I don't expect the area health
              service to turn things around overnight but they have already reduced
              the number of creditors by 50 per cent and we are headed in the right
              direction."</em></p>
              <p><em>Ms Picone said the health service had reduced its
              administrators by 17 per cent and increased frontline staff by up to 29
              per cent in the past year.</em></p>
              <p><em>But Dr Fisher questioned the figures.
              "Where are these extra doctors and nurses? I haven't seen them. All the
              doctors and nurses here are exhausted from double shifts and being on
              call. And if we quit, who suffers? Joe in the street, that's who."</em></p>
              <p><em><strong>with Louise Hall and Andrew Clennell </strong></em></p>

              <p><em>"It is dangerous here and we are losing the will to continue," a surgeon, Dean Fisher, (above)told the </em><em>Herald yesterday.</em></p>
              <p><em>He
              said <span style="color: #ff0000;">most specialists at the hospital had not been paid in six weeks
              and operating theatre staff were still regularly without basic supplies
              such as gloves.</span></em></p>
              <p><em>"As of Monday we have no urologist and cardiac
              patients are already sent to Sydney because there is one cardiologist
              who flies in once a month. Eight clinicians, including surgeons,
              psychiatrists, physicians, anaesthetists and locums, are flown in every
              month at huge cost to the health service because nobody wants to work
              here."</em></p>
              <p><em>The Medical Staff Council, run by 15 Dubbo doctors, passed
              a unanimous vote of no confidence in the hospital's management three
              months ago but Dr Fisher said "nothing had changed".</em></p>
              <p><em>"Nobody is ever held accountable for this mess."</em></p>

              <p>You're not Australian (frankly, even if you sucked Rudd's cock and called him Daddy they'd be laughing too hard to let you in), so what business is it of yours?  You're not affected by it, but even if Elle Mcpherson's hair was out of place you'd post it and ask if Australia is such a great place after all, so the first step to your unlikely recovery is to admit that you've got a fucking big problem with this obsession of yours. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              Economic Security Strategy last October. And in this debate about
              what's occurring in the global economy, we should never lose sight of
              the underlying strengths of the Australian economy. And one of those
              strengths during this period of great global uncertainty was the fact
              we had an economic stimulus package in place while confidence globally
              and demand globally was falling off the cliff. </em></p>
              <p><em> The second point is that we have a very strong banking  sector, p<span style="color: #ff0000;">erhaps the strongest </span>banking of anywhere in the world. </em></p>
