              <time class='date' datetime='2008-10-21T22:46:41+00:00'>21 Oct 08, 22:46</time>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>During the past three years, the four top host countries - Australia, Canada, US and New Zealand - reported an upsurge of Singaporean permanent residents.</strong> <br><br><strong>Australia <br>2001 - 1,786 <br>2002 - 2,064 (up 15.5%) <br>2003 - 2,656 (up 28.6%) <br>Canada <br>2001 - 666 <br>2003 - 991 (up 49%) <br>USA <br>2000 - 671 <br>2002 - 1,036 (up 54.4%) <br>New Zealand <br>2001 - 437 <br>2002 - 278 (down 30%) <br>2003 - 369 (up 32.7%)</strong> <br><br>Most are the "desirable" graduates that large, under-populated countries like Australia and Canada prefer. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The majority worries about the long-term prospects of living in a city, however developed, whose small size restricts opportunities and ambitions with a hectic pace of life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some are concerned about job security and their children's future. Other push factors are strong government control and a relative lack of personal liberties. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Population shift is not unique to Singapore, but outward migration poses a special problem because of national service (NS). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It depends on its "people's" army to defend itself. In any war, these reservists who have served 2½ years' training, become frontline soldiers. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Foreigners don't undergo NS and, it is feared, lack the commitment and training to defend Singapore. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For most, a complete uprooting is not the objective. They want a foreign PR but without abandoning their citizenship. Few are ready to burn bridges. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some 60% select Australia because of its nearness to home. It serves as job insurance. It is unclear how many who are given these PRs actually migrate. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The government has moved to try to draw benefits from a bad situation. It has formed "Singapore clubs" in many receiving cities to tap these people to help develop the business ties. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The desire to leave appears to be growing. One migration consultant told the Straits Times that he was receiving at least 20 enquiries a day, twice the number in 2001. They included Singaporeans who held high-paying jobs. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">"We get people in their 30s, holding good jobs but terribly worried about restructuring and retrenchment," said the manager. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Others are 40-plus professionals who find it hard to get meaningful jobs. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A former lawyer who moved to Sydney to do his masters in public health said he wanted to get out of the rat race. "In Singapore, you have to work so hard to save up a retirement sum. By the time you manage to save that amount, will you be in any shape to enjoy it?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The government finds itself caught in a bind. The more Singaporeans leave, the more foreigners it has to bring in to close the gap, which in turn contributes to the exodus. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The newspapers and Internet are reflecting some of the resentment and worry about foreign workers. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A few are lashing out in blind fury at foreign PRs, ranging from medal-winning sportsmen to students. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">One frequent complaint is the giving of perks to foreign PRs at the expense of locals, including exemption from national service, scholarship and housing subsidy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some Singaporeans want the government to distinguish between naturalised citizens (with full rights) and PRs, who should have no more than residential rights until they become citizens. <br>The authorities reject this. They want more, not less, foreign talent because it fills skills that Singapore's new high-tech investors need. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Last week, Singapore's economy shed a strong ray of light in a long dark tunnel. The first quarter GDP grew by a strong 7.3%, three times the previous rate, catching even the government by surprise. It augurs well for next year or two. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What will happen from now? It is hoped it will resemble what happened to Taiwan and Hong Kong in the 1990s, when large numbers who had fled to the West out of worries about China, flocked back when their economies took off. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Australian Economic Revival Outstrips Asian Countries like Singapore, saves 15B in Costs while Singapore forced to spend:</strong></span></p>
              <p>The Australian economic revival has led to the revival of confidence and respect. And we can measure the economic revival against other developed nations. Through the ’80s and ’90s we fell below the average GDP per capita of the OECD countries. From the beginning of this decade we turned positive in the rankings.</p>
              <p>Since 1996 we have had eight surplus budgets, and are on the verge of eliminating Commonwealth debt, inflation has been stable notwithstanding huge pressures from what in truth has amounted to the third oil shock.</p>
              <p>A number of steps have been important in getting us to where we are.</p>
              <p>The March 1996 election was fought on the basis that the Commonwealth Budget was in surplus. Kim Beazley, then Finance Minister, repeatedly affirmed in the campaign that the budget was in surplus, for example, saying on February 1, 1996: “… we’re operating in surplus, and our projections are for surpluses in the future.”</p>
              <p>However, the day after the election on March 2, 1996 the Treasury estimated the deficit at $9.0 billion (1.9 per cent of GDP). The outcome was in fact a deficit of $10.1 billion (2.1 per cent of GDP).</p>
              <p>Immediately after the election the Coalition Government announced that it would legislate to prevent such deception ever occurring again.</p>
              <p>We introduced the <em>Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998</em> which provides mandatory reporting standards and the preparation of a pre-election statement by the Secretaries of Treasury and Finance. Now the public is told the actual state of the budget before the election campaign and is able to assess policy against agreed facts before they vote.</p>
              <p>The new government also announced an immediate Commission of Audit to identify all assets and liabilities of the Commonwealth including all contingent liabilities and unfunded superannuation to get a true picture of Commonwealth finances.</p>
              <p>On August 14, 1996, upon the appointment of a new Governor of the Reserve Bank, the governor and I entered an agreement to set inflation targets, to direct monetary policy at those targets, and to guarantee the independence of the Central Bank. This was the origin of a medium-term framework for monetary policy.</p>
              <p>In our first budget the Government laid down a medium-term framework for fiscal policy. The objective was “maintaining an underlying balance on average over the course of the economic cycle. This approach will ensure that over time the Commonwealth Budget makes no overall call on private sector saving and therefore does not detract from national saving.”</p>
              <p>In ten budgets since 1996-97 there have been eight surpluses cumulating to an estimated $59 billion over 10 years. Commonwealth net debt will this year be eliminated.</p>
              <p>Net interest payments which were $8.4 billion (1.5 per cent of GDP in 1996-97) will fall to $0.3 billion in 2006-07 (0.0 per cent of GDP). And thereafter net interest payments will be negative. In 2006-07 1.5 per cent of GDP represents a saving of around $15 billion - this shows the value of our debt reduction strategy.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The issue of a government guarantee has been in the system for
              years, with the Rudd Government initially offering a guarantee for
              deposits up to $20,000.</p>
              <p>It was estimated that 80per cent of bank depositers would be covered by this free and capped scheme.</p>
              <p>Turnbull suggested a cap of $100,000, but the Government initially resisted any rise above $20,000.</p>
              <p>Then, after the economic crisis deepened in the US on October 10,
              Rudd announced an unlimited guarantee for bank deposits. That is, all
              bank deposits had a taxpayer-funded guarantee without charge.</p>
              <p>This wiped out the initial scheme capped at $20,000, and outbid the Coalition's $100,000 capped scheme.</p>
              <p>Within 24 hours of the announcement, the Government was being warned
              of distortion in the financial markets as people moved money from
              institutions without guarantees to those with a guarantee.</p>
              <p>Lower risk equates with a lower return, and at a time of uncertainty
              people are prepared to take a cut in their interest payment in return
              for safety, especially free, government-guaranteed safety.</p>
              <p>But Rudd said in his announcement on October 12 the issue of a "cap"
              would be revised after three years - that is, introducing a cap beyond
              which the guarantee would not be free.</p>
              <p>Even as he introduced the legislation last Wednesday, Swan was signalling there would have to be changes.</p>
              <p>The distortion was already forcing changes. And Stevens advised
              Henry last Friday, in writing, there had to be a "cap" to stop the
              dislocation in the finance markets.</p>
              <p>Henry made the point yesterday that in the context of his
              discussions, a "cap" really meant a "threshold" above which a fee would
              be charged.</p>
              <p>Swan made the same point in parliament, saying: "There needs to be a
              threshold above which a fee would be paid. Let me say this is the
              fine-tuning that I forecast."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">the 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter of 2008 has seen a decline in the overall performance of many Singaporean companies. As expected, this performance has been reflected in the overall payment patterns of Singaporean businesses for the second quarter of 2008. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Prompt payment is classified as when at least 90% of total bills are paid within the agreed payment terms while slow payment is classified as when more than 50% of total bills are paid later than the agreed credit terms.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Based on the latest data released by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Singapore, we see that in June 2008, only 43% of Singaporean companies paid their suppliers promptly. This is a 13% decrease from the 56% high reached at the end of the first quarter of 2008. Furthermore, the proportion of companies that were slow in payment has simultaneously increased by 12% over the same time period, where in May 2008 majority of Singaporean companies fell under the slow payment category.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This pattern of payment practice has been reflected across all major industries, including the manufacturing, construction, wholesale and services industries. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The most significant decrease was by the wholesale industry with a 17% decrease in prompt payments from a 62% high in March 2008. Slow payment numbers for the wholesale industry rose by 15% to reach 40% by the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter.   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The least affected industry was the construction industry with a 4% decrease in prompt payments and 5% increase in slow payments. This performance should be mainly attributed to the boom in the property market which largely lasted through the last quarter of 2007 to the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> quarter of 2008. When compared to a year ago the construction industry has made 17% more prompt payments at the end of June 2008 than they did in July 2007. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hard times get harder for Singapore as local talent leave:</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The exodus continues<br>Foreigners more than make up for increasing local outflow; unfortunately it doesn’t help consolidate nationhood. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br>Feb 24, 2008
              </span></strong></p><p><strong>YEARS of strong economic growth have failed to stem Singapore’s skilled youths from leaving for a better life abroad, with the number topping 1,000 a year. </strong></p><strong>
              <p>This works out to 4%-5%, or three in 10, of the highly educated population, a severe brain drain for a small, young nation, according to Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. </p>
              <p>Such high-end emigration is usually associated with less better-off countries where living conditions are poor. Here the opposite is the case. </p>
              <p>Last year the economy created almost 200,000 jobs, far in excess of the 38,000 births recorded. </p>
              <p>The future doesn’t look better, either, despite Lee holding out promises of “a golden period” in the next five to 10 years. </p>
              <p>Lee believes the exodus, which has been worrying him for two decades, could only grow because “every year, there are more people going abroad for their first or second degree.” </p>
              <p>The emigration rate, one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis, is a blow to the government, particularly to Lee, who takes pride in building up this once poor squatter colony into a glittering global city. </p>
              <p>They are people who abandoned their citizenship for a foreign one, mostly in Australia, the United States and Canada. </p>
              <p>It is particularly serious for two reasons. First, Singapore is a young nation that is working hard to consolidate its nationhood and its people, and second, its defence lies in a reservist army. </p>
              <p>This is made up of young men who have served two years of compulsory military training when they reach the age of 18. Any big outflow will badly affect security, not to mention the economy. </p>
              <p>Adding to a declining birth rate, the problem of emigration, which appears to have worsened during the past few decades as people became better educated, will further reduce the base of this well-trained people’s army. </p>
              <p>Hundreds of thousands of foreigners and permanent residents who have come to Singapore help make up the numbers, but they do not have to serve national service. </p>
              <p>The emigrants, mostly professionals, don’t leave Singapore out of poverty but to seek a better, less pressurised life. </p>
              <p>Lee recently said the brain drain is touching close to this family. </p>
              <p>Lee’s grandson, the elder son of Prime Minister Hsien Loong, who is studying in the United States, has indicated that he may not return. </p>
              <p>Over the years, the children of several Cabinet ministers have also made Britain or the US their home. </p>
              <p>Lee, aged 84, has often spoken on the issue with emotions, once tearing when referring to the losses. </p>
              <p>However, he has offered no reasons for the exodus beyond economic opportunities, although the government more or less knows what they are. </p>
              <p>Singaporeans who have or are planning to emigrate are given a host of 10 questions and asked to tick the three most important ones. They include the following: - </p>
              <p>&gt; High costs of living </p>
              <p>&gt; Singapore is too regulated and stifling </p>
              <p>&gt; Better career and prospects overseas </p>
              <p>&gt; Prefer a more relaxed lifestyle </p>
              <p>&gt; Uncertain future of Singapore. </p>
              <p>Some liberal Singaporeans believe Lee himself, with his authoritarian leadership and unpopular policies, is largely to blame. </p>
              <p>Singapore’s best-known writer Catherine Lim calls it a climate of fear that stops citizens from speaking out against the government, saying it could eventually lead to the decline of the state. </p>
              <p>She praised the government for its economic achievements but added: “A compliant, fearful population that has never learnt to be politically savvy could spell the doom of Singapore.” Globalisation, which offers opportunities in many countries like never before, is a big reason for the outflow. </p>
              <p>Many countries, including populous China, are making a special effort to attract foreign talent. </p>
              <p>Others who leave were worried about the future of their children living in a small island, and look for security and comfort of a larger country. </p>
              <p>The exodus is more than made up – at least in numbers – by a larger intake of professionals from China and India. </p>
              <p>“The trouble is many of the Chinese then use us as a stepping stone to go to America, where the grass is greener, Lee said. </p>
              <p>“But even if we only keep 30%-40% and lose 60%-70%, we’re a net gainer,” he added. </p>
              <p>He believed, however, that the Chinese would cease to come in 20 to 30 years’ time, when China’s living standards rise to match Singapore’s. </p>
              <p>Some feel the large presence of foreigners, and the perks they enjoy over locals in military exemption as well as in scholarships, are themselves strong push factors. </p>
              <p>They see the foreigners as a threat to jobs and space, undermining salaries and loosening the nation’s cohesion. </p>
              <p>“I just feel very sad to see the Singapore of today with so many talented, passionate Singaporeans moving out and being replaced by many foreigners,” said one blogger. “I feel sorry for the future.” </p>
              <p>Others point out the danger of an easy fix in numbers without regard to quality. </p>
              <p>“Foreigners treat this place as a hotel, when the economy turns they will leave,” said a teacher who is seeing more and more foreign students in his class. </p>
              <p>Lee recently made a passionate appeal to youths to think hard about their country. He said they had received education and opportunities provided by Singaporeans who had worked hard for it. </p>
              <p>“Can you in good conscience say, ‘Goodbye! Thank you very much?’ Can you leave with a clear conscience? I cannot,” he said. </p>

              <p>Have receives this comment from a Malaysian doctor working in UK.</p>
              <p>Dear Mr Seah Chiang Nee, <br>I thought your column in today's STAR is extremely interesting, and particularly pertinent to my personal circumstances. <br>All too often, people attribute reasons for emigration to general poverty (economic, individual financial, healthcare, etc). <br>I am a Malaysian doctor, and have lived in the UK for over 13 years now. As the only and eldest son of Malaysian Chinese parents (one of 3 siblings), I am expected to return to Malaysia for various reasons. My parents aren't poor. I have just told them that I do not intend to return to Malaysia, and would like to live in London instead. <br>However, they are unable to comprehend or accept my decision, particularly as they lead prosperous lives in Malaysia. <br>Your article is particularly apt, as it illustrates that in the current day and age, there are many other reasons for emigration, beyond economic strife. <br>Even PM Lee Hsien Long's eldest son (and we know the importance of this person's role in the families of our culture), is contemplating not returning to Singapore. <br>I think people forget, that as general quality of life improve, one seeks other forms of fulfillment. That is just part of natural human development. Certainly, somewhere like Singapore (where I spent 8 years my pre-university education), still has relative poverty of thought, freedom of speech, diversity of opportunities, depth of culture amongst other things. Thank you for your pertinent article. <br>In the current 'shrinking' world that we live in, where travel and communication is almost universally accessible and available, I certainly hope that people around us will have a more open-minded perception of emigration. That it is not simply attributed to economic opportunities. <br>After all, all of us seek different forms of fulfillment. As we (particularly Asia as a region) move upwards in life, hopefully one's choice of what is a better 'quality of life' can be better respected by the people around us. Emigration is often no longerabout survival, but about choosing what one sees is a better 'quality' of life. Kind Regards, <br>Chien <br><br>Dear Sir,<br>I'd just like to comment on your amazing article that you have written about the emigration rate in Singapore.<br>I am a 'Singaporean' studying in Malaysia in my final year before I am forced to return to my 'homeland' to 'serve' it. <br>I have never lived there and yet am still sent back to report for duty and hearing all my thoughts written out in an article in such a succinct manner actually made me have a little party in my head. <br>Just adding to everything you have said, I personally think it's the strict rules that they imply which adds to the pressure. <br>People are forced to believe one view rather than the whole view, you know?<br>Every-time, I am 'forced' to go back to Singapore to get an exit permit simply so I can continue my studies in Malaysia not only irritates me, but angers me a little. <br>Having never staying in Singapore for over 5 months in my lifetime... In addition to this, being a Drama student, I am forced to delay my studies by 2 years? <br>This essentially delays my career! This will never be forgiven in my opinion. Of course, there are some out there who want to complete their service as there is a sense of pride there, but for those who are totally against it?<br>I guess time is the only answer, whether it is my two years service, or 10 years down the road to when Singapore might realize, that their decline - is not coming by their creation of more lenient rules, and investing in this and that...but that the problem is with the people themselves, and their right as civilians of this world - their freedom.<br>Thank you once again sir,<br>Ben <br><br><em>Dear Seah Chiang Nee, </em><br>My two-cents worth on the above subject :<br>I have always wondered what it means - "leaving to go abroad for a better quality of life". <br>In my view, one does not stay very long in one place if one feels that one does not quite belong there. This can also be extrapolated to mean that the place is also an uninteresting and boring place.<br>In a similar context - on a national perspective - if there is little freedom of discussion, debate, and involvement in affairs of the states, and any other subjects or issues under the sun, in whatever shades or colour, at whatever level of intelligence, by whichever resident on these fair lands of Singapore and Malaysia, there is little that can be said to support it being an interesting and exciting place. You don't feel like its a great place if you have no say. You font feel like you belong if you don't have a say. It doesn't seem to be like your home or room. You seem to be only a guest. And guests depart when the time comes.<br>You feel at home, you identify with the "home" when there is freedom to be yourself and voice your views no matter how limited or unintelligent it may be. A place also where you can grow without feeling initimidated.<br>Imagine a family where the children are encouraged to talk and discuss any subject under the sun without feeling they will be penalised or punished or ostracized or viewed suspiciously or harshly (but with a benign smile and twinkle of the eye instead), can only be a healthy, functional, and warm environment for all. It all just depends on this head of the house and a, equally wise first woman of the house. <br>Is there any reason why residents under this roof, should not feel good, have a keen sense of self esteem and worth, identity, belonging? Or of a confidence that they are allowed to grow in understanding and knowledge of the complexities of many less-than-easy-to comprehend issues of life, society, politics, death, religion, and what have you that concerns them in this earthly domain. Idealistic? I think not.<br>Compare this with a dysfunctional family whose heads of the households are too busy with making a living or living their own little lives, with little interest or knowledge in building family ties that lead to the positive intangibles mentioned in the fore-going paragraph. Ingredients for a rather lifeless, boring, uninteresting, uncultured, unintellectual, uncivilized familial environment, wouldn't you say?<br>I look at Singapore and Malaysia and I see two families where the children, even though grown up as they are, have little say in terms of voicing their opinions - whether right or wrong, intelligent or or not so clever - in the mainstream medias. Such overly tight control over the medias contributes basically to an "oppressive" (albeit benign) atmosphere. One does not feel like one have a stake in the country. For to have a stake is to have a say on the policies and decisions of the country from national to local councils' decisions. And of which there is an equally interesting and well edited reportage of such discussion and debates and commentaries available at the same time. It is when MPs and bureaucratic heads are no longer allowed to feel by the fourth estate that they are inviolable Gods or demi Gods, then I think we have arrived. Then indeed political debates, for example, is a live "on-line", "real time" tool of national building. (Of course at the end of the day, we know there is only one elected party whose job is to govern. So no big deal if we have a lot of noisy chatter)<br>"Man shall not live by bread alone" perhaps aptly sums it all up. <br>It is probably the one major reason - subconsciously or consciously - why the anglo-saxon countries seem more appealing to many outsiders. I certainly felt it when I returned back to Malaysia. there is a loss of interest and excitement and ability to "connect" with the place you are in. It was like going outside the mainstream unlike NZ where no matter which part of the country you are in, you feel as part of the whole. The mass media does not make you feel left out. Here there is a sense of being a faceless, unknown and unimportant digit; a "masses" for the exploitation by unscrupulous vultures.<br>So, to advance to the next lap or phase in development policy, would be to advance to a heightened sense of belonging, participation, and knowledge of their ownership of this two fair lands. Open up and develop the media as knowledge drivers. We need to develop this to provide continuing education to all stake-holders.<br>Vigorous, dynamic, exciting, intelligent debates and discussions on just about any subject under the sky. This is truly what a really open society is about. Not the "open society" so narrowly defined by LKY earlier. Its a new generation, a new time. There needs a re-definition for Singapore and Malaysia on this matter. <br>Time to loosen control. The children are grown up. Should we hold them from going forward to 2020?<br><strong>Henry Lee<br>Seremban</strong><br></p>

              SINGAPORE is losing about 1,000 capable people every year and the numbers are growing, said Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, sounding the alarm on the severity of the brain drain.
              <p>And the main magnet for these talents is not regional powerhouse China, but the United States and other developed English-speaking countries, he told the United Press International (UPI) news agency in an interview earlier this month.</p>
              <p>Citing figures of Singaporeans who gave up their citizenship and took out their savings and CPF funds, he said this meant 'losing about, at the top end, 1,000 a year, which is about - if you take the top 30 per cent of the population - about 4 or 5 per cent'.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee believes this exodus can only grow because 'every year, there are more people going abroad for their first or second degree'.</p>
              <p>Some of these Singaporean talents head for China, but return eventually because, at the end of the day, they do not want to compete with the Chinese, he said.</p>
              <p>'You go to China, you're going to compete against 1,300 million very bright fellows, hardworking, starving.</p>

              <p>In comparison, the pull of the US is difficult to reverse, he said, noting that American firms recruited bright Singaporean students straight out of universities there.</p>
              <p>After acclimatising to life and work in the US, 'if they decide to take the green card and settle in America, then I think we've lost them', he said. Singaporeans who do not want the stiff competition in the US go to Australia and Canada.</p>
              <p>The brain drain has been a regular issue addressed by Mr Lee. To stem this loss of talent, Singapore has wooed many top professionals from China and India here, he said.</p>
              <p>The draw for the Chinese is that their children can learn both English and Chinese, while the Indians like Singapore because it is close to home, yet a step up in terms of First World infrastructure.</p>
              <p>'The trouble is many of the Chinese then use us as a stepping stone to go to America, where the grass is greener.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Brain Drain</span></strong></p>
              <p>by Kenneth Lyen</p>
              <p>In the past few years, a number of my friends have emigrated from Singapore. Many of them are young gifted individuals on the upward swing of their careers. They have difficulties getting attractive jobs here, and they are aware of the exodus of manufacturing and consultation jobs out of Singapore. In addition my friends had become increasingly uncomfortable with the stifling nature of our bureaucracy, which prompted them to seek greener pastures overseas.</p>
              <p>Ngiam Tong Dow wrote in the Straits Times of 14 August 2004 that SingaporeÂ’s future economic survival depends on the number of talented and creative individuals that we can cultivate and retain. Competition is now global, and we need to create new products and innovate old ones regularly. We are competing with the brightest and most creative brains in the world.</p>
              <p>Each year we send large numbers of students overseas for study and research. Not all will return to Singapore, and we are suffering from a small but significant brain drain. Those who do return, will only remain for a while, and ultimately they will emigrate.</p>
              <p>Top companies worldwide recognise the importance of talent, and they scour the world in search of gifted people, whom they will grab. How do we reduce the number of our brightest individuals being drawn overseas?</p>
              <p>Ngiam suggested that one of the reasons why our talent leave is that they do not have enough creative space. Expanding this space can be achieved by giving greater freedom of expression, developing greater tolerance of divergent views and pushing out-of-bound markers. He also suggested that we make an emotional appeal to these people to return to Singapore, although he does not say how.</p>
              <p>However he misses out on a couple of important points. Why do our young talent forsake Singapore? Yes, some find our academic and intellectual climate and our excessive government regulation, quite suffocating. Yes, we do not treat our own citizens as well as we treat our overseas visitors, and indeed we tend to look down on our own and do not accord them the recognition they deserve.</p>
              <p>But there are a few other important factors that push our people away. First is the difficulty in getting financing for new businesses. Our financiers and venture capitalists tend to be very conservative, and do not like to take risks. They tend to underfund projects, so that there is no chance for them to succeed. Indeed, it is relatively easier to find funding overseas.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the high cost of living in Singapore has become a handicap in doing business. We are the 46th most expensive city to live in, according to Mercer Human Resource ConsultingÂ’s report for 2004. Our businesses are no longer competitive.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, we have a highly rigid atherosclerotic educational system. A significant number of emigrants cite this as the main reason why they are leaving. Their children are not coping with the excessively competitive and uncreative educational system. We may win international competitions that test convergent thinking, but we would most surely lose out on divergent thinking competitions if they were to exist.</p>
              <p>And the last straw that pushes our creative people away is that we have a quiet, skeletal arts scene that has inadequate government and public support.</p>
              <p>They have noted that Singapore agencies likes to "throw" money at overseas companies. For example, the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board is giving $10 million to lure overseas film companies to make part of their film in Singapore. The Singapore Film Commission gives 50% of film production costs to overseas companies on joint ventures, which in reality fail to afford any real benefits to Singapore filmmakers. Such behaviour sends the wrong message to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Unless we redress these and other complaints, and take effective remedial action, we will continue to lose our best and brightest minds.</p>
              <p>The former prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, accused such people as being "quitters". Well, instead of regarding this as a shameful label, the emigrants pride themselves in being "quitters". They send me photographs of their children enjoying the benefits of a more imaginative educational system overseas, and they tell me about the more self-fulfilling lifestyle they live.</p>
              <p>No, IÂ’m not envious of them. I have other priorities in life. I made my decision to return to Singapore after a stint in England and in the United States, with my eyes open. Yes the climate here is oppressively hot and humid. But IÂ’ve learnt to acclimatize. Not everyone can do this.</p>

              <p>CUT the length of scholarship bonds to three years and grant tax rebates for the overseas university fees paid by parents whose children return to Singapore after studying abroad.</p>
              <p>These measures were suggested by Nominated MP Loo Choon Yong to help tackle Singapore's brain drain.</p>
              <p>He noted that many talented young Singaporeans are leaving the country annually to study overseas and feared they 'may be lost to Singapore permanently' if they settle overseas after studying there.</p>
              <p>
              
              'We are losing some 1,000 bright people annually to other countries,' he said. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew provided the same statistic in an interview with United Press International earlier this month.</p>
              <p>Dr Loo said he supported the notion that scholarship students must return to serve Singapore after they study overseas. But he urged the Government to cut bond periods to three years and allow them the option of serving also in the private sector, not just with the Government.</p>
              <p>In this way, scholars who choose to work in the civil service would do so willingly. They would be attracted by the excellent compensation and improved work environment in government agencies, as well as the pride of serving Singapore, he said.</p>
              <p>The scholarships must 'not be an instrument for converting free Singaporeans to indentured serfs,' he said.</p>
              <p>In the light of the current shortage of places at local universities, Dr Loo also urged the finance minister to consider giving tax rebates to parents whose children study at approved overseas universities and return here to work.</p>
              <p>These tax rebates can be the same size as the subsidy given for the child if he had attended a local university.</p>
              <p>This can help to grow the pool of graduates in Singapore and give more Singaporeans a chance at tertiary education, said Dr Loo.</p>
              <p>'If we lose our young, we will have nothing,' he said.</p>

                  suspended payouts as the backlash against the Federal Government's

              <p>Blue-chip
                  funds manager Perpetual said that effective today, it would only allow
                  quarterly redemptions, based on funds available as securities mature in
                  the portfolios, freezing redemptions in seven of its funds containing
                  around $2 billion in investors' savings.</p>
              <p>"Regrettably, the <a href="http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,27753,24541907-31037,00.html">recent introduction of the guarantee on bank deposits</a> and subsequent actions by other parties has incited uncertainty in the
                  market and created a sudden spike in redemptions in the past few days,"
                  Perpetual group executive of income and multi-sector funds Richard
                  Brandweiner said.</p>
              <p>"In this context, we must act prudently to protect the interests of all investors in the funds."</p>
              <p>The Perpetual move comes soon after that of Challenger Howard, th<span style="color: #ff0000;">e
                  biggest mortgage fu</span>nd in the country, which froze redemptions earlier

              <div class="post-body entry-content">The topic of ‘Rice’ hogged the headlines of local news this week following its soaring price all over Asia, including Singapore.<br><br>Reasons for the increase in price boils down to these three main factors:<br><br>1) Higher fuel costs, with crude soaring above US $100 a barrel and threatening to stay that way, have been a major factor in the crisis, making fertilizer more expensive and increasing transport costs.<br>2) In Southeast Asia, disease, pests and an unparalleled 45-day cold snap that extended from China to Vietnam in January and February have also hurt harvests. Flooding in the Philippines and Vietnam has added to the growing crisis.<br>3) Medium-grade rice exported from Thailand, the world’s biggest rice exporter, reached $760 a metric ton, up from $360 a ton at the end of last year.<br><br>Singaporeans, including me are feeling the pinch when we witness our forking of extra few hard-earned dollars for the same kilogram of rice.<br><br>Some hawkers in Singapore may also be capitalising on this surge of rice price to increase the price of their rice dishes by a few cents. I patron regularly a food stall which sell reasonably-priced ‘chap chai ben’ but now for the same few dishes and the same amount of rice, the hawker charges me an additional 20 cents!<br><br>I asked the hawker why the price increases, he replied me that it was ‘a natural thing’ to do and he had ‘no choice’ but to increase his price following the surge in price of rice.<br><br>Well, he certainly has other alternatives, not all the hawkers in Singapore are increasing the prices of their rice dishes to defray the rising cost of rice. This hawker is certainly killing his business and disappointing his ‘loyal customer’ by his price-increase feat. I would think twice before buying food from him again in future.<br><br>How apt is the man’s lament ‘This rising, that rising’ in the recent ad by the retailer Courts.<br><br>Meanwhile, governments of rice importing countries, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, are expressing concern that rising prices could spark unrest.</div>
