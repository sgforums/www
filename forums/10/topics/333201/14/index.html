Taxi fares are going up. <br><br>Taxi giant ComfortDelGro Corp has notified the Public Transport Council (PTC) about an imminent fare increase. The PTC could not say more. <br><br>Commuters can expect to pay more from as early as the week before Christmas, as taxi operators have to inform the council at least two weeks before any fare changes. <br><br>For its part, ComfortDelGro again declined to comment, as it has for several weeks since speculation about a hike first started. <br><br>Sources, however, said the adjustment will include a 30-cent rise in flag-down rate. This would bring the minimum starting fare to $2.80. For newer cabs which meet the stringent Euro IV emission standard, the flag-down will go from $2.70 to $3. <br><br>Currently, ComfortDelGro has about 2,000 of such cabs in its fleet. <br><br>Commuters can expect changes to the distance and time-based charges too. Surcharges are also expected to be streamlined. <br><br>There is speculation that the operator might help cabbies defray electronic road- pricing charges to encourage them to enter the Central Business District - where demand for cabs is high. <br><br>The signs of a fare hike had been there for some time as cabbies and their associations have been lobbying for it for several months now, arguing the increase in diesel price and the goods and services tax have eroded drivers' income substantially. <br><br>The plight of cabbies is not lost on commuters. Said merchandiser Ivy Ong, 41, who takes cabs regularly: 'Will this fare adjustment be helping the taxi-drivers? If their taxi rental goes up, I don't think it would.' <br><br>Citigroup Singapore strategist Lim Jit Soon does not think ComfortDelGro would raise rental this time round as it wants to retain as many drivers as possible 'in this buoyant market'. <br><br>'What it means is that it might gradually remove some subsidies,' he said. <br><br>For instance, ComfortDelGro is still selling diesel to cabbies at 94 cents a litre, 36 cents cheaper than diesel dispensed at stations run by oil companies. <br><br></span><a href="mailto:christan@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0053a2; font-family: Calibri;">christan@sph.com.sg</span></span></a></span></strong></p></div>

That is because oil prices will continue to be high, and the six months from April to September tend to see higher power use nationwide. <br><br>The wholesale price is what power companies pay for electricity, plus a small amount of regulation and administrative costs and adjustments. It affects how much consumers end up paying. <br><br>Yesterday, the Energy Market Co, which runs the wholesale electricity market here, said that this price - known as the Uniform Singapore Energy Price - jumped 17.7 per cent from March to hit $173 per megawatt hour (MWh) last month. <br><br>That is the highest monthly average since 2003, when wholesale market trading began, and well up on the last high of $168.34 per MWh in August 2006. Last year, the average price was $124.57 per MWh. <br><br>The result is a corresponding spike in electricity prices consumers pay, though it is not a direct correlation. <br><br>In response to rising wholesale prices, Singapore Power Services (SPS), which supplies electricity to about 1.2 million households, has been steadily increasing electricity tariffs. <br><br>The so-called Low Tension Tariff, which is what the man-in-the-street pays, was 18.88 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh) from April to June last year. <br><br>The rate jumped to 22.62 cents per kwh by the first quarter of this year. And a month ago, the rate - which is set by SPS every quarter - rose 5.7 per cent to 23.88 cents per kwh. <br><br>For people such retiree Loh T.E., this means higher electricity bills. <br><br>Mr Loh, who lives in a five-room flat without air-conditioning, said electricity costs now make up 12 per cent of his household expenses, compared with 8 per cent last year. <br><br>EMC chief executive David Carlson said yesterday that the main reason behind the higher bills is the rising price of crude oil, which hit close to US$124 (S$170) per barrel yesterday. <br><br>And fuel oil, which is priced in tandem with crude oil, forms the largest cost component for power generating companies. <br><br>'Fuel oil prices continued to rise coming into this year, so during the first quarter, fuel costs have had to be paid by (power) generators. That had an impact on what they can offer into the market,' said Mr Carlson. <br><br>'We expect to see higher demand (for power) in the second and third quarter.' <br><br>But he declined to predict if that would translate to higher electricity prices, saying that there were other factors at play. <br><br>First, demand is heavily influenced by economic growth. If the economy slows down, then prices should ease a little. <br><br>Second, Singapore's power market has been liberalised, and new power generation companies are free to enter the market and compete, bringing down prices. <br><br>Mr Carlson said greater competition has cushioned the impact of oil prices on electricity prices in the past three years and will continue doing so. <br><br></span><a href="mailto:yanghw@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0053a2; font-family: Calibri;">yanghw@sph.com.sg</span></span></a></span></strong></p></div>

But after adjusting for inflation, they effectively earned $3,982. <br><br>This monthly figure is derived from an average of all full-time and part-time CPF members. <br><br>Rising global prices of food and fuel saw the consumer price index rise by 6.6 per cent in the first three months of this year. <br><br>The Government rolled out help schemes for the needy and the strong Singapore dollar is helping maintain purchasing power. The National Wages Council also asked firms to give one-off bonuses to help rank-and-file workers cope with inflation. <br><br>Still, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said the best way to manage rising prices is to grow the economy so real incomes outpace inflation. <br><br>But for now, salary consultant Peter Lee is not optimistic real earnings can do so. 'Nobody can control inflation, and most employers cannot adjust wages to fight it,' said the managing consultant of RDS Remuneration Data Specialists. <br><br>His firm's recent survey of 200 companies showed pay packets were likely to rise by 5 per cent - lower than what prices have risen already by, and below the 6 per cent inflation forecast this year. <br><br>But for now, the economy is growing, with jobs aplenty. <br><br>The ministry's report showed a record 73,200 new jobs from January to March. This includes 46,500 in services, 14,500 in construction and 11,800 in manufacturing. <br><br>But unemployment crept up to 2 per cent in March, from 1.7 per cent in December. Among residents, the rate was 2.9 per cent, up from 2.4 per cent. <br><br>As for vacancies, there were 38,200 openings in March with more jobs for professionals, managers, executives, technicians, clerical, sales and service staff. <br><br>Analysts like Dr Park believe unemployment may rise and job growth could slow - a point backed by a Monetary Authority of Singapore survey of economists, who see growth slowing to 4.7 per cent this quarter. <br><br><a href="mailto:zakirh@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">zakirh@sph.com.sg</span></a></span></strong></strong></p><strong>

              <p>What I’d like to propose today is a government guarantee to pay all of
              the federal government’s contracts, up to $1 million, to small
              business, on time, <span style="color: #ff0000;">within 30 days.</span> That’s almost 70,000 contracts a
              year. And if we don’t, the proposal is this: you and small business can
              charge us interest until we do. We intend to lead by example.</p>

Taxi fares are going up.<br><br>Taxi giant ComfortDelGro Corp has notified the Public Transport Council (PTC) about an imminent fare increase. The PTC could not say more.<br><br>Commuters can expect to pay more from as early as the week before Christmas, as taxi operators have to inform the council at least two weeks before any fare changes.<br><br>For its part, ComfortDelGro again declined to comment, as it has for several weeks since speculation about a hike first started.<br><br>Sources, however, said the adjustment will include a 30-cent rise in flag-down rate. This would bring the minimum starting fare to $2.80. For newer cabs which meet the stringent Euro IV emission standard, the flag-down will go from $2.70 to $3.<br><br>Currently, ComfortDelGro has about 2,000 of such cabs in its fleet.<br><br>Commuters can expect changes to the distance and time-based charges too. Surcharges are also expected to be streamlined.<br><br>There is speculation that the operator might help cabbies defray electronic road- pricing charges to encourage them to enter the Central Business District - where demand for cabs is high.<br><br>The signs of a fare hike had been there for some time as cabbies and their associations have been lobbying for it for several months now, arguing the increase in diesel price and the goods and services tax have eroded drivers' income substantially.<br><br>The plight of cabbies is not lost on commuters. Said merchandiser Ivy Ong, 41, who takes cabs regularly: 'Will this fare adjustment be helping the taxi-drivers? If their taxi rental goes up, I don't think it would.'<br><br>Citigroup Singapore strategist Lim Jit Soon does not think ComfortDelGro would raise rental this time round as it wants to retain as many drivers as possible 'in this buoyant market'.<br><br>'What it means is that it might gradually remove some subsidies,' he said.<br><br>For instance, ComfortDelGro is still selling diesel to cabbies at 94 cents a litre, 36 cents cheaper than diesel dispensed at stations run by oil companies.<br><br></span><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:christan@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0053a2; font-family: Calibri;">christan@sph.com.sg</span></span></a></span></strong></p></div>

The National Wages Council also asked firms to give one-off bonuses to help rank-and-file workers cope with inflation.<br><br>Still, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said the best way to manage rising prices is to grow the economy so real incomes outpace inflation.<br><br>But for now, salary consultant Peter Lee is not optimistic real earnings can do so. 'Nobody can control inflation, and most employers cannot adjust wages to fight it,' said the managing consultant of RDS Remuneration Data Specialists.<br><br>His firm's recent survey of 200 companies showed pay packets were likely to rise by 5 per cent - lower than what prices have risen already by, and below the 6 per cent inflation forecast this year.<br><br>But for now, the economy is growing, with jobs aplenty.<br><br>The ministry's report showed a record 73,200 new jobs from January to March. This includes 46,500 in services, 14,500 in construction and 11,800 in manufacturing.<br><br>But unemployment crept up to 2 per cent in March, from 1.7 per cent in December.

That is because oil prices will continue to be high, and the six months from April to September tend to see higher power use nationwide.<br><br>The wholesale price is what power companies pay for electricity, plus a small amount of regulation and administrative costs and adjustments. It affects how much consumers end up paying.<br><br>Yesterday, the Energy Market Co, which runs the wholesale electricity market here, said that this price - known as the Uniform Singapore Energy Price - jumped 17.7 per cent from March to hit $173 per megawatt hour (MWh) last month.<br><br>That is the highest monthly average since 2003, when wholesale market trading began, and well up on the last high of $168.34 per MWh in August 2006. Last year, the average price was $124.57 per MWh.<br><br>The result is a corresponding spike in electricity prices consumers pay, though it is not a direct correlation.<br><br>In response to rising wholesale prices, Singapore Power Services (SPS), which supplies electricity to about 1.2 million households, has been steadily increasing electricity tariffs.<br><br>The so-called Low Tension Tariff, which is what the man-in-the-street pays, was 18.88 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh) from April to June last year.<br><br>The rate jumped to 22.62 cents per kwh by the first quarter of this year. And a month ago, the rate - which is set by SPS every quarter - rose 5.7 per cent to 23.88 cents per kwh.<br><br>For people such retiree Loh T.E., this means higher electricity bills.<br><br>Mr Loh, who lives in a five-room flat without air-conditioning, said electricity costs now make up 12 per cent of his household expenses, compared with 8 per cent last year.<br><br>EMC chief executive David Carlson said yesterday that the main reason behind the higher bills is the rising price of crude oil, which hit close to US$124 (S$170) per barrel yesterday.<br><br>And fuel oil, which is priced in tandem with crude oil, forms the largest cost component for power generating companies.<br><br>'Fuel oil prices continued to rise coming into this year, so during the first quarter, fuel costs have had to be paid by (power) generators. That had an impact on what they can offer into the market,' said Mr Carlson.<br><br>'We expect to see higher demand (for power) in the second and third quarter.'<br><br>But he declined to predict if that would translate to higher electricity prices, saying that there were other factors at play.<br><br>First, demand is heavily influenced by economic growth. If the economy slows down, then prices should ease a little.<br><br>Second, Singapore's power market has been liberalised, and new power generation companies are free to enter the market and compete, bringing down prices.<br><br>Mr Carlson said greater competition has cushioned the impact of oil prices on electricity prices in the past three years and will continue doing so.<br><br></span><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:yanghw@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0053a2; font-family: Calibri;">yanghw@sph.com.sg</span></span></a></span></strong></p></div>

              <p>The Coalition Government was elected in March 1996. We laid down an economic program setting out medium-term targets on fiscal policy, monetary policy and debt management. By July 1997 we were on track to balance the budget for the first time in seven years. It was a close run.</p>
              <p>Beginning with mass capital outflow from Thailand in June-July 1997, financial contagion began spreading around the region. Those in Australia who had marvelled at the growth rates and saving rates of Asian Tigers saw these countries stagger and reel. They could only shudder to think what would happen to Australia - considered by many to have a weaker economy.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But Australia did not succumb to the Asian financial and economic collapse. In 1997-98 our growth rate was 4.5 per cent. We produced the first balanced budget in seven years. Paul Krugman writing in <em>Fortune Magazine</em> in December 1998 dubbed Australia “the miracle economy”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In March 1996 the APEC Finance Ministers met in Japan. It was the first APEC meeting I attended. We were given a polite welcome but we were not respected. Australia was tolerated much as a fading uncle is tolerated at Christmas dinner - there out of politeness and past association rather than present or future expectation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">But we proved strong and resilient through the Asian economic crisis. We survived and we offered financial assistance to badly affected economies in the region.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In May 1999 APEC Finance Ministers met at Langkawi in Malaysia. We were not the fading relation at this meeting. Australia had won a great deal of respect. The region knew Australia was a success story and they wanted to learn from its experience. Now we had people talking of the “Australian model”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Since 1996 Australia has had continuous growth averaging 3.5 per cent per annum. During that period Singapore has had three recessions, Hong Kong has had three recessions, Korea has had one recession, Taiwan has had two recessions, Japan has had four recessions, and the United States went into a recession in 2001.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Over the last 10 years Australia has earned a great deal of respect amongst its neighbours and the other economies of the world. Australia’s achievements have given its people a lot more self respect. The nation feels more secure about itself. This is the Australian revival.</p>

              <p><span>Di Yerbury Lecture Sydney</span></p>
              <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>The most recent OECD economic survey of Australia declared that in “the last decade of the 20th century Australia became a model for other OECD countries”. It is a report card which confirms that the sacrifices which went into stripping back protection and making all sectors of the Australia economy more competitive have, for the most part, been worth it.</p>

              </ul>
              <div>
              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">A stable and competitive economy</span></h1>
              <p>Australia has recorded 17 consecutive years of economic growth since 1992 – averaging 3.3 per cent a year.</p>
              <p>It has been one of the most stable and productive periods of Australia’s modern history, and places Australia in the top echelon of developed countries in terms of sustained rates of growth.</p>
              <p>Australia is forecast to grow again at 2.75 per cent in 2008-09 which is above the average growth rate members of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of 2.2 per cent.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Australia ranks first in the Asia-Pacific region for labour, agricultural and industrial productivity per person employed, according to the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook.</p>
              <p>The 2006 OECD Economic Survey noted that living standards in Australia surpass those of all Group of Eight countries except the United States.</p>
              <h2>Sound economic management</h2>
              <p>Australia’s positive outlook is also sustained by its strong fiscal position. A sustained period of Government budget surpluses has enabled the Australian Government and many state level Governments to retire large amounts of Government debt.</p>
              <p>Net Government debt was eliminated in 2005-06 making Australia a net creditor nation. In May 2008, the Australian Government committed to a budget surplus equivalent to 1.8 per cent of GDP – some $21.7 billion.</p>
              <p>Australia’s independent central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), is responsible for monetary policy, in particular to keep consumer price inflation between two and three percent, on average, over business cycles.</p>
              <h2>Advanced economic structure</h2>
              <p>Australia has a sound and practical structure of financial regulations and institutions that provides certainty for business and is open to investment without undue delay. There is a strong, transparent corporate governance system along with business-oriented corporate regulation and insolvency regimes.</p>
              <p>Australia also has low barriers to trade and investment. Since a wave of micro-economic reform in the early 1990s, competition policy has been a key ingredient of the economy’s continuing success, including in key areas such as transport, telecommunications, electricity and gas.</p>
              <p>According to the World Bank, a new business can be established in Australia within two days compared with an OECD average of 20 days.</p>
              <p>The goods and services tax (GST) – Australia’s value-added tax – is levied at 10 per cent and applies to almost all goods and services transactions across the economy. There is no stamp duty on share transactions and a flat corporate tax rate of 30 per cent.</p>
              <p>Australia’s long and extensive period of economic growth has stretched its infrastructure capacity to the limit. Recognising the potential capacity restraints resulting from this problem, the Government committed in 2008 to creating an organisation called ‘Infrastructure Australia’ to provide a new, national approach to planning, funding and implementing the nation's future infrastructure needs.</p>
              <p>Safe, stable and prosperous, Australia is an increasingly attractive hub for global and regional business operations.</p>
              <div>
              <div>Did you know?</div>
              <p>Australia is home to citizens from some 200 countries, making it the most multilingual workforce in the Asia–Pacific region. More than 4 million Australians speak a second language.</p>
              </div>
              <h2>Knowledge-based industries</h2>
              <p>In the last century, it could be strongly argued that Australia’s economic success was based on its abundant agricultural and later mineral and fuels resources. While these sectors are still important, Australia has increasingly become a knowledge-based economy.</p>
              <p>Numerous factors have contributed to this development: the pace of technological and social change; advances in transport making travel, and the exchange of ideas, easier; and broader access to higher standards of education.</p>
              <p>Information and communications technology (ICT) is a key driver of economic growth, and continuing expansion of ICT infrastructure is essential to keep pace with world standards. Australia’s ICT market is worth an estimated $89 billion with 25 000 companies employing 236 000 IT specialists.</p>
              <div>
              <div>Did you know?</div>
              <p>Australia was ranked the third most technology-savvy country in the world in the 2007 Globalisation Index (conducted for Foreign Policy by consulting firm A.T. Kearney).</p>
              </div>
              <h2>Financial markets</h2>
              <p>Australia is a major regional financial centre and a vital cog in the global financial system.</p>
              <p>The Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange merged in 2006 to form the world’s 8<sup>th</sup> largest listed exchange – the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). As at 30 June 2007, the ASX had 2,090 listed companies with a domestic market capitalisation of $1.63 trillion. Every day, some 150 000 equities and 400 000 futures and options are traded.</p>
              <p>Australia’s trading day spans the closure of the markets in the United States and the opening of markets in Europe. The ASX also has strong links with the major stock markets of Asia.</p>
              <p>Australia has one of the highest percentages of shareholders in the world. More than 50 per cent of the adult population own shares in publicly-listed companies.</p>

              <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
              <p><strong><em><span style="color: #008000;">The Association of South-East Asian Nations used to boast of the virtues of being an easy-going club. No longer.</span></em></strong></p>
              <p>NOBODY likes to admit his dependence on others' goodwill. For the proud leaders of south east Asia, once so cocksure about their political and economic prowess, the experience has been especially galling. The global markets have, with a vengeance, taken a toll on their economic miracle. And, to sort out the mess, they are reduced to complaining that the rich world-the United States, Japan and Europe-is not doing enough to help. They may be right. But the financial turmoil has also shown up the inadequacy of the region's own self-help mechanisms.</p>
              <p>None of the much-touted institutions and forums designed to promote regional stability and economic health has had much to contribute, especially not the region's own club: the Association of south east Asian Nations (ASEAN). This favours carrots over sticks, consensus over breakthrough, camaraderie over formality and process over substance. Above all, ASEAN resists "interference in the internal affairs" of its members. Although this served the region well in the years after ASEAN's founding in 1967, enabling old sores to be salved and mutual confidence to be built, it has rendered the organisation incapable of providing a concerted response to the financial disaster. The "ASEAN way" no longer works.<br><br><strong>Economic sclerosis</strong></p>
              <p>THE organisation has, since last July, faced serious challenges to its effectiveness on three fronts: the economic, with the contagious effect of currency depreciations and market meltdowns; the political, from the bloody putsch in Cambodia just before it was due to join ASEAN; and the environmental, because of the poisonous smog from Indonesian forest fires. In each case the organisation's cardinal principle of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/80227aw.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">non-interference</span></span></a> has run into the reality of interdependence.</p>
              <p>One of the ironies is that the economic integration to which ASEAN has always aspired has arrived in the saddest of circumstances. The group has made some progress in economic co-operation. Intra-regional trade had been growing fast, lessening the reliance on America for exports, and a regional free-trade area is in the works. There is some co-ordination between central banks. But the speed with which the markets turned on the region as a whole exaggerated its member countries' similarities, and the unity between them.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the differences within the region made it hard to come up with an effective regional response. There have been several occasions when, had ASEAN not been so averse to meddling in its members' affairs, friendly criticism might have helped to avert calamity. Thailand, where south east Asia sprang a leak early last year, had for some time been heading for the rocks. The IMF had cautioned its government; the markets had sent warning shots across its bows; but any persuasion from fellow ASEAN members to set a new course was so discreet that it was easy to ignore.</p>
              <p>Later, after the Thai currency, the baht, had been floated and sank, and its neighbours found their own currencies and markets under siege, each country became painfully vulnerable to policy mistakes made by the others. For three months, for example, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, made repeated vitriolic attacks on speculators and on the West, and threatened to impose capital controls. Each outburst was followed by a sell-off, not just in Malaysia, but across the region. Many ASEAN leaders, as well as Malaysian businessmen, must have wished Dr Mahathir would keep his mouth shut. But it is unthinkable, in the ASEAN context, that they should tell him so.</p>
              <p>And they certainly cannot boss President Suharto of Indonesia around. The only ASEAN leader in power since the group's founding, Mr Suharto, in his quiet Javanese way, calls the shots. Indonesia is the regional giant, and has become the local bully. Containing Indonesia after the excesses of its "confrontation" with Malaysia and Singapore in the early 1960s was one of ASEAN's prime objectives and its greatest diplomatic success. Now, Mr Suharto's economic mismanagement poses the biggest threat to regional economic recovery.</p>
              <p>Other South-East Asian leaders, such as Dr Mahathir and Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister of Singapore, have visited him, presumably to coax him into implementing the sort of reforms the IMF has prescribed. But telephone calls from President Bill Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl probably did more to get Mr Suharto apparently to shelve a much-criticised plan to peg the stricken Indonesian currency, the rupiah, to the dollar by means of a currency board.</p>
              <p>Many south east Asians were alarmed. Asked about such "shock therapy", one finance minister says he is not sure that "therapy" is the right word. But he would not say so in public. That is not "the ASEAN way". When Singapore's senior minister, Lee Kuan Yew, suggested that Mr Suharto's apparent <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/80212st1.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">choice of a new vice-president</span></span></a> might rattle the markets, there were angry editorials in the Indonesian press.</p>
              <p>Yet the continuing economic dismemberment of Indonesia is, in a sense, the first test for the most significant initiative ASEAN has taken to deal with the crisis. The "Manila framework", agreed upon in the Philippine capital last November, envisages a regional surveillance mechanism whereby ASEAN members would pool economic data and apply "peer pressure" on those pursuing dangerous policies. This was virtually all that was left of a bold plan for an "Asian monetary fund", pursued with particular gusto by Dr Mahathir. Japan, which would have provided much of the money, pulled out, faced with the disapproval of the United States and the IMF.</p>
              <p>In the absence of a fund, ASEAN had no choice but to accept the IMF's primacy in prescribing economic cures. Although there is still talk of a "standby facility", the idea is, in the words of Lee Kuan Yew's son, Lee Hsien Loong, the head of Singapore's monetary authority, for "a kind of neighbourhood watch scheme".</p>
              <p>Although such initiatives might ease the next crisis, they come too late to help with this one. Instead, it is hoped that western governments will persuade their banks not to call in their loans; that Japan will stimulate its economy; that Europe and the United States will come up with more aid; and that China will not devalue its currency and set off a new round of regional depreciation. But as south east Asian leaders and diplomats grumble about the inadequacy of the rich countries' offers of help, and mutter about "fair-weather friends", they might think about the shortcomings of their own approach. A spot of "peer pressure" on governments causing instability would be a fine thing. But there is little sign of it; and none that it is working.<br><br><strong>Diplomatic paralysis</strong></p>
              <p>CALLS for a rethink of ASEAN's ways were first prompted, not by the economic debacle, but by a political upheaval: the savage coup mounted in Cambodia on July 5th last year, in which the country's second prime minister, Hun Sen, got rid of the first, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
              <p>Mr Hun Sen blew two holes in ASEAN's cosy style of business. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/0711smh.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Cambodia</span></span></a> was due to join on July 23rd, along with <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/10/topics/0714pres.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Myanmar</span></span></a> and Laos, thereby realising the founders' vision of a group including all ten countries of south east Asia. But the organisation had little choice but to defer Cambodia's accession. It had to admit that there were, after all, some limits to "non-interference", and some basic criteria for the domestic behaviour of members. But nobody could agree exactly what those criteria should be.</p>
              <p>Second, efforts to find a solution in "the ASEAN way" were thwarted by Mr Hun Sen's refusal to play by such rules. He was rude in public and private to ASEAN officials, and repeatedly pointed out the hypocrisy of their position. They had, after all, proceeded with the admission of Myanmar, despite its government's illegitimate seizure of power in 1988, its overturning of an election result in 1990, and its continued repression of dissenters. When, this month, hopes of a breakthrough in Cambodia finally emerged, it was as a result of a proposal, not from ASEAN, but from Japan.</p>
              <p>Although ASEAN diplomats express exasperation about Cambodia, they have a bigger worry. The regional crisis raises the fear of a catastrophic explosion of unrest and repression in Indonesia. Diplomatic efforts are directed at ensuring that it does not happen-largely by ensuring the rich world is aware of the potential danger, and so dips deep into its pocket to buy stability.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew laments that ASEAN can only show a "solidarity of fellow chicken-flu sufferers." On February 28th, the group's finance ministers were due to discuss measures such as Dr Mahathir's idea for greater use of local currencies in inter-regional trade, and Singapore's proposal for foreign guarantees to help finance Indonesian trade. But the important decisions are out of ASEAN's hands. As Mr Lee says: "We can't help each other."</p>

              <p>Singapore becomes the first Asian victim of recession</p>
              <p><br><span>AFP, SINGAPORE</span><br>Saturday, Oct 11, 2008, Page 1</p>
              <p>Singapore has become the first Asian economy to fall into recession, analysts said yesterday, after the government revised downward its full-year growth estimate and eased monetary policy for the first time in years.<br><br>The Ministry of Trade and Industry lowered the city-state’s full-year growth forecast to around 3 percent, citing a slowdown in the global economy and key domestic sectors.<br><br>The move came as the ministry released preliminary data showing that real GDP declined by 6.3 percent in the third quarter after contracting 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, the ministry said.<br><br>While it did not describe the economy as being in recession, a technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in economic output.<br><br>“Singapore will be the first Asia economy to fall into a technical recession,” DBS Group Research said in an assessment of the data.<br><br>In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) — its de facto central bank — said it was easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.<br><br>“The Singapore economy has weakened over the course of 2008, alongside an escalation in the turmoil in financial markets and a more severe deceleration in global economic activity,” MAS said.<br><br>These developments meant new uncertainties for the Singapore economy, while slower Asian growth would restrain activity in a range of service industries such as transportation and tourism, it said.<br><br>“The risks to external demand conditions continue to be on the downside and a more severe global downturn cannot be discounted,” the bank said.<br><br>Singapore is Southeast Asia’s wealthiest economy in terms of GDP per capita, but is heavily dependent on trade. This makes it sensitive to hiccups in developed economies, particularly key export markets the US and Europe.<br><br>Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP, the value of goods and services produced in the economy.<br><br>Compared with the third quarter of last year, the ministry said Singapore’s economy contracted by 0.5 percent in real terms, against the 0.8 percent expansion foreseen in the Dow Jones poll.</p>

              <div>SINGAPORE'S economy has slid into its first technical recession since 2002, as a slump in exports pushed quarterly growth into negative territory for the second quarter in a row.</div>
              <div>The economy shrank by a worse-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, according to estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) released on Friday morning.</div>
              <p>MTI has also revised its full-year growth forecast for the second time this year, lowering it to 'around 3 per cent' from 4 to 5 per cent previously. This would make it the weakest pace in seven years.</p>
              <p>Recognising growth concerns, the Monetary Authority of Singapore also changed its policy stance to zero appreciation of the Singapore dollar, reversing the gradual appreciation policy it has adopted since 2003.</p>
              <p>On a quarterly basis, third-quarter GDP contracted 6.3 per cent from the second quarter, on top of a 5.7 per cent decline in the previous three months. A technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of decline.</p>
              <p>Manufacturing led the slowdown again this time around, weighed down by a poor performance in the biomedical sciences segment. It was also hit by weakened global demand for exports as the United States-triggered financial crisis spreads around the world.</p>
              <p>The sector shrank by 11.5 per cent in the third quarter, after declining 4.9 per cent in the previous quarter.</p>
              <p>Growth in construction and services also slowed. Construction, in particular, saw its pace of expansion halved to single-digit growth, as projects were delayed by the construction squeeze, said MTI.</p>
              <p>Services, touted as a key driver of growth this year, is likely to take a hit as well as financial services falters in the wake of the global credit crunch.</p>
              <p>Most economists expect the economy to grow even more slowly next year, with the chance of a technical recession turning into a 'real' one.</p>
              <p>'With external conditions deteriorating and the lack of domestic demand support, we expect Singapore to register no growth next year... with a muted recovery, if at all, expected only in the second half of next year at the earliest,' said Morgan Stanley economists in a report.</p>
              <p><strong>Inflation peaks</strong><br>Inflation, which reached a 26-year high earlier this year, has peaked, said MAS. Consumer prices will rise between 6 per cent and 7 per cent this year, and gains will ease to between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 2009, it predicted.</p>
              <p>'Against the backdrop of a weakening external economic environment and continuing stresses in global financial markets, the growth of the Singapore economy is expected to remain below potential in the period ahead,' said MAS.</p>
              <p>'Inflation is expected to trend down in 2009 as the global and domestic economies slow.'(Straits Times Singapore)</p>

              <p>They only worry about Australian dollar going down against Singapore currency and neglect the fact that Singaporean dollar is going down against other major currencies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought Singapore has lots of reserves similar to Japan, then how is it that Japanese Yen rose against the US Dollar, but Singapore Dollar fell against the US Dollar. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shouldn't the Singapore Dollar be a stronger currency due to her reserves, or have all Singaporeans been tricked. Ok. Who can properly account for all of Singapore's reserves?
