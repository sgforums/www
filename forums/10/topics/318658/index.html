                                    oblivious to the danger. By Seah Chiang Nee.<br> May 24, 2008</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">AFTER 
                                    several years of explosive growth and a red-hot property 
                                    market, Singaporeans are facing the prospect of stormier 
                                    times ahead.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    party spoiler is the prospect of a combined sharp slowdown 
                                    and high prices spilling over here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Supported 
                                    by strong reserves and a diversified economy, the state 
                                    would likely emerge from the crisis without serious damage, 
                                    but the same cannot be said of the fate of ordinary workers 
                                    and elderly citizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Except 
                                    for the wealthy, people are already bearing the brunt – 
                                    a drop in living standards and savings and assets being 
                                    valued lower.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">To say 
                                    that the government is worried about a world recession visiting 
                                    here – or even stagflation, a rare combination of 
                                    slow growth and rising prices – is an understatement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Once 
                                    brimming with optimism, some senior economists have turned 
                                    cautious about prospects for the next two years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    a grim reminder to Singaporeans that – despite becoming 
                                    a First World economy – their island-state remains 
                                    a ship in a stormy sea.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    difference is that it is now no longer a “sampan” 
                                    tossing about in a turbulent South-East Asia as described 
                                    by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in the 1960s.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Today, 
                                    it has become a large vessel that sails international waters 
                                    – but nevertheless a ship it remains.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    vulnerable because of its size and its dependency on the 
                                    world for all its daily necessities, including oil, food, 
                                    and trade, to survive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Some 
                                    gloomy developments include the following:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">&gt; 
                                    The huge jump in the price of oil, so crucial for its existence, 
                                    to a record US$135 (RM437) a barrel with no signs of a let-up;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">&gt; 
                                    The prices of imported staple foods, such as rice (50% costlier 
                                    here) could stay high for the next three years, says a World 
                                    Bank official, hindering the battle against inflation;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">&gt; 
                                    Inflation has risen to 6.7%, a 26-year high, and may take 
                                    an economic downturn to control;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">&gt; 
                                    A slowdown in the housing market has prompted two banks 
                                    to predict a dramatic plunge in home values of up to 40% 
                                    in the next two years. This is bad news for nine-tenths 
                                    of Singaporeans who own property;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">&gt; 
                                    The government forecasts a sharp drop in economic growth 
                                    this year to 5.6% – sharply down from the booming 
                                    2007 (7.7%) and 2006 (8.8%); and if the US goes into recession, 
                                    it could fall to 3%;</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">&gt; 
                                    Respected former deputy prime minister Dr Tony Tan said 
                                    that – in the worst case scenario – the world 
                                    could be hit with its worst recession in 30 years; and,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">&gt; 
                                    The values of a portion of the tens of billions in Singapore’s 
                                    assets invested strategically in foreign banks and properties 
                                    have been wiped out, leading to fears of higher indirect 
                                    taxes here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">However, 
                                    judging from the booming shopping plazas and restaurants 
                                    and the jump in credit card usage, it appears that many 
                                    people are shrugging away the gloomy signs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    more cautious – usually older, crisis-hardened people 
                                    – are opting to prepare for trouble, skimming a little 
                                    here and there, like packing meals from home or cutting 
                                    down on outings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">But 
                                    for the bulk, it is business as usual. They continue to 
                                    shop, eat and travel abroad for holidays.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One 
                                    retired accountant said: “Many people are spending 
                                    past savings because their earnings are not enough to cope 
                                    with inflation.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">He believes 
                                    the splurge could be due to two factors: one, insufficient 
                                    awareness of the seriousness and, two, “a younger 
                                    set being too addicted to the good life to be able to rein 
                                    it in”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Prime 
                                    Minister Lee Hsien Loong thinks that some Singaporeans are 
                                    spending beyond their means.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“We 
                                    often see families who have over-committed themselves financially 
                                    – for instance, extravagantly doing up their homes 
                                    with renovation loans, or buying expensive furniture or 
                                    large-screen TV sets on hire purchase,” Lee recently 
                                    said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“The 
                                    ones with the most serious problems have bought homes which 
                                    are larger than they can afford, and taken mortgages which 
                                    they are then unable to pay off.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                                    apparent unconcern could be due to a mistaken belief that 
                                    the financial problems of America and Europe would not affect 
                                    Singapore too badly, now that it is tied to China’s 
                                    strong economy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“We’re 
                                    okay. What has America’s banking problems got to do 
                                    with us?” is a frequent comment I hear.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">After 
                                    an age of stability and prosperity and media hype that plays 
                                    up the good news and plays down, or avoids, the bad, many 
                                    Singaporeans have been lulled into a sense of invincibility 
                                    about their country and its leaders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">They 
                                    believe that if things go wrong, the government can be relied 
                                    on to put it right.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">“Well, 
                                    we are not invincible,” Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew 
                                    told his people following blunders that allowed top terrorist 
                                    suspect Mas Selamat Kastari to escape from detention this 
                                    year.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">All 
                                    this will not undermine fundamentals that include a diversified 
                                    economic base and strong reserves, an efficient infrastructure 
                                    and large overseas investments that will continue to support 
                                    the future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Almost 
                                    a year ago, before the world crisis became apparent, Lee 
                                    senior sketched a rosy picture of a golden era and a vibrant 
                                    Singapore in five years’ time, if it played its cards 
                                    right.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It is 
                                    not known if he feels the same way now, but I believe his 
                                    general optimism still remains.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Singaporeans 
                                    can only hope that this vibrancy, when it happens, will 
                                    be reflected in their individual lives – not just 
                                    in the state’s GDP.</span></p>
              <p><em>hehe, i like the last sentence! the state's gdp or coffers is somehow immune to reccession but not poor us!</em></p>
