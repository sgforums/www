              <h1>PM proposes MP wage freeze to set example</h1>
              <p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has proposed a wage freeze for federal
              MPs, recommending Parliamentary salaries not rise until at least the
              middle of next year.</p>
              <p>He says MPs will not be able to reclaim foregone salary at a later date, a move backed by the Opposition.</p>
              <p>Mr Rudd says it is a modest measure but one that is important in setting an example in the fight against inflation.</p>
              <p>"We are not calling on working families to engage in some sort of
              freeze in their wage claims or wage outcomes, working families are
              already under enough pressure," he said.</p>
              <p>"But we need to be able to face the Australian community in the eye
              and say that we, in the privileged position in this case, are doing one
              small bit when it comes to exercising wage restraint on our part."</p>
              <p>Opposition Leader Breandan Nelson has supported the pay freeze.</p>
              <p>"It just sends a signal to everyday Australians that we want to make
              a contribution, whatever that contribution is, to make sure that they
              know that we are doing our bit," he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Rudd is urging the corporate sector, in particular CEOs around the country, to follow his lead and show wage restraint.</p>
              <p>"Right across the country many people have responded to further claims for CEO salary increases," he said.</p>
              <p>"Markets ultimately determine these things but in the difficult
              circumstance we face this year on the economy and inflation I would
              hope that those in the most privileged positions in the corporate
              sector also reflect carefully on the need for CEO wage restraint in the
              year ahead."</p>

              <p>His point is simple. Kevin Rudd is freezing MP pay for the benefit of the country. May seem like an insignificant thing to do but it is one small step towards trying to control inflation. MPs serve the country therefore they have to set an example for the country.</p>
