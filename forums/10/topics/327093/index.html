              I don't think Gary Glitter will have a problem because his crime is non-political. Had he been arrested for public assembly without a permit instead of child rape, that might be a problem.
                                                  
              So... another 'foreign talent' for the PAP collection. Last year, we had a woman-beating European dude (I think he is still a PR here, and he even wrote a forum letter praising the PAP), and this year we will have a child rapist.
                                                  
              No worries Mr Glitter. So long as you remember to write in a few letters to the Straits Times praising the PAP, you too can be a 'respectable citizen' and a 'foreign talent'. By the way, there's some vicious liberal propaganda going around. You might have heard that the PAP do not welcome foreigners who stick their noses in our domestic affairs. That is simply not true. The PAP simply adores foreigners who praise their policies.
                                                  
              We would also like to remind Mr Glitter that we have rather professional lawyers here who will be willing to defend you in for a variety of offences ranging from child rape to murder. Just remember not to push your luck and cross the line to doing public assembly without a permit.

              <p>I don't think a tax evasion charge can be forgiven because u build a hospital. About sporting performances, it is desired to achieved results. I tend to agree with u tat we shouldn't import talents wholesale but it helps raise the standard of the sporting arena here. If everybody is poor at playing the game, then the standard cannot be raised unless some good players r in and force the players to raise their standard</p>

              <p>Sigh.... what is there even to talk about?</p>
              <p>This paedo fella is only <em>talking</em> about coming to Singapore.</p>
              <p>ICA hasn't <em>accepted</em> his application. Heck, he hasn't even <em>decided</em> to come to Singapore, much less <em>submitted</em> his application. For all we know he may decide to go to Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>On my part, I hope that ICA will do the right thing should he submit an application to reside in Singapore: burn the form and send the ashes back to him.</p>
              <p>But otherwise, since he hasn't even decided on settling down here.... can all of you don't be so kan cheong, please?</p>
              <p>Everything also want to politicize.... sheesh....</p>

              <p>there is a need to realise on thing about the report... it is him wanting to go to singapore to reside. It doesn't mean singapore is wooing him to come and reside. Whether he succeed or not is another question.</p>
              <p>And if u talk about mugabe coming here to shop (i think tat is pretty far fetch) or myanmar leader coming here for treatment. Why not ? They r here to spend money and if u ask me, I think tis money is easy money. I don't like these people but I certainly like their money.</p>

              <p>I know the message seems to be wrong but then again... it is money to be earned and singapore do want to be a medical and fiancial hub.</p>
              <p>Can we, a country with no real resources, really afford the high ground ? Everyone is complaining about tax and inflation and tis is a real good solution to the economy.</p>
