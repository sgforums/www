            <div class='col-md body'>The purchase of a flat is like setting yourself up for a debt trap.<br><br>These days, everyone is taking up 30 year mortgage. Effectively, you are signing away 30 years of your adult working life to servicing a loan. But the ironic part is that, once you reach 40, there is a high possiblity that you might get retrenched. So in actual fact you might have only 10 years to service your mortgage.<br><br>Even if you manage to pay off your flat. So far there is no precedent of a flat lasting more then the stated lease of 99 years. The first generation of flats are being en bloc under the SERS scheme. You are lucky if the compensation for the old flat can offset the value of the new flat. If not, you would have to take another mortgage again. Seems like there is an incidental insidious policy of keeping everyone in perpetual debt.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My wife and me have paid upfront for the 127k for our 4 room flat with every single cent in our CPF ordinary account. Guess what the nightmare isn't over yet. It get's better.<br><br>As you all know, CPF pays an interest of 2.5% to the balance in the ordinary acccount. When you use your all your savings in your ordinary account to pay upfront for your flat, you think your nightmare is over? Far from it.<br><br>DO you know that the moment, you borrow from your CPF account to pay for your flat, the interest start compounding? What interest? The 2.5% interest. Every month CPF will calculated the interest accured each month as if the amount you have loaned remained with CPF. It will update your statement monthly to show you how much you owed in interest.<br><br>You are asking "What the... ?"<br><br>Yes, you owe yourself interest payments! If you ever sell your flat you need to return what ever you have borrowed from cpf ordinary account with interest.<br><br>What if you don't sell your flat? If you decide not to sell your flat? The principal amount owed to the CPF account, with the compound interest will continue to compound!<br><br>To date, I owed my cpf ordinary account $3k in interest payments after 1 year of owning the flat. In 30 years time,I will owe myself $140k in interest!<br><br>If at that point of time(after 30 years) my 4 room flat gets EN BLOC under the SERs scheme. I need to be compensated at least $267k for the 4 room flat. $127k + $140k =$267K. If HDB decided to compensates less then $267k, I will have to fork out the difference in cash as interest payments. As under En Bloc scheme, all your funds (whatever you have borrowed from your ordinary account with interest from the day you borrowed) will need to be returned back to CPF first, before you are allowed to purchase your SERS new flats.<br><br>I did a calculation based on the 127.5k 4 room flat using the old rule of 20% down payment, and remaining lump sum service by 30 years mortgage.<br><br>You need to take out $25,500 from your cpf account to pay the 20% downpayment under the old rule. After 30 years at 2.5% compounding interest rate, the total amount you need to return cpf with accured interest is $53,487.97.<br><br>As for the remaining lump sum, $102,000 that you will pay with installments over 30 years to HDB at 2.6% interest rate. The total sum with interest that you will need to draw out from your cpf is $147,005 to pay up the mortgage.<br><br>$147,005 will be split into 360 installments of $408.35 to be withdraw from cpf every month to service the mortgage. Every month, once the $408.35 is out of your account, cpf will start calculating the interest as if the money has remained inside. Over 30 years, the principal with interest accured with be $218617.34 ($147,005 principal/ $71,117 interest)<br><br>So the final grand total amount you have to return to cpf if you flat is EN BLOC in 30 years is $272105.31. (20% deposit $53,487.97, 30 year mortgage monthly payments $218617.34)<br><br>Now compare this with the upfront payment of $127.5k compounding at 2.5%. Grand total:$267,349.<br><br>The difference is $4756.<br><br>However, if you take a 30 year mortgage, the total amount that you have withdraw from cpf is $172,505 ( $25,500 for 20% downpayment, $147,005 for monthly installments). As you need to use $45,005 of your cpf ordinary account balance as interest payments to HDB.<br><br>At the 31st year, $172,505 will compound at a faster rate then then the $127,500 as the principal is bigger.<br><br></div>

THINKING OUT OF THE BOX.<br><br>Instead of raising the retirement age (from 62 to 65 then to 67), it is worth to consider to lower the retirement age from 62 to 55 (then to 50 then to 45).<br><br>Those 55 and above who are still gainfully employed in the civil services are generally rich enough to last their remaining life with their current assets accumulated over the many good years.

Guess what the nightmare isn't over yet. It get's better.<br><br>As you all know, CPF pays an interest of 2.5% to the balance in the ordinary acccount. When you use your all your savings in your ordinary account to pay upfront for your flat, you think your nightmare is over? Far from it.<br><br>DO you know that the moment, you borrow from your CPF account to pay for your flat, the interest start compounding? What interest? The 2.5% interest. Every month CPF will calculated the interest accured each month as if the amount you have loaned remained with CPF. It will update your statement monthly to show you how much you owed in interest.<br><br>You are asking "What the... ?"<br><br>Yes, you owe yourself interest payments! If you ever sell your flat you need to return what ever you have borrowed from cpf ordinary account with interest.<br><br>What if you don't sell your flat? If you decide not to sell your flat? The principal amount owed to the CPF account, with the compound interest will continue to compound!<br><br>To date, I owed my cpf ordinary account $3k in interest payments after 1 year of owning the flat. In 30 years time,I will owe myself $140k in interest!<br><br>If at that point of time(after 30 years) my 4 room flat gets EN BLOC under the SERs scheme. I need to be compensated at least $267k for the 4 room flat. $127k + $140k =$267K. If HDB decided to compensates less then $267k, I will have to fork out the difference in cash as interest payments. As under En Bloc scheme, all your funds (whatever you have borrowed from your ordinary account with interest from the day you borrowed) will need to be returned back to CPF first, before you are allowed to purchase your SERS new flats.<br><br>I did a calculation based on the 127.5k 4 room flat using the old rule of 20% down payment, and remaining lump sum service by 30 years mortgage.<br><br>You need to take out $25,500 from your cpf account to pay the 20% downpayment under the old rule. After 30 years at 2.5% compounding interest rate, the total amount you need to return cpf with accured interest is $53,487.97.<br><br>As for the remaining lump sum, $102,000 that you will pay with installments over 30 years to HDB at 2.6% interest rate. The total sum with interest that you will need to draw out from your cpf is $147,005 to pay up the mortgage.<br><br>$147,005 will be split into 360 installments of $408.35 to be withdraw from cpf every month to service the mortgage. Every month, once the $408.35 is out of your account, cpf will start calculating the interest as if the money has remained inside. Over 30 years, the principal with interest accured with be $218617.34 ($147,005 principal/ $71,117 interest)<br><br>So the final grand total amount you have to return to cpf if you flat is EN BLOC in 30 years is $272105.31. (20% deposit $53,487.97, 30 year mortgage monthly payments $218617.34)<br><br>Now compare this with the upfront payment of $127.5k compounding at 2.5%. Grand total:$267,349.<br><br>The difference is $4756.<br><br>However, if you take a 30 year mortgage, the total amount that you have withdraw from cpf is $172,505 ( $25,500 for 20% downpayment, $147,005 for monthly installments). As you need to use $45,005 of your cpf ordinary account balance as interest payments to HDB.<br><br>At the 31st year, $172,505 will compound at a faster rate then then the $127,500 as the principal is bigger.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hihi<br><br>I bit lost here,<br><br>so what you are saying is that you use your CPF funds to pay for downpayment, then rest u took a loan from HDB.<br><br>End up, u will have to pay the loans interest of 2.6% for HDB and also the 2.5% for your CPF funds? That add up to be actually 5.1% Right?<br><br>If that is true, then i dun think i will ever be able to buy a HDB for myself, Lucky, me dad flat is fully paid for, I rather used the CPF funds to invest for retirement.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Cecil,<br><br>Nope I cleared everything from my CPF account to pay for the flat.<br><br>I did a calculation for 30 year mortgage for the benefit of those who has a mortgage.<br><br>Well, HDB charges an interest of 2.6%. Depending on the loan amount and the number of years of mortgage you take, it is used to calculate the total amount you need to pay for the full tenture of the loan. The amount is then divided into number monthly installment that you need to pay to service the principal and interest payment.<br><br>The funds that you withdraw from you CPF account every month to pay your HDB installment attracts an interest of 2.5%pa every month.<br><br></div>
