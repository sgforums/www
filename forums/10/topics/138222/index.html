            <div class='col-md body'>Another piece for the historians here:-<br><br>ttp://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20050618f1.htm<br><br>Singapore's Japanese prostitute era paved over<br><br>By TAKEHIKO KAJITA<br><br>SINGAPORE (Kyodo) Clean, safe and green, Singapore is one of the most<br>favored destinations for modern Japanese women who want to work and<br>play hard.<br><br>Some of the streets that formed the former Japanese red-light<br>district in Singapore remain in a huge commercial complex called<br>Bugis Junction.<br><br>In Japan, women often find it difficult to get into key corporate<br>positions and face pressure to quit once they get married or give<br>birth. So the city-state's female-friendly working environment is<br>quite attractive to them.<br><br>"In Japan, it's almost impossible for women aged over 30 to find a<br>full-time position. But it's easier to get one here," said Mayo<br>Omura, a 32-year-old accountant at the local unit of Hewlett-Packard<br>Co.<br><br>She and many other Japanese women interviewed for this article seemed<br>well-informed about present-day Singapore -- who to speak to for<br>business, where to go for leisure, and what to buy at which shops.<br><br>What an overwhelming majority of them don't know about Singapore,<br>however, was the countless Japanese women who worked here as<br>prostitutes between the late 19th century and early 20th century,<br>women who were referred to simply as "Karayuki-san."<br><br>"I suspect the days of Karayuki-san have become distant history,"<br>said Kazuo Sugino, secretary general of the Japanese Association in<br>Singapore.<br><br>Karayuki-san were Japanese peasant girls -- mostly from the Shimabara<br>Peninsula in Nagasaki Prefecture and Amakusa Islands in Kumamoto<br>Prefecture -- who were sold into the flesh trade in colonial<br>Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia.<br><br>Japan, the world's second-largest economy, was a poor country a<br>century ago, and women were one of its major exports, along with silk<br>and coal.<br><br>Karayuki-san, together with other Japanese women who served as<br>prostitutes elsewhere, including Siberia, Hawaii, Australia and some<br>parts of India and Africa, were said to be the third-biggest foreign<br>currency earner for Japan at the turn of the 20th century.<br><br>Former "Karayuki-san," or Japanese prostitutes, are buried under a<br>number of small tombstones at Japanese Cemetery Park in Singapore.<br><br>The existence of Karayuki-san in Singapore dates back to 1877, when<br>there were two Japanese-owned brothels on Malay Street with 14<br>Japanese prostitutes, official Japanese data show.<br><br>Malay Street and the nearby streets of Malabar, Hylam and Bugis later<br>grew into a big red-light district.<br><br>Singapore's official records suggest 633 Japanese women were<br>operating in 109 brothels in 1905. The number is believed to have<br>been well over 1,000, if unlicensed prostitutes are included.<br><br>Combined with the far larger Chinese-dominated red-light district and<br>other similar districts catering to different ethnic groups,<br>Singapore was known as one of the centers of the sex industry in Asia<br>in those days.<br><br>As Singapore started to develop around the 1870s, immigrants --<br>mostly men -- rushed in from China and India to toil at rubber<br>plantations and tin mines or as rickshaw pullers. To maintain social<br>order, British colonial rulers tolerated prostitution at designated<br>brothels, bringing in Chinese and Japanese women in droves.<br><br>As Japan's international profile rose with victories in the Sino-<br>Japanese War in 1894, the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 and its having<br>sided with the victors of World War I, Japan began to view Japanese<br>prostitutes working overseas as a national shame.<br><br>In addition, successful Japanese business operations in British-ruled<br>Malaya, now Malaysia, lessened the need for foreign currency earned<br>by Karayuki-san. So the then Japanese Consulate General in Singapore<br>banned Japanese brothels in 1920.<br><br>Consequently, many Karayuki-san were forcefully repatriated to Japan.<br>But many others managed to stay in Singapore or move to other parts<br>of Malaya, illegally selling themselves.<br><br>Four decades later, a young Japanese woman who settled here after<br>marrying a Singaporean one day encountered a former Karayuki-san by<br>chance and was shocked to learn about the tales of Japanese women<br>working abroad.<br><br>"I was saddened to realize that I had known nothing about Karayuki-<br>san," said Yuko Gan, who later became a charismatic tour guide well-<br>versed in Singapore's history.<br><br>She has since found more former Karayuki-san, listened to them and<br>told the stories of their lives to Japanese tourists.<br><br>"I believe I grew as a human, thanks to the encounter with former<br>Karayuki-san. Thinking about their plight fills me with courage," she<br>said. "Up until 15 to 20 years back, four or five former Karayuki-san<br>survived in Singapore. But not any more."<br><br>Gone with the Karayuki-san is the Japanese red-light district.<br>Ironically, the entire district is now a giant commercial complex<br>that houses a department store run by Seiyu Ltd. and a shopping<br>center operated by Parco Co., both Japanese companies.<br><br>Malay, Malabar and Hylam streets remain, but they are now merely<br>passages under the roof of a structure called Bugis Junction, a<br>popular spot with young Singaporeans that also houses movie theaters<br>and the Hotel Inter-Continental.<br><br>Traces of Karayuki-san are more evident at Japanese Cemetery Park,<br>where countless -- and largely nameless -- Karayuki-san are buried<br>along with other Japanese.<br><br>Rumiko Motoyama, a 37-year-old bridal consultant who spent her early<br>teens in Singapore, came back in the late 1990s to what she calls<br>her "second hometown." She visits the cemetery every summer during<br>Bon, the Buddhist festival for the dead, to pay tribute to the<br>deceased Japanese in Singapore, including Karayuki-san.<br><br>"I respect the Karayuki-san. They lived hard in unfamiliar places<br>where they couldn't understand local languages. They must have been<br>so strong," she said.<br><br>"As a Japanese living in Singapore, I'm grateful to the Karayuki-san,<br>because I feel their hardships form a cornerstone in my mind on which<br>I can live happily now," Motoyama said.<br><br>This year, which marks the 60th anniversary of the end of World War<br>II, is a good opportunity for Japanese to hark back to the past and<br>look to the future.<br><br>One can draw a lot of lessons by taking a glance at the history<br>between Japan and Singapore, especially Japan's 1942 invasion and<br>occupation up to 1945.<br><br>Ordinary Japanese know little about the killings of ethnic Chinese in<br>Singapore by the Imperial Japanese Army during the war years.<br><br>Sugino of the Japanese Association wants Japanese to face up to<br>history involving their own country and other parts of Asia in order<br>to strengthen friendly ties.<br><br>"It is important that those planning to live in Singapore from now<br>study the present and past of Singapore and develop a clear<br>understanding of Singapore, including Karayuki-san and the war," he<br>said.<br><br>The Japan Times: June 18, 2005</div>
