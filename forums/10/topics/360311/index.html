              <p> </p>
              <p>Most stable and primitive societies, such as the
              American Indians before 1492 or medieval Europe, have no great
              population problem because the birthrate is balanced by the death rate.
              In such societies both of these are high, the population is stable, and
              the major portion of that population is young (below eighteen years of
              age).</p>
              <p>This kind of society (frequently called Population Type A) is
              what existed in Europe in the medieval period (say about 1400) or even
              in part of the early modern period (say about 1700). As a result of the
              increased supply of food in Europe after 1725, and of men's increased
              ability to save lives because of advances in sanitation and medicine
              after 1775, the death rate began to fall, the birthrate remained high,
              the population began to increase, and the number of older persons in
              the society increased.</p>
              <p>This gave rise to what we have called the
              demographic explosion (or Population Type B). As a result of it, the
              population of Europe (beginning in western Europe) increased in the
              nineteenth century, and the major portion of that population was in the
              prime of life (ages eighteen to forty-five), the arms-bearing years for
              men and the childbearing years for women.</p>
              <p>At this point the demographic cycle of an
              expanding population goes into a third stage (Population Type C) in
              which the birthrate also begins to fall. The reasons for this fall in
              the birthrate have never been explained in a satisfactory way, but, as
              a consequence of it, there appears a new demographic condition marked
              by a falling birthrate, a low death rate, and a stabilizing and aging
              population whose major part is in the mature years from thirty to
              sixty.</p>
              <p>As the population gets older because of the decrease in births
              and the increase in expectation of life, a larger and larger part of
              the population has passed the years of hearing children or bearing
              arms. This causes the birthrate to decline even more rapidly, and
              eventually gives a population so old that the death rate begins to rise
              again because of the great increase in deaths from old age or from the
              casualties of inevitable senility.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, the society passes into
              a fourth stage of the demographic cycle (Population Type D). This stage
              is marked by a declining birthrate, a rising death rate, a decreasing
              population, and a population in which the major part is over fifty
              years of age.</p>
              <p>It must be confessed that the nature of the fourth
              stage of this demographic cycle is based on theoretical considerations
              rather than on empirical observation, because even western Europe,
              where the cycle is most advanced, has not yet reached this fourth
              stage.</p>
              <p>However, it seems quite likely that it will pass into such a
              stage by the year 2000, and already the increasing number of older
              persons has given rise to new problems and to a new science called
              geriatrics both in western Europe and in the eastern United States.</p>
              <p>As we have said, Europe has already experienced
              the first three stages of this demographic cycle as a result of the
              Agricultural Revolution after 1725 and the Sanitation-Medical
              Revolution after 1775. As these two revolutions have diffused outward
              from western Europe to more peripheral areas of the world (the
              lifesaving revolution passing the food-producing revolution in the
              process), these more remote areas have entered, one by one, upon the
              demographic cycle.</p>
              <p>This means that the demographic explosion
              (Population Type B) has moved outward from western Europe to Central
              Europe to eastern Europe and finally to Asia and Africa. By the middle
              of the twentieth century, India was fully in the grasp of the
              demographic explosion, with its population shooting upward at a rate of
              about 5 million a year, while Japan's population rose from 55 million
              in 1920 to 94 million in 1960.</p>
              <p>A fine example of the working of this
              process can be seen in Ceylon where in 1920 the birthrate was 40 per
              thousand and the death rate was 32 per thousand, but in 1950 the
              birthrate was still at 40 while the death rate had fallen to 12. Before
              we examine the impact of this development on world history in the
              twentieth century let us look at two brief tables which will clarify
              this process.</p>
              <p>The demographic cycle may be divided into four
              stages which we have designated by the first four letters of the
              alphabet. These four stages can be distinguished in respect to four
              traits: the birthrate, the death rate, the number of the population,
              and its age distribution. The nature of the four stages in these four
              respects can be seen in the following table:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Demographic Cycle</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Stage               A          B               C               D</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Birthrate          High          High               Falling               Low</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Death rate          High          Falling               Low               Rising</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Numbers           Stable          Rising               Stable               Falling</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The consequences of this demographic cycle (and
              the resulting demographic explosion) as it diffuses outward from
              western Europe to more peripheral areas of the world may be gathered
              from the following table which sets out the chronology of this movement
              in the four areas of western Europe, central Europe, eastern Europe,
              and Asia:</p>

              <p>In this table the line of greatest population
              pressure (the demographic explosion of Type B population) has been
              marked by a dotted line. This shows that there has been a sequence, at
              intervals of about fifty years, of four successive population pressures
              which might be designated with the following names:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>                         Anglo-French pressure, about 1850</p>
              <p>                         Germanic-Italian pressure, about 1900</p>
              <p>                         Slavic pressure, about 1950</p>
              <p>                        <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Asiatic pressure, about 2000</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>     This diffusion of pressure outward from the
              western European core of Western Civilization can contribute a great
              deal toward a richer understanding of the period 1850-2000. It helps to
              explain the Anglo-French rivalry about 1850, the Anglo-French alliance
              based on fear of Germany after 1900, the free-world alliance based on
              fear of Soviet Russia after 1950, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the danger to both Western
              Civilization </strong></span>and Soviet Civilization from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Asiatic pressure by 2000.</strong></span></p>

              <p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Q: Why are some countries suspicious of China's rising power?</strong></span><br><br>Vairon:
              I have two thoughts on this issue. The first is from a common
              foreigner's point of view. For common foreigners, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>they feel threatened
              because China has a large population. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span>There are Chinese people
              everywhere overseas. We see Chinese people traveling and studying
              everywhere in the world. This visual picture creates a sense of
              “threat.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We can see Chinese people in Africa, Europe, all over, so it
              seems that this has created fear. </strong></span>This is the feeling of common
              foreigners. They feel nervous when they see Chinese people everywhere.
              This is a very popular view.<br><br>The second answer is linked to the
              first one. Because there are so many Chinese people, they cannot find
              jobs at home, and therefore they go abroad for opportunities.
              Foreigners feel the Chinese people who go overseas are taking their
              employment opportunities...</span></p>

              <p>Demographics relate to population numbers, its size in determining the strength of the community to face challenges from other communities.</p>
              <p>Such thinking are primitively tribal and persist in the thinking of politicians in this modern century when considering the modern day aspects of demographics that can and will play havoc with the economy, finance, politics, and military defense.</p>
              <p>However, should demographic alone be the primary factor in determining the future of the Community ?</p>
              <p>Should it not be the quality of the Community that determine their future ?</p>
              <p>The standards set by small countries such as Switzerland and Israel, Ireland and Belgium - have shown that demographics have not been a critical criteria that affect their continued prosperity, security, and quality of life.</p>
              <p>The strength of these small countries lie in the communal values that are embraced, institutionalized and practiced at all levels of society - amongst the citizens and also the political leadership.</p>
              <p>There do not exist different sets of values and standards required from the Citizens and the Political Leadership.</p>
              <p>Honesty, Transparency and Accountability are demanded and imposed equally on all.</p>
              <p>The Political Leadership do not assume <span style="font-style: italic;">"Total License"</span> in deciding for the Citizens.</p>
              <p>All issues that affect the lives of the Citizens are put to open debate and everyone are required to participate and place their decisions in the regularly held referendums that are "honestly drafted to reflect choices".</p>
              <p>What is the use of Demographics when a larger and growing population can be held to ransom by a Political Leadership that controls, manipulate, and thwarts the exercise or practice of political transparency, political honesty, political accountability, and the honest representation of diverse views ?</p>
