            <div class='col-md body'>Based on the ST report reproduced below, it would seem that the priority of the police is to catch the guilty and not to prevent crime or murder. Have they lost their senses?<br><br>27 Oct 2005<br>Eyewitness to a tragedy<br>JALAN BUKIT MERAH MURDER<br><br>Retiree Liew Meng Choon, 65, was sitting in his usual place at the top of the staircase at the end of a short path from Block 132, Jalan Bukit Merah, when he witnessed the tragic events unfold on Tuesday evening<br><br>6pm: He sees the 26-year-old wife coming out of a taxi. She appears normal, talking into her mobile phone, but then goes to the coffee shop to use the public phone. The conversation is short, about 40 seconds, and she then goes up to her flat.<br><br>She knocks on the door of her second-storey flat and her husband lets her in. Shortly after that, an argument breaks out between the couple. Neighbours told Mr Liew later that they heard the woman crying out for help.<br><br>..............<br><br>8.45pm: The wife's boyfriend calls the police. He tells them that<br>she has sent him an SMS asking him to call 999 as her life is in<br>danger. He tells the police she is in Block 132, Jalan Bukit Merah,<br>but fails to give the unit number.<br><br>9pm: The first team of police officers arrives and goes door to<br>door. When the officers reach the second-floor unit, they see a man<br>armed with two knives sitting in the living room.<br><br>Officers see a handbag and a woman's shoe but no sign of the woman.<br>When the man notices them, he threatens them and slams the door shut.<br><br>The police then try to persuade him to put down the knives and to<br>let them in, but fail. Singapore Civil Defence Force officers are<br>then called in to climb up to the windows at the rear of the flat to<br>prevent him from escaping.<br><br>The Special Operations Command is also called in. By this time, the<br>crowd of onlookers is more than 200-strong.<br><br>10pm: Police officers cut the lock of the metal gate with special<br>cutters but do not attempt to break down the door. Instead, police<br>negotiators are called in and, in line with police strategy, the<br>man's relatives are quickly found and taken to the unit to persuade<br>the man to give up.<br><br>12.40am: After the man's sister and mother fail to persuade him to<br>open the door, his son and daughter, who have been playing around the<br>staircase landing, are asked to try to get him out.<br><br>Crying pitifully, their pleas work and the man opens the door.<br>Police rush in and find his wife strangled to death in the bedroom.</div>

But sadly, tragedy cannot be prevented.<br>If you are probing that the situation may have been different if they chose to break in than to apply time-consuming procedures, then bear in mind that at that point in time, the police officers were threatened. As such, two possible hypothesis arise,<br><br>1. Faster escalation of tragedy<br>2. Tragedy prevented<br><br>Since, I mentioned that the man is in a state of mental aggression, then it will be wiser to follow standard protocols as the probability of hypothesis 1 happening is higher should they used force.<br><br>2 Cents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Or was it Heartlanders?<br><br>Civil defense are trained to handle such incidents. In case you don't know. Average cases of this simliar incidents are 8-9 per day.<br><br>Thread Starter : Disagree with your statement.<br>The first piority is to maintain safety of human lives - then deterrance of crimes.<br>However in this case. The 999 call came a little too late, there are too many possiblilties which the officers at scene have to consider.<br>For this case.

Just like it was required by SOP to send in 40 well armed riot police to stop 4 silent protesters to turn voilent. The SOP was so well followed then when the police sized the paper plycards.

            <div class='col-md body'>To thread starter: I dont really see how did you come to the conclusion that "the priority of the police is to catch the guilty and not to prevent crime or murder".<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Cindyfeh:<br>It must be super hard to fire a shot accurately at a man sitting down with 2 knives. Maybe the the police team that arrived at the spot used super computers to calculate that the man sitting down has a parry skill of 100% and thats why the SPECIAL force was called in.</blockquote>Whether to fire a shot or not depends not on how exposed the subject is or how easy the shot will be. Rather, it depends on the consequences of taking the shot. Had the shot been justified, the police would definitely have taken it.<br><br>During the incident, the police did not have a clear n thorough understanding of the overall situation. Therefore, given the circumstances, it is quite alright for them to assume the worst. Thats probably why they called in special ops.<br><br>Btw, when SOPs are produced, many different scenarios and situations are considered. The police on the ground would not need "supercomputers" to make decisions for them since they can follow the SOP, which would most probably have recommended the best course of action.<br><br>Anw, what did you think the police should have done instead?</div>

And when they failed to persuade the man to let them into the house, they called the Civil Defence "to prevent the man from escaping" and called the Special Operations Command (purpose unknown, maybe the police officers here could enlighten me)<br><br>Don't you think that the police should be calling the negotiating team rather than the CD? Isn't it the responsibilty of the police negotiating team to avert any disaster and prevent any unnecessary loss of human lives? Or have i overstated the function of our police negotiating team?<br><br>The police negotiating team was only called an hour later.<br><br>Yes, maybe the man had already killed the wife but should we or maybe the police assume that? Maybe she was not dead yet and there could be a possibility of saving her had the police or CD or Special Operations Command got into the house earlier?<br><br>Btw, i find it rather embrassing that the police had to mobilize so many manpower and spend so many manhour and in the end not able to do anything.<br><br>acotis and m +square,<br><br>you all were participating in an internet forum and not issuing press statements and there weren't any need to protect my id by referring to me as the thread starter. anyway, i should be thankful that you all didn't refer to me as #27.<br><br>cheers<br>pearlie27</div>
