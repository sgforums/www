              <p>Wednesday, 11 February 2009	
                  
                  
              Temasek
                  Holdings, the Singapore government’s sovereign wealth fund, said
                  Tuesday the value of its investment portfolio fell by 31 percent of its
                  total, or about $39 billion, between March and November last year, a
                  reflection of the stock market rout set off by the turmoil surrounding
                  U.S. subprime mortgages. <br><br> Temasek’s portfolio was worth 127 billion Singapore dollars, or $85
                  billion, at the end of November, down 31 percent from the end of March.
                  Lim Hwee Hua, senior minister of state with the Finance Ministry,
                  confirmed the figures to Parliament on Tuesday, news agencies reported.
                  <br><br>The
                  decline was broadly in line with the performance of the world’s stock
                  markets last year -- the MSCI World Index fell 38 percent over the same
                  period in U.S. dollar terms, Bloomberg News said. <br><br>Temasek,
                  which has a wide-ranging portfolio spanning financial services,
                  telecoms, media, infrastructure and other sectors, is nursing losses
                  from high-profile investments that it made in Merrill Lynch and
                  Barclays as it aggressively expanded outside its core Asian market. <br><br>Its
                  $5.9 billion investment in Merrill Lynch alone resulted in a loss of
                  more than $2 billion, as the shares plunged before the stock was
                  delisted following the Bank of America purchase. <br><br>Temasek
                  controls some of Singapore’s high-profile companies, including
                  Singapore Airlines and Singapore Telecommunications, and has stakes in
                  global companies like Standard Chartered. <br><br>Last week, Temasek
                  announced that its chief executive, Ho Ching, would step down and would
                  be replaced by Charles Goodyear, the former chief executive of BHP
                  Billiton, on Oct. 1. <br><br>S. Dhanabalan, Temasek’s chairman, said
                  that the decision by Ms. Ho, who drove the state fund’s expansion
                  outside Singapore with acquisitions in China, Europe and the United
                  States, to step down was not linked to performance and that it was too
                  early to determine whether investments made in the last two years will
                  lose out in the long term. <br><br>Ms. Ho is married to Prime Minister 	Lee Hsien Loong. 	<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/business/worldbusiness/11temasek.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business"><em>http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/business/worldbusiness/11temasek.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business</em></a><em><br><br><br></em> <strong>Singapore wealth fund loses steam</strong><em><strong><br></strong>BBC News</em> <br><br>The
                  value of Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings contracted
                  last year as the economic downturn dented the value of its investments.<br><br>Temasek
                  said its portfolio had shrunk 31% to 127 billion Singapore dollars
                  (£57.2bn; $84.7bn) in November 2008, down from S$185bn at the end of
                  March.<br><br>The value of Temasek's investments in banks such as Merrill Lynch has declined due to the credit crunch.<br><br>Temasek bought 9% of Merrill Lynch in 2007 before its shares were delisted.<br><br>The
                  country's other sovereign wealth fund, Government of Singapore
                  Investment Corporation (GIC), has also seen the value of its stakes in
                  banking concerns reduced.<br><br>"It's easy to say the acquisitions
                  were done at the wrong price, but I believe Temasek and GIC took the
                  risks based on their due diligence," said Amanah Asset Management chief
                  executive, Scott Lim.<br><br>"The depth of the crisis is something we couldn't have anticipated."<br><br><strong>Investment<br></strong><br>Temasek had ploughed some US$5.9bn into Merrill Lynch and owned about 9% of the US company.<br><br>Merrill Lynch's shares plummeted 78% in value before it was eventually delisted and bought by Bank of America.<br><br>Temasek converted its Merrill stock and so now holds 189 million shares in Bank of America.<br><br>Despite
                  the losses in foreign holdings, the government said it would not
                  automatically increase investment in local firms, but would instead
                  consider whether to establish another fund to prop up local companies.<br><br>The
                  government also highlighted it had been quick to reduce its equity
                  shares shortly after the credit crisis took hold, thereby limiting
                  losses.<br><br>What strategy Temasek adopts in the future remains to be
                  seen as chief executive Ho Ching - who is married to Singapore Prime
                  Minister Lee Hsien Loong - last week announced she would step down
                  after seven years with the fund.<br><br>In October she will be replaced by 51-year-old Chip Goodyear, a former BHP Billiton chief executive.<br><br><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7881147.stm"><em>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7881147.stm</em></a></p>

              guru Jim Rogers believes that U.S. bank stocks could fall further and

              <p>For every risk taken, there is the potential for a return or loss. Temasek can avoid the possiblity of a 31% loss completely by investing in riskless or very low risk assets (e.g. fixed deposits receive 1% return for a $1m deposit for 2 years right now) , but that will also mean it'll never be able to achieve a high return even in years when the market is doing well.<br><br>Within the past 1 year, the Straits Times index was at a high of 3269.88 but has now fallen to a mere 1697.84, dropping 48%. Those who have invested in the STI stocks on average has been bitten too, even worse than Temasek on a relative basis.<br><br>CashBench your future,<br><a href="http://cashbench.blogspot.com">http://cashbench.blogspot.com</a></p>
