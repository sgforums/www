He was very active on<br>the political scene in the 1950s and part of the<br>1960s until his arrest in 1963.<br>At first a member of the PAP, he later left the party<br>to form the <strong>Barisan Socialis</strong><br>in 1961 with other politicians such as Dr Lee Siew Choh.<br><br>Whether for or against his political beliefs, the late<br>Lim Chin Siong, a former leader of the Barisan Sosialis,<br>made an impact on both his political rivals as well as friends.<br><br>"Occasionally, we talked about it (politics).<br>He was glad that Singapore has developed<br>very well under the PAP Government,<br>I think he appreciates what the PAP government<br>has been  doing but I think there's still a little<br>bit here and there<br>that he doesn't agree with."<br><br>(Dr Lee doesn't think Mr Lim regretted his part in<br>Singapore's past.) "He was doing what<br>he thought was best  for the people of Singapore."<br><br>-- Dr Lee Siew Choh, 79, had known Mr Lim since 1961,<br>when they were members of the Barisan Socialis<br>(The Straits Times, Feb 6, 1996)<br><br>"I had good regard for him. He was a dedicated politician, but questionable because he was left-wing. He never did anything stupid or incorrigible and never did anything for money, and in that way, he was clean."<br><br>-- Former Senior Minister S Rajaratnam, 82 (The Straits Times, Feb 7, 1996)<br><br><img src="http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/independence/images/limcs2.jpg"><br>Above -- Dr Toh Chin Chye ,former DPM at Lim Chin Siong's funeral<br>Dr Toh Chin Chye (bowing) paying respects.

(The Straits Times, Feb 9, 1996)<br><br>I liked and respected him for his simple lifestyle and his selflessness. He did not seek financial gain or political glory. He was totally committed to the advancement of his cause.<br><br>He and many of his comrades, graduates from the Chinese middle schools, taught my colleagues and me the meaning of dedication to a cause.<br><br>They were prepared to sacrifice everything for their cause, and many did. Some lost their lives in the jungles, many were banished to China.<br><br>Because of the standards of dedication they set, we, the English-educated PAP leaders, had to set high standards of personal integrity and spartan lifestyles to withstand their political attacks. They were ruthless and thorough. We became as determined as they were in pursuing our political objectives.<br><br></strong></blockquote><br><br><strong><a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fsg.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3DLim%2BChin%2BSiong%26sm%3DAll%2Bthe%2BWeb%26fr%3DFP-tab-img-t%26toggle%3D1&amp;h=179&amp;w=300&amp;imgcurl=ourstory.asia1.com.sg%2Findependence%2Fimages%2Flimcs2.jpg&amp;imgurl=ourstory.asia1.com.sg%2Findependence%2Fimages%2Flimcs2.jpg&amp;size=8.4kB&amp;name=limcs2.jpg&amp;rcurl=http%3A%2F%2Fourstory.asia1.com.sg%2Findependence%2Fref%2Flimqte.html&amp;rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fourstory.asia1.com.sg%2Findependence%2Fref%2Flimqte.html&amp;p=Lim+Chin+Siong&amp;type=jpeg&amp;no=1&amp;tt=7&amp;ei=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">source of the above</a></strong><br><br>3.Have u heard of LKY praised a man like this?<br>What is the cost and benefits for LKY to praise Mr Lim?<br>Why Mr Lim's  photo can be found in Sg history book?<br><br>If LKY and PAP want to abolish history of Mr LIm,they can<br>do so easily.<br><br>Why LKY pened a so remarkable obituary note<br>on Mr Lim Chin Siong when many old generations<br>almost forget Mr Lim and remind next generation<br>there was a Mr Lim who shaped the history?<br><br>4.<strong>Lim Chin Siong and the Communist Party played a very important part in Singapore's political history and if they had won, Singapore would be very different today."<br>-- </strong>Former Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye, 75, said during the funeral of Mr Lim Chin Siong in February 1996 (The Straits Times, Feb 7, 1996)<br><br>How Mr Lim would treat LKY if he won?<br><br>5.Mr Lim and wife went to London after release<br>.Their two sons were born there.<br>Mr Lim returned to Sg let his sons study here.I remember both<br>of them are doctors.<br><br></div>
