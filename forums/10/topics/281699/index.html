            <div class='col-md body'>The below article discusses USA's efforts in recent years under the Bush regime to encircle Russia and China on the eurasian continent and the resulting countermoves made by Russia and China to break out of the american encirclement.<br><br><strong>The Sino-Russian Alliance: Challenging America's Ambitions in Eurasia</strong><br>by Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">    Â“But if the middle space [Russia and the former Soviet Union] rebuffs the West [the European Union and America], becomes an assertive single entity, and either gains control over the South [Middle East] or forms an alliance with the major Eastern actor [China], then AmericaÂ’s primacy in Eurasia shrinks dramatically. The same would be the case if the two major Eastern players were somehow to unite. Finally, any ejection of America by its Western partners [the Franco-German entente] from its perch on the western periphery [Europe] would automatically spell the end of AmericaÂ’s participation in the game on the Eurasian chessboard, even though that would probably also mean the eventual subordination of the western extremity to a revived player occupying the middle space [e.g. Russia].Â”</span><br><br>- Zbigniew Brzezinski (The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives, 1997)<br><br>Sir Isaac NewtonÂ’s Third Law of Motion states that Â“for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.Â” These precepts of physics can also be used in the social sciences, specifically with reference to social relations and geopolitics.<br><br>America and Britain, the Anglo-American alliance, have engaged in an ambitious project to control global energy resources. Their actions have resulted in a series of complicated reactions, which have established a Eurasian-based coalition which is preparing to challenge the Anglo-American axis.<br><br><strong>Encircling Russia and China: Anglo-American Global Ambitions Backfire</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force Â– military force Â– in international relations, force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts. As a result we do not have sufficient strength to find a comprehensive solution to any one of these conflicts. Finding a political settlement also becomes impossible. We are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law. And independent legal norms are, as a matter of fact, coming increasingly closer to one stateÂ’s legal system. One state and, of course, first and foremost the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way.Â”</span><br><br>- Vladimir Putin at the Munich Conference on Security Policy in Germany (February 11, 2007)<br><br>What American leaders and officials called the Â“New World OrderÂ” is what the Chinese and Russians consider a Â“Unipolar World.Â” This is the vision or hallucination, depending on perspective, that has bridged the Sino-Russian divide between Beijing and Moscow.<br><br>China and Russia are well aware of the fact that they are targets of the Anglo-American alliance. Their mutual fears of encirclement have brought them together. It is no accident that in the same year that NATO bombarded Yugoslavia, President Jiang Zemin of China and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia made an anticipated joint declaration at a historic summit in December of 1999 that revealed that China and the Russian Federation would join hands to resist the Â“New World Order.Â” The seeds for this Sino-Russian declaration were in fact laid in 1996 when both sides declared that they opposed the global imposition of single-state hegemony.<br><br>Both Jiang Zemin and Boris Yeltsin stated that all nation-states should be treated equally, enjoy security, respect each otherÂ’s sovereignty, and most importantly not interfere in the internal affairs of other nation-states. These statements were directed at the U.S. government and its partners...<br><br><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=6688" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=6688</a><br><br></div>
