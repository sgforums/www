            <div class='col-md body'>Old news, but i thought its something to comment about.<br><br>If a contest arises, it could be a heavyweight fight: Analysts<br><br>Lee Ching Wern<br>chingwern@newstoday.com.sg<br><br>Going by the current activity in the constituency, a battle royale could be on the cards in Aljunied GRC in the elections which many believe are just around the corner.<br><br>Party bigwigs are not talking but political watchers say that if a contest does come about, a heavyweight battle is likely to be in the offing Â— with a PAP top-liner in the form of Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo on one side and Workers Party (WP) chairman Sylvia Lim on the other.<br><br>Mr Yeo heads the current GRC slate with MPs Mdm Cynthia Phua, chairman of Aljunied Town Council, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed and Dr Ong Seh Hong.<br><br>Both corners are keeping their cards well hidden but last month Mr Yeo, who many political analysts believe is destined for bigger things in government, unveiled a five-year master plan and budget worth $160 million to upgrade the GRC.<br><br>The GRC encircles the WP stronghold of Hougang, which is like the hole in the middle of a doughnut. The influence of WP stalwart Low Thia Khiang, who holds fort in Hougang, could spread to the GRC if this geographical juxtaposition of constituencies, which have similarities in demographics, count for anything.<br><br>what the<br>Political watchers, who believe that Aljunied GRC is likely to remain part of the WP's political strategy, point to the fact that WP's Ms Lim and 2nd Assistant Secretary-General James Gomez have been spotted working the ground in Aljunied GRC during weekends.<br><br>Just two weeks ago, the WP also held a public outreach session at Hougang Ave 1.<br><br>The PAP have not been laggards in this aspect. Soon after the unveiling of the master plan by Mr Yeo, residents received flyers informing them of improvements that will be made to their living environment, which includes lift upgrading, security systems, adventure parks and other recreational facilities.<br><br>Roving exhibitions to obtain feedback from residents on the facelift are being held at all the housing estates. Mr Yeo has also been seen more often around the estate, residents told Today.<br><br>That the GRC has kept up with the needs of residents with the PAP at the helm can be gauged from the number of public amenities Â— 14 schools, 17 PAP education centres, six Community Clubs, 27 Child Care Centres, two sports halls/swimming complexes, 11 parks and three MRT stations.<br><br>In addition, the GRC can boast of being home to 11 churches, 13 temples and five mosques. And for shoppers, five malls.<br><br>"The buzz seems to be that the Workers Party will field a strong foursome in the upcoming GE against a strong incumbent team which has been doing due diligence since winning the ward in 2001. There are signs that both sides have not rested on their political laurels, and are seeking to make an impression before the GE," said Ms Jeannie Conceicao, research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies.<br><br>How will the $160 million carrot affect the elections, Today asked residents of Aljunied GRC?<br><br>Residents welcomed the newly announced measures and IT professional Mr CK Tan said that for supporters of the PAP, they showed the commitment of the party to the constituency.<br><br>But some differ.<br><br><strong>Then there are the diehards. "I will vote for the party I wish to support, regardless of whether the lift stops at every floor," said Mr Wilson Aw, a 23-year-old undergraduate.</strong><br><br>Mr Yeo, when asked if the upgrading measures were timed to garner support from voters for the GE, said: "If you ask me whether this has anything to do with serving residents, winning their support, yes, the whole idea is to serve residents, win their support and serve them better."<br><br>But will the goodwill felt for Mr Low in Hougang spill over to Aljunied GRC?<br><br>"Sentiments still play a part in how people respond to candidates and political parties. This is evident in Hougang. But whether there will be any similar effect in Aljunied is hard to say because it also depends on which particular candidates the WP fields there and not purely on Mr Low's influence," said political scientist Dr Ho Khai Leong.<br><br>While they have definitely seen the WP working the ground, many residents that Today spoke to cannot remember the names of the party members they've met.<br><br>"Unless you're someone who follows politics very closely, chances are you won't know much about them, especially the new candidates. When we have to choose between voting for a known entity or an unknown entity, the choice is quite obvious. So to convince people to switch camps, the opposition has to be very clear as to what they can offer," said resident Mr Ow.<br><br>And what does the opposition have to offer?<br><br>The WP's Ms Lim told Today: "We have to work within the resources available to us to do our outreach. Even if some voters may not know us intimately, votes for the WP could serve a variety of purposes: To effect change and to indicate support for the WP or its candidates per se, or to express dissatisfaction with the incumbent party by sending them a clear signal."<br><br>With Singaporeans largely viewing upgrading as a given and a part of the social compact between the Government and the people, the new amenities may not win over some residents.<br><br>"To be honest, all these are cosmetic add-ons. Adventure parks and CCTVs are good to have, but I don't really need them," said Mr Ow, who added he would keep an open mind and listen to what the opposition has to offer before deciding on whom to vote into office.<br><br>In the last GE in 2001, a WP team tried to contest in Aljunied GRC but was disqualified because of incomplete nomination papers.<br><br>Their supporters would be sorely disappointed if that error was repeated.<br><br>Although I applaud the efforts made by WP, I have to say that the contest described above is, in all likelihood, over-hyped.<br><br>First of all, George Yeo is not an unpopular minister. He is in charge of the Foreign Ministry and I have to say Mr Yeo has done his job ably. Singapore is well regarded in the international scene and that is remarkable for the fact that Singapore is only a small island state.<br><br>Secondly, the $160 million upgrading carrot will certainly have an effect has most would like their estate to be spruced up in the hope that it will help to boost the price of their properties.<br><br>However the table might be turned on PAP if the residents are made to hefty co-payment for the project. It is an issue that the WP can capitalise on.<br><br>WP could have made their task easier by targeting some of the weaker and more unpopular ministers for the next GE. In my opinion Hong Kah GRC would have been a good target for the WP because of the many unpopular policies that the anchor minister, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, has implemented and that LTA is probably by far the most unpopular ministry in Singapore for the many debacles it had committed.<br><br>The task of challenging Mr Yeo on the upcoming GE would probably fall on SDP given that they had contested in Hong Kah GRC during the 2001 elections. But I really cannot see SDP winning the GRC just for the fact the SDPÂ’s reputation is no longer what it used to be after Dr Chee took over.<br><br>WTF got 160 million to spend money on upgrading exercise and 400k to spend on renaming exercise that ends up with the same name (hi marina bay!) but no money to pay NS slaves and tell MO no money to hire more MOs? kns<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wherever we go, we will sure to bump into one or two ministers, regardless of whether he/she/they are "heavy weights" or not.<br><br>I think we must be realistic. Political apathy is everywhere in Singapore. The most important necessary (though not sufficient) criteria for winning the battle is to have a sizeable number of people with certain political awareness of the brand name Workers' Party. IF voters don't even have the slightest idea of  your party logo or name, do you think there is any chance for them to vote for you?<br><br>Political awareness is created by approximity to our base in Hougang. People living near Hougang constituency would know who is Mr. Low Thia Khiang, even if they do not really know the party that he belongs. It would make our job easier to create higher level of awareness of our party name by association to our Hougang MP Mr. Low. This is opeartionally very practical thing. If you ask anyone in Holland Bukit Panjang about WP, chances are more than half of them only heard about the name but do not know exactly what it is or who is its MP at the moment.<br><br>PAP has chosen the strategy of "besiege" of Hougang, fearing that we may break through the barricade. This is why a heavy weight like George Yeo who happens to be Teo Cheow Catholic is chosen for such important task. The best chance is to break through this siege of PAP. Another way is to create another base on the Northern enclave (Nee Soon East) so that the same awareness of approximity could be created. This would give us another option, using it as another "springboard" to launch aggressive campaigning on the Northern front.<br><br>Hougang itself is a springboard or what we call a "breach head" in military strategic terms. A breach head is first launching pad for further attacks on the battle front.  IF we do not use it efficiently and effectively, then we would be wasting our resources to go around Singapore on a wild goose chase. The battle in Aljunied GRC is inevitable strategically. PAP has played its cards well in strategical terms but we could still gain something out from it eventually. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Pat33,<br><br>I understand the sentiment of wanting to VOTE (or participating inthe process) in the elections. I am a Chengsan Voter and my right to vote was destroyed when they broke up Chengsan GRC after the close fight they have with WP back in 1997. I was pretty angry in 2001 to learn that I was robbed of my voting right by such "technicality". This is one of the reasons why I chose to PARTICIPATE in the political process in another way..join Workers' Party during the 2001 GE.<br><br>(read my blog singaporealternatives.blogspot.com)<br><br>The only way to keep our voting rights intact is to PROTECT it in every ways we can. Joining Workers' Party would maintain and provide the CHOICE that we have, no matter how limited it is. Another way of protecting our voting rights is to participate in the General Elections in OTHER WAYS. We may not have the opportunity to exercise our rights to vote, but we surely could exercise our rights to PARTICIPATE in the political process; I don't expect everyone to become candidates in election process, but there are other ways to participate in the political process, examples:<br><br>Help out any political parties that really need help during elections<br><br>1) Be a polling agent for party like Workers' Party which trying hard to maintain a credible choice to voters. In one GRC we need about 200 to 300 polling agents<br><br>2) Help out in setting up rally sites for political parties like Workers' Party<br><br>3) Help out in campaigning for alternative parties.<br><br>4) Help out in distributing political messages and candidates' profile during election time.<br><br>5) Become an independent rally reporters on the ground during election time.
