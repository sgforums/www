He did the same when he was Seoul's mayor, forgoing his salary for 4 years. (If he works for free, then he must be incompetent, right? This must be so if the logic of the PAP prevails.

              <p>Big difference. None of the current batch of overpaid monkeys have struck out on their own in the private sector and have succeeded based on free market prinicples, including LKY etc. The only way they can make money in the private sector is to be "consultants" aka lobbyists to foreign companies, selling their inside knowledge of GLCs and ties and connections within the government.</p>
