              <p><br> What <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">66.6%</span></strong> of votes did
              the PAP get in Election 2006 ?</p>
              <p>That is a <strong>big lie</strong> that the PAP make
              to give themselves some legitimacy.</p>
              <p>The total number of electorates in the <strong>Registered Voters
              Roll numbered <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2,147,840</span></strong> Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The Total number of votes that the PAP received in the Election
              2006 was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">748,130</span></strong> votes.</p>
              <p>This represent only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">34.83%</span></span> from the List
              of Registered Voters</strong>.</p>
              <p>What kind of legitmacy is this when one consider that the
              <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/themes/people/hist/popn.html">‘Total Population of <strong>4,401,400
              Singaporeans</strong> – from 0 to 65 years and over (July 2006
              est)’ (*1) </a>- the PAP can only get <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">748,130</span></strong> votes ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Comparing the Singapore Election held in this Little Red Dot,
              the Indonesian had conducted their Presidential Election 2009
              across thousands of islands.</p>
              <p>Still the near impossible tasks saw that
              the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_legislative_election,_2009">‘Indonesians had a Registered List of Voters that
              numbered <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">171,265,442</span></strong> citizens;
              and the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Total
              Votes countered was 104,099,785</span></strong> votes’
              (*2) </a>- which gives the Election Results a greater

              <p>I think theres some error there.</p>
              <p>You need to look at more sets of numbers rather than total registered voters and total voted for PAP.</p>
              <p>They are the total number voted (ie, ppl who actually turned up), votes for PAP, and then the list of registered votes just to get a feel of the voter turn out. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Total votes out was 1,123,000.  Out of which 748,130 voted for the PAP.  Total registered was as you said, (didn't verify), 2,147,840.  </p>
              <p>So to get the voting percentage u divide 748,130  /  1,123,000    * 100.   That gives about roughly 66%</p>

              <p>I think theres some error there.</p>
              <p>You need to look at more sets of numbers rather than total registered voters and total voted for PAP.</p>
              <p>They are the total number voted (ie, ppl who actually turned up), votes for PAP, and then the list of registered votes just to get a feel of the voter turn out. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Total votes out was 1,123,000.  Out of which 748,130 voted for the PAP.  Total registered was as you said, (didn't verify), 2,147,840.  </p>
              <p>So to get the voting percentage u divide 748,130  /  1,123,000    * 100.   That gives about roughly 66%</p>

              <p>I guess you did not get the drift of my post which highlighted the irony of the Singapore situation that with such a small population of 4.5 million, the electoral roll of registered citizen voters had numbered only half of the population.</p>
              <p>Further more, looking at the roll of registered voters of 2,147,840 citizens only - (as PR do not vote) - the PAP could only get 748,130 votes.</p>
              <p>The numbers were checked and counted several times from wiki's info on Singapore Election 2006, and data published from the Election Office.</p>
              <p>Considering that Indonesia and Japan have larger population that spread across several islands and larger land mass - the number of citizens actually involved in the electoral process was far higher then the pathetic numbers in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Despite the vast land and population size, the number of votes that went to the elected representative in the Indonesian and Japanese Election - would have given them far more legitimacy than the pathetic results of 748,130 votes that would actually amount to 34.83% of the Register Number of Voters.</p>
              <p>Some will say that this is due to the Alternative Political Parties not putting up candidates to allow for PAP walk-over in so many constituencies, and is no fault of the PAP.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, this is the disingenious part of LKY's scheme to create advantage to the PAP - and is part of his characteristic "kiasi-kiasu" gerrymandering strategies to win the Elections at any cost.</p>
              <p>Singapore with a tiny land mass and a population size that is smaller then New York State, and even Jakarta, or even Switzerland - will have far more constituencies and candidates to be elected to Parliament.</p>
              <p>This is LKY's ploy to handicap the Alternative Political Parties - and is only one aspect of his intricate grand scheme that is deliberately designed o make the election process a series of formidable hurdles, to trip any ambitious Singaporean who have the desire to be a Member of Parliament - and to be the alternative voice for the people.</p>
