              <p>Welcome to the 'real world' of Third World Politics practised by LKY and the PAP in Singapore and towards Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>"Revenge" ?</p>
              <p>Did you not see the "revenge" on the politicians who dare to challenge LKY and his plans - there were the actions taken against those who dared to challenge his idea to merge Singapore into Malaysia ?</p>
              <p>Those who dared were all caught in LKY's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://socialistworld.net/eng/2006/06/26singapore.html">‘Operation Coldstore’ (*1) </a>- which he planned with Malaysian Tunku Abdul Rahman and the British Colonial Government, so as to ensure themselves a successful outcome to a rushed merger with Malaysia process.</p>
              <p>In the other thread - <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/381979">‘Dr Lim Hock Siew speaks for the 1 time post-detention’ (*2) </a>- the cruelty and criminal abuse towards Singaporean Political Detainees is tantamount to Crimes against Humanity conducted by the Singapore Government - when it breach its own Prison Laws in its criminal treatment towards fellow Singaporeans detained under the ISA.</p>
              <p>The list of Singaporeans suffered under the vengeful act of LKY and the PAP will also include - Lim Chin Siong, Chia Thye Poh, and their collleagues rounded during Op Coldstore, Dr Lee Siew Choh, Tan Wah Piow, J.B. Jeyeratnam, Tang Liang Hong, Francis Seow, Vincent Tan, Teo Soh Lung, Fong Soh Har, and those accused of being communists in the Singapore Catholic Church and branded as Marxist Conspirators; Ryan Goh whose PR status was revoked for daring to stand up against LKY and speak on behalf of the Singapore Airline Pilots - and of course Dr Chee Soon Juan.</p>
              <p>The "acts of vengeance" are not directed at individuals who dare to take political or socio-political actions against LKY and his PAP - but towards entire constituency that cast their vote for the Alternative Political Parties.</p>
              <p>These recriminative acts of vengeance take the form of total pettiness such as bus routes are cancelled to inconvenience the constituents, HDB upgrading works are suspended, the entire constituencies are deliberately "starved".</p>
              <p>To the credit of the residents in Potong Pasir and Hougang Constituencies, they snubbed the petty politics from the PAP, and continue to return the incumbents Low and Chiam to be the Member of Parliament to be the voice of the constituents.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I think the opposition MPs can attest that the votes are kept secret.  From what I recall, the opposition MPs are required to escort the ballots to disposal after they have been counted.  </p>
              <p>The only "tracking" that I understand is possible is up to Block Level.  Which means, if your hdb block has a large numbers of opposition votes, good chance you will get your elevators last.  As for civil servants getting the sack cos they voted opposition, I highly doubt so since the disposal process is witnessed as well.  More likely, he was a loud mouth who has said too many things without tact.</p>

              <p>That is not the point in my statement. The fact is that there are a large numbers of people who did not vote for the PAP and it is quite impossible for PAP to punish every single one of them. My point to  the TS being that, vote for who you think is best for Singapore, don't vote for PAP just because you think you will suffer some sort of revenge. </p>
