There are many feedback channels.<br>BTW, NKF isn't govt's fault at all. Its a private organisation. No laws were broken. Why do you insist on grabbing everything to vilify the govt. I don't think that is constructive at all. I think there is a certain negativity anfd htred on your part.<br><br><blockquote><br>Right now you want to build an inclusive society but can you really get only a few elites or leaders to do it.

Singapore is not inclusive and decisisons are made carefully after much consultataion. You may not agree with certain decisions but that does not mean they are wrong. Neither is the govt obliged to adopt all feedback. In fact the govt do adopt feedback in their decisions.<br>There is also no falling faith for the govt. You are too negative and anti. Too much rhetoric and propaganda on your part.<br><br></div>
