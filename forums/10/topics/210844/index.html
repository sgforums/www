People know about it and can handle it. People work around the systems and sometimes corruption is minor greed and can be overcome..<br>With Singapore, it is different. Everything is hush hush and everyone knows, is fearful and no one dare say a word. it is covert and there is no way around the system. It is in fact worse and no one knows how to work the system or get things done because everywhere you walk, you walk into walls - there are no opportunities in Singapore and all are controlled by the govt. There are always corruption everywhere because it is a fact of life but in Singapore, it i so covered up, and people are so fearful - no one really knows how far it runs here.  For all the "safe country" touted by Singapore, it can become a double edge sword. Beside, other countries will catch up and others have benefits beyond "safety". With the influx of "foreign special service talents", "safety" in Singapore is a illusion.<br>It is a fact that no police system will be sufficient and there are more weak places that remains unguarded. The fact is that if any of our neighbouring countries want to attack us, they only need to fire a missle from their country or from the sea and we would be effectively dead. All that is just once again, a mind game. It is only whether the other countries want to take down Singapore.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><br>The interview with David Marshall by Dharmendra Yadav in 1994 was very timely, as David Marshall passed on from this life in 1995.<br><br>Reading his commentaries from this interview will reveal the breadth of this gentleman, one who would have made Singapore quite differently had he pursued successfully in politics.<br><br>Unfortunately, Singapore was fated not to have a generous man to be a national leader, but moved on to be what Singapore is today through the understanding on the use of brutish and forceful grip to Political Power by the <span style="font-style: italic;">'Power of ONE'</span>.</span><br><br><span style="color: olive;"><blockquote> Selected extracts from <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://thinkhappiness.blogspot.com/2006/08/meeting-david-marshall-in-1994.html" rel="nofollow">'Meeting David Marshall in 1994'</a> :<strong><br><br>"In my time, I tried to educate our people in an understanding of the dignity of human life and their right as fellow human beings, and youth was not only interested but excited about what I consider things that matter. Things of the spirit; the development of a human being to his true potential in accordance with his own personal genius in the context of equal rights of others. "<br><br>..........................................................................................................................<br><br>"I am frankly terrified by this massive control of the mass media, the press, the radio, television, antennae, [and] public meetings. You canÂ’t write a letter to the Straits Times; if there is a shadow of criticism, itÂ’s not published. And the Chinese press follows suit. ItÂ’s a very dangerous position because experience proves that no one group of human beings has got all the wisdom in the world.<br><br>I meanÂ… well, two of you are Chinese and one Indian [Ed: actually, the interviewers were one Chinese, one Jew and one Indian]. I donÂ’t know much about Indian history but look at China. You had Confucian authoritarianism for more than 2500 years. What happened to China? She was a fossil. She had to reinvigorate herself with the Western ideology of communism. Another authoritarian ideology! And what was the result?<br><br>There must have been a million decent people who were transformed into vipers, vicious obscene vipers. IÂ’m afraid of this control of the mass media. "<br><br>..........................................................................................................................<br><br>"But you say to yourselves, Â“Well, you know, what do we seek in life? We seek a rice bowl, full!Â”<br><br>It is full and overflowing, in fact. They serve you your rice in a jade bowl with golden chopsticks; not that it makes much difference to the taste of the rice. But youÂ’re empty!<br><br>YouÂ’ve got technocratic skills and you are seeking more but internally you are empty. Money is your acid test of success.<br><br>IÂ’ve got nothing against money. IÂ’d like to have money myself! IÂ’d like to have a house and a garden and dogs and a car and a chauffeur but, look, IÂ’ve got a flat. IÂ’ve got a swimming pool attached to the flat. IÂ’ve not even got a car but I use taxis. I have a dignified way of life without being wealthy.<br><br>I donÂ’t see the necessity of owning a Mercedes-Benz and a swimming pool and a couple of mistresses. I think weÂ’ve got our values all wrong. "<br><br>..........................................................................................................................<br><br>"We have lost sight of the joy and excitement of public service, helping our fellow men. The joy and excitement of seeking and understanding of the joy of the miracle of the living the duty and the grandeur. We have lost taste for heroic action in the service of our people.<br><br>We have become good bourgeois seeking comfort, security. ItÂ’s like seeking a crystal coffin and being fed by intravenous injections through pipes in the crystal coffin; crystal coffins stuck with certificates of your pragmatic abilities.<br><br>What has changed?<br><br>The self-confidence of our people has grown immensely, and that is good to see. Our pragmatic abilities have grown magnificently, and that is good to see. Very good to see!<br><br>You are very able. YouÂ’re ambitious, and the government has heroic plans for the future. It hasnÂ’t finished.<br><br>I take off my hat to the pragmatic ability of our government but there is no soul in our conduct. It is a difficult thing to speak of because it is difficult to put in a computer, and the youth of Singapore is accustomed to computer fault. There is no longer the intellectual ferment, the passionate argument for a better civilisation. The emphasis on the rice bowl! "<br><br>.........................................................................................................................<br><br>The government doesnÂ’t see I do respect them immensely. They donÂ’t see IÂ’m a genuine friend. They only see me as a critic and to be a critic is to be an enemy who must be erased and destroyed. There is no such thing as an honest critic to the PAP. ItÂ’s a blasphemy to criticise the emperor, spoilt son of heaven.<br><br>[Lee] Kuan Yew says you mustnÂ’t lampoon a Chinese gentleman. Oh, dear me! Ya, what happened? What happened to China?<br><br>In Europe, they institutionalised the court jester and the court jester had total immunity against any result from his public criticism of the kings and emperors and the courtyard. Open public criticism Â– that was his job! They tried to laugh it off but at least there was one person to prick the bubble of their overgrown egoism.<br><br>And which civilisation has progressed better for the development of humanity? The Western civilisation or the Chinese civilisation?<br><br>You talk of Asian values. I only know two Asian values and, I wish someone would really pinpoint them instead of pontificating ponderously in humbug and hypocrisy.<br><br>Family values - I think we have more family cohesion in Asia than in Europe; more family warmth and I like that. I accept that there is a greater tradition of family warmth and family cohesion.<br><br>Two, we have a greater passion for education. My secretary Â– I asked her once what her background is. She said her mother is a washer-woman and, here is this lovely secretary doing a damn good job. She was educated. How her mother could save enough to give her the education?<br><br>So these are the only two values I know. Somebody tell me what other values that are Asian, which everybody talks and nobody mentions the exact parameters.<br><br>And you know we use this concept of family cohesion to place on our youths the burden of caring for aging and ailing parents and grand-parents.<br><br>The young have got their own lives to make. To carry in your own homes aging irritable ailing parents and grandparents can destroy the family life of the young.<br><br>But then, the alternative is for the government to pour so much mountains of gold into building homes for the aged. ThatÂ’s sacrilege Â– gold is to be gathered and not to be spent.<br><br>I want to see more crÃ¨ches, more homes for the aged.<br><br>Our Prime Minister [Goh Chok Tong] talks about gracious living. Where is the gracious living?<br><br>So I am a bad boy, IÂ’m ostracised. The Straits Times makes slimy remarks about me.<br><br>The [press are] running dogs of the PAP.<br></strong></span></blockquote></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">For complete interview, click on - </span><a href="http://thinkhappiness.blogspot.com/2006/08/meeting-david-marshall-in-1994.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-style: italic;">'Meeting David Marshall in 1994'</span></a></div>

People know about it and can handle it. People work around the systems and sometimes corruption is minor greed and can be overcome..<br>With Singapore, it is different. Everything is hush hush and everyone knows, is fearful and no one dare say a word. it is covert and there is no way around the system. It is in fact worse and no one knows how to work the system or get things done because everywhere you walk, you walk into walls - there are no opportunities in Singapore and all are controlled by the govt. There are always corruption everywhere because it is a fact of life but in Singapore, it i so covered up, and people are so fearful - no one really knows how far it runs here.  For all the "safe country" touted by Singapore, it can become a double edge sword. Beside, other countries will catch up and others have benefits beyond "safety". With the influx of "foreign special service talents", "safety" in Singapore is a illusion.<br>It is a fact that no police system will be sufficient and there are more weak places that remains unguarded. The fact is that if any of our neighbouring countries want to attack us, they only need to fire a missle from their country or from the sea and we would be effectively dead. All that is just once again, a mind game. It is only whether the other countries want to take down Singapore.<br><br></div></blockquote>Remember Karma!!!<br><br>All these Gods,u must take care of yr daughters n sons!!!karma will take care of u n the next G</div>
