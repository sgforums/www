About anything cept' for dirty stuff<br><br>++++++<br><br>Luke (if that is your name) firstly you cannot go around tell ppl that you are joining THE AIR FORCE. The aptitude is just a routine to filter out the cream.<br><br>1. Physically you are fit to be a pilot (not like commandos but able to withstand the G-force)<br>2. Mentally (no explanation with all the papers they are looking for)<br>3. Politically - MOST IMPORTANT TO GET YOU IN  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>a) Try to be a PSC scholar - it will help you get in &amp; also advance you career if you donÂ’t want to become a bus-driver in SIA after reaching 35. Lucky 40 if you are a Major &amp; 50 for LTC.<br>b) Your family record must be clean, not anti-PAP, no jail or corruptions by your ancestor or any police record.<br>c) After the test they will monitor you to see if you are a loud mouth going around letting our secrets &amp; so on..(This is no joke) Cos a pilot hold top secret information More than normal army LTC or even general level of secrecy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't exactly tell you what sort of questions they ask. But a tip would be to know the background of RSAF. The countries that train specific aircraft type.<br><br>What aircrafts RSAF uses. Know abit of technical specs. would be useful like ILS system, HUD, max speed, range, what is an AIM 120 missle ?. etc. Not necessary, but impress the interview board.<br><br>Find out when the RSAF was developed, what planes they used initially, how many pilots ? how many airbase are there in Singapore and overseas ? so on.<br><br>Usually a hand-out has been prepared prior the interview for the rookies to view.<br><br>You can be sure its normal everyday questions. Some wierd ones like What do you think about your parents ?<br><br>Be honest. psychologist can tell if you lie.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you really wanted to be a pilot in RSAF, some of these stuff you would have already known.  And if you don't and still don't, well it shows a lack of resourcefulness.  No offense bud, but u need to work harder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey thanks Flight Cadet Officer Irwin!<br>That's gonna help a lot! As for shotgun its ok no offence taken but yeah I know most of the stuff like ILS HUD and other impt stuff as I read up on it and play simulators <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  but to tell u the truth...I wasn't expecting to tell the history of RSAF. I did read up on it in the library but now I think I have to remember some facts that I have gone through with a fine tooth comb. Yeah guess that part caught me by surprise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
