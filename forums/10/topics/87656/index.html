            <div class='col-md body'>War games where one side thinks that it has sufficient power to cower the other into some form of compromise or submission is a simplistic military strategy.<br><br>It does not lead to supremacy or diplomatic success. It may lead to war ultimately. No body is the winner finally. China (mainland) thinks that it can go to war at all cost to take back Taiwan. Policy-wise it may be the right move for China. However, to flex the muscle and start military operations to threaten Taiwan may be a counter-productive strategy.<br><br>This is clearly seen in how USA reacts to the situation. USA was said to be supportive of one-china policy. Because of open threats, now it supports Taiwan on the quiet.<br><br>The former Soviet Union became a super-power sometime around the 1980s backed by a communist ideology supported by many countries. Many countries were threatened by their unknown military might. Soviet Union could have still controlled the world today had it treaded its unknown military might - its triumph card - carefully through pursuit of quiet behind the scene diplomacy. Howeer, it was not willing to wait and work it out this way. It soon asserted itself by flexing its muscle too readily. It went into not just threats but open field conflicts in Afgstan and neighbouring countries. Americans then knowing its true power then came in to to test Soviet Union's vulnerabilities.<br><br>For a Small (Red Dot) country, the best foreign policy (yet to be established) is to establish real fire power (our strength) and never shows it but instead conduct quiet diplomacy based on harmonious relations around our neighbourhood with a bit of technical assistance to all to help them do better. We could establish a common market sooner. This mode of quiet diplomacy definitely will go a longer way to winning friends. Don't let enemy know we have the main policy of being close to super-power or China. This latter need is psychological but will happen naturally through involvement in regionalization and progress. Build neighbourly relations through exchange programs of all kinds to make our intention to be friendly truly tested.<br><br>A quiet diplomacy founded on real military prowess acquired in an unassuming and low-profile way is the real power. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
