            <div class='col-md body'>A strong nation is built on strong morality. Virtues are the elements of moral men, good leaders and nationhood.<br><br>I fully support such a morality survey suggested by some forumers for our politicians and ruling party and potential leaders.<br><br>Will anyone care to come up with an online survey for voting. Those who are measured highly will become our next-generation leaders. To balance with practicality, moral leaders are entitled to decent pays even if they declined such as without decent pays they may not concentrate their full energy on serving the people. Decency is measured against the median pays of the people. A good decent pay can be mapped out and determined by the people such as 20x$800.00 pm for ministers or 40x$800 pm for PM. The rest can be in proportion to such guidelines depending on roles and responsibility.<br><br>Let us remove money worshiping as the key element to attract talents. Let us decide that not all good politicians are attracted to monies as the final factor for giving their service. Good politicians are those who have the basic intelligence and abilities to inspire and motivate citizens to work together as one with unity and strive to attain common goals.<br><br>Let the ministers be elected who are men of such profile as stated in the foregoing and remove monies from our formula of talent hunting. Open the door fully to find men and women of such profile to serve our people and reject all those who are confusing us with their own political self-interests and self-glorifications and craze for power.<br><br></div>

Indirectly, all will say that we need to avoid falling into such evils as a society or there is a need to find a way to such a problem.<br><br>However, everybody it seems also agree that "THERE IS NO SOLUTION AND NO ONE CAN STOP SUCH EVILS". Why? Because that everyone includes you and me and you and me do not want to love money.<br><br>Therefore on such a topic everyone will stop at finding a solution or start searching for one.<br><br>If someone can come up with a solution or the first step to solution then let it spread and create better values for society at least if we still cannot find moral political leaders to serve us with full commitments.<br><br>We can all do better.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share with all a Morality Quiz designed to test whether a person has morality to deserve to work in positions as leaders or custodians looking after vital interests and wellbeings of others. (It may not be the most apt quiz but here it is for a starter)<br><br>The Morality Quiz<br><br>The deepest foundation on which morality is built is the phenomenon of empathy, the understanding that what hurts me would feel the same way to you.<br><br>And human ego notwithstanding, it's a quality other species share. While it's impossible to directly measure empathy in animals, in humans it's another matter.<br><br>Here are some of the dilemmas used to study human morality.<br><br>Take this quiz to see how you compare to other TIME.com readers. Then read how scientists are using these dilemmas to study morality.<br><br>Scenerio 1: The Crying Baby<br>Illustration for TIME by John Ritter<br><br>It's war time, and you're hiding in a basement with a group of other people.<br><br>Enemy soldiers are approaching outside and will be drawn to any sound. If you're found, you'll all be killed immediately.<br><br>A baby hiding with you starts to cry loudly and cannot be stopped. Smothering it to death is the only way to silence it, saving the lives of everyone in the room.<br><br>Assume that the parents of the baby are unknown and not present and there will be no penalty for killing the child. Could you be the one who smothered it if no one else would?<br><br>I could not smother the child.<br><br>I could smother the child.<br></div>

As opposed to democracy we have many other systems from dictatorship to authoritarianism, to communism, and our own pseudo-democracy variously justified as leadership or meritocracy which so far have only come across as unwieldy ad hoc and circumstantial which do not have the sustainability of applications to assure of serving the people's greatest benefits of the greatest number. Often hypocrisy or justifications of all kinds will have to be put up with the results of greater suppressions and oppressions of ordinary people who were finally made to suffer and who finally had to rebel.<br><br>Keep in mind there is a need to understand that we need a framework or governing philosophy and democracy offers such a framework from which it gives assurances that those in charge of power will govern fellow human beings in a certain direction towards which all could share and benefit together.<br><br>This is where democracy comes in to serve its purpose - a framework or governing philosophy but not a final or exact solution which can be applied without thoughts or further refinements.<br><br>Australians' current election of the Labour leaders have demonstrated once again the benefit of democracy as the most stable and sustainable governing process-based philosophy to satisfy the particular needs and aspirations of the people to their advantage. As a framework or philosophy it will continue to do well to guide people into resolving diverse conflicts and work towards better final solutions all of us desire.</div>
