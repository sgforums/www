The moment when the property market was swinging up slightly...then came the increase of development charge so......quickly.<br>The way that sg govt manages singapore.......they charge loads on land costs, rentals,utilities,communications, direct or indirect taxes, Authorities charges and etc....heck.. these are the contribution of high operating cost of businesses in sg.<br>On the other hand...they closed one eye on companies that were cheating on labourer quotas  such as....ratios of employment; these companies are supposed to employ X numbers singaporeans versus employing Y numbers of foreigners...but many companies made up blank employment of housewifes, old men or old women so as to meet the quotas with monthly CPF contributions of about S$60.00; and that were for submission to MOM for approvals of application of foreigners workers.<br><br>Those less important industry...like cleaning works or maintenance works....it seemed that these bosses have had hard time in applying for foreign workers' permit.<br><br>Now...the current situation may seemed inevitable due to highly competitive market...<br>But as not to affect or rather continuing to increase collection of govt or tax revenue.....somehow, sg govt chosen to sarcrifice or at the expense of poor and lower income peasants. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
