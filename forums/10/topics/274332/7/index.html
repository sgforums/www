Whatever that is from me, please ignore.  I don't agree that I am 90% ranting here, you are exaggerating.    When you provoke and talk to Gazelle sometimes, you are ranting!  There are others who rant, so do you want to tell them?  I am not the only one who rant and I definitely am not ranting that much.   It is so common to read ranting of people in any forum.  If ranting is a problem to you, then I can't help it.   It is with prejudice that you consider me emotionally unstable.   Tell me how well do you know me to jump into this conclusion.  There are so many in forums who use exclaimation marks often so do you consider them unstable?<br>If you are a fair person, you will notice I contribute facts to this forum,too!
