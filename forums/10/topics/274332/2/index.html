What matters is motive!  This guy as far as we are concerned he is here to oppose and stop people from expressing their views about the govt.  In addition, he hurls insults, do name calling and use vulgarity on people.  When people retaliate and do the same to him he makes hell of a noise.  When we ask him questions, he can't answer and all he does is evade.  He is ever so fast to be unkind to people.  Do you want to consider to stick by him, think he needs you to be on his side?<br><br>Do you., tell me do you stop anyone of us here to express our views about the way the govt is working?  hloc, all of us are in one way or other affected by the work of the govt, so it is understandable why people come here to contribute, voice their views and comments positively.  But this guy is not contributing positively, he is more interested to antagonize people, hurl insults, use vulgarity.  He is what he is doing so to stop people from expressing views, comments about the govt.   I agree with the way people responded to him because he asked for it.</div>
