From what I see, he comes to forum not with a genuine interest to discuss topics but rather attack people and so on.   I can see that I am not the only one who is treated badly.</div>

You fail to see the fault in you and you imagine people are like you.  You are the true attention seeker.  I am here to contribute by not using vulgarity like you or using words as weapon against credible trustworthy people in SC.  YOu are so not credible and full of crap.  Like what Maurizio said people here know you.  Yes, we are know what sort of crap are you up to.  What you are doing now is to divert people's attention on how crappy you are to focus on me!  Please, anyone who is sensible and intelligent know the sort of person you are.  When I said intelligent and sensible people,  I am not referring to those who evade when they can't answer our questions, those who whine when people merely voice out comments and views on the way govt work or those who are against people talking about freedom of speech.</div>
