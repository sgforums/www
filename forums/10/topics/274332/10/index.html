I really don't agree I am ranting most of the time. I do but not most of the time.  It is natural for people to rant, you can't stop this.  I believe in your own way you rant, too.   I do really political stuff but not too much.  Now I hope the people of Singapore will show how unhappy they are with the government by allowing the percentage of winning votes for PAP to decline to the lowest.  This is just hope, it is still very much up to the people.</div>
