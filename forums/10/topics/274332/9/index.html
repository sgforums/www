For what I see you have been bearing grudge against me.  That is fine, you can go on say all sort of stuff about me.   Heaven knows what happen. Remember what happened?  I posted here with the intention to tell people to check on the money they will receive for the GST package, you kept asking me to send a letter to STs instead, I refuse but I back up with my reason why.  Thereafter, you were not  happy but I know somehow you have been bearing grudge against me and this is really undercurrent.   Please be more magnanimous as a man.</div>
