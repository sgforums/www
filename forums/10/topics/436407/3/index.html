              <p>I think maybe it is oversimplification because the North-South
              civil war and their industrial disparity maybe has many different
              complicated factors dont you think ?</p>
              <p>Anyways, it is difficult to just discuss about conceptual topics
              without concrete examples.</p>
              <p>Maybe, you can think up of a few concrete examples in the real
              world, like I tried to do, and then mention them ?</p>
              <p>Then it will be easier to discuss..........</p>

              <p>I only brought up history because you were saying cheap labour was an asset to exploit.</p>
              <p>Here's a real example of some countries who remain poor. We do have some very educated Indonesians, Malaysians and Filipinos working here, right? In fact, some Filipino maids here are quite highly educated.</p>
              <p>Labour there is plentiful and cheap. The rich business owners would rather make money in primitive industries, paying very little for labour, exporting cheap goods. How many high tech companies have you heard of from these Southeast Asian countries? There are no opportunities for better educated workers to earn the money they are worth.</p>
              <p>As a result, even very talented individuals are unable to find work. They either migrate towards better opportunities, or toil as a manual worker.</p>
              <p>These countries have a few extremely rich people and huge numbers of poor. If the situation continues, the wealth gap will only widen.</p>

              <p>Just as it is wise for these Malaysians, Indonesians and Philipinos to leave their country (unless they are the very rich), it is wise for me to leave mine.</p>

              <p>Not a direct example........dont look at Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillipines.....just look at Singapore only.</p>
              <p>Because what I was pointing out is the act of acquiring or using cheap foreign labour , aka  21st century colonization and enslavement and the betterment of the living standards of the locals.</p>
              <p>Btw that may be a little bit rude and insensitive. I am just pointing it out as an illustration only, I dont mean to say Singapore is enslaving and colonizing others.</p>
              <p>Ok,</p>
              <p>Using that example,</p>
              <p>I have pointed out how it benefits the locals in terms of the direct and indirect effects of maids, construction workers, janitors, cleaners, etc.</p>
              <p>For historical comparison, lets look at UK.</p>
              <p>Why did UK became so rich, so powerful ?</p>
              <p>Why was it UK, and not some countries say.....Bulgaria ?</p>
              <p>Because they have extra resources and labour from the slaves and colonies, isnt it ?</p>
              <p>And another reason why it is not good to directly compare to Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillipines.....uhm....because Singapore only uses cheap foreign labour as a temporary or transient worker only. These cheap foreign worker labour at the low-skilled spectrum do not become permanent residents or citizens. So they won't create rich-poor social gap problems and so on (not saying there is 100% no social problem, because trust me there is still some social effects such as the Sentosa bikini ogling case by foreign workers etc)</p>
              <p>These cheap foreign workers are rotated. As far as I know.</p>

              <p>This example not to your liking again? First you talk about slavery, when you have an example for slavery then you ask for something real and present. Now still not satisfied.</p>

              <p>If you think about it, when Singaporean goes to countries in Asean, to China...don't we find things cheaper there? then who are the people buying in Singapore? If you ask then you might be surprised to know that many things are indeed cheaper here back home for many tourists, who are from these asean countries, besides the many varieties. even when it comes to food, I can find some food cheaper here than in KL!</p>
              <p>when you go to ion, which floor do you go to?</p>
              <p>In Singapore, I know where to go when shopping, and I can certainly get things cheaper than those in the tourist area, won't complain about being expensive.</p>
              <p>So really, how much do you need to live?</p>

If this is not enough don't pay any taxes as well. Ass kissing works only for so long. Same with the Chinese.</p>
