              <tr>
              <td colspan="2"><span class="postbody"> We the people would have thought a leader of such intelligence like MM
              Lee should well know that people can forgive leaders for mistakes if
              mistakes are honest ones as to err is human to forgive divine.
              <br> <br>But what has MM Lee to deserve such understanding from its people?
              He has been arrogant all his life towards other people. He is always
              comparing his leadership with other countries' leaders and are
              condescending all the time to his own people.
              <br> <br>When such a leader makes a mistake and wants his people to believe
              him will he get his people to understand his problems e.g. complacency
              of his government.
              <br> <br>He has yet to show his care and concern for citizens or morality in
              governing the country e.g. rising costs of living or citizens' many
              problems with their living and working.
              <br> <br>Such caring for his citizens for their problems will he be able to
              get his citizens to understand it is human to make mistakes on the part
              of his million dollar ministers or other superscale prison chief in
              shabby administration on the part of ISD or prison.
              <br> <br>It is all a matter of people's reactions to his own arrogance,
              talk-down and condescending attitude that his leadership is world's
              best and infallible.
              <br> <br>You reap what you sow. This general unhappiness with arrogance of
              government has already happened in reactions over NKF, Shin Corp and
              UBS.
              <br> <br>It is not that people cannot understand mistakes can happen. It is
              so simple the governing philosophy that Mas Selamat's escape may be
              unexpected as mistakes can happen.
              <br> <br>There is a stronger underlying reason - the basically lack of
              humility and the current high-handedness and arrogance of the
              government are the main reason why people are unhappy whenever
              something like this happen.
              <br> <br>It is time the PM looks into his way of governing the country which
              is too arrogant. If he wanted to quote MM Lee as saying we are not
              infallible, he must make sure his government change its present
              arrogance and high-handedness in running this country.</span></td>

              <p>Some do and some do not because their constituencies are not contested. Some do and are still not happy because results to not go their way. Well, it requires a concerted effort and for the opposition to come into power. You need the majority in your constituency be pissed with the ruling party. The worst case scenario will be that one is pissed with the ruling party but is even more pissed with the opposition party that contest in a particular constituency.</p>

              <p>I think we need angry people who vote for the opposition on the streets first. This will "wake" the angry people who vote for the PAP and let them know that they can change their destiny (for better or for worse). Opposition parties will need to fight more seats as well. If Jeff Ooi can contest, so can Mr Brown or Yap Keng Ho. Doubt the latter will go very far if he continues to call Singapore Sinkapore. You'll need stupid politicians who play the racial cards as well flaunt their riches. Else having someone like Mrs GCT might help as well.</p>
