            <div class='col-md body'>I apologise. It was NYP not NP. The sources are extracted from the copy of Weekend Today on the July 26-27. Ok i managed to skim the more salient and relevant parts of the article for your perusal due to the fact that i cannot find any online sources.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DEBATING STORM</span><br><br>When NYP returned home early from an international debating tournament, the institution had no idea it would leave university debaters across the globe up in arms.<br><br>The strong reaction was sparked by the perception that the polytechnic was trying to censor- and censure- one of its students, who gave a speech that was critical of the Singapore Government.<br>Now, from Canada and Britain to Asia and Australia, various debating communities have expressed concern about the World Universities Debating Championships, which will be held here in December, the first time Singapore is hosting the event.<br><br>Scotsman Andy Hume, a previous world champion, said the issue is whether or not the debater would be able to stand up in a debate to castigate the Singaporean model of democracy. Recent moves by the Government to open up drew scant notice as murmurs of government regulation rumbled throughout several debating fora.<br><br>The episode began on July 6 with the NYP student's speech in hte public speaking competition at the Australasian Intervarsity Debating Championships in Malaysia. After getting the topic "What the Matrix means to me", he decided to speak about democracy in Singapore, and suggested it was found wanting. Another debator, Mr Ravi Viswanathan of NTU, described the speech as "funny, entertaining and tongue-in-cheek." He added: " I don't think it was very pointed."<br><br>The NYP student, a foreigner who has been here for 17 years, made it to the finals of the competition. But according to the student, the NYP authorities told him the next day that he would be withdrawn from the competition. The following day, NYP's debaters, who did not make it to the knockout stages of the tournament, were told that they were returning home- one day before the championship finals.<br><br>However, NYP's director of academic services, Mr Anthony Woon, stressed that the student's political speech was not the reason for the polytechnic's early departure.<br><br>"As far as we are concerned, the debates were over for us and the school term had started. We didn't want students to miss lessons," he told TODAY.<br><br>But what about the fact that the student had qualified for the finals of the public speaking event, which was part of a larger competition? The team's decision to return home apparently came as a surprise to the organising committee from Multimedia University, the tournament hosts, and the Australasian Intervarsity Debating Association (AIDa).<br><br>On behalf of the two bodies, the AIDa secretary drafted a letter to NYP expressing their "disappointment" at the polytechnic's decision and their concerns regarding the impact such a decision would have on debating in Singapore.<br><br></div>

I just find it disheartening to see that the true essence of debate has to be stifled and caged within certain regulatory frames. From the article, i do not think the debater meant to go overboard. No bashing to be anticipated, i just want more justice and more freedom in speech accrued to the spirit of debate.</div>
