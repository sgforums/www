Its a bit like, they simply cannot see how to attract people to stay and bring out their loyalty thru reasonable means. Obviously labelling people who leave quitters are an act of frustration because they cannot 'strong-arm' people into staying, not after the sort of things they do. Its a sign of a weakness and helplessness on their part and it only makes them look worse.</div>
