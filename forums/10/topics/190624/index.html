We are not interested in pock barrel politics.<br><br>However, even before our manifesto hit the public, the PAP asked us to change our manifesto.

Midway through our election campaign, PAP wanted us to withdraw James Gomez from the Aljunied team.<br><br>This is typical of the PAP. They are arrogant with a Â“We know whatÂ’s bestÂ” attitude. Let me tell them this Â– WP is not subject to the PAP; Nor are we afraid. We have our own mind!<br><br>..............................................<br><br>We fully agree that honesty and integrity are important traits for MPs. So right from the onset of the campaign, I have instructed all our candidates NOT to make any personal attacks or baseless allegations against the PAP.<br><br>I believe we must have a more civilized political culture and political engagement must be based on facts and debate and NOT name-calling. An open debate on policies and issues will give us a better understanding of the policies and intent of the government. And with this, people can participate more actively in decision-making of policies that affect them.<br><br><strong>Disappointingly however, the PAP candidates behaved otherwise. Even new candidates got inducted into the PAPÂ’s culture of making offensive remarks about opposition very quickly. Some of them even equate us as horse and donkey. One new PAP candidate for Ang Mo Kio GRC, Lee Bee Hwa, who spoke in Mandarin over Channel 8,  6.30pm news on 30 April, said that Â“WorkersÂ’ Party  candidates may have integrity problems. Â”<br><br>This is uncalled for. I did not demand an apology as sheÂ’s new and people make mistakes. A minister also called WP the Wayang Party. They are not only defaming our candidates but our party as well. Do you know what would happen if an opposition MP said this?</strong><br><br>I have told the press during the introduction of our candidates that they were selected based on 3Cs and 2Ps Â– credibility, capablility, character, passion and public spiritedness.<br><br>We are coming to the end of the election campaign period and I have observed how our candidates have carried themselves this election. It has reinforced my confidence in them. The PAP is also unable to dig out any skeletons about our WP candidates. Why? Because there are none!<br><br>The PAP has questioned the intention of James Gomez with regards to the minority certificate. I have asked all potential minority candidates to apply for one in case of a strategic switch in constituency. The Malay candidate for Ang Mo Kio, Abdul Salim, has also  applied for one although we already have Gopal Khrisnan there as our minority candidate. This is the reason why James went to apply for the certificate.<br><br><strong>As this episode has caused much distress to the Election Department unwittingly, we have asked James to apologise and this he did.

None of them have raised any issues on race or religion to incite the people.
