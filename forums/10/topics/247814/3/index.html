            <div class='col-md body'>Media Release: No need to donate increment, just repudiate pay hike<br>11 Apr 06<br><br>Obviously unable to stomach the backlash from Singaporeans and the eyebrows raised by others around the world, PM Lee Hsien Loong has announced that he will donate his pay increment of S$600,000 a year.<br><br>Singaporeans should not be so easily placated Â– or fooled. If Mr Lee has no need of the extra money, why did he allow the pay-raise in the first place? If, on the other hand, he believes that the move is good for Singapore, then he should have stood his ground and defended his actions.<br><br>Obviously, it is impossible to justify the unjustifiable. The pay hike was a colossal misstep on the part of the Government, especially when there is overwhelming evidence that the economic situation of Singaporeans has been deteriorating in recent years. The PM is obviously now trying to undo, or at least limit, the damage.<br><br>However, Mr Lee's move to increase his salary and then announce that he will donate it away seems such an unnecessary show. Wouldn't it have made more sense to not increase salaries in the first instance?<br><br>And what are we to conclude if the other ministers don't follow suit and donate their increments as well?<br><br>Singaporeans must not forget that even without the latest increase, Mr Lee and the entire cabinet are already way overpaid. The Singapore Democrats repeat our call for the PM and his ministers to revise their salaries downwards to less obscene levels.<br><br>At the same time, and in line with international democratic practice, ministers should declare their assets and the assets of their family members.<br><br>If fact, given the dismal economic situation that poor Singaporeans are being put through, Parliament should unequivocally repudiate any talk of salary increase and all MPs should forgo their increments and ensure that the funds are used to alleviate the suffering of the working poor.<br><br>It must never be forgotten that parliaments are institutions of service, not avarice.<br><br>Chee Soon Juan<br>Secretary-General<br>Singapore Democratic Party<br><br>==================================<br><br>Singapore PM to donate pay hike after salary furore<br>Reuters<br>11 Apr 07<br><br>Singapore's prime minister said on Wednesday he would donate his S$600,000 ($395,800) pay rise for each of the next five years as he defended a 60 percent increase in ministers' million-dollar salaries.<br><br>Lee Hsien Loong, who is set to earn S$3.1 million ($2.1 million) this year following this week's pay rise - or five times U.S. President George Bush's salary - told parliament he did not expect other ministers to donate their pay increases.<br><br>The government's decision to jack up salaries for ministers and top civil servants - already among the highest-paid in the world - has brought criticism from ordinary Singaporeans, many of whom consider the move tactless given the widening rich-poor gap in the city-state.<br><br>"For five years, whatever the increase in salary above the present level, I will donate," said Lee, who earned S$2.5 million ($1.65 million) previously, in parliament on Wednesday.<br><br>Lee said this would give him the moral standing to defend the move to raise ministers' salaries.<br><br>The salaries of Singapore ministers were raised by about 60 percent to an average of S$1.9 million ($1.26 million) on Monday, just short of the S$2.2 million that the government had initially proposed.<br><br>The government said the move was necessary to attract and retain top talent.

If the PAP had not resorted to criminal intimidation and persecution of opposition voices, there will be more talents willing to come forward to serve the nation. It's all PAP's undoing. Using money now as carrot shows how corrupted PAP has become. Might as well call it the L&amp;L family empire.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi moderators, could you please combine several topics all related to the ministers' pay increase so everyone can get a clearer view of how everyone here thinks.<br><br>Honestly, with such dissatisfaction among the singaporeans, how can the govt leaders still go ahead with the pay increases? and what are singaporeans doing, or rather what can we do to express our dissatisfaction with the govt's decision?<br><br>i'm in the middle of my freaking take-home examination but i just couldn't reisist reading up all the news and opinions about this issue, to see if perhaps my thoughts are incoherent and illogical, but apparently thru newspapers, blogs, forums, and even my friends on msn, all have similar views on the pay increases.<br><br>1. Ministers do put in their effort n deserve good pay. But how exactly does earning more money motivate them to perform better? Many forum writers already expressed their point, money shouldn't be the incentive to get people to join the government.<br><br>2. Economic students would be familiar with this theory, once you spend a certain amount on necessities, the rest you spend on are luxuries. A minister already earns about $100,000 a month. Even if they could earn more in the private sector, that doesn't deny the fact that the amount is already ridiculously huge. What are they doing with their pay? Investing into government holdings?<br><br>3. They say we shouldn't have a say in how much pay rise they get. People then ask for an independent committee to look into it, compare their pay to international standards. Of cos they refuse to do so, becos their pay is comparatively way above other civil servants according to international standards. The arguement is Singapore is ranked 5th in terms of corruption in the world. Well, what is it that the other 4 countries are doing right that doesn't require obscene amounts of money for the ministers?<br><br>4. Pegging the pay of ministers to top earners in the top industries is just plain ridiculous. If the ministers would really earn 5 -10 times more in the private sector, then shouldn't they do that in the first place and bring in more money for GDP growth? If they're gifted to work in the private sector then why drag them into government with the lure of money? One more important point: TOP EARNERS IN TOP INDUSTRIES MAY CONSIST OF DIFFERENT PERSONS EVERY YEAR BUT OUR MINISTERS ARE STILL THERE FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS, MOST MUCH LONGER. People in the private sector take risks to earn that much amount of money, and occasionally risks results in failure, thats why they have to draw so much money. Think about this point further, n you'll see why it doesn't make sense to peg minister's pay to top earners in top industries.<br><br>5.If the "bottom line" is just simply money, then all political science students should throw in the towel and start doing other modules. Since nobody believes that some people would want to work for the government for the good and betterment of society, and all citizens are materialistic and selfish buggers, then the rest of Singapore should seriously reflect on themselves - is this what Singaporeans are made up of? No honour, no desire to help, no altruisic desire?<br><br>I felt like writing into the newspapers, but then again whats the point, we all know who SPH is run by.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of pay increase of civil servants, most only get a on time bonus, as seen by the army regualrs (assuming that they are civil servants too) while those at the top get pay increases. So how in any way does it help to attract talent? By encouraging people to rise to the top? Nono. people don't need an increase in the salary that the top pple get to strive to rise up the corporate ladder, or rather, the government's equivalent.<br><br>Stop kidding yourselves and acknowledge the fact that the increase isn't necessary. Help the poor and the middle classes. only with everyone's support will you actually reach greater heights. A vice around everyone's throat isn't going to help. Except increase the size of your wallet (which i guess. no. i affirm. is the main motive)</div>

I wonder is there anyway we can sound our displeasures to the Gov???<br><br>Haiz, i can only predict the future to be tougher and tougher for us.... 5-6 yrs ago, a freshly University graduate can expect a salary in the region of 2.5-2.8k monthly, nowdays, even a 1.6k we also "bo bian" have to accept...<br>so...Dear PM Lee, how would you expect us to accept and approve your increament? As the smallest country in the world map, you are earning 5x of George Bush, and 8x of Abe... How can we be convinced? The message i recieved is...."unless you are the best, else u can leave. Singapore is only for the Top Talents....no matter where you are from".<br><br>I just feel that, at times, we must really be realistic. What we have achieved so far, already have been very much envy and respected by many.... what else we want? Be the best in everything and be a Public No.1 enermy??

But, we live only 1 life... Can we bring the $$ when we die? PM Lee...personally, I just want a peaceful life where i need not stress over my 3 meals, and as long i dun have any debts.... but yet again....its so tough! Here we are sweating and tiring ourselves just for the 2-3k per month.... the same 24 hours per day, you wanna earn 100k per month? Is that justified?<br><br>In my own opinion, if one is only for the money and carrot, go to the private sectors, YOU ARE NOT SUIT TO RULE OUR COUNTRY...<br><br>So now, I'm hoping for the next election to come soon....
