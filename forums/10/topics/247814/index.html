            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says he will hold his own salary at the present level for five years and will donate any increases in his salary during that period.<br><br>He made the announcement in Parliament on Wednesday, as the House continues its debate on salary revisions for government ministers and civil servants.<br><br>Mr Lee said making a large adjustment in public sector salaries now is politically a most difficult decision.<br><br>But it is something that must be done.<br><br>While it is very difficult to get people to understand and emotionally accept it, he said the issue is absolutely critical.<br><br>"If we do not tackle it now, the problem will not go away; it will just get worse - we will be in serious trouble," he said.<br><br>After discussing it at length in Cabinet, and with Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in particular strongly encouraging him to do it, PM Lee decided to move now because of the overriding importance of keeping public sector salaries competitive.<br><br>The Prime Minister said that to make clear why he is doing this, and to give him the moral standing to defend this policy to Singaporeans, he will hold his own salary at its present level for five years.<br><br>The Government will pay him his full pay, because that is how the system must work.<br><br>But for five years, he will donate the increase in his salary from this and subsequent revisions.<br><br>Mr Lee said he does not expect other Ministers to follow.<br><br>While it is a Cabinet decision, he told Parliament, he is carrying the ultimate responsibility, not them.<br><br>So what the individual Ministers and MPs do is up to them.<br><br>Mr Lee said that he knows they already support various worthy causes.<br><br>It should not be a public ostentatious display of how generous they are, but a private matter for them to decide at their own discretion, he said. - CNA/ir<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That PM Lee is willing to donate all of his additional earnings to charity is admirable. Few ministers and MPs are likely to follow suit, especially since he has made it clear that what the others do with their money is completely up to them.<br><br>However, the fact that certain MPs such as the outspoken Irene Ng, have opened questioned 'What is so immoral' about the pay hike, clearly illustrates that a portion of the MIW are so convinced that they 'deserve' this pay hike.<br><br>Again i stress: what tangible results have they to show for that makes them deserving of this pay rise?<br><br>The fact that some even dare question those who challenge their increase indicates an obnoxious and self-serving mercenary who has wormed his way into power and fills his mind with delusions of grandeur, believing that it is their RIGHT to adjust their own salaries at will, without the need to consult the very people who PAY their exhorbitant wages.<br><br><blockquote>Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) was worried that the pay increases for ministers and top civil servants had undermined support for Workfare and GST offset packages. "I don't think we have been sensitive to the feelings of many people. Many people have asked me: Did we increase GST to pay for this increase in salaries? While that is clearly not the case, it is most unfortunate that a support package so carefully crafted in good faith to help our lower income families should be seen as such light," he said.</blockquote>Michael Palmer raised a good point: Why on earth would people see this pay rise as anything else but being funded by the corresponding rise in GST and other price hikes? Why indeed? How else would one see this potential quicksand? Why wouldnÂ’t the obvious inference be made? WasnÂ’t the budget plan and other packaged offsets little more than a smokescreen to hide the real issue Â– a big fat raise for already fattened ministers?<br></div>

His Â‘sacrificeÂ’ was smaller then because his pay was increased to $60K Â‘onlyÂ’ a month. He did not donate to charity.

But, if we apply the principle that we in the labour market have been fighting for on behalf of our workers - pay our workers according to their abilities and performance - why should we adopt an opposing standard when it comes to those who make it possible for us to enjoy a better standard of living year by year?"<br><br>The example set by the Prime Minister was also brought up.<br><br>In 1992, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, as then-Deputy Prime Minister, had held a media conference just after undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoma.<br><br>"I don't think he allowed the media to interview him for his own sake or because he liked the publicity. For sure it was not. It was for public interest. It was to assure the public that life and business in Singapore was going on as usual. I think if you talk to any cancer patient going through chemotherapy, I think their instinct is, 'Please let me recover quietly, let me focus on my health'. But he (Lee Hsien Loong) was thinking of Singapore even in his time of need," said Ms Ng. - CNA/ir<br><br>EXTRAORDINARY !!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
