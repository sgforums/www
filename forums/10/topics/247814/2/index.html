Much the same way, we fear that increasing financial assistance for the poor will erode the work ethics of the working population. How many lives and livelihoods are at stake if our policy-makers become too comfortable and disconnected from the realities of ordinary Singaporeans," asked the Hong Kah GRC MP.<br><br>The first-time MP who entered politics when he contested the 2006 General Election calls himself a post-65 idealist.<br><br>He said he would like to see leaders coming forward with a heart to serve honestly and compassionately, "put aside their personal interests for the interests for Singapore, and not just chase their GDP and performance bonuses."</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was on a plane when I overhead two Chinese nationals talking to each other:<br><br>Chinese A - "Guess what the Singapore prime minister is paid every year?"<br>Chinese B - "What?"<br>Chinese A - "CNY 16 million per year."<br>Chinese B - "What!"<br>Chinese B - "How much did Deng Xiao Ping last made?"<br><br>Talk about value for money. That was when I decided that I had enough.  I had to write something to get it off my chest, so here it goes Â…<br><br>I just cannot comprehend why Singapore needs to pay its top civil servants so much money? I understand the need to benchmark against the private sector but I disagree with the idea of benchmarking against the top earners.  Why?  Because most people would agree that top executive salaries are often inflated and unjustified.  In addition, private sector compensation is often seen as an entire package (housing benefits, transportation benefits, security benefits).  Is this taken into consideration (i.e., perhaps the ministerÂ’s pay should be seen as an entire package as well) or are we comparing apples and oranges?<br><br>But the million dollar question is Â“will top salary guarantee top talent?Â”  I doubt so.  Just look at the US Â– CEOs are often paid a lot of money that they donÂ’t deserve.  On the other hand, look at Warren Buffet Â– this guy doesnÂ’t pay his CEOs a dime more than what they deserve and yet the executives running his businesses are among the best in Corporate America.  There are a lot more intangibles to job satisfaction that just pay.  It seems that the current system of benchmarking civil servantÂ’s salaries is shallow at best.<br><br>PM Lee said that he doesnÂ’t want salary to be the reason why people donÂ’t want to join the civil service or leave the civil service.  Does this mean that increasing the salaries of civil servants will solve all these issues?  First of all, if someone doesnÂ’t want to join the civil service because the pay is too low, chances are that he or she shouldnÂ’t.  He or she should spend a decade or so in the private sector and accumulate sufficient wealth to be financially independent before joining the civil service.  In this way, we can derive some comfort that he or she really wants to serve the country; a few years of private sector experience is probably a good addition to the government anyway.<br><br>It was reported in the New Paper that the overall resignation rate for graduate officers was 10.6% 2006, up from 7.4% in 2005.  What the figures donÂ’t tell you is how many of these people resign because they saw a glass ceiling? I have came across many young civil servants that became disillusioned with the Â“Administrative ServiceÂ” (i.e., you are either in it or you suck) system.  It seems that unless you are in the Â“Administrative ServiceÂ”, you are somewhat disadvantaged regardless of your performance - all things being equal, a scholar in Â“Administrative ServiceÂ” is seem to be promoted faster.  You donÂ’t get that in the private sector.  For example, if you join a Wall Street firm right out of college, everyone will be placed in the same class pool Â– regardless of whether you get a 4.0 GPA from Harvard or 3.2 GPA from Tufts Â– everyone competes on qualities that matter to the job at hand.  Again, intangibles.<br><br>More important that the current pay raise fiasco is the big picture of things in Singapore, which really makes me uncomfortable.  Are Singaporeans truly happy with the current manner things are developing?  It seems that the current policy of Singapore is one of pro-immigrants, and one of continuous overall growth. Are true blue Singaporeans reaping the benefits of such growth?  Why canÂ’t the government be focused on upping the wealth of its existing citizens (what I call bottom-line growth) rather than trying to growth the overall wealth (what I call top-line growth) by importing new people?  Is it because if they donÂ’t grow the overall wealth, they cannot justify a 33% salary increase?<br><br>I believe LKY said that our real estate would be worth a fraction of what it is worth today if not for a competent government.  That I agree.  However, going forward, it seems that if we go down the current trajectory that the government has put in place, that piece of real estate is probably going to be worth maybe two times or even three times as much in ten yearsÂ’ time.  But you know what? You donÂ’t own it anymore, and neither will your children.<br></div>
