Emperors rule dynasties. Usually the founding emperor of the dynasty is one that understands the commoners' pains, and does not lead a life of overindulgence.<br><br>A few emperors down the road, the corruption creeps in. The new emperor starts using people's taxes to overindulge, resulting in unhappiness in the commoners, and slowly sow the seeds of destruction<br><br>Distribution of wealth is an important consideration in a society. Keep too much wealth at the top, and risk a revolt of all the poor (coz 80% (in singapore this could be more) belong to the poor. The rich is of a much smaller percentage).<br><br>To keep the people happy, wealth should be distributed to the people, in turn keeping stability in the society.<br></div></blockquote>Not really... corruption has always existed throughout China's history, doesn't matter which era of a dynasty. A few of the emperors who are well-known for their thrifty habit did not really produce much of a results too. Han Hui Di of the Han Dynasty and Jia Qing of the Qing Dynasty are both famous for being thrifty and benevolent. But their political abilities has been seriously doubt. On the contrary a number of the high spenders such as Han Wu Di and a number of the Tang Emperors drove China to its golden age.<br><br>The Chinese has a habit of equating poor officials as good officials, but in fact a number of officials who are famous for their integrity has very limited ability. Like the famous Bao Gong; in actual history, he has very limited investigative ability and he is only liked by the people because he is not corrupt. But if you want to measure how much he has done......hmmmm. On the contrary, Lee Hong Zhang, whom many did not like so much, is famous for being a corrupt official. A china friend of mine's family used to live on the same street with this official and had recorded that bribes to Lee had been sent into his house by carts. Yet this corrupt official is also known as the Brismack of the East and his ability has nevertheless, prolonged the existence of the Qing Dynastyl. Incidentally, he is also one of the pioneer in modernising China. General Guo Ziyi of the late Tang Dynasty has also not been very clean in terms of corruption, but somehow he is still well-like and his ability shows why.<br><br>So ya, greed and ability... as much as we Chinese people would like to fantasize, do not always have a direct relationship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically Mr Lee have gone from a very bad move to another bad move.<br><br>He should seriously step back and take note to undo the bad one than carry on making worst ones.<br><br>On one hand - he say that the need to have good minister the country will prosper better !!! - by doing that he increase pay and finance it by raising GST !!!<br><br>By increasing GST - it make the live of Singaporean harder and less attractive to foreigners !!! So what good it is - even you run the place well everyone wanting out !!!<br><br>Next mistake - if you do not need it then reverse it , stop the increase of salaries and gst !!! Do not donate it to charities in the Mr lee name - you get all the credit from charities donating blood money of other which suck from gst !!!<br><br>Should it not be be that stop the GST increase and let people donate money in their own names .... why take people money and donate it in your name !!!</div>

And he had a hand in taking out He Shen.<br><br>Ultimately, when we say our current govt is not worth the money, its not that we cannot pay them. Its 'We think they are NOT WORTH the price'. What have they done to deserve such astronomical pay? Have they made any significant impact to the people of late? (Yea, significantly increase our blood pressure)<br><br>LKY better start to understand the younger generation. Forcing things down our throat is useless. We will revolt against that. The more negative and ridiculous threats he make, the more our generation will look towards the opposition. I hope he understands this, coz he becomes a liability to PAP for all the threats he made, and a liability to Singapore for antagonizing other leaders through his insults</div>
