Is Govt = PAP?Ministers,pls understand you have dual roles, i.e. leaders in the govt and the party.Pls don't mix the two roles.The ministers' salaries are paid by all tax payers.<br><br>The govt should encourage good opposition parties.Then it wouldn't matter whether votiers choose ruling or oppostion party.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Under any accountable and transparent system, opposition will be treated as alternative voices representing the people as well for checks and balances.<br><br>I don't see why this role cannot be performed or tolerated by the dominant party in power. If the policies or implementations of the governing party are right as against the alternative proposals of the opposition, they will always enjoy the support of the people.<br><br>Why is the party in power so narrow-minded in regarding opposition as a threat to its power as posted by some forumers. I fear that when the party in power becomes self-centred and wants to have the power solely to itself will it regard the opposition as a threat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore goverment is nither democratic nor  communist, it is a new type of system. But tis system seems to be working. Maybe it would be best that it remains the same. Countries such as usa and taiwan have waste alot of money in their campaining, when they can spend their money in helping the people. With a single party, there would be lesser time slots on the tv for parlament, that is a good thing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br>tried visiting the oppostions party website.

            <div class='col-md body'>In any system there will be beneficiaries and disadvantaged. Whether something is good or not is measured only finally by the degree of support of existing system or government. If high costs affect the people and policies are causing loss of economic competitiveness and unemployment and difficulties in making ends meet, then what will be the good being talked about.<br><br>If next year, it is hoped due to continued world market forces, the economy remains on the uptrend, there may be forgiving acceptance of all the autocratic rule and denials.<br><br>If high costs come down under the new leadership and government becomes more caring and pro-Singapore and accountable, then there is a possibility that one party or even dictatorship will be somewhat acquiesced by the people.<br><br>For now, high costs are affecting the people, and there is a lack of economic strategy to take the economy forward. The domestic sector of economy is full of problems. The beneficiaries like the MPs, grass roots and party supporters naturally have nothing to worry about. Think, will the people bear with such problems and for how long.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Just did more researchÂ…<br><br>PM appoints the CDC mayor, who appoints the Grassroots OrganisationÂ’s Advisor.<br><br>http://app.sprinter.gov.sg/data/pr/2004081002-PMO.pdf<br><br>Under the current scheme of things, most, if not all, public assistance, is channelled through the CDC.<br><br>This would suggest that an MP.. if not holding a concurrent post of mayor or grassroots advisor, is nothing more than a town council chairman, with no discretionary power when it comes to public assistance schemes. It would not make sense if got problem and looking for assistance.<br><br>Gee.. being just a town council chairman is quite a thankless job. Those who have performed MCST chairman jobs should know.<br></div>
