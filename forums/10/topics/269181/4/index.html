Honestly, I think it's crap because of the spending cap. $500??? If your bank account has more than $500, then a debit card may be alot more useful. In the event of an emergency while I'm overseas, the $500 is good enough to buy me erm... 10 min in the ICU??<br><br>Plus you can earn points and enjoy the same discount privileges as its credit card cousin. The ones who claim that debit cards don't offer the same privileges as credit cards obviously haven't done their homework.<br><br>So at the end of the day, what good is this thing? If I don't even have $500 in my bank to spend using debit card, maybe I should not be getting a CC in the first place. </div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">different card got different privileges.. if not, why would banks work so hard trying to 'sell' their credit cards?<br><br>most debit cards only help to accumulate smart$.. unlike credit cards, that u can get instant discounts.  </span></div>
