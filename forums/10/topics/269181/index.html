            <div class='col-md body'>July 19, 2007<br>Parents slam new credit card scheme<br>By Claire Huang<br>SINGAPORE parents are alarmed at the recent launch of a new credit card that allows young consumers to apply even if they do not earn a single cent.<br>This new scheme by Citibank which kicked off yesterday is called Clear Card.<br><br>Earlier in March, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) changed its regulation on unsecured loans, thus allowing banks to come up with credit cards that need no minimum income.<br><br>Under the Clear Card scheme, consumers aged as young as 18 can apply for the card which allows a maximum monthly credit limit of $500.<br><br>The interest rate on rollover balance is 28 per cent, and is four per cent higher than the standard rate.<br><br>High interest rates whatsoever, some say they're all for it.<br><br>Secondary three student Lim Jun Shang says it's 'a good idea' and that now, he can 'spend money without thinking'.<br><br>Giving the thumbs up to this scheme is Justin Seah, also a student, who feels that although it may cultivate over-reliance on future money, it's handy to have a credit card.<br><br>But parents do not welcome the idea.<br><br>Mdm Virginia Ng, 50, says 'it's not right', as it means young adults will be able to spend money without first earning it.<br><br>But Citibank says this is the time for young adults to learn how to manage their finances.<br><br>Ms Alice Fok, Marketing Director of Citibank Credit Cards says as a parent herself, she feels that letting her children learn the intricacies in balancing their finances will benefit them in future.<br><br>And one regular Straits Times reader agrees.<br><br>Mr Leong Sze Hian, a financial professional pointed out that there is a tendency for young people to cultivate an 'easy spending' habit, but he's not stopping his 22-year-old daughter from applying for one.<br><br>'Sure go and apply, but you (his daughter) have to pay it when you use it and if you can't pay, you'll have to pay the interest also.<br><br>'No way am I going to bail you out. (I) Got to make that clear right from the start.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am absolutely against this sort of thing.<br><br>The comments of that fella who wants to use it to buy a $399 Hugo Boss shirt only underlines my sentiments. I wonder if he realises that while you can pay in small installments, the interest will eventually snowball the more you drag out your payments... and the final amount can be far more substantial than $399.<br><br>If you want to teach the kids financial responsibility, then let them use debit cards instead. Let them use their savings instead of credit to buy things.<br><br>Dollars to donuts say that some of these kids who use their credit cards will hit the $500 limit in no time at all.... and they'll end up whining and begging for their parents to bail them out.</div>
