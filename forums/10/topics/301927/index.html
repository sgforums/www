            <div class='col-md body'>SIA 's offer to buy stakes in China Eastern Airlines(CEA)<br>is 30% premium of 6 months average share prices<br>before SIA's offer!This is damn reasonable,considering<br>CEA is losing money for many years and the share price is almost<br>sleeping for many years.<br><br>BTW,who will so stupid to sell a money making company.<br><br>CEA need SIA's money ,reputation,know how and expertise<br>to make more money.SIA need to have higher market share<br>in PRC.Win --win ,why not.<br><br>But<br><strong><a

zaobao.<br><br><strong>Use Dragon Air as reference--by net asset value</strong><br>Since CEA is in deficits,SIA cant use profits ratio to value.<br>SIA and CEA use the reference of China National Aviation Corp (CNAC) selling<br>Dragon Air to Cathay Pacific(CX) as reference.CNAC sold Dragon Air at<br>3.17 times of the Net Assets value.<br>But now SIA bought CEA at more than 6 times of CEA net asstes value of<br>HK$0.58 per share!!<br><br><strong>Use CNAC and CX as reference--by net asset value</strong><br>When CNAC and CX cross holding the shares,CX sold CNAC at 1.3<br>of CX net assets,while CNAC sold to CX at 1.68 of net assets.<br><br><span style="color: red;">now SIA bought CEA at more than 6 times of CEA net asstes value is very reasonable.</span><br><br><strong>The jump in share prices after the proposed purchase is irrelevant</strong><br>Have CEA performance changed after SIA's offer?NO.<br>Why the price jump so far?<br>SIA is the answer.People hope SIA can turn around CEA.<br>Also CNAC and CX wanted to compete is another factor.<br>But they were stopped by PRC Authority in 2007,but not in 2008.<br><br><strong>SIA need CEA more than CEA need

            <div class='col-md body'>British Airways has been fined about Â£270m after it admitted collusion in fixing the prices of fuel surcharges.<br><br>The US Department of Justice has fined it $300m (Â£148m) for colluding on how much extra to charge on passenger and cargo flights, to cover fuel costs.<br><br>It followed a decision by the UK's Office of Fair Trading to fine BA Â£121.5m, after it held illegal talks with rival Virgin Atlantic.<br><br>Surcharges were added to passenger fares in response to rising oil prices.<br><br><strong>Virgin has been given immunity after it reported the collusion and is not expected to be fined, the OFT said. </strong><br><br>BA now faces the possibility of legal challenges by customers on both sides of the Atlantic who believe they lost money as a result of the collusion.<br><br>The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington said the airline could face multiple lawsuits for damages in the US from aggrieved passengers.<br><br>Record fines<br><br>The OFT and the DoJ began investigating BA's price-fixing in June 2006.<br><br>However, he acknowledged that the conduct of some of the carrier's employees had been wrong and could not be excused.<br><br>"Anti-competitive behaviour is entirely unacceptable and we condemn it unreservedly," Mr Walsh said.<br><br>"We have a long-standing competition compliance policy which requires all staff to comply with the law at all times.<br><br>"I am satisfied that we have the right controls in place. However, it is deeply regrettable that some individuals ignored our policy."<br><br>Scott Hammond of the DoJ's antitrust division said that "virtually every American business and consumer was impacted by these crimes".<br><br>"American companies rely on competitive shipping rates to export their goods to foreign markets, American consumers rely on imports for so many consumer and household goods, American families flew these airlines on international destinations.<br><br>"In every instance American businesses and consumers ended up paying more as a result of these crimes."<br><br>'Blatant breach'<br><br>OFT chairman Philip Collins said that the hefty fine would "send an important message" to companies and business leaders about its intention to enforce the law.<br><br>"This serves to remind companies of the substantial risks involved if they are found to engage in such behaviour," he said.<br><br>Virgin Atlantic said that it had informed the OFT as soon as its lawyers were made aware of the nature of contacts that had occurred between individuals from the two airlines.<br><br>"We take complying with competition laws extremely seriously and regret that contacts were made between the two companies," it said.<br><br>"As a criminal investigation is continuing, we are unable to give further details until the regulators publish their full findings."<br><br>BBC business editor Robert Peston said that the collusion between BA and Virgin Atlantic was "as blatant a breach of competition law as it's possible to imagine".<br><br>"This was not a careless accident. The two big birds... were not competing properly on price over an extended period: they were giving each other comfort that they would not undercut each other on the fuel surcharge."<br><br>He added: "Virgin won't pay a penny in fines and actually emerges as a winner, since all the opprobrium of the rule-breach has been heaped on BA."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Here is a selection of comments received by the BBC News website.<br>Willie Walsh states that customers were not overcharged, however, if the surcharges were fixed between Virgin and BA and not competitive then surely the customers must have lost out, they would have paid over the odds. What happens to the money from the fines? Will any customers be re-imbursed?<br>Andy Sharman, Peterborough<br><br>Sir Richard and the Virgin brand won over so many hearts when the details of British Airways` 'dirty tricks' campaign came to light in the early 90s. To me, if there were ever two businesses that wouldn`t have colluded in such a way - it would be these. Shame on you Virgin Atlantic.<br>Gareth Reid, Wellingborough, Northants<br><br>It is an outrage that Virgin are not being penalised in the same way and to the same extent. How can we know that they had not planned this all along, a real possibility given the history between the firms? It takes two to collude and with only BA being fined the message this sends is not constructive for any party or any industry. It sets a dangerous precedent. In no way do I condone the action taken by BA but I think that the fine is excessive - and why are they being fined twice? I would still fly with both companies and probably BA before Virgin.<br>Chris Cecil, Haddington, East Lothian<br><br>I flew BA in June 2006 to India and back. Did the price gouging affect me? If so, then 'B' for British should be replaced with another "B" that stands for illegitimate.<br>Robert Tavaris, Florida, USA<br><br>I have been flying the Atlantic for 50 years and I find the anti-competition laws a joke. The price of a trans-Atlantic ticket has not fallen in real terms since the IATA rules were suspended. All that has happened is that conveniences such as no-charge trip cancellation, free seat selection and inter-airline open-jaw bookings have been withdrawn.<br>Jim Garner, Ottawa, Canada<br><br>Source: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6925397.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6925397.stm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You also have to take into account that the analyst might have used a profit figure of Â£41.6 million profits for valuation.<br><br>The Â£41.6 million profits was a result of Virgin Atlantic's use of price collusion with British Airways.<br><br>If you notice in 2005, sales was Â£1,640 million, while in 2006, sales increased by only 17.3%, whereas profits have increased 100.69%. Makes sense to you?<br><br>If profits have increased by 100.69%, a normal person would expect sales to have gone up by more than 100%. Unless there was some radical changes to the industry like, they being the monopoly (no budget airlines exist), wages have gone done dramatically and fuel prices have dropped substantially.<br><br>I think you have to take a logical stance and not always err on the side of the government, else it would seem dubious as to whether you are on the government payroll.</div>
