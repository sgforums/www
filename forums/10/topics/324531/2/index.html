              <p>Personally in Singapore, i find that private cars in Singapore is more of a luxury than a neccessity. It is a good idea to use the ERP to slowly force the people to use public transport and cut down on the country usage of oil.</p>
              <p>That said however, the guys running the LTA have some serious issues. Ok fine you want to cut down on traffic jams and encourage the people to use public transport, but could  they make sure the public transport infrastructure could handle the influx of people before they go trigger happy with the ERPs ?</p>
              <p>The MRT is already maxed out when our population suddenly went from 4.5mil to 6.5mil, you simply can't increase the frequency of the trains any more. The circle line is only going to operate in the southern side of the country so it's hardly going to make much of a dent with the crowd. So far the only token gesture is the introduction of bus that runs parallel with the train lines.</p>
              <p>My beef with the ERP now is that transport vehicles(Lorries, vans..etc) are expected to pay the same amount as private transports. Surely they could be given a rebate since they're needed for a functioning economy and to contain inflation. It's not like they could chose not to use the expressways and enter the CBD.</p>
              <p>Are you serious that the public transport are being charged too ? I've never heard of it and never paid attention to whether buses have that cash card thing. I'm take a closer look next time.</p>

              <p>Personaly I feel tat the population should not be increased to such a high amount... singapore is just too small...</p>
              <p>And about ERP, it is not a bad idea in the way tat in a city with a high population density, control of cars is always a problem. Either car is very expensive to own or cars r always caught in a jam. U can solve the problem with more roads, but it is gonna cost especially with the small land size of singapore.</p>
              <p>The best model is tat people own car, however use it only in selected occasions. Tis offer some flexibility among the two other options. Normally u go to work taking the public transport. If u wake up late one day, u have the option to save yourself by driving over to work. If u wanna bring your girlfriend for a date, u have the option of spending the ERP charges and use the car to fetch her. U get a smooth ride and u get to have a car</p>
              <p>Maybe can think of it in the economics sense ba... the roads r limited while the drivers r a lot. Some form of economy should be present to ensure the supply (road) is used for the demand (drivers). If there is no control, then the supply cannot fulfilled the overwhelming demand and roads r jammed. The way to control tis supply and demand is done by setting price changes, which becomes the ERP. If u wanna use more of such resources, u pay more tax which help the people who do not have a car.</p>
              <p>Tat is why tis system is adopted by some countries now.</p>
              <p>anway just my two cents worth on ERP.......................................</p>
