            <div class='col-md body'>One of my helpers have suggested for us to press for a referendum for the issue of Casino.<br><br>No matter how we look at it, this is about trading social well being for economic gains. Whether this is acceptable to us will affect us in the years to come.<br><br>The impact on the society would vary but it is important for Singaporeans at large to decide whether they would agree to have casino or not, with the potential threats on social order and well being.<br><br>Thus, it is time for us, the citizens to reclaim our power and right to decide on issues that might have wide impact on us as a Nation and a people.<br><br>I suggest we hold the referendum on the casino issue in the coming general elections, to save cost. This is also good in the sense that at least for those constituencies that do not have the chance to vote, they could still exercise their rights of ownership of this place we call Singapore.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng<br><br>Disclaimer: This is not Workers' Party's Official stand yet, I am just opening up this issue for everybody to discuss.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If such ethnic/religious divide exist, it exists regardless of whether a referendum is held.  By having a referendum to reveal it would allow the society to address the issue.  Otherwise it will be a hidden time bomb waiting to expose one day when some other issues force us to reveal our core values.<br><br>If 99% of Muslims say NO, the government will need to have more communication with the Muslim community to address their view and concern as any inclusive gov't should do.  The gov't can't just force the decision to the society based on a subjective view that the society is mature enough.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by idwar:</div><div class="quote_body">Even if 75% agree, so what?

What about the cost incurred when treating these problems? So lets say indeed that there are economic benefits. will it go into other places used to solve the social problems? If it is so, must well we don't have a casino and maintain the standard of our living. Have casino or no casino also no difference. -.-</div>

Oh. We will be safe keeping the money for rainy days. In other words, the money will be hidden in the reserves. hahahaha..singaporeans..wake up your idea.</div>
