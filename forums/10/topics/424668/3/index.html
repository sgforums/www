              <p><br>you are right. that why top civil servants get paid high salary. Singapore are not alone is using promotion and high salary to induce civil servant to be ruling party puppets.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Singapore" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/singapore"><span style="color: #005689;">Singapore</span></a> is proud of its place near the top of many international rankings. Its school system is by some measures the world's best. The island state promotes itself as diverse, competitive and cultured – an exciting global hub. But there are two league tables which shame Singapore. The first, compiled by the campaigning group <a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.rsf.org/"><span style="color: #005689;">Reporters Without Borders</span></a>, places the country 136th in the world for <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Press freedom" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/press-freedom"><span style="color: #005689;">press freedom</span></a> – below Iraq and Zimbabwe. The second is the rate at which Singapore executes convicted criminals: arguably higher, per capita, than any other country in the world.</p>
              <p>Singapore presents itself as a modern liberal democracy: it has a parliament, elections, courts, a constitutional right to free speech and the consumerist gloss of capitalism. Its citizens are free to become rich and to travel. Many do both. The country has by any measure succeeded since independence. But its autocratic political culture – overseen by the country's founding father and now official minister mentor <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/AboutUs/Org-MP-MP-Prof-LeeKuanYew.htm"><span style="color: #005689;">Lee Kuan Yew</span></a> – is highly and needlessly restrictive. The media is largely state-owned. Defamation and contempt laws threaten dissent. The latest victim of these is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/16/alan-shadrake-jailed-contempt-singapore"><span style="color: #005689;">Alan Shadrake</span></a>, a British-born writer sentenced yesterday to six weeks in prison and a large fine after being found guilty of contempt of court. His book Once a Jolly Hangman questioned the independence of Singapore's legal system, and its use of the death penalty.</p>
              <p>It is depressing that a country as successful as Singapore should feel the need for such restrictions on free speech. Singapore argues that, without them, the balance between the country's Chinese, Malay and Indian populations would be upset. But the reality is that other successful parts of Asia – Hong Kong and Taiwan, for instance – have thrived by extending free speech and the rule of law. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2010/nov/16/press-freedom-singapore"><span style="color: #005689;">Singapore is making itself a less significant place</span></a> by refusing to give its people the sorts of freedoms that are routine elsewhere.</p>
              <p>On a practical level, the decision to prosecute Mr Shadrake was also foolish. His book has had far greater attention because of it, and Singapore's reputation has been harmed. Mr Shadrake is quite right to attack a criminal justice system whose victims are often poor migrant workers. His book was legitimate and – despite the court's claim to the contrary – largely accurate. The suspicion is that the Singapore government resented the exposure of a squalid system of routine executions which sits uneasily with the image it likes to present to the world. Singapore wants to be judged as a first-world nation. It must find the confidence to allow its citizens the freedoms that go with that status. Repression is not the route to success. In the end, it will prove its enemy</p>

              <p>It is proven that it is possible to live in prosperity in a developed nation while having its citizen's human rights and freedom of speech being trampled upon.</p>
              <p>Look at China, their citizens can be prosperous while having the same human rights as those of North Korean citizens.</p>
              <p>PAP is making excuse about racial harmony to suppress individual free spech. Alan Shadrake is just another scapegoat caught in the quagmire of singapore's zero tolerance towards anybody who dares to question PAP policy and governance.</p>

              <p>We have now reach the economic stage we want to be in. So why are we still obligated to support PAP?

The important thing is that the government must serve the people not they dictating how we should or should not behave. This is democracy. Power to the people.</p>
              <p>We should now be seeking for more freedom. Its time to give PAP their wake up call. Even if they win, we must cut down their 2/3 majority so they will know how the people feel about high prices, over-immigration and over stress work policies. No sufficient protection for employees, its time for labour unions to rise up and protect employee rights. It is time for the ordinary singapore to have the guts to speak out against the government without having fear of reprisals or lawsuits. I call for the overhaul of the court judicial system so PAP would not unfairly use this to sue opposition lawmakers for legitimate statements they have to make in their role as check and balances in the govt.</p>

              <p>Of course. That's why:</p>
              <p>-Singapore supports China.</p>
              <p>-Singapore supports Burma, says arms sales to Burma are "defensive" only.</p>
              <p>-Singapore warned Egypt protesters to "be patient" and not to seek too much change.</p>
              <p>-Lee Kuan Yew always says there is a western liberal democracy to sink Singapore. As if they get anything out of it.</p>
              <p>-Singapore says many people admire its system.</p>
