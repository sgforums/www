              <p>PM Lee again repeated that he would debunk the many lies told by people
                  in many blogs, forums or podcasts. So about two years ago he sent his
                  ministers like Lui Tuck Yew and Ng Eng Hen to counter the lies told in
                  the internet in many sites including youngpap, sgforums, sammyboy etc.<br> <br> Were the armies of counter-insurgency agents successful in debunking
                  the netizens' views about NKF, Shin Corp, Merryl Lynch and the paying
                  of another round of Ministers' super-salary increments soon the GST was
                  increased in the name of helping the poor last year.<br> <br> Go and read the posts of cyber-agents with nicks like salman,
                  bigcannonking, wy47, om or lately singlemalcollector
                  (forumsoneasia) and you would no doubt appreciate the beauty of some of
                  the most uncouth languages used in slamming people as whiners,
                  crybabies or ungrateful quitters.<br> <br> Of course PM Lee after these cyber-countering disasters could not say
                  that he has lost debates on government policies to these netizens as
                  that would be bad for face.<br> <br> With such loss of face he ought to change tune by not talking about
                  debunking them as he had proudly claim he could but is now trying to
                  say something different like it is a reality to live with or govt could
                  not really rebut all of them in the net.<br> <br> Such cyber-counter-insurgency attempt will certainly fail because the
                  netizens are not the simplistic lot easily deceived by some
                  ****-and-bull stories like "no free lunch" or "no one will be left
                  behind" or "foreign talents will create more jobs for citizens" craps
                  often told often in the past by their scheming masters out to deceive
                  simple folks in showing ceremonies and campaigns.<br> <br> Spending of part of ministers' or civil servants' time who are actually
                  paid by people from the public payroll is certainly illegal use of
                  people funds. <br> <br> Surely the citizens have a case for asking refund of salaries from such
                  people as such people being paid out of public payroll should not spend
                  time away from their jobs in their respective ministries and waste time
                  in countering their people's political evolution pr participation to
                  upgrade to a long-term sustainable democracy to prevent the constant
                  abuse of power as posted.<br> <br> If anything agents like singlemaltcollector has only aroused immediate
                  resentments and revulsions for their oft-bombastic boast of language
                  ability, life style or intellect with outright slamming of netizens'
                  poems or writings as childish or naive.<br> <br> These agents are only antagonising netizens as whiners or crybabies or
                  ungrateful or quitters wannabes like they way the leader belittled
                  Chiam See Tong as lacking enough of "A"s in his "O" level results.<br> <br> Beware too of technique like pretending to be sympathetic or sharing of
                  their thought on alternative policies or solutions hoping to catch your
                  support to walk the middle path.<br> <br> With the States Times, the brainwashing process might consist of
                  putting up ghost writers to publish pro-establishment news or analysis
                  but with the internet the indoctrination process is going to end up
                  hurting the ruling elites the next time round.<br> <br> So friends do stay the course and fear no knock at the door in the
                  middle of the night as long as you are serving as active citizens or
                  people's ultimate angel warrior to protect the sanctified interest.</p>
