I suspect they are the PAP proxies.<br><br>Let me share with you a typical day for those living in the north with the new ERP in the CTE after office hours:<br><br>to save money wake up at 6 am<br>left house by 645.<br>Reach CTE gentry with the heavy traffic in the morning (pre-ERP activation) before 730 am<br>reached office at 8 am<br><br>worked all the way till 8 pm to avoid ERP at the CTE<br><br>830 pm still stuck in the CTE tunnel because great minds thinks alike.<br><br>reached home at 930 pm.<br><br>Wife and hubby to tired to F--K. How to have babies???<br>Dinner have not taken- health problems- high health cost!!!<br>No exercises- no time to do.<br><br>What the F--K is the garmen doing?? What the f--k has going hiome to do with them.<br><br>Please support this topic to force the garmen to reliquish the ERP at the CTE between 6- 8 PM.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CENTRAL PLANNING that micro-manages every aspect of the Lives of Citizens can only result in FAILURES.<br><br>This approach has been the hallmark of this Singapore Government, and it is not surprising that the LTA and Traffic Police will dogmatically DICTATE - the driving habits on the roads and expressways in Singapore - by setting speed limits; and creating situations that does not fulfill the purpose of the original designs of the roads and expressways.<br><br>In most countries, roads and expressways are designed to bring people from one place to another in the <strong>quickest time and safest manner</strong>.<br><br>Has the same objectives been met with the designs and management of our roads and expressways ?<br><br>Roads and Highways are the connecting life lines of Singapore's Economic and Social bodies, and instead of assisting Singaporeans to use the roadways and expressways to achieve Economic and Social 'excellence, the Government, the Traffic Police, and the LTA seems to have created obstacles to impede these goals from being achieved.<br><br>Can Singapore achieve its present economic status if every road user had observed the Traffic Speed Limit of 70kmh on most roads in Singapore; and the other Speed Limits of 80kmh and 90kmh on Expressways ?<br><br>With such UNREALISTIC speed limits, the Government, the Traffic Police and the LTA has <strong>created and made CRIMINALS </strong>out of all the Singapore Drivers and Riders on Singapore roads - who can be seen to be travelling at speeds that are exceeding the Stated Speed Limits by over 10kmh to 20kmh.<br><br>Everyone is driving at 80kmh along <strong>various sections</strong> on the Bukit Timah and Upper Bukit Timah Roads, Thomson and Upper Thomson Roads, Serangoon and Upper Serangoon Roads, Nichol Highway, Shenton Way, Keppel Road, Mountbatten Road, Paya Lebar Road - and the Speed Limit is from 50kmh to 70kmh.<br><br>Along the PIE, ECP, AYE, CTE, TPE, SLE, BKE, and KJE - although the speed limits are set at 80kmh and 90kmh, many drivers can be seen to be driving at speeds of 90kmh (at the 80kmh sections), and speeds of 100kmh and more at the stretches of the expressways with a speed limit of 90kmh !!!<br><br>What is the monthly incidence of major and minor accidents along such roads and expressways ? When compared with the daily volume of traffic that is handled, are such incidents below the average for such heavily used roadways and expressways found in the 'FIRST WORLD' ?<br><br>Accidents are always shocking and heart breaking, but what are the causes of the accidents ?<br><br>Accidents <strong>are not always </strong>the result of 'over speeding' - as these can also be attributed to the manner in which driving skills are poorly developed and taught; and some of our Singapore roads/expressways <strong>are designed and built to cause accidents</strong>.<br><br>Singapore Drivers are taught the basic of driving, and given a year probation before being confirmed a 'permanent' licence; and yet some 'newbies' have abstained from driving during the first year - so as to 'pass safely' through the probation period, then head back to driving school for familiarisation before venturing further.<br><br>ADVANCE DRIVING SKILL is not further taught to new drivers - in handling speeds and skids, cornering, approaching and exiting a bend on the road or expressways.<br><br>Most of the Drivers of 'AUTOMATIC' cars are not informed that when driving at speed around the bend, they will need to MANUALLY SLOW DOWN the car by either stepping the brakes, or MANUALLY SHIFT DOWN - from 'D' to '3' or '2' position on the gear shift.<br><br>The Automatic Car <strong>DO NOT </strong>shift down automatically and DO NOT sense the car negotiating a bend; and neither can any Auto-car sense trouble going round the bend - (the poor design of a road bend is another subject, see below).<br><br>The materials used for road surface on some sections of Singapore roads are questionable. Most of the paintwork - that marked the lanes - will become invisible with the rain (and becomes worst when it happens at night).<br><br>The manner in which the roads are designed and built have caused drivers to 'fight against natural forces, especially at road curves when the road is sloping or banking away from the apex of the curve, and not allowing the road user to bank 'naturally into the curve'.<br><br>To those who are uninitiated and unfamiliar with 'high speed' driving, such curves and roads - that embank into the wrong directions - are death traps.<br><br>Putting up speed cameras does not help to prevent speeding, but will merely cause traffic bottle necks to occur at about 1 kilometer before the camera location, and the vehicles will gather speed again about 100 meters after passing the cameras.<br><br>Road disciplines are poorly enforced on Singapore roads and expressways, when slower drivers (trucks, vans, cars, motorcyles) are hogging the fast lane and also the middle lane of most major roads and expressways.<br><br>Instead of maintaining lane discipline, how many times have we seen the 'Motorbike Cops' enjoying the privilege of high speed - as if to catch some imaginary person some <strong>3 kilometers ahead </strong>(as if he could keep the party within sight ) ?<br><br>It seems that LTA and the Traffic Cops are obssessed with controlling speed limits, to the extent that they will forget about lane discipline and the road conditions of the various vehicles on the road.<br><br>How many vehicles have we seen on Singapore roads that have no red tail lights, one or both head lamps blinked out. signal indicators that do not work ?<br><br>The Ministry of Transport, LTA, Traffic Police and the R.O.V. should all work out a system that MAXIMISE the use of Expressways and Roadways.<br><br>They should allow vehicles to move at the <strong>'maximum' safest speed at the DIFFERENT HOURS of the day or night</strong>, and allow the Driver's judgment of the road conditions to move at a speed higher then the speed limit - and hold him responsible for any consequences of his decision.<br><br>They should consider making it an offense for any lead car to be permanently in that position - in front of a column of cars - for longer then 3 kilometers.<br><br>This will force 'road hogs' - who believe that they are within the speed limit, and allow them to hold the lead position and obstruct other road users - who may make risky moves out of frustration .<br><br>In this manner the Government and its agencies will not make CRIMINALS out of the larger numbers of the Singapore Road Users, who cannot possibly follow the Speed Limits that are <strong>UNREALISTICALLY SET </strong>for cars that are designed in the 1950s through the 1970s.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An older article on the impact of ERP:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">No need for N-S highway if evening ERP charges ease CTE jam<br>By Lee Ching Yee/Julia Ng, Channel NewsAsia<br><br>SINGAPORE : From August 1, motorists heading north on the Central Expressway between 6pm and 8pm must pay evening Electronic Road Pricing charges.<br><br>Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said if the new ERP charges could ease congestion on the CTE, Singapore would not need the proposed North-South Expressway.<br><br>There are presently eight expressways serving Singapore motorists, and the ninth - the Kallang Paya Lebar Expressway - would be ready in 2008.<br><br>And more expressways will be built, depending on the population growth.<br><br>Mr Yeo said the Government was still assessing whether there was a need to build a North-South expressway.<br><br>This is because the project is not only expensive, but also complicated as it will cut through several nature reserves.<br><br>"The North-South Expressway - we have got no timeline for that yet. Maybe it will be built in the next 10 years, maybe not. Depends very much on the demand, and the cost of the system.<br><br>"The KPE costs us quite a few billion dollars. I think the North-South Expressway have to run through all these sensitive areas, will cost us even more."<br><br>Mr Yeo said both Singapore's road and rail network had surpassed their original targets as set out in the Land Transport Authority's World-Class Transport System White Paper.<br><br>Between 1996 and 2000, 225 kilometres of lane-miles were planned.<br><br>But double that distance has been built and at a lower cost than the $1.1 billion original estimates.<br><br>Mr Yeo said: "Singapore is actually quite densely built up, in terms of road. Today the road space is 12 per cent of our total land area. Our residential usage only takes up 13 per cent. So actually road space takes up as much space as our homes. So there is a limit to how much more we can grow."<br><br>But he said in time, Singapore's public transport system would be as extensive as those in London and Paris.<br><br>The MRT Circle Line is expected to be running by 2010.<br><br>Two new MRT lines would also link Marine Parade with Bukit Timah.<br><br>Mr Yeo said: "I think give us another 20 to 25 years, I think the density of train stations in the city centre would be as good as London, because by that time I would expect that we would have two additional new lines built."<br><br>And when the railway network is complete, Singaporeans will be able to take an MRT train from the City to any corner of the island. - CNA/de</span><br><br>Frankly, i believe the potential shelving of the N-S highway if ERP results are 'good' is a lame excuse. Sure, not only does it do your coffers wonders, it's a classic example resting on your laurels.<br><br>LTA has a 'nerve centre' to monitor the ERP situation daily. Why can't that money be spent on setting up a dedicated team to explore greater possibilities on road improvements?<br><br>In US, the transport system on highways includes a carpool lane (min 2 in a car) that encourages MORE people to take LESS vehicles. These lanes are specifically constructed on the fast channels to improve point to point travelling. This is especially effective near the city. Engineers from Asia visit SG to learn more from our transport network. Why aren't we investing likewise from other developed nations? Or are we simply too smug to think WE know best?<br><br>Implementing ERP seems a masterstroke. At S$ 2.50 during peak hours, it is just expensive enough to discourage middle class and the stingy ones from using the expressways but just cheap enough for upper-middle class people to absorb it as a small cost.<br><br>Hence the likely users during such times are either the rich or the desperate late comers etc. Is it just me or is there something seriously screwed with this idea? Is the gahmen too limited in its creativity that the LTA is so unwillinging to explore other feasible options?<br><br>I see workers digging up our roads daily to service power lines or water pipes. Why is our road tax money being spent on such things? Or are such public works 'designed' to necessitate pre-determined service inspections on a scheduled basis such that we provide work for our foreign labour? Aren't these things supposed to last? If they're not digging in one spot, it's another spot down the road.<br><br>After the screwed-up job at the circle line, LTA continue to confound average citizens with that ridiculous anti-cyclist barrier on overhead bridges and even had the gall to push the blame to their contractors after the accident. A radical shake-up with fresh minds should be performed to change the 'mindset' of the current administration.</div>

I have suggested that LTA adopt a system similar to the carpool format of highways in the US. This could further be extended to carpool buses or CBD transport akin to the school bus system.  I have repeatedly stated (perhaps in an occasional disatisfied tone) that slapping a monetary cost behind every 'solution' is not the best option, especially when cost of living is going up astronomically. Yet you selectively ignore these discussion points and press home your usual rhetoric: "what are your action plans?"<br><br>If you aren't here to discuss, why pour slime on those who are interested? Or are you back with your 'migration' scheme once more?<br><br></div>

ERP is all about cost. Melbourne may have been one success factor where their local govt drove home the 'use public transport' message.
