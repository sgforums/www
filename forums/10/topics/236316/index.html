The closing of Malaysian taps is not unforeseeable cos of the very obvious reliance on them for water. If Malaysia wants to play hardball and strong-arm us, surely you wouldn't want the govt to go meek and be suppressed?<br><br>As for the sand issue, to what extent that itself was foreseeable remains unknown.  In fact, anyone can always look back on hindsight to say that anything that has occured could have been foreseeable.<br><br>I doubt strong-arming was an agenda when dealing with our ASEAN neighbours. SG is not a superpower and cannot do that. As far as SG is concerned, it is standing up for its sovereign status and will not subject itself and its citizens to any form of blackmail by our neighbours.<br><br>In all the posts I have seen from you, I do not recall seeing you credit the govt for any good that they have done for SG.

If they feed pigs with beta-agonist, a banned growth enhancer, the court will decide on the penalty under the Penal Code," he added.<br><br>Abdul Aziz said state governments can also use their state enactment to punish the culprits, including closing down their farms.<br><br>He said VSD enforcement teams are still conducting checks and collecting samplings on pig farms in the country. "If they are found using beta-agonist, the farms will be quarantined."<br><br>"Farms found free from the use of beta-agonist, we will continue to conduct tests. We will not tell them that they are clear," he added.<br><br>Deputy Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Datuk Mah Siew Keong said it was now mandatory for pig farmers to sign the "Aku Janji" oath for renewal of farming licence.<br><br>"This will enable us to take legal action when they break the oath," said Mah.<br><br>Meanwhile, Federation of Livestock Farmers' Associations of Malaysia pig unit chairman Tung Hong Chai said: "We support the government's oath signing requirement for pig farming licence.<br><br>"Although most pig farmers had agreed to sign the oath, they were advised to seek legal advice from their lawyers.<br><br>"If pig farmers have stopped using the growth enhancer, there is no harm in signing the oath," he said.<br><br>Tung said the VSD should reconduct tests on pig farms, found using beta-agonist and quarantined for a month, again so the farmers can resume their operations and business.<br><br>However, an industry source said the many loopholes in the various Acts governing the use of the growth enhancer had been exploited and "is now the source of problems" as the control of drugs in animals is under the jurisdiction of the Health Ministry.<br><br>The loopholes in the Poison Act:<br><br>* beta-agonist has been classified as Group A poison for animal feed since 1991, but no action has been done to ensure it is not used;<br><br>* the Act allows drugs to be sold to farmers directly and they do not need to seek any veterinary advice from veterinarians or prescription;<br><br>* no requirement for pharmacists to declare what is in the product when they sell it to the customers. Most packages can even have no labels or can be sold in plastic pails, bags or drums with minimal labelling; and<br><br>* the Act also allows complete exemption on import and sale without restriction of all veterinary feeding supplements, which means if an importer falsely declares the growth enhancer as importing veterinary feeding supplements - there is no need for him to have a poison licence.<br><br>He said although the Sale of Drugs Act accepts the registration of veterinary medicines, to date there is no veterinary drug registered.<br><br>He said any drug in any label, without the quality check or control in any way can be imported if it is declared as veterinary drug.<br><br>He said the VSD through its primary legislation, the Animal Act, has no authority on producers on the use of drugs.<br><br>"Why is the Health Ministry pushing the problem to the Agriculture Ministry as the Act has no authority on producers on the use of drugs," he added.<br><br>He said the VSD provided veterinary inspections at government and privatised abattoirs but once the meat leaves the abattoirs, "it falls under the jurisdiction of the Health Ministry's Food Act".<br><br>He said it was ironic that the (health) minister now wants to identify the root causes of the problems afflicting pig farmers when the puzzling problems had been looming since 1991 when beta-agonist was banned.<br></blockquote>---http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=16704<br><br>2.<strong>Indo Pig breed by SG</strong><br>I remember news reported that SG has a pigsty in Indo.<br>The management initially dunt welcome reporters for<br>they afraid virus will be brought inside.<br><br>No new pigs is allowed into the farm.Only OUT,No in.<br><br>They guard the farm like secret military base!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is useful to see the perspective from the other side, and not just hold your own beliefs.<br><br>I dont think those actions are sabotages meant to undermine Singapore, as what your first post suggest.<br><br>To know what's going on, try to put yourself in the other party's shoes.<br><br>For Malaysia, they feel that the water is sold very cheap, and the contract price is outdated, they feel they are having the short end of the bargain. Then they wanted to re-negotiate for a better price, and if still cannot reach a compromise, they would rather cancel or break the contract, since they feel it's not fair anymore.<br><br>For Indonesia, the sand mining is very destructive to the environment, as the miners dont care about the enviromental damage. The companies just want to make money, and they use whatever crude method they like. It has caused wider and wider enviromental damage. Furthermore, in some areas there is concern the massive sand mining will reduce the island shoreline or reduce the elevation. Not just big environment effect, but also possible political or territorial effect. They are worried that in the future, any border dispute or a redrawing of boundaries may happen.<br><br>Indonesia actually not just banned sand mining, some time ago it banned tin mining as well, as it caused massive holes resembling pockmarks.<br><br>So as you can see.....both these countries have their own concerns and their own internal reasoning which made them decide like that. I really doubt it has much to do with Singapore, or let alone a deliberate intent to negatively sabotage Singapore.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>
