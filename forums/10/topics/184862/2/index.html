The Chosen One has stood up again! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>When LKY passes on, I do not think there would be drastic shifts to PAP policy, because the cabinet are full of his people and allies, they will support LHL, who will be aided by senior ministers like GCT, and maybe later Teo Chee Hean etc. Unless LHL makes a huge political mistake somewhere, and he can't handle a gathering storm like LKY handled SIA.<br><br>But I think certain policies in Singapore might change faster, the society might open up faster. Maybe I can expect more streets, buildings, institutes to be named after LKY. Who knows if they will build a grand memorial hall like the Chiang Kai Shek one in Taipei? They build an equivilant of Mount Li for him, thousands of terrocota PAP members at virgil... They will build a grand museum, will historical relics, to trace the epic events from 1955-1965.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by ndmmxiaomayi:<strong><br>I don't know if the laws have changed. According to my books, the President is part of the Executive under the Singapore Government. The other two are Legislature and Judiciary.<br><br>The President has the power to safeguard the financial reserves of our country. But whether this translate to asking for our national accounts I don't know. He also have the power to permit investigations of corruptions.<br><br>According to this website, <a href="http://www.istana.gov.sg/cpa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.istana.gov.sg/cpa.html</a>, he can veto after consulting the panel. That's pretty limited in way, but he can still do so.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by oxford mushroom:<strong><br>Ours is not a presidential system...the head of the Execcutive branch is the Prime Minister, not the President. Since the President is considered part of the Executive, he cannot overrule the PM.<br><br>I think the government has a change of mind after Ong Teng Cheong, who considered his role as independent of the Executive in matters touching on his Presidential mandate. The government probably did not think it through carefully enough as to the implications if a President should challenge the cabinet on political decisions regarding the national reserves. Now that they know the possible impact, they are trying to backtrack. They probably wish they had never thought of an elected president in the first place.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">From an extract of a Government material, the <a href="http://www.istana.gov.sg/pro.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Office of the Elected Presidency</strong></a> was described as follows:-<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In January 1991, the Constitution was amended to allow for the election of a President by the citizens of Singapore. The elected President will hold office for a fixed term of six years. The creation of the elected presidency is a major constitutional and political change in Singapore's history.<br><br>Under the revision,</span> <strong><span style="color: red;">the President is empowered to veto government budgets and appointments to public office</span></strong>.<span style="color: darkred;"> He can also examine the Government's exercise of its powers under the Internal Security Act and religious harmony laws, and in investigations into cases of corruption. The President must, however, consult the Council of Presidential Advisers before he takes a decision on some of these matters</span><br><br>This highlighted sentence - in red - clearly shows the authority and duty of the Office of the Elected President over that of the Government as intended and legislated into Law by the Ruling Political Party.<br><br>Unfortunately, the irony of having the Office of the Elected Presidency is that it is made impotent by the mere fact that the Elected President has to consult his Council of Presidential Advisers before making any decisions.<br><br>The <a href="http://www.istana.gov.sg/cpa.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>Council of Presidential Advisers</strong></a> comprises six members, of whom two are appointed by the President at his discretion, two are the Prime Minister's nominees, one is the Chief Justice's nominee and the sixth, the nominee of the Chairman of the Public Service Commission.<br><br>With both appointments to the Chief Justice and Chairman of the Public Service Commission being selected and recommended by the Prime Minister, can their selection of their candidate be independent from the Prime Minister's influence ?<br><br>With the Advisory Council largely in the hands of the Ruling Political Party that form the Government of the day - can the President have any space to perform the duties that is expected of him to check any abuses and corruption by his Government ?<br><br>This is the typical charade that the Ruling Political Party has constantly shown to preserve its own controlling position over the Political Life of Singapore.</span><br><br></div>
