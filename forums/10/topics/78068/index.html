            <div class='col-md body'>1. yes many parents are over protecting their kids, since nowadaes parents haf fewer kids. and they wan the best for them. and they are more vocal and some parents themselves no longer haf the kind of respect for educators tt was present in the past due to the difference in education level.<br><br>2. teachers and principals should be allowed a certain amount of discretion to act. the system should respect their judgement, rather than try to list out the dos and donts comprehensively (wich is nex to impossible anyway). this discretion includes the freedom to mete out punishments.<br><br>3. punishments should be proportionate and effective and directed. use of cane should be continued but only as part of the system, to be carried out according to regulations.<br><br>4. teachers should be encouraged to refrain from physical punishments and use only as a last resort. difficult as it is, teachers should try to make it clear to the students when punishments are given why he / she is punished and why the form of punishment is chosen. again, their judgement should be respected.<br><br>5. the students' behaviour in the past should not be used to influence the decision on the form of punishment for a certain errant behaviour now.<br><br>jus rattling off wat i think of on the spot... in the end my opinion is mainly tt teachers shouldnt fear repercussions for their actions which have been carried out in the best of the students' interest. and its necessary to assume tt most of their actions are based on tt. however if the teacher himself feels a rush of temper, he should know tt he needs to walk away from the situation.</div>

I think having such fear in students/kids is nto healthy for the kid.<br><br>3) your cousin is quite an extreme example, i believe. the problem with our local press is that they take a few exceptional cases and portray them as social problems.  but look on the bright side, at least your cousin learned to wipe his ass!<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i recently spoke to an old friend who has always wanted to become a teacher. she told me she will still become a teacher, but she has grown to become afraid of the school, parents and especially children. oh no...hopefully this isn't the mentality of most of the teacher-wannabes. MOE better have a better recruiting campaign. as for my cousin being an extreme case, maybe not. i'm sure there are many like him, just that we don't know of such private stuff.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A little pain applied in the right context of punishment for a misdeed never damaged any child.<br><br>However the covering up and protection from the consquences of their wrongdoing has often been the bane of many a child who has grown up with a blurred line between the right and wrong.<br><br>There's no need to be a superstrict parent that lashes a child at every misdeed, and worse, be one who cannot control the child and is not more revelant to him or her then a vending machine or a shield to hide from the consquences of wrongdoing.

            <div class='col-md body'>OooOooo.... tat sounds like a lot of pain...<br><br>I remember an incident where I get severly caned when I was young... I steal some money from... hehehe... my grandma  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  to buy some toys and my mum discover it. At night it was hell... the toy was thrown and I was caned for 2 hours straight. No amount of begging or crying can make her stop.<br><br>I think she did the right thing to me then as I deserve every single bit of it... I never think about stealing ever after tat incident...<br><br>For young children, how to talk sense into them when they don't even understand much about anything ? If my mum just talk "sense" into me then I will just probably just say "Orr.." or "Yes" and when I have a chance, I will steal again. I gain a toy and I have lost nothing u see. When one is young they r just not sensible. If a child really did something wrong, caning is really the best way to tell it to them.</div>
