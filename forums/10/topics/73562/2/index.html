            <div class='col-md body'>Should we have a casino?<br>YES<br><br>I'VE always thought it was high time for Singapore to have a casino. If Singapore seriously wants to promote itself as a fun place, it has to do better than trumpeting bar-top dancing and reverse bungee jumping.<br><br>I visited Las Vegas some years ago and, till this day, I remember the dynamism and vibrancy of the place, the ebullient vibes.<br><br>Singapore has nothing remotely resembling a decent nightlife and is positively boring, compared to cities such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, and needs to reinvent itself to remain attractive to foreign MNCs.<br><br>I don't foresee how organised crime, long a mainstay of an active gambling scene and the bane of most governments, can ever abound, much less take root, given the tightly-policed city state that Singapore is.<br><br>Far from being a hive of criminal activity, a well-run and properly regulated casino - Genting is an example - can be marketed as a wholesome, family-oriented experience.<br><br>Monte Carlo in Monaco with its pristine and picturesque beaches, resorts and a casino for the rich and pampered, has developed a reputation for attracting high-rollers, the swaggering European elite.<br><br>What if Singapore can position itself as the Asian equivalent with Sentosa and the Southern Islands? As competitors go, Singapore has virtually the entire playing field to itself. Thailand and the resort islands of Indonesia, namely Bali and Bintan, are almost exclusively for low-budget backpackers and nature lovers.<br><br>Hong Kong and Shanghai have a dazzling entertainment scene but lack the beaches and the idyllic 'island resort' feel. Macau, popular with high-stakes gamblers, is marred by its association with triads and crime.<br><br>Aside from reaping the obvious economic gains of building a world-class, luxurious playground for the rich and famous, Singapore would be able to boost its international profile, much like what Dubai has achieved.<br><br>Social problems will inevitably arise because gambling can have adverse effects on the family setup, but I question the impact.<br><br>SHANE HUANG JINWEI<br><br>IT IS good to see the Government exploring the feasibility of a casino. It shows that the Government is willing to open its mind even to subjects that have been considered taboo for the longest time.<br><br>Granted there may be social repercussions but a progressive country needs to stop worrying incessantly about too many things, especially when the pros outweigh the cons, and the cons are not all that insurmountable.<br><br>One of the biggest worries is addiction to gambling and the ensuing problems. But there are already many outlets to satisfy the urge to gamble, including the casino ships which may be inconvenient but not all that inaccessible.<br><br>A minister said that one solution is to restrict entry to those of a certain economic class. But that smacks of elitism and discrimination, not the done thing for a country that wants to be seen as progressive and dynamic, judging from the Uniquely Singapore campaign.<br><br>I remember visiting a casino that issued entry cards with date and time of entry marked on them. On each card, there are boxes with denominations from $5 to $100. Each time you change cash for chips, the croupier would stamp the appropriate boxes. This is in essence your credit limit for the night. It also helps you keep track of your losses.<br><br>I also remember seeing cards with a helpline you can call if you felt that you needed help. I believe this was a casino in the United States, although I cannot remember which as I had visited a fair number in my reckless youth!<br><br>Of course, you could also apply for membership and be given a card for entry without the credit limit.<br><br>My point is that it is possible to have measures to minimise any fallout. Encourage the formation of self-help groups, make it mandatory for the casino operator to contribute funds for counselling programmes...<br><br>It would be a pity to dismiss this potentially lucrative source of revenue simply out of fear.<br><br>ALICIA TAN GEK CHENG (MS)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>NO<br><br>I STRONGLY object to having a casino in Singapore.<br><br>The Govern-ment has always rejected calls to have a casino because it knows it can cause great harm to Singaporeans, especially those who are unfortunate enough to have a close family member who is addicted to gambling. Families have broken up and children suffered.<br><br>So what if many Singaporeans are already gambling in neighbouring countries or on cruise ships?<br><br>While we want to attract rich tourists we must not forget that we are harming our own people just to satisfy the few who will benefit from the opening of a casino.<br><br>I feel sad for Singapore if this is what we call 'Remaking Singapore'.<br><br>When I was young, I was proud to learn that Singapore became successful despite the fact that we did not have any natural resources.<br><br>We faced difficult times and yet we overcame every difficulty to be where we are today, thanks to our early leaders, without whom we would not be able to enjoy a good life.<br><br>I fear for the future of Singapore if our leaders think it is all right to set up a casino now because we must keep up with the times. It takes strong leaders to reject pressure from a few.<br><br>There are certain businesses we should never get involved in and gambling is definitely one of them. How could one enjoy spending money that had caused families to break up and children to suffer because their parents went to the casino in Sentosa, our resort in the sun?<br><br>It is even more ridiculous to suggest that we divide Singaporeans into classes - the 'can go' and the 'cannot go'.<br><br>I know of a man who earned $10,000 monthly who would spend all his salary within two days in a casino and return home empty-handed and in a daze. He did this for the last two years.<br><br>What happened to his family? The children suffered.<br><br>KELVIN LING WAI PING<br><br>IN RESPONSE to the proposal to set up a casino in Sentosa to make Singapore a more attractive travel destination, I urge the authorities to tread carefully.<br><br>Hong Kong, for instance, has increasingly recognised that gambling is a fiercely addictive activity, and that an addiction to it plagues a considerably large proportion of its population.<br><br>Such is the government's concern that numerous campaigns have been implemented to educate the public on the dire consequences of gambling addiction, and particularly how it could, very possibly, adversely affect one's family and loved ones.<br><br>The way Hong Kong deals with the problem of gambling addiction is not unlike how we discourage drug abuse. Prime-time television programming is peppered with campaign advertisements which inform viewers of the far-reaching consequences of their gambling habits.<br><br>Viewers are also reminded that a counselling service and hotline are available for addicted individuals.<br><br>Clearly, such action was taken because it is a serious problem; many an individual's dalliance with gambling has spiralled out of control, with dire conse-quences.<br><br>Closer to home, there is much value, and truth, in urban legends and grandmothers' tales of how gamblers lost their home and family.<br><br>Singapore's largely Asian population is not unlike Hong Kong's. Culturally, we are very similar. We both share an inherent enthusiasm for food, shopping - and gambling.<br><br>Although Hong Kong's gambling problems are not solely casino-linked, the scale ought to be a warning to us.<br><br>Are we ready to deal with the numerous social problems which would follow from making gambling even more accessible than it already is, and on a larger scale? Would introducing a casino lead to problems which we have largely avoided, quite successfully, by restricting legalised gambling to its current forms?<br><br>JONATHAN WONG SHOOU-HUANG<br><br>Taken from ST forum section 260304</div>

First, is money laundering, if you do not know recently Singapore has setup a task force to counter money laundering (effectively checking accounts for frauds) and is working together with world banks on this issue. Secondly, the MAS, has supreme powers to look into any bank account (why do you think our IRAS is very good at catching tax evaders, even ktv ma ma san also can catch). Thirdly, any cash or large transaction or TT wired in will be investigated, amounts more than $1 million (or high transactions on individuals or groups, most suspicious are companies setup in the Bahamas). There are other measures setup as well... if you want to know about M'sia fallout in currency that was due to currency speculation, it goes in far greater detail than just that. We can still keep both issues separate.<br><br>Did you know that Singapore allows prostitution in brothels? I heard sex is more addictive and far more demanding than money. Why do I not hear more broken homes due to prostitutes taking husbands away from their families?<br><br>Stealing is a bad habit did you know that? Some people are addicted to it. Same goes for a lot of illegal activities, you can't stop people from doing it, the government can only place measures to ensure that strict rules are followed and are in place.<br><br>See beyond, gambling being a vice that is the con, what good can it bring Singapore? From what I can see, the pros sure outweigh the cons!<br><br>ps. please do not get offended for the spelling mistakes I pointed out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
