If you WIN, count yourself lucky. Who pays for the dealer, the air-con, the cards, the dice...???<br>6) Clubbing&gt;$30 cover to Velvet, you get 2 drinks and party for 9hrs(6pm-3am), add $12 - 1000+ for more drinks<br><br>As for any form of entertainment, you have to PAY for it. So is going to a Casino, yes you could go everyday, yes you could also have sex in geylang everyday or watch movies all day long and not work. Or hardcore soccer fans can just spend their lives savings and buy an air ticket to UK and watch all of Arsenal matches until they run out of money and start begging for food. Or you could bet $10,000 Big on a 4D number, you stand to win $30m with an odds of 1 in 10000.<br><br>However, you can distinguish that Casino, sex, alcohol, betting on soccer, 4D, smoking are vices and are harmful.<br><br>Some people are bound to abuse these, we definitely have alcoholics in Singapore, do you suppose we BAN it since raging alcoholics tend to beat up their wivies and children? And all the drunk driving incidents could have been avoided!!!<br><br>We also have people who are sex addicts, yes sex is very addictive!! haha.... Do you suppose we make PROSTITUTING ILLEGAL? You should expect, more divorces(hard to believe, but it keeps families together) and more rapists out on the streets.<br><br>Smoking causes Cancer and is harmful to everyone, shall we Ban Smoking islandwife in Singapore as well? People will have to step into JB or take a ferry to Batam or take a boat out of Singapore waters to smoke?<br><br>Shall we also close down all pubs and discos since they're a playground and market for drugs, and new age party drugs like E. Zouk and Centro have been widely known for people selling a variety of party drugs. Indecent KTVs would sell black market viagara, to pot or ice... Shall we BAN all pubs and discos, any place that plays loud music and do a blood and urine test for every citizen in Singapore within 3 days, you will know who has taken drugs, has HIV, Hep A B or C and other known viral diseases??? Change people's IC to RED if they have HIV, for other STDS will be noted on the IC, Hep A B or C IC will be orange.<br><br>You can ban all these vices, but then where's the fun and excitement in life ?<br><br>For those above 18, we're all adults, its up to you to choose what type of life you want to live.<br><br></div>

Opening a Casino, will actually benefit all Singaporeans by creating more jobs, more revenue/capital inflow and capital investment by foreign partners.<br><br>Here's the scenario:<br>Opportunity lost if a Casino in Singapore is opened<br>&gt;creates jobs in Casino roughly 500-1000 jobs(card dealers, floor managers, host.. etc)<br>&gt;increase in tourist from around the world&gt; 500k - 1m+ additional tourist each year&gt;more revenue for SIA and Changi airport of $1 - 5billion(Airport charges, airline tickets, airport personnel)&gt; more jobs created 1000- 5000 jobs<br>&gt;increase in hotel occupancy&gt;increase in hotel rates&gt;increase in revenue for hotels $500m - 1billion&gt;increase in new hirings&gt;more jobs being created 500-1000jobs<br>&gt;increase in F&amp;B outlets&gt;new outlets 100-500+&gt;more jobs 500-1000jobs<br>&gt;increase in sales for shops due an influx of tourist&gt;new shops 100 - 500+&gt;more jobs 500-1000jobs<br>&gt;increase in revenue for taxis as there are more tourists&gt;more income for taxi drivers $10 - 100million<br>&gt;Setting up of banking accounts for tourists&gt; new accounts add up to $500m - 1billion in savings, current account or wire transfers to gamble&gt; more banking jobs 500-1000<br>&gt;Gambling tax of 30 - 40% of Casino revenue&gt; $100m - 500m in taxes&gt; goes back to the citizens, developing singapore etc<br>&gt;increase in tax revenue leads to more hires for IRAS&gt; 50 -100jobs<br>&gt;Owner of Casino will be foreign players and majority ownership by Temasek holdings or some GIC company&gt;thus majority of Casino profits goes indirectly back into Singapore's economy, set at $1b - 5 billion<br><br>Summary of the cost of opportunity lost:<br>1) $10-100billion in lost revenues each year<br>2) 10,000 - 50,000+ jobs lost<br>3) New hotels to be built<br>4) Lost of interest of a place to gamble for tourist<br>5) Lost of capital inflow and investment $5 - 10billion(setup of Casino)<br>5a) Increase in rental properties such as Condo/HDB/Private homes to gamblers or tourist or expats working on the new bank accounts<br>there's more as well......<br><br>This is a small view of the opportunity lost if Singapore does'nt open a Casino.<br><br>Now does it outweigh the bad?<br>Please list and substantiate your points with good sounding judgement.<br><br><blockquote><span style="color: red;">goverment would become richer,<br>but maybe not to people of singaporean,<br>the bad impact that would harm singaporean would be quite hugh</span></blockquote>The new creation of jobs for Singaporeans, will make Singaporeans richer, so will the influx of revenue and capital expenditure by the tourist increase the revenue of Singaporean business.<br><br>What does a richer government mean? Means, that they will have a surplus in the budget. What does a surplus in budget mean? The surplus goes into the Reserves. This gets a bit tricky as its up to MAS to do what they want with the reserves. But generally in monetary policy, our Sing dollar gets stronger. They can also do lotsa funky policies as well with more money they're receiving but thats a bit complicated.<br><br>However, the surplus means that the Govt can spend more on their budget. IE more salary you can afford to spend more. Thus, parliment will say we have X surplus every year, means we can increase our budget by X percent, lets decide what we need to spend on. All the ministers, MP, NMP will all say, spend here on my GRC we need blah blah blah, my other GRC wants this blah blah....<br><br>Thus, with a surplus, they can increase most of the budget, like on defense, the SAF can get a few NEW TOYS to play with, spend more on upgrading HDBs&gt;more work for contractors, spend more on education&gt;new schools more CCs, more highways more MRT lines(forgodsakes no more LRT lines PLEASE)...etc you get the point?<br></span><br><br><blockquote></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me,the answer is Yes.The reason is simple,they can create more jobs for singaporeans n more tax income for the government.And from there,like some forumers pointed out here,the government could hopefully reduce some other taxes that have make the cost of livings unbearable for those commoners.And also,even if the government dont open a casino,ppl can still go to other places n gamble like Genting highland or Indonesia or any other countries,this will in term benefit other countries n we are not getting anything from it.It will only cost our money to fly overseas by not building any casinos.</div>
