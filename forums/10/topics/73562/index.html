            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The government is not out to promote gambling even as it considers plans for a casino in Sentosa.<br><br>Instead, Trade and Industry Minister George Yeo explains the government's approach is to have <strong>a casino that is good for the economy, but without the sleaze.</strong><br><br>Singapore will not be another Macau or Las Vegas, says Brigadier-General (NS) Yeo, but the government is interested in the economic boost that will come with high stakes gambling.<br><br>If it does decide on a casino, it will be on Sentosa and the southern islands - an area to be developed into a playground for the rich and famous.<br><br>"We don't want the crime and sleaze. What we want is a facility in the southern islands which is world-class, which stands out because of its special unique character, and part of an international resort and residential development which will help Singapore stay ahead in this competition amongst cities in Asia," BG Yeo said<br><br>"This is our objective, not to promote gambling among Singaporeans. <strong>And to achieve this, to have our cake and eat it too, we must have controls in place."</strong><br><br>It may be an uphill task convincing Singaporeans why most of them should be left out of such a casino -- <strong>membership may be one way of controlling their admission.</strong><br><br>Meeting with Bukit Batok residents, BG Yeo related how Singaporeans will go to Batam or get on a cruise ship to gamble.<br><br>But his point was that the government would never make it easier for Singaporeans to gamble. If it did, he felt the number of gamblers will increase "ten times".<br><br>"Sometimes gambling can destroy families. So on the one hand we want to attract international gamblers to come here, we want to attract high, wealthy tourists to come here, I don't think we want to encourage Singaporeans to go and patronise these casinos when they cannot afford it," he said.<br><strong><br>BG Yeo was quick to assure that many of the reasons for not wanting a casino in Singapore still hold.<br></strong><br>Otherwise he said the government might as well have a casino in Bukit Batok East.<br><br>So the government in its deliberations have to balance both issues -- how to have an international casino, that is not at the same time nearby and convenient to locals.<br><br>Meanwhile, it is likely many studies will be done before a decision is made. - CNA<br><br>[/quote]<br><br>for eons they had been adamant - our current PM had even said tt as long as he is in power, no casinos wil be built in singapore.<br><br>i certainly hope they haf done or are going to do extensive studies, and thinking, into this, b4 committing.<br><br>yes the economic boost may seem attractive. but there r likely to be negative consequences.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes gambling is a vice..<br>but 4d toto big sweep, soccer betting all these are also gambling. in a small way, this vice has been allowed.. to some extent, some even treat the stock markets as some form of a gamble..and from the queues of toto its quite evident that many cannot stand this temptation.. addiction to any vice makes it worse.<br><br>all vices are unhealthy, and gambling away the money that one has worked hard for the day instead of using it to feed those who depends on you is a waste. opening an avenue where singaporeans can go gamble is definitely no no.. personally i think i wont go or find ways to circumvent any "blockades" they may put in place to "bar" or discourage locals.<br><br>govt says they opening up this for the rich.. distribution of wealth? or paving a way to further ministerial pay rise? depends a lot on the future. for the good of singaporeans, i really hope they really put some very good measures to prevent locals from going there. and for the even greater good, i hope they distribute some of the returns to the poor in one way or another.<br><br>on a personal note maybe we all can try our best to discourage those who go or will want to go.. i.e. those we know who cant fight such an addiction.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm probably going to get flamed for this, but my vote has to be 'YES'.<br><br>And why not? We can't, and shouldn't, nursemaid people forever. The choice of whether or not to gamble is a personal decision which should be the individual's prerogative. I don't like gambling myself, but I don't think a ban is the way to go, especially since all we're doing is driving the industry underground, and driving people to those huge casino cruise ships that ply international waters. Personally, I don't think the ban is doing much good at all.<br><br>I have only ONE CONDITION if casinos are to be introduced into Singapore: severely restrict the amount and type of advertising put out by these casinos. Casinos should not be allowed to advertise themselves on television; whatever ads they publish should be restricted to print media, and the size and frequency of those ads should be seriously limited. The content of the ads should also be closely scrutinised to screen out any misleading information and / or representations. The rationale for such restrictions? I don't believe that we can effectively stop people from gambling if they really want to, but what we can do is limit the ability of the gambling industry to suck more people into the cycle of vice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The idea of having a casino in Singapore is everything that evidences a bad idea and nothing that resembles a good idea.<br><br>While the allure of profit money Â– and we are talking about a mass sum of them in here Â– is indeed a temptation that is difficult to resist, the cost of clearing up the aftermaths of the mess that will be created from the ills of gambling promotion will be a mistake of astronomical scale that the government and people will soon find themselves to be left facing with.<br><br>The negative side efforts from the setting up of a casino be it on Sentosa, another southern island, or even in the territorial seas of Singapore onboard any vessel are deep in impact and long enduring in influence.<br><br>One thing for sure, the devastation on Singapore and its population from such ill aftermath will definitely go beyond the seemingly common worry such as :<br><br>A. Having compulsive gamblers or housewives frequenting the casino with little knowledge or control of their dispensable income,<br><br>B. Giving other complementary vice organizations such as loan sharks a chance to spring to life anew through the creation of a concentrated Â‘CBDÂ’ for all their illegal nonsense, and<br><br>C. The conflict and irony of a previously firmly held position on suppression and non-encouragement of any gambling activities vs the present day decision to proceed.<br><br>No.<br><br>The aftermath and social ills of having a casino within Singapore will to be more severe and serious than just the mere three points briefly listed above.<br><br>What we will have on hand to clean up, assuming that the planned casino is to really go thru, will be:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1.The allure and open invitational signal for Illegal Funds to enter Singapore.</span></strong><br><br>It is already knowledge to the Ministry of Finance, the MAS, SGX and the major banks in Singapore that the activity of money laundering is still taking place to some extend within the local scenario.<br><br>Even with the current stringent checks on suspicious monetary transactions from i) suspicious sources and ii) unaccountable and material sums, the legal net in Singapore like those in overseas countries, still have a number of loopholes that money launderers are capable and able of exploiting.<br><br>Now, the complex operational nature of casinos has been a well known mechanism for such sums of illegal monies to be washed clean.<br><br>Given the typical operational characteristic of having huge sum of monies going in and coming out from the visitors of a casino every single day, it is totally impossible to implement any form of audit on the source of such funds at any reasonable effective or efficient level.<br><br>Under such circumstances, what this means is that a so-called Â‘High EndÂ’ casino patron from any part of the world would be able to just walk in simply into the casino, change a deck of USD250000 that had been Â‘earnedÂ’ just 5 flight hours away in another from a drug or arms deal into a bucket of casino chips, go on a Â‘losingÂ’ spree of maybe about USD50000 in ten minutes, and then walk back sighing to the counter to have the remaining USD200000 chips in value exchanged back into clean bills or clean cheque out of the casino and towards the bank.<br><br>If one of them could do just that, just think of the 5 others in collaboration with this criminal and how easy it would have been for anyone with <strong>similar criminal intentions to come forth into Singapore</strong>, and to easily get their stinking god damned money washed clean from a legal and untainted source.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.The erosion of true economic status and statistics as a result of residue Black Funds invested in Singapore</span></strong><br><br>Now going one step further to continue with the above point, we assume that the mastermind behind the planning of the earlier money laundering episode (heinafter referred to as Â‘JimmyÂ’), decides to transfer only some portion of his newly Â‘washedÂ’ money out of Singapore.<br><br>Maybe somewhere along the line after Jimmy has had successful and unobstructing managed to a few millions dollars of Euro or Green Back was cleaned in Singapore, he might just decide to invest in some local landed properties.<br><br>But investing by himself wasnÂ’t fun.<br><br>So Jimmy rang up a few other friends working in the same line as he is, and as equally excited by the prospect and profitability of how Singapore is now unknowingly offering them a red carpet to dump in their bloody money for investments, these boys (JimmyÂ’s friends) then come straight in into the local economic picture with their organizational resources and pumped in whatever shi.t they can throw in into our private property market, stocks, shares, futures, gold and whatever you have.<br><br>And while the big boys go about on their crazy purchasing spree, back on the firm ground, we see Singaporeans who have been working their life away, sink into greater dire straits as the following then takes place :<br><br>CPI rises from the official statistics that does not give us an accurate reading of the true economy anymore,;<br><br>The computed amount of disposable income per household would have risen and hence prompted possible decisions to revamp on current government grants or subsidizes,<br><br>Financial statistics will show and read that the economy has been booming at a steady and rosy pace, leading possible actions by utilities, public transport and other fundamental amenities/infrastructure providers to give themselves yet another wonderful excuse to milk cream from stones.<br><br>On our openly accessible stocks exchange and funds board, local companies would also run a higher risk of falling into the danger of being introduced Â– undue influences (or even control in severe cases) from significant share ownership by any criminally involved entity. This puts to risks, the stability of locally built-up enterprises, with an unnecessary new source of threat in face with the already very competitive regional operating environment.<br><br>(Continue Below)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Disruption of Social Structure and Risk to Family Values</span></strong><br><br>Undeniably, the availably of a casino just a few MRT stops away from home is definitely going to send a few adventurous previously non-gambling individuals onto the casino tables.<br><br>Now with Genting Highlands Casino located just some six to eight hours drive away to Singapore, we already have a large number of citizens and residents flocking over across the causeway to proactively sink their hard earned money into a totally worthless and unconstructive economic activity.<br><br>The ironic question now is Â– Why are the authorities planning to do some that will bring such a valueless and unconstructive economic activity back onto the local scale after tremendous efforts had been made ever since independence to suppress and disencourage the gambling vice?<br><br>Is it truly economically benefiting to open up a source where gambling addictions can be nurtured and not suppressed and stopped?<br><br>Is it truly socially constructive Â– when couples, be them married or not, young or old, along with their basic family nucleus unit Â– be faced with this new challenge to handle the proper and healthy mindset of another family member, to recognize and maturely decide for themselves just how much they wish to become involved with this useless economic activity?<br><br>And last but not least, is this allowing, creating and promoting of vice associated activity under the excuse of bringing in more revenue into the country truly ethical?<br><br>Can I not then say that drugs or porn are also alternate avenues that can bring in lucrative sums of money and so we could also conveniently consider the legalization of these activities?<br><br>What rubbish.<br><br>Of course I canÂ’t.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Wrong signal send out to the Younger and Subsequent Generations</span></strong><br><br>In association with the negative clash sparked forth and affecting badly on the economical and social-cultural dimension, the other body bag that the authorities must be prepared to clear too, will be to clear up and explain themselves to the Younger and Subsequent Generations in Singapore, on just why the casino in Singapore on one hand Â– is being actively promoted across the world under the Â‘TourismÂ’ and Â‘RecreationalÂ’ shield, while similar mahjong or card game activities are also considered an evil vice crime when a few friends gather and play for an insignificant amount of cents in a non-casino setting.<br><br>Is it also true then, that the age old saying of Â‘Only Money makes the World goes RoundÂ’ holds more weight than morals, and that the future generation will be faultless when they rely on this same concept to gradually introduce in more Â‘profit-bringÂ’ activities into Singapore?<br><br>Geez. Maybe I would have to go back to school again then to check with my teachers.<br><br>Because the last time I remembered, the National pledge that I recited had the following lines in them :<br><br>Â“To build a democratic society,<br>Based on Justice and Equality,<br>So as to achieve Happiness, Prosperity,<br>And Progress for our Nation.Â”<br><br>And having broken families, distorted economic readings and vice promotion from the introduction a casino in SingaporeÂ…<br><br>These are certainly items which do not exactly go along and fit in well with my interpretation of Â‘HappinessÂ’, Â‘ProsperityÂ’, nor Â‘ProgressÂ’ for the Nation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quite suprised alot of 'no' answers.. personally, i dun really mind as to me, if a person doesnt like it, u dun have to go, no one is forcing you to.<br><br>however, the point that irks me most  is the fact that only the 'rich' can go... wtf.. imagine the irony that singaporeans have to go to other countries to use a 'facility' they have in their own backyard. Come on govt! we can take care of our own money thank u very much! it really makes me feel like the poor isn't good enough to be singaporean? is this helping towards us building a more cohesive society? it'll only make the social divide more distinct in the society..</div>
