              <p><span class="postbody"> What has he done during the whole of last two recessions. The economic
              restructuring committee has put up many recommendations including
              changing the education system to a broad-based knowledge applications
              system and promoting more pro-business environment. </span></p>
              <p>Have you noticed all ministers are keeping mum about the progress of this economic restructuring headed by LHL for many years. Why the silence or reticence of this whole ERC. Too afraid to report problems or lack of success in promoting the value-adding knowledge-based goals we suppose.<span class="postbody"><br> <br> It is clear that after years of trying to restructure the economy to a technology-driven value-adding model LKY still has not come up to GKS's standard in this area to produce the desired results.
              <br> <br>The world recovery in 2004 allows him to catch the wind again by quickly playing with property and IR
              this time. Nothing fundamentally has changed as there is a lack of progress in restructuring the economy. The only policy LKY knows is still one
              of throwing monies at foreigners and promoting foreign investments at the expense of the domestic sector.<br> <br> We need another heavy weight minister like Dr. Goh Keng
              Swee who understand how to go about promoting creativity and technology
              start-ups in a big way. </span></p>
              <p><span class="postbody">With such true talents we will go down again once the world goes into recessions.
              <br> <br>It will be too early to say LKY has succeeded in creating a more
              competitive economy or motivating the people to produce a more united
              country.</span></p>

              If you mean we have a government that is only interested in making monies through questionable and evil method like increasing GST even with the big surpluses of $6.5 bil in 2007 at people's expense you are still prepared to call it a successful government.
              
              If such a government has succeeded in building a country from such a evil method like taxing withholding spending, profiteering and hoarding monies at people's expense causing them to struggle to bear with all sorts of burdens we the citizens are successful. 
              
              Do you know the majority of citizens are hardly surviving you are still claiming are increasing GDP, or making billions in some unaccountable doubtful overseas investments are good for the people. Where is your sense of citizenship and loyalty to Singapore as claimed by you in asking people to support WP. You ought to make up your mind whether you are fighters for the people or for the ruling party in the guise of working for oppositions.

              I have the luxury to post my views in forums, does that make me poor or rich. I don't know. But I have my views about wrong doings as pointed out by this kind of taxing and profiteering system of governing. It is immoral and uncaring.

              <p>Kramnave,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just look at profiteering made by the government in low-cost public housing. How much is the average percentage of mortgage loan repayment over the disposable household income. In the old days any banker worth his salt will tell you it must not exceed 20% of one's disposable household income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, many people are losing their homes or forced to downgrade to smaller flats being unable to pay for basic housing over-charged by the government which keeps pushing up housing prices even though lands were acquired at dirt cheap prices to provide for low-cost public housing. If this is not profiteering then what is</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't forget the artificially pushed up costs of public transportation and utilities. According again to the expert bankers how much must such necessities form as percentage of disposable household income of say $800.00 - $1,200.00 pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When food and medical expenses are costed in how much are left for people's survival. No wonder in certain schools as much as 20-30 in a class are depending on school food vouchers to survive for lunch or breakfast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You might be well but spare a thought for the less fortunate like the families of this type of kids in schools.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do I need to say more?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Just look at profiteering made by the government in low-cost public housing. How much is the average percentage of mortgage loan repayment over the disposable household income. In the old days any banker worth his salt will tell you it must not exceed 20% of one's disposable household income.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, many people are losing their homes or forced to downgrade to smaller flats being unable to pay for basic housing over-charged by the government which keeps pushing up housing prices even though lands were acquired at dirt cheap prices to provide for low-cost public housing. If this is not profiteering then what is</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't forget the artificially pushed up costs of public transportation and utilities. According again to the expert bankers how much must such necessities form as percentage of disposable household income of say $800.00 - $1,200.00 pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When food and medical expenses are costed in how much are left for people's survival. No wonder in certain schools as much as 20-30 in a class are depending on school food vouchers to survive for lunch or breakfast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You might be well but spare a thought for the less fortunate like the families of this type of kids in schools.</p>

              <p>If you spent more time to look around you'd have realised that
              our finance industry has grown. Banks had across the years built a
              larger presence in private banking and operations. Commodity
              merchants have increased their presence and commodity arms of banks
              are building their presence. We are building oil rigs like never
              before and firms supplying materials are profiting like never
              before. Im sorry if you are worse off than before. Maybe if you
              spent less time spamming the same topics and be more productive,
              things can turn for the better.</p>

              <p>This is called an expansion of a sector largely done by foreigners since our local banks are inept as hell. Restructuring, as it is in the dictionary, means changing the structure. Fundamentally speaking, what the government has done for the last few years is encourage expansion of certain sectors and restructured the manufacturing sector. In truth, the economy in some sectors has shrunk, like Manufacturing. Pharmaceutical output would never match the kind of employment and money that electronics once did. I think last year might well be the last good year for a while as the slowdown in the US economy becomes apparent towards the end of the year. We haven't even factored in the rise in food prices yet.</p>
              <p>Also, our Gini coefficient, which is an important indicator, discarding any hand outs given by the government, hasn't improved substantially over the last decade either. That in many words say, the rich are getting richer, and the poor, either poorer, or stagnated. Whereas it is too far fetched to say "they are hardly surviving", I think it is fair to say a good portion of the population are just doing what they can to make ends meet, barely. Mind you, the income pyramid for this country has long bee a gentle one at the bottom, and steep at the top.</p>
