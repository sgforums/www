              <p>Thats why they are more stupid than Men!!!</p>
              <p>Many women might not agree with Shakespear's famous saying "Women are weak".But,i sort of agree with what this famous British saying.</p>
              <p>Women are weak not interm of physical n health,as a matter of fact,in health condition,they are far better than men n also endurance.But,they are weak in their mind n their way of doing things.And they are especially mean at times n tend to remember your "bad things" or "weak points" or "mistakes" n are more unforgiving than men.</p>
              <p>To sum it up,women are no angel at all.</p>
              <p>So i dont know why our fuking PAP government want to side them so much?Maybe LKY,LHL n GCT are more stupid than usual ppl n they like to wear panties instead of underwear.</p>
              <p>And who knows,they might have "periods" every month!!!</p>

              The rise in singles is good news. I personally advocate singlehood as an act of "civil disobedience" against the system which favour women in terms of divorce and everything else...no point fighting against the system who has their own sons already well protected whereas 90% of poor sons are to sacrifice to live up to that "ideal" image for women - it's just ain't worth it...if you do the cost-benefit analysis!
              
              If the system wants to be Number 1 in everything...why not be the first also to establish Men's Charter?  
              
              The system can blah out against all those who interferes with domestic affairs but become weak-lilies when women squint and just by squeezing the men from NS to living up to women expectations (the system really owes men a lot)...Another view is that the recent AWARE saga on how power is being usurped shows how such "gentle women" behaviour could also be repeated against the system itself in the future....we are paving the way towards "Singapore Empress Wu" who strangled her baby as a career move to get the throne...we should set up BEWARE to monitor on women's movements...haha

              To add on further, the way the system continues in favour of women will see greater rise in singles and, of course, divorces till the marital laws are amended. The fear of committment in men will increase exponentially. The system may do well economically, but failed terribly in social psychological development framework necessarily decisive if society sill wants men to lead.   
              
              The only retribution will come when today's women become mothers with sons....then they will see the pain and sorrows right before their very eyes how their own flesh and blood suffers under such system. 
              
              The curse of this all is credited back to J. S. Mill, the prominent British philosopher who failed to foresee his own gender suffers in the end. If I possess the effigy of Beatrice Webb, I would surely burn and stamp on it.
              
              Women may suffer emotionally from divorces, but men suffer both emotionally and financially. The system is responsible for the silent depression which is spiralling deeper in a society which, besides the system itself, but medias of all channels have become dominantly feminist as well.

              Politically, the system would need to furnish itself with the image of feminism, so as to ward off any adverse comments from world medias. At the mean time, domestically it would need the support of women votes against the opposition. Truly, the system is exploiting and allowing women to voice, and by supressing the male ego, that would make women feel more confident and happy, especially the feminists - without knowing the hatred of the modern women has become iconic in the hearts of many men. 
              
              This would lead to certain psychological abnormality growing in men (questioning his symbol of male identity and subconscious needs) - violence on women would thus continue and get worse through more cunning devices men could think of. 
              
              The ministers' sons are a protected 'white horse' group which are well blanketed since our NS days (you know it if you had served the NS...sure you have better food if you are his camp mate) - and a reason why NS has changed so much in favour of their sons when it is their turn to serve NS.

              Doris Lessing, Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, had commented (much against the unhappiness of the feminists) that British men has become ridiculously timid...
