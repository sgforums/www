              <p>But then again,this is what coffeeshop talk or other ppl speculated,which i believe there is certain truth in it.Well,afterall,we all do know the character of LKY n his son after all this years of their dictatorship ruling of Singapore.Dont we?</p>

              <p>Well, to be fair, TS did mentioned marry women and migrate, therefore no protection.</p>
              <p>The again, it's high time to do some amendments to the women charter. Unlike the past, women these day are not as naive and uneducated compared to the past.</p>
              <p>Women these days are educated, some are smarter than men and in some cases, more scheming than men.</p>
              <p>The outdated women's charter therefore become an ideal and formidable weapon if women have the right knowledge on manipulating it and you can't deny the possiblity.</p>

              <p>Well, to be fair, TS did mentioned marry women and migrate,

              <p>The again, it's high time to do some amendments to the women
              charter. Unlike the past, women these day are not as naive and

              <p>Women these days are educated, some are smarter than men and in

              formidable weapon if women have the right knowledge on manipulating

              <p>When migrate to western country, you have to abide by the law in THAT country. Then what is the difference between marrying SG or foreign and migrating elsewhere?</p>

              <p>that is what i mean... how could the Women's Charter has anything got to do with PAP?</p>
              <p>i do agree that the Women's Charter has to be reviewed frequently to be in sync with today's situation, however we still have quite a big number of older generation women in their mid 40s or 50s that has to be protected. of course if you meet a wife who is able to manipulate the law into her favour, i'll say you are f**ked then... too bad but again, why marry her?</p>
              <p>if you want to put PAP in the unfavourable light, use something more substantial like ERP increment, high unemployment rate or something else that both gender of Singaporeans can relate to. if you use something like the Women's Charter, you'll only get backlashed from our ladies...</p>
