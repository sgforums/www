              <p>Yah.. but is that not the man's fault.</p>
              <p>The foreign bride did not marry the man for love.</p>
              <p>So just because a man provides material and shelter , she is to love the man ?</p>
              <p>I don't think that's how love works.</p>
              <p>This kind of marriage is merely a transaction. The man provides the goods and the woman provides her body.</p>
              <p>A loveless marriage is doomed for failure from the beginning.</p>

              <p>What i am trying to say is,our law should be fair to both sex,both men n women.</p>
              <p>Lets say,if a man n a woman divorce,they should each take back their own money n property.Not all give to women.And then the children,it should let them decide who they want to follow,not women grab everything.</p>
              <p>If our law only take side on one party,it will only show our PAP is unjust n shallow ministers.No one will respect them.</p>

              <p>What i am trying to say is,our law should be fair to both sex,both men n women.</p>
              <p>Lets say,if a man n a woman divorce,they should each take back their own money n property.Not all give to women.And then the children,it should let them decide who they want to follow,not women grab everything.</p>
              <p>If our law only take side on one party,it will only show our PAP is unjust n shallow ministers.No one will respect them.</p>

              <p>the day the law is fair between men and women is when men starts getting pregnant.</p>
              <p>put it this way. before you got married your net worth is $500,000. you got married and later on in life, after kids and promotions your net worth is $5,000,000. your wife can claim that it is due to her existence and assistance that now you are worth so much... she is liable to claim half of your net worth...</p>
              <p>children? below 21, they have no say... end of story. if they are 21, they can even choose to follow Brad Pitt home, no one bothers.</p>
