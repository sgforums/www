              <p>Yah.. but is that not the man's fault.</p>
              <p>The foreign bride did not marry the man for love.</p>
              <p>So just because a man provides material and shelter , she is to love the man ?</p>
              <p>I don't think that's how love works.</p>
              <p>This kind of marriage is merely a transaction. The man provides the goods and the woman provides her body.</p>
              <p>A loveless marriage is doomed for failure from the beginning.</p>

              <p>What i am trying to say is,our law should be fair to both sex,both men n women.</p>
              <p>Lets say,if a man n a woman divorce,they should each take back their own money n property.Not all give to women.And then the children,it should let them decide who they want to follow,not women grab everything.</p>
              <p>If our law only take side on one party,it will only show our PAP is unjust n shallow ministers.No one will respect them.</p>

              <p>What i am trying to say is,our law should be fair to both sex,both men n women.</p>
              <p>Lets say,if a man n a woman divorce,they should each take back their own money n property.Not all give to women.And then the children,it should let them decide who they want to follow,not women grab everything.</p>
              <p>If our law only take side on one party,it will only show our PAP is unjust n shallow ministers.No one will respect them.</p>

              <p>put it this way. before you got married your net worth is $500,000. you got married and later on in life, after kids and promotions your net worth is $5,000,000. your wife can claim that it is due to her existence and assistance that now you are worth so much... she is liable to claim half of your net worth...</p>
              <p>children? below 21, they have no say... end of story. if they are 21, they can even choose to follow Brad Pitt home, no one bothers.</p>

              <p><br>no lah, we can live together, why need a certificate, that is just the laws, dun alway think we desire it, in states alone, there are milions of divorce per year without certificate and usually is the gal who find another man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And in singapore alone, 12,000 abortion was performed last year...</p>
