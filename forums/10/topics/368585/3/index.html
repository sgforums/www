              <p>&gt;.&gt; those examples are there to show that there is a need for the charter not as an excuse... the government would have considered lessons learnt from the world before creating such a law and most probably they extract it from British laws.</p>
              <p>besides I did not say anything about sacrificing the minority good men who suffers. I said it has to be practical to the culture in SG today... which part of that u dont understand?</p>
              <p>why not just wait for Novelltie to consult his lawyer on these issues..?</p>

If all cases are dealt with the same judgement then no need lawyers liao... then again, if you married a "money grabber" then frankly, too bad. what can you do? this is life, this is fate.</span></p>

              <p>If I put it in this way. There is no way to make it 0% percent crime free world. So we shall stop wasting tax payer money on police force.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">you want to be so "extreme", i also can't stop you. you don't want to be reasonable then what you want me to say? you say police force useless then useless lah... you don't want to pay tax then don't pay lah... who am i to stop you?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">next time you meet robbers or thief or you witness a crime, don't call 999. you go settle it like Bruce Lee cos' Police is useless what. you said it, i didn't.</span></p>
              <p>Is that what u try to mean in injustice divorce cases happening on men?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">i'm not preaching about Fate and Destiny but if you are that "unlucky" to experience it then there are 2 options.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">1) refuse to bow down to your fate and challenge it; get a lawyer and fight it out. if fail, try again, never give up!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">2) accept that this is your life and get over it.</span></p>
              <p>So if women marry the wrong men, it's yr fate. U deserve it. Am I right?<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;">if you married the wrong man; there are also 2 options:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">1) Divorce him and move along</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">2) Stick along and who knows? life might get better?</span></p>

              <p>It is proven in this age. Nobody will laugh at the guy who divorce the wife for adultery. It is the wife who shall be ashame of her wrong doing. The children will be educated its her/his mother fault to go out and fool with other guy.</p>

              <p>Why don't u go ask yr daddy first? U got a father
              right?</p>
              <p>This is regarding whether a guy will feel shameful for a
              admiting a wife wrongdoing and divorce her. Ask women for what?</p>
              <p>It is proven in this age. Nobody will laugh at the guy who
              divorce the wife for adultery. It is the wife who shall be ashame
              of her wrong doing. The children will be educated its her/his
              mother fault to go out and fool with other guy.</p>
              <p>Maybe in some places like India or backward country. But
              definitely not in sg, hongkong or taiwan...</p>

              <p>my friend recently asked her mother to divorce her father because she found out her dad was seeing another woman outside. she was fiddling through her dad's handphone when she stumbled upon some "disturbing" messages.</p>
              <p>my lawyer friend just got divorced because the wife was seeing another man. he was not asked to pay a single cent for alimony. it was simple and fast; all assets divided by 2 and it was done very quickly. forgot to mention; the wife's also a lawyer.</p>
              <p>what i'm putting here is an example is divorce is a very common topic among the younger generation. it is no longer a shameful event if either party commits adultery but rather a sad event. there isn't a "big difference" if it's the woman or man.</p>
              <p>if my guy friend comes to me and say, "bro, my wife is seeing another man" i won't go and say how incompetent he is to hold his marriage. i'll say "b*tch! divorce her... call my lawyer and he will do the arrangements".</p>

              <p><br>until she finds a job? hmm... sounds reasonable... i'm okay for that; i'm not heartless but let's give a timeline... you can't expect me to pay for 12 years until she finds a job? i will say maximum 6 months...</p>
              <p>that's why i agree with Zenden that the Women's Charter has to be reviewed and updated accordingly.</p>
