BCA says these have been a useful experience, and have given a better understanding of the process involved in reactivating a quarry. But although there is no need to begin quarrying for granite on Pulau Ubin for the time being, BCA says it is keeping all options open.<br><br>And the reactivation of local quarries remains a part of contingency plans to ensure resilience in the supply of essential construction materials. - CNA/ch </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am taken aback by this criticism from Indonesia.  Just how much of a democracy is the Indonesian state?  Indigenous groups wanting independence getting crushed by government troops?  Military figureheads dominating much of Indonesia's politics?  The greater &amp; more brutal lack of equality amongst citizens &amp; ethnicities?<br><br>Indonesia trying to give a lesson on democracy can be likened to Hitler giving a lesson on humanity.  Indonesia will not be a democratic nation for eons to come.</div>
