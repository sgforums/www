            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Lee very late in understanding changes in RI : legislator</strong><br><br>Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Senior Singaporean politician Lee Kuan Yew is very late in understanding the political changes that have happened in Indonesia, a legislator said.<br><br>"Lee`s statement that the Singapore government can conclude bilateral cooperation agreements, including the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA), only with the Indonesian government shows he is beginning to become senile," Andreas Pareira, a member of the House of Representatives (DPR)`s Commission I representing the Indonesian Democratic Party- Struggle (PDI-P), told ANTARA News here on Wednesday.<br><br>He said Lee Kuan Yew still regarded present-day Indonesia as being the Indonesia during the era of former president Soeharto who was his close friend.<br><br>"Wake up, Mr Lee. Present-day Indonesia is much more democratic and open than during the era when the two of you (Lee and Soeharto) could make bilateral agreements on your own on behalf of the two countries," Andreas said vehemently.<br><br>Hence, the young PDI-P politician said he would like to give Lee a political lesson on the new democratic era to Indonesia.<br><br>"The senior Singapore politician should know that in Indonesia now strategic decisions relating to the interest of many people can be made only with the approval of the House of Representatives which consists of political party members elected through elections that are possibly among the most democratic in the world," he said.<br><br>As to political democracy, according to Pareira, Singapore still needed to learn much, including from Indonesia.<br><br><a href="http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2007/7/26/lee-very-late-in-understanding-changes-in-ri--legislator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2007/7/26/lee-very-late-in-understanding-changes-in-ri--legislator/</a><br><br>wow, wtf? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
