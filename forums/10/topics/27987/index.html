            <div class='col-md body'>Considering the small size of Singapore's regular army, wouldn't it be difficult to project its power , say , over the causeway? It would need a fast , hard hitting battalion of troops being transported by air or sea. I believe that the guard's role fits this description. But the guards alone cannot hold the ground let alone take it. Wouldn't singapore need a larger troop formation for this sort of thing (eg. Marines)??<br><br>True, we have helicopters and 4 amphibious landing ships but i feel the regular infantry soldier should be transported in faster vehicles. The U.S. i believe are doing that now with they're formation of the new brigade combat teams. Do you think singapore should invest in armored wheeled vehicles for this purpose?? The new terrex 8x8 AV from STengg could fill this gap. The vehicle could help in peace keeping operations too... any comments??</div>

The amphibious bridages are mainly armed with AMX-10 vehicles which are fully amphibious. The air mobile bridage usually drop of from transport choppers like the Super Pumas and use vehicles like the LSV to get around places. They are almost like Singapore version of airborne troops - but much lighter. The amphibious ones are our Marines....</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Infantry vs Guards vs Commandos<br><br>I'll start with the easy one first: Commandos. Commandos perform special operations, with recce and raid missions being their specialities. For example, 4 man LRRPs (long range recce patrols) are dropped behind enemy lines and spend a few weeks running, hiding, eating the local wildlife and reporting on enemy movements before exfiltrating. Larger commando units might drop behind enemy lines, creep up to an enemy installation like a supply base, perform a lightning raid against the defenders, sabotage the place with explosives, then exfiltrate before the enemy counterattacks. Commandos do not fight en masse, but instead emphasize stealth and mobility to complete missions. This means that they are more lightly armed than infantry. They do not hold ground. They do not perform defence missions. They do not form part of the "main effort" of ground forces (i.e. they do not participate on the front lines) unless absolutely required.<br><br>Infantry can perform a wide variety of missions. However, the bread and butter missions for infantry are attack, defence and patrol missions. Infantry perform frontal attacks against enemy positions, particularly in areas like jungle or mountains where ONLY infantry can operate. Infantry dig in on objectives and defend them against attack. Infantry patrol territory in order to police and control it, or to detect and disrupt enemy actions, especially with ambushes. Infantry form part of the "main effort" of ground forces (along with Armor, Combat Engineers and Artillery, with support arms) and hold and push forward the front line. Infantry, more than any other combat arm, fight en masse and rely on main strength to complete missions. In the end, infantry win the war.<br><br>Guards (or Marines) are a cross between the two, in almost every way. They fight en masse like infantry, but they are not numerous. They are armed more heavily than commandos, but cannot stand up on the front line against enemy armor and massed infantry. They are more mobile than infantry, but not as mobile as commandos (they are helimobile and amphibious, but not airborne). Their role is to perform the missions that fall in between the two extremes I gave. An example would be a large raid behind enemy lines against a fortified objective. Another example would be reconnaisance-in-force (RIF), which is scouting the enemy by engaging him in a skirmish, seeing his response, then withdrawing. Yet another example would be fighting a "guerilla war" behind enemy lines, mounting ambushes all over the place and evading counterattack. The last example would be creating a beachhead and holding it until infantry arrive. It is a matter of debate whether Guards inherit the good points or the bad points of both infantry and commandos by being a jack of all trades.<br><br>Hope this clears things up.<br><br>PS: I am from infantry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I'm not wrong, Guards aren't airborne qualified. They are only heliborne.  And if SAF isn't lying, Guards are supposed to BE the ELITE of the infantry.  Usually fitter than the infantry counter-parts and more mobile.  Question is, WHO has the heavier armaments?  Guards or Infantry?  And if indeed the Guards are the elite of the infantry, why "CAN'T" they mount frontal assaults?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I did say that Guards are not airborne (read my post again). Infantry are more heavily armed in general, but I think our Guards have some toys that we don't.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  Guards CAN mount frontal assaults, but since there are only 2 battalions of Guards, they are not meant to. It would be like asking the USMC to fight a war when there is a perfectly good US Army.<br><br>About Guards being more elite than Infantry: As much as it pains me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  I have to admit this is true. They get better men and more resources. They are trained to do more. But in the end, they are still a side dish, while we are the main course. The war hinges on the fate of the Infantry and until one of our guys is dug in there it is not ours, no matter how many Guards LSVs drive over it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the Army already got good men around. What I think its lacking was the quality of our Navy servicemen, do you think we should enlarge or change the scope of what our Naval Divers to that of a SEAL? The US SEALs originated from their UDT in the past too, just like our NDU.<br>I am still unclear about wat our divers do.....<br>Do they just dispose underwater mines and explosives???<br>Since they are men of calibre, why not give them a bigger roles to play???</div>
