              <h1>MM Lee: Singapore will not become a “satellite” of China</h1>

              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">December 30, 2009</span></p>
              <span class="time">
              <p>In his latest public speech, Singapore’s “forecaster extraordinarie” MM Lee Kuan Yew predicted that China “may become an advanced world power in 50 years’ time.”</p>
              <p>He added that for Singapore to be an effective player on the world stage, it must retain its point of view, and not become a satellite of bigger economies like the US, Japan or China:</p>
              <p><em>“We are a little red dot but we are a special red dot. We are connected with the world, we play a special role. And we are not going to be in anybody’s pocket. And if we lose that status, we are meaningless. Because of our status as independent actors, independent observers of situation, when we say something, they say yes that is a Singapore point of view and very often a realistic point of view.”</em></p>
              <p>A former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee now jets around the world to dispense his “pearls of wisdom” to leaders of other countries. His last lecture was to the Japanese to emulate Singapore’s example and open its doors to immigration.</p>
              <p>Contrary to Lee’s claims, Singapore may have already become a satellite of China in another sense. The small island state has seen a relentless influx of foreigners in recent years especially from China.</p>
              <p>Mainland Chinese are allowed to come to Singapore to study, work and live with few restrictions. PRs and citizenships are given freely even to construction workers, cleaners and masseurs.</p>
              <p>As many of them are unable to speak English, the ruling party has generously offered free English language classes to them, courtesy of a $10 million Community Integration Fund sponsored fully by Singapore taxpayers to make the new citizens and PRs feel “welcomed” in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In a recent interview with the National Geographic magazine, Lee admitted that it is a “good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants” as they are more “hard-driving and hard-striving” than locals.</p>
              <p>Lee’s remarks sparked a massive outcry in cyberspace with many netizens condemning him for it, but was not reported by the mainstream media. A Facebook was even set up demanding him apologize to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>With China becoming more affluent and influential, it is doubtful if it will be interested to listen to Singapore’s “point of view” again, again and again in the future.</p>

              <p>Not satellite of China but satellite of U.S? Don't talk nonsense LKY. I know you are not chinese but please don't be a stooge of western powers against China. My forefathers are all from China. Please show some basic respect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>China is facing a tightening military circle</h2>
              <p> According
                      to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
                      released in Sweden last week, world military expenditures in 2008 rose
                      4 percent to a record $1.46 trillion despite the spreading economic
                      recession. And the United States remains the country with the highest
                      military expenditures in the world, accounting for 42 percent of the
                      world's total – more than the sum of the next 14 countries combined.</p>
              <p>Chinese must keep a clear head and understand how this money was
                      spent. The military “crescent encirclement” of China formed by the US
                      is expanding.</p>
              <p>In the South China Sea, it is reported that the US is seeking to
                      lease the military base in Vietnam's Cam Ranh Bay. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Once achieved, there
                      will be three US military bases in the region – the other two located
                      at Guam and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore's Changi. </span>The three bases form a triangular
                      encirclement of the South China Sea. The US already has two strategic
                      island chains in the Pacific, not including Cam Ranh Bay. Once the US
                      successfully leases it, the chain of islands will be enhanced.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>More importantly, compared with any Chinese naval base, the Cam Ranh
                      Bay base has more power to deploy forces to any island in the South
                      China Sea.</p>
              <p>And to the northwest, NATO is threatening, too. In May, it conducted
                      two military exercises in Georgia. Some international military critics
                      have claimed that these are not typical NATO exercises, since major
                      NATO countries like Germany, France and Italy did not participate,
                      while most participating countries were former Soviet Union republics
                      like Georgia and the Ukraine, and former Warsaw Pact countries like
                      Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
              <p>This indicates that NATO's eastward expansion has extended not only
                      to Russia, but also China. In addition, there is a “shadow of NATO,”
                      that is the long-existing US-Japan and US-South Korea military
                      alliances.</p>

              <p><strong> SAF joins anti-piracy patrol  </strong></p>
              <p>RSN will deploy a Landing Ship Tank (LST), with two Super Puma
                  Helicopters on board, and 200 personnel, as part of an international
                  flotilla that will patrol the waters off Somalia, a major flashpoint
                  where pirates have attacked more than 100 ships last year.</p>
              <p>For three months, the LST will work with the US-led Combined
                  Task Force 151 and other ships to escort the vessels that ply the
                  pirate-infested waterway everyday.</p>
