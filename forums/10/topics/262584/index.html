            <div class='col-md body'>blame the companies for raising costs and implementing an unviable system, not the drivers. they're merely trying to survive.<br><br>rather than doubling late night fares, they should instead halve late night rentals. this solves the problem of the drivers not earning enough to cover rentals unless having a double fare.<br><br>another is to hire the driver as a fixed-salary employee rather than a freelancing driver, and offer reasonable compensation for the work done, rather than give subsistence level wage like what was proposed some time back (which, ironically was announced some time after i posted a detailed proposal for fixed salary drivers online).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I don't think we can blame the taxi drivers so much as the system which forces them to resort to such practices if they are to survive. It's the system that has to be changed in order to improve the state of affairs. So in that sense more regulation is necessary, for the taxi companies, not the drivers themselves.</div>

High chance that they will be out of the city.</div>
