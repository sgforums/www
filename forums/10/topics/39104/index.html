            <div class='col-md body'>During the Vietnam War, the US had only the direct support of the armed forces from South Korea, Thailand, Philippines, and Australia.<br><br>in this current Operation Iraqi Freedom, although the US has the committed combat support of UK, and also combat troops contribution from Australia; there are more then FORTY countries that give their political and material support to the US-UK led Coalition Force. These FORTY odd countries have also voted in favor to most resolutions proposed by USA and UK at the United Nations Security Council, as well as at the UN General Assembly.<br><br>During the Vietnam War, North Vietnam had the unstinting support from Soviet Russia and Communist China.<br><br>In this Operation IRAQI Freedom, no country is providing any material support to IRAQ - except for political and ideological support from the Arab Public BUT not from the Arab Governments.<br><br>Vietnam War deja vu for the USA ?<br><br>Not likely, when the US Government has learned not to "MICRO-MANAGE" the military operations of the US Armed Forces.<br><br>The US Armed Forces have fought in Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Dessert Storm (or Gulf War ONE), with weapons that are compared to STAR WARs. Compared to what was available to the US Armed Forces during the Vietnam War, the weapons available today is even far superior to what was used in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Gulf War ONE.<br><br>So a repeat of the Vietnam War this time, it will not be - although the anti-War idealist may wish to make this out to be, so as to prove themselves correct.<br><br></div>

SCHOLAR<br>War with Iraq puts U.S. 'in a very dangerous situation'<br><br>James A. Miller is a cultural geographer at Clemson University. He specializes in the Middle East and has served as a foreign service officer in North Africa.<br><br>Q: -- What do you think the average person in the Middle East is saying about the war in Iraq?<br><br>A: -- What we now see very clearly in the Arab world, and the Middle East as a whole, is that the U.S. is seen as an invader with no justification to be in Iraq. It's all seen from a very different perspective from their side, and why wouldn't it be?<br><br>It's called civilization rallying. That's an extremely important fact. When we see our own troops in danger, we rally around them. As the French see it, we have an Anglo-Saxon rally going.<br><br>Q: -- Is there a significant split in opinion between the Sunni and Shiite Muslims within Iraq?<br><br>A: -- It's becoming less significant because they appear to be banding against us. Hussein has treated the Shi'a terribly and has done everything he can to favor Sunnis.<br><br>The Iraqis and Saddam Hussein have consistently tried to become a great power in the Middle East and he's won. This man looms as a hero for those on the other side.<br><br>Q: -- What do the leaders in the other Arab countries think about this war?<br><br>A: -- They don't like Iraqi regime .Â‘.Â‘. but they're very nervous. Someone like (Egyptian) President (Hosni) Murbarak, who's in a very precarious position, said "watch out, you're opening the gates of hell." And it's happening. If this war concluded quickly, the gates of hell will close. But we're digging in our heels, and I think it's very instructive to look at Vietnam. This looks like Vietnam in fast forward.<br><br>Q: -- Didn't some people predict that outcome when U.S. troops went into Afghanistan?<br><br>A: -- Afghanistan is isolated and it was in nobody's interest. Iraq is a lot different because of where it is on the map. I want people to realize that we need to get our justifications straight. If we don't, the gates of hell won't close. We're in a very dangerous situation.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>As told to Jeff Stensland<br><br><a href="http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/5510697.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/5510697.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Americans are crazy, to go in with so little forces. There's only about a Corp-size force there.

Give them a mechanised div in the south and Baghdad will have to be abondanded.<br><br>Can it become like vietnam? not likely. Who's gonna feed them?<br><br>I expect a bombed-out Baghdad, bloodly street-fighting, a dead Saddam, a quick american withdrawal after the war, a weak new government and maybe civil war if the UN can't get it's shit together. After that a new dictator. I'll be reading the history books 20 years from now to see if I'm rite.<br><br>Iraq was a country but not a nation until saddam came along. Like Isreal and Pakistan-India, this problem is a remant of the artificial countries created by the British.<br><br>The middle east and central asia has been warring since there has been recorded history. What makes anyone think that THEY can solve the problems?<br><br>Atobe, I still see men covered in mud carrying M-16s around. What's so different? With one exception, all the things that are done now could have been done by the US military of 1965 only they needed more men and helicopters and planes (which they had).<br><br>The exception is the capability of a/c to evade radar at middle and high altitude.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>21Alpha, while your observation of what is happening is correct, you will have to appreciate that to mobilize the 2 Corps strengths that USA had during Dessert Storm, it would have been impossible this time round as there is only one single staging area in Kuwait that is available to the USA Â– while there was the vast area of Saudi Arabia during Dessert Storm in 1991.<br><br>To overcome this limitation, the Central Command developed the Â“Rolling StartÂ” doctrine, where the full force will be developed in size, as the first group takes off.<br><br>After the Afghanistan campaign, USA had developed a new doctrine of using Special Forces coordinating air strikes, with the support of local insurgents (if any).<br><br>In any case, the vast uninhabited areas of Iraq are ideal ground for Special Force operations - similar to Afghanistan.<br><br>From the constant feed of updated news reports, the normal Iraqi Army are not putting much resistance during the early days. It would seemed that the recent days of resistance is probably a result of Saddam HusseinÂ’s <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Fedayeen </span></strong>terrorist squad threatening the regular soldiers, and even the local citizens to face death fighting the Coalition Forces, or face immediate execution by their hands.<br><br>In a terrorized Iraqi environment, donÂ’t count on the reliability of demonstrations by the Iraqi civilian population against the US-UK efforts, as shown regularly on TV. There would have been some guns pointing at the crowd hidden from the camera view.<br><br>In any war, as in any of our own SAF exercises, we would expect soldiers to Â“tough outÂ” the rough living conditions. Rain, mud, sun, heat Â– all that is part and parcel of a soldierÂ’s life in any country. It cannot be seen as upcoming defeat.<br><br>During the Vietnam War, many Field Commanders had to fight this war, with Â“one hand tied behind their backÂ”. Strategic targets that were outside the Vietnam Theatre were not to be attacked Â– especially in Cambodia, Laos and North Vietnam Â– right till the end of the Vietnam War.<br><br>The Politicians in Washington were MICRO-Managing the war in South Vietnam. They were determining and approving where, when and how the attack is to be made.<br><br>Read some of the books written from the Generals down to the most junior commanders, and you will understand the frustrations and disillusionment of the US soldiers towards the Vietnam War. The Anti-Vietnam War mood in US Civil Life, made matters worse for those who fought in that War.<br><br>It was those young officers, who served in the Vietnam War and learnt those lessons the hard way, and who were placed in the Leadership Positions in 1991 and led in Dessert Storm that prevented those same Vietnam War mistakes from being made.<br><br>Sorry to differ from your opinion about Iraq was not a nation until Saddam came along; but before Saddam, Iraq was a flourishing nation, and continued its reputation of being a cradle of civilization.<br><br>With Saddam, Iraq quickly deteriorated as a Nation, and became fragmented with his own kindreds from Takri competing with the Shiites in the South, and the Kurds in the north, and the other minorities polarized.<br><br>It was his way of ruling with a strong grip on the lives of Iraq, by his way of Â“divide and ruleÂ”. Any semblence of opposition, even within his inner circle, is immediately dispatched with.<br><br>The same was said about Afghanistan, and of many other Middle-eastern countries, yet we see some semblance of hope with the Younger Generations being educated and living in the West, and being exposed to the Liberal Freedom of the INDIVIDUAL Â– except that is some countries, the long established system remains intact and in the hands of the politically savvy.<br><br>Many Iraqis, who have fled Iraq, are waiting and looking forward to this change; and bear out hope for those whom they have left behind in Iraq.<br><br>However, this change in Iraq also holds many contradictory challenges to the established systems of Governments in the Middle East, as many of these Governments are no different from the ancient Feudal Systems found centuries ago.<br><br>The ball has been kicked now, and the intention is to score goals Â– UNLESS, world opinions forced the United Nations to act strongly to get USA and UK (and all its supporting coalition allies) to terminate all war activities in Iraq.<br><br>Is there sufficient POLITICAL force to ensure that this war activities be terminated?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh well... all these and all... but I really do feel that the UN is slowly becoming the League of Nations all over again. Nobody can ever come to a conclusion and those diplomats are just trying to take on the driver's seat but do not have the balls to do so.<br><br>In terms of security issues, the UN is lacking, but it is truly doing well in coordinating relief efforts and trying to reduce poverty and stuff. UN is handing out the bread, but is hesitant to use the rifle.<br><br>Vietnam War again? No way. The Americans had the wrong doctrine the whole time and it lasted for 11 years. A long war is a war already lost. The current war has only proceeded for less than two weeks and people are talking about Vietnam War again. They really don't know what they're talking about.</div>
