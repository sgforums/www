            <div class='col-md body'><br>China to censor text messages<br><br>By Louisa Lim<br>BBC, Beijing<br><br>China is expanding its censorship controls to cover text messages sent using mobile phones.<br>New regulations have been issued to allow mobile phone service providers to police and filter messages for pornographic or fraudulent content.<br><br>But analysts fear the real targets are political dissidents.<br><br>China's authorities are gradually tightening control over the spread of electronic information, particularly on the internet.<br><br>A Paris-based group, Reporters Without Borders, says the Chinese authorities are increasingly using new technology to control information.<br><br>It says one Chinese company marketing a system to monitor mobile phone text messages has announced it is watching for "false political rumours" and "reactionary remarks".<br><br>Venus Info Tech Ltd said in a press release that its surveillance system worked by filtering algorithms based on key words and combinations of key words.<br><br>Certain key words could trigger an automatic alert to the police.<br><br>Text threat<br><br>Text messaging has already threatened Beijing's control over information.<br><br>Last year, the authorities tried to hide the outbreak of the respiratory disease Sars.<br><br>But millions of text messages were sent, alerting people to the virus and exposing the government cover-up.<br><br>So far, the new regulations are only being used by one of the country's two mobile phone operators, China Mobile Corporation.<br><br>But it controls 65% of the mobile phone market, so these new rules will almost certainly become the industry standard.<br><br>Last year, Chinese people sent more than 220bn text messages, more than half of all messages sent in the world, according to China's Xinhua news agency.<br><br></div>
