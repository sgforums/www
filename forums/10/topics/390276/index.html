              <p><strong>Former Singapore Chief Statistician Paul Cheung: Singapore can still accommodate more people</strong></p>
              <p>During a speech made at the HDB’s 50th anniversary celebration last week, Singapore’s former Chief Statistician (1994 – 2001)  Dr Paul Cheung said that Singapore can still accommodate more people due to increase in per capita living space.</p>
              <p>Dr Cheung was born in Hong Kong and is now a Singapore citizen. He is currently a visiting consultant to China’s National Bureau of Statistics.</p>
              <p>He pointed out that the average number of people per household including maids is 3.5 and the number of extended families living under the same roof occupies only 7 per cent of the total population.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s demographics has changed radically due to the relentless influx of foreigners in recent years who now make up 36 per cent of the population.</p>
              <p>Dr Cheung opined that though the current supply of public housing is adequate to meet local demands, there is a need to make some adjustments to allow foreigners to have a place to live in as well.</p>
              <p>He suggested that HDB rent a few blocks of flats to private real estate companies to rent out to foreigners at a rate lower than that of condominiums.</p>
              <p>He quoted the example of New York where every block of high-rise flat has rental units to faciliate the moving in and out of foreigners.</p>
              <p>“Foreigners in Singapore face two extremes in the choice of their housing: it is either too expensive or cheap like workers’ dormitories. Not every foreigner can afford high-end private apartments like Ritz-Carlton Residences.”</p>
              <p>Dr Cheung failed to mention the fact that the apartments in New York mostly belong to the private housing sector while HDB flats are supposedly public housing built to cater for the housing needs of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, they are built by a government agency HDB which monopolizes the entire public housing market in Singapore, leaving Singaporeans with no other alternatives.</p>
              <p>He also jumped to the defence of the PAP’s pro-foreigner policy that foreigners help to prop up the prices of HDB resale flats thereby increasing the “asset value” of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>What was not mentioned is that the capital value of HDB flats can only be unlocked if the owners emigrate or downgrade to a cheaper flat.</p>
              <p>The sky-rocketing prices coupled with stagnant wages mean that Singaporeans will be plunged into greater debts financing their flats thereby leaving very little cash left for their retirement.</p>
              <p>Stung by rising frustration, resentment and anger on the ground at its liberal immigration policies, PAP leaders have backtracked in the last few days by reassuring Singaporeans that the inflow of foreigners will be slowed down.</p>

              <p><br>Can the Chief Statistician - who deals with numbers - be the qualified person to say if Singapore has space to accomodate more people ?</p>
              <p>How will the Chief Statistician factor in the intangibles such as the quality of life, the Standards of Living, the social and psychological impact of crowded living ?</p>
              <p>The type of living standard and comfort are some immediate aspects that are related to the individuals that will demand attention, and similarly as important will be the issues of social bonding of the new arrivals with the existing community.</p>
              <p>The existing community will need to demand from the government the clarification as to what "added value" can the new arrivals bring to Singapore that will allow existing "hard earned" infrastructures "to be shared".</p>
              <p>It is amazing that the PAP government is far less discriminating then Australia in the immigration policy, when Australia is far bigger than Singapore in land size.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 16pt; ">Australia tightens skilled migration rules</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
              <p><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1"><span style="color: #333333;">CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia tightened its migration rules yesterday in favor of English speakers and professionals, saying the country has been attracting too many hairdressers and cooks and too few doctors and engineers. </span></span></p>
              <p><span class="HeadLineNewsContent1">Immigration Minister, Chris Evans, blamed the overrepresentation of lower skilled immigrants on a system put in place by Prime Minister, John Howard, whose government lost power in 2007 elections. </span></p>
              <p>“Under the Howard government, we had a lot of cooks, a lot of hairdressers coming through,” Evans told reporters. “We were taking hairdressers from overseas in front of doctors and nurses — it didn't make any sense.”</p>
              <p>The new rules will favor applicants who already have job offers over those who merely have qualifications or who are studying. The measures are expected to dampen enrollment in Australian colleges by foreign students hoping to settle in the country.</p>
              <p>Numbers of foreign students enrolled in Australian colleges exploded in 2001, when the government changed migration rules to allow them to apply for permanent residency while studying. Until then, skilled workers had to apply offshore for visas to fill jobs from a list of more than 100 trades and professions that were suffering shortages in Australia.</p>
              <p>Australia continues to have a shortage of accountants, partly because many of the 40,000 accountants who immigrated in the past five years did not have the professional or language skills to find work, Evans said.</p>
              <p>“You've got to say if they don't have the English-language skills, don't have the trade skills and can't get a job, then really they should not be eligible for permanent residency,” Evans said.</p>
              <p>The new policy will favor applicants who score highly in an English language test. Moreover, immigrant numbers in certain jobs could be capped for the first time. The government has not identified which jobs.</p>
              <p>Because of the higher standards and a revised list of which skilled workers are in short supply, 20,000 visa applications will be scrapped and their application fees totaling A$14 million (US$12 million) refunded, he said.</p>
              <p>The new list will be made public mid-year and focus on high-skill professions.</p>
              <p>Foreign students enrolled in courses for professions that are cut from the list will be given 18 months after graduation to find work in their field, or will have to leave Australia.</p>
              <p>Evans conceded that the new rules would cost the education sector, which has rapidly grown into Australia's fourth largest export industry and reaps A$12 billion a year from foreign student fees. But he said high-quality universities would continue to prosper.</p>
              <p>Monash University social scientist, Andrew Markus, an expert on migration policy, said student enrollments would fall because more than 70 percent of foreign students in Australia planned to settle here permanently.</p>
              <p>Foreign student numbers in Australia have gone from 150,000 in 2002 to almost 400,000 last year, with India recently overtaking China as the largest source of applicants.</p>
              <p>Indians accounted for almost one in four foreign students in Australia last year, but Australian universities expect enrollments to fall 30 percent this year because of a spate of violent crimes against Indians in Melbourne, Australia's second largest city.</p>
