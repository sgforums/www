              <p>This speech reveal the brilliance of a matchstick in Singapore's PM.</p>
              <p>It shockingly revealed that in the course of preparing his May Day message in 2008, he did so without considering the stark warnings that were written on the walls in Washington D.C. that appeared as early as 2006 -</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,460044,00.html">“"Expect fallout, expect foreclosures, expect horror stories," California mortgage lender Paris Welch wrote to U.S. regulators in January 2006, about one year before the housing implosion cost her a job.”. </a></p>
              <p>What happened to the researchers and gatherers of intelligence and information that would have helped him get a better grasp of reality ?</p>
              <p>It seems that despite the writings on the walls, even his Old Man MM LKY and his grand dame at Temasek were all similarly wantonly ignoring the same signs that more astute investors would have given serious attention - and in the process lost US$100 BILLION from Singapore's Reserves.</p>
              <p>As early as <strong>March 2008</strong> - at least a whole month prior to PM's effort at preparing the May Day 2008 message - investment gurus such as Warren Buffet and those at the US National Association for Business Economics had warned that the -<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.infowars.net/articles/march2008/030308Recession.htm">"US Economy is in Recession". </a></p>
              <p>In the second paragraph of his speech - is there any use for the PM to give a summary of what has been the daily dose of economic gloom printed in the various broadcast and print media ?</p>
              <p>If Obama paid only an annual salary of US$500,000+ and can show decisiveness in seeking the US Congress to pump US$3 Trillion into the US economy in support of the banking sectors to the manufacturing sectors, and to rebuild the infrastructure of the USA - why is our S$3.5Million salaried PM less certain as to the outcome or direction of his economic recovery policies ?</p>
              <p>Compared to the US$3 Trillion Economic Recovery Plan proposed by Obama's Team - the Million Dollar salaried Ministers in the Singapore Cabinet could only think of petty program with an acronym "SPUR" to further drive Singaporeans like horses being moved forward by the sharp spurs on boots.</p>
              <p>After urging Singaporeans to move forward by the "SPUR" of their ministerial boots - they come up with another brilliant plan to create "Resilliance Package" to soothe Singaporeans, which will include "Job Credit Scheme" - in the usual PAP "big stick and small carrot" approach used since the 1960s.</p>
              <p>Can the Unions and Employers "create or save jobs by cutting costs" - instead of "cutting jobs to save costs" ?</p>
              <p>If we could reduce the million dollar wages from the entire Singapore Cabinet, the sum total of all the Ministers' Million Dollar Wages will go a long way to help many jobless Singaporeans to become entrepreneurs.</p>
              <p>The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yeocheowtong.com/Salaries.html">Total Annual Wages paid to 22 Ministers and 8 Minister of State amount to S$75Million  </a>- and this amount saved annually could be the seed money to help jobless Singaporeans to start new businesses. </p>
              <p>His efforts at making the speech is so painfully dismal - as seen in the opening three paragraphs of his May Day message - that it becomes a drag to read it entirely.</p>
              <p>PM LHL has a long lead time to fix his next May Day message for 2010 - and it will do him well to read the many signs written on the Singapore walls, if he cannot read those clear signs written in Washington D.C. in 2008.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p> <a class="contentpagetitle" href="/index.php/news/singapore/2313-sdps-may-day-message-time-to-help-our-workers">SDP's May Day message: Time to help our workers</a></p>
              <p> Thursday, 30 April 2009</p>
              <p>Over the last decade or so when Singapore experienced the so-called “golden period” described by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, Singaporean workers have not seen their conditions improve.<br><br>In fact statistics show that wages for the labour force, especially those in the lower income levels, have diminished. Between 1998 and 2003, the average household monthly income of the poorest 20 percent of the population decreased by nearly 15 percent while the richest quintile increased by 11.7 percent.</p>
              <p>In that same period, while the average wage dropped for the poorest 40 percent of households, their expenditure continued to outstrip their income.<br><br>These have contributed significantly to the widening income disparity in Singapore. Our Gini coefficient, an indicator of income inequality, resembles those of Third World countries.<br><br>Part of the problem is that the PAP Government continues to use cheap foreign labour to suppress wages in a bid to show that our economy is still making money.<br><br>There are, of course, a few ways that an economy can grow. One is that our workforce is innovative and intelligent, producing goods and services. The other is that wage levels are ruthlessly suppressed to give the illusion of healthy profit margins.<br><br>Needless to say, the second mode of economic “growth” is not viable nor sustainable. This is clearly demonstrated in surveys that show that among the various Asian societies, Singaporeans are most likely to have suffered depression, stress, and fatigue. <br><br>But even before our workers can share in the largesse of the boom years, they are now reeling from the devastating effects of the current global economic crisis.<br><br>While the going was good, workers did not share in the progress. Now that things have turned sour, workers are expected to bear the brunt by getting retrenched or having to suffer further wage cuts. Singaporean workers are in a lose-lose arrangement.<br><br>On this occasion of International Workers' Day, the Singapore Democrats repeat our call for the Government to cease its exploitation of our workers and to return to them the rights to freely organise themselves.<br><br>The National Trades Union Congress is a relic that serves neither the purpose of a labour union nor the interests of the workers. It is merely a tool of the PAP to continue the subjugation of workers and to buttress the power of the ruling party.<br><br>The Singapore Democrats repeat our call for a democratic and free labour union where workers are empowered and be free of economic enslavement. In doing so we will cultivate an economy that can compete on the world stage and not be at the constant mercy of an export-oriented economic model.<br><br>To urgently address some of the immediate problems faced by our workers, we repeat our calls:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>for a <em><strong>Singaporeans First Policy</strong></em> in which foreign workers will be retrenched first and Singaporeans laid off only as a last resort. In addition such a policy will require the Government and employers to employ foreigners only if locals cannot be found for the job. This will ensure that only qualified foreigners will be allowed into Singapore. </li>
              <li>to introduce <em><strong>Minimum Wage</strong></em> to ensure that employees be paid fair wages for their work commensurate with the cost of living. </li>
              <li>for <em><strong>Retrenchment Entitlements</strong></em> where the State pays all retrenched workers their salary for a limited period if and when they are retrenched. Such a scheme will provide workers a cushion when they are retrenched. </li>
              </ul>
