And who provided it? Prophet Muhammad or Allah? The verses?<br><br>For all I know, Quran itself supports it....<br><br>Quran 8:12 wrote:<br><br>Yusuf Ali: Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you: give firmness to the Believers: I will instil terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them."<br><br>Pickthal: When thy Lord inspired the angels, (saying): I am with you. So make those who believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger.<br><br>Shakir:When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.<br><br>Quran 47:4 wrote:<br><br>Yusuf Ali: Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens. Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in order to test you, some with others. But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds be lost.<br><br>Pickthal:: Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.<br><br>Shakir: So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite the necks until when you have overcome them, then make (them) prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favor or let them ransom (themselves) until the war terminates. That (shall be so); and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have exacted what is due from them, but that He may try some of you by means of others; and (as for) those who are slain in the way of Allah, He will by no means allow their deeds to perish.<br><br>All verses provided from <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/008.qmt.html#008.012" rel="nofollow">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/008.qmt.html#008.012</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>History is giddy with heads separated from their bodies.<br><br>However, thereÂ’s still a bunch of followers who still stick by the book to carry out the primitive methods of seperating the head from body in modern times.<br><br>It has to be the rewards. The attractive rewards for its followers comes in the form of a paradise package which  includes:<br><br>Â·	Seventy-Two virgins, who are ever-young, doe-eyed, shy, big-bosomed, and      who are ready to satisfy a manÂ’s wildest sexual-fantasies.<br>Â·	pure water, river, fountains and springs<br>Â·	River of wine. In paradise, the wine is not intoxicating and therefore not<br>sinful.<br><br>Today, there are much effective ways to execute man.
