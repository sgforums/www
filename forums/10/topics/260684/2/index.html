This research is conducted not only in English but also in native-language sourcesÂ—Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Tamil, and othersÂ—so that we can gather information not only from newspapers but also from products from the terrorist community. The terrorists are often quite proud of what they do in their local communities, and they produce albums and all kinds of other information that can be very helpful to understand suicide-terrorist attacks.<br><br>This wealth of information creates a new picture about what is motivating suicide terrorism. Islamic fundamentalism is not as closely associated with suicide terrorism as many people think. <span style="color: red;">The world leader in suicide terrorism is a group that you may not be familiar with: the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka.</span><br><br>This is a Marxist group, a completely secular group that draws from the Hindu families of the Tamil regions of the country. They invented the famous suicide vest for their suicide assassination of Rajiv Ghandi in May 1991. The <span style="color: brown;">Palestinians got the idea of the suicide vest from the Tamil Tigers.</span><br><br>TAC: So if Islamic fundamentalism is not necessarily a key variable behind these groups, what is?<br><br>RP: The central fact is that overwhelmingly <span style="color: red;">suicide-terrorist attacks are not driven by religion as much as they are by a clear strategic objective</span>: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland. From Lebanon to Sri Lanka to Chechnya to Kashmir to the West Bank, every major suicide-terrorist campaignÂ—over 95 percent of all the incidentsÂ—has had as its central objective to compel a democratic state to withdraw.<br></blockquote>So i hope you cna provide me with the relevant link for me to read.<br><br>Inshallah i shall be waiting</div>

This research is conducted not only in English but also in native-language sourcesÂ—Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, and Tamil, and othersÂ—so that we can gather information not only from newspapers but also from products from the terrorist community. The terrorists are often quite proud of what they do in their local communities, and they produce albums and all kinds of other information that can be very helpful to understand suicide-terrorist attacks.<br><br>This wealth of information creates a new picture about what is motivating suicide terrorism. Islamic fundamentalism is not as closely associated with suicide terrorism as many people think. <span style="color: red;">The world leader in suicide terrorism is a group that you may not be familiar with: the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka.</span><br><br>This is a Marxist group, a completely secular group that draws from the Hindu families of the Tamil regions of the country. They invented the famous suicide vest for their suicide assassination of Rajiv Ghandi in May 1991. The <span style="color: brown;">Palestinians got the idea of the suicide vest from the Tamil Tigers.</span><br><br>TAC: So if Islamic fundamentalism is not necessarily a key variable behind these groups, what is?<br><br>RP: The central fact is that overwhelmingly <span style="color: red;">suicide-terrorist attacks are not driven by religion as much as they are by a clear strategic objective</span>: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland. From Lebanon to Sri Lanka to Chechnya to Kashmir to the West Bank, every major suicide-terrorist campaignÂ—over 95 percent of all the incidentsÂ—has had as its central objective to compel a democratic state to withdraw. </span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So i hope you cna provide me with the relevant link for me to read.<br><br>Inshallah i shall be waiting<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Are you now attempting to move out of the <span style="font-style: italic;">'Islamic Teachings'</span> and move into the <span style="font-style: italic;">'World of Academia'</span> to justify the violent acts of <span style="font-style: italic;">'Suicide Bombings'</span> ?<br><br>You should be ashamed of yourself by making such a comparison, as the Tamil Tigers did not need any <span style="font-style: italic;">'Religious Cover'</span> for their violent acts of terror.<br><br>The Tamil Tigers were <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">more honest</span></strong> with their ultimate acts of <span style="font-style: italic;">Self-Sacrifice</span> for the sake of their <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Political Agenda</strong></span> without having to cast any blemish on their <span style="font-style: italic;">'Hindu Religion'</span>.<br><br>There were no promises of <span style="font-style: italic;">''7 virgins waiting for them in Heaven for their ultimate acts of Self-Sacrifice''</span>.<br><br>All those who sacrificed themselves for their <span style="font-style: italic;">Political Cause</span> were not misled with such <span style="font-style: italic;">'weak human temptations for the 7 waiting virgins'</span> - they died for their personal political conviction for a Free Tamil State in Sri Lanka - misguided as it is by the personal political agenda of the Tamil Tiger Leadership.<br></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....this is just my opinion...<br><br>I think all religions are good.....<br><br>However in some conflicts, there are some people who involve religion....This is where some religious teachings got tweaked to embolster the morale of the fighters, and that's why some religions become having a bad image as a result......because religions are supposedly teaching good stuff, and so people are shocked and disappointed when they see religion being involved in a conflict.<br><br>I think alot of conflicts in the world are actually nationalistic/ territorial, and to a certain extent, ethnic strife.<br><br>Perhaps during those difficult times, the people refer to their religion for inner strength, and also to mobilize and embolster the morale of the people.<br><br>During the conflicts, atrocities happen, and since there was wide religious reference in those times, some of the atrocities are commited in the name of religion. This further tarnish the image of religion. It is totally opposite of what religions are supposed to be. Peaceful, good.<br><br>I think basically the problem lies in....mixing religion with nationalism.<br><br>War is war.....people shouldnt mix it with religion. Religion should not be used as a banner. Use some other banners, whether ethnic or something else. If there is a problem which is nationalistic/ territorial/ ethnic in nature, then fine, use those, but dont bring up religion.<br><br>For instance.....when one group of people are fighting another group of people with different religion......sometimes there are leaders who will say.....it is a religious duty to kill enemies, or it is holy, those kinds of religious aspects. But when fighting groups who are of the same religion, then the leaders will say other things, they will talk about lands, about ethnicity. So what does this mean??? Basically religion is being inappropriately used as a banner in an otherwise nationalistic/ territorial/ ethnic conflict.<br><br>It is very unfortunate and it causes alot of confusion in this world.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I realize that Muslims often oppose people who quote the offensive verses of the Quran  with Â‘out of contextÂ’ arguments.<br><br>So hereÂ’s small hint from an Arab in understanding Islam.<br><br>Understanding the concept of abrogation is very important in order to understand Islam. Within the Qur'an itself are statements which contradict others. For example, one person quotes this verse :<br><br>"the only permissible war (in the Koran) is one of self-defense. Muslims may not begin hostilities (2:190)."<br><br>Another person quote verses from the Qur'an like: "Let there be no compulsion in religion" (2:256)<br><br>Theis verse seem to say clearly enough that the Qur'an teaches a peaceful response to those who oppose Islam.<br><br>But there are other verses in the Qur'an which say quite the opposite.<br>For example:<br><br>" But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most MercifulÂ”(9.5)<br><br>How to solve this conflict? and which verse should the Muslims follow?<br>HereÂ’s a brief explanation.<br><br>There is a concept called "Abrogation" in the Quran , and that is: The Quran was (supposedly) revealed to Muhammad in a sequence of events, the latter verses supercede and nullifies the earlier verses.<br><br>Out of the whole Quran, there are 124 verses that teach some tolerence towards non-Muslims...but here is the striking fact....all of these verses are void, and were abrogated by the last verse (supposedly) revealed upon Muhammad, and that is verse 9:5 (listed above)<br><br>Jalaluddin Suyuti (One of the most respected authorities in Islam) in his book "Istenbat al tanzeel" says: "Every thing in the Qur'an about forgiveness is abrogated by verse 9:5."(listed above)<br><br>Al-Shawkani in his book "Alsaylu Jarar" (4:518-519) says: "Islam is unanimous about fighting the unbelievers and forcing them to Islam or submitting and paying Jiziah (special tax paid only by Christians or Jews) or being killed. [The verses] about forgiving them are abrogated unanimously by the obligation of fighting in any case."<br><br>Finally here is what Muhammad the prophet of Islam himself said:<br><br>Ibn Haban in his Sahih, vol. 14, p. 529, narrates: Muhammad said: "I swear by Him who has my soul in his hands, I was sent to you with nothing but slaughter."<br></div>

I did not support the Iraq war at all for that matter, I took part in a protest against it in Australia. And on a personal level , I oppose the occupation of Palestine by Israelis.<br><br>I don't think what you are doing here is helping. Those certain people who felt misguided and went towards violence are using your religion to shield their own wrong doings.  You should be concentrating on doing something in the muslim community to prevent such misguidance.<br><br>Those who would be interested in learning your faith will probably go to a muslim forum in sgforum , I think it is minaret or something. Do it there.<br><br>Don't mix politics with religion - it gets very messy.</div>
