Understanding doesn't spring from a single verse taken in isolation, and it is intellectually lazy to confuse temporal verses with timelessness of other verses. You don't know anything near about Fiqh just like the nutty muslims and I hate it when you speak with an air of authority.<br><br>Only the anti-muslim bigots quotes those from Jalaluddin Suyuti and Al-Shawkani or the dumb hadiths to defend their proofs. If you want to know where those jihadists actually pull their nutty ideas from, it was mostly from the likes of Sayyid Qutb, a man of the 20th century. Bah.<br><br>I've seen and read that verse so many times. The pagans were given a time-honored period of four months to make peace after a violation of the peace treaty. They were attacking the muslims and driving them out of their homelands. How about posting the very next verse?<br><br>9:6 "And if any of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God seeks thy protection, grant him protection, so that he might [be able to] hear the word of God [from thee]; and thereupon convey him to a place where he can feel secure: this, because they [may be] people who [sin only because they] do not know."<br><br>The Quran almost always follows up with things like "If they desist, then all hostility shall cease."<br><br>The expression from 9:5,"if they repent, and take to prayer [lit., "establish prayer"] and render the purifying dues (zakah)" is no more than one, and by no means the only, way of their "desisting from hostility".<br><br>The timeless verses such as, "Let there be no compulsion in religion" still stands, forever.<br><br>Mancha: Lol.<br>Zulkiflim: It is easier really if you'd already say you do condemn terrorism, the killing of innocents and you support freedom of religion with no "but" clauses.</div></blockquote>Stop monkey around, Gauze. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>This is another tactic used by Muslims: calling them Fanatics or self radicalizing muslims.<br><br>You insist that the unbelievers had breached the treaty. There are others who view that the Muslims had breached the treaty.<br><br>I've provided the sources of the proof text in my post. You can do a yourself a favour by producing an Enlish translation of the treaty to support your claim and also for our reference.<br><br>It's the Treaty of Hudaybiyya. I googled hard by I couldn't find it.<br></div>

There was no battle, of course there was no casualty.<br><br>So thereÂ’s no point in going on since you insists itÂ’s not the treaty of Hudaybiyyah.<br></div>
