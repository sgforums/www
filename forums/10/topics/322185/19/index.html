                  You tried to tell us that real disposable income is a more reliable
                  indicator than GDP per capita (PPP) without understanding how GDP is
                  calculated, and when challenged, is not able to use it to prove

              <p>And btw, Singapore per capita GDP in 2007 is S$52994, not
                      S$49700 and in 2007, petrol price is still below S$2 per L</p>

              <p>If petrol price / per capita GDP is a good indication of

              <p>Before you made the above statement have you ever ask yourself
                      if GDP is a reliablie indicator to make that conclusion? Have
                      you consider using real disposable income as comparison?</p>
              <p>Plus, have you also consider the average miles an average driver
                      have to travel in luxembourg as compared to Singapore?</p>
              <p>Conclusion? More like half fuck anaylsis good enough for the

              <p>According to <strong>January 1, 2005</strong> estimates by the<em> Oil and Gas Journal, </em>Taiwan's proven oil reserves are approximately <strong>4 million barrels</strong>. Total oil production for 2005 is expected to be <strong>8,404 bbl/d</strong>, of which 800 bbl/d is crude. Oil consumption for 2005 is estimated at 1,045,000 bbl/d. The majority of the oil is consumed by the industrial sector. Most of Taiwan's crude oil imports come from the Persian Gulf, though West African countries also are important suppliers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to <span style="font-style: italic;">Oil and Gas Journal (OGJ)</span>, Taiwan had <strong>2.4 million barrels</strong> of proven oil reserves in <strong>January 2006</strong>. During the first half of 2006, Taiwan produced 7,910 barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil, of which only 800 bbl/d was crude oil. Almost 90 percent of Taiwan’s oil production comes in the form of refinery gain, resulting from the country’s large petroleum refining sector. EIA forecasts that Taiwan will consume 973,000 bbl/d of oil in 2006, virtually all of which will come from imports.</p>

              <p><br>About the SG$1.50 per liter?</p>
              <p>The price should be more like SG$1.90 per liter under normal market conditions, the SG$1.50 was subsidised. Whereas the SG$1.50 per litre for Taiwan is slightly subsidised, it should be in the range of SG$1.80 to SG$1.90, because currently the government taxes $0.44 per litre, current prices in Singapore are around SG$2.30.</p>

              <p>More importantly, maybe you should enlighten us as to why Taiwan has cheaper petrol prices?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your article is outdated like the gas prices earlier. From January 2005 the oil reserves of 4 million has dropped by 1.6 million barrels to 2.4 million barrels in January 2006.</p>
              <p>It's not June 2008. Maybe you can post updated information.</p>
              <p>The KMT caucus leader has already stated that Taiwan has no more oil reserves. Something which you fail to provide an explanation for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to <strong>January 1, 2005</strong> estimates by the <em>Oil and Gas Journal,</em> Taiwan's proven oil reserves are approximately <strong>4 million barrels</strong>. Total oil production for 2005 is expected to be <strong>8,404 bbl/d</strong>, of which 800 bbl/d is crude. Oil consumption for 2005 is estimated at 1,045,000 bbl/d. The majority of the oil is consumed by the industrial sector. Most of Taiwan's crude oil imports come from the Persian Gulf, though West African countries also are important suppliers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to <span style="font-style: italic;">Oil and Gas Journal (OGJ)</span>, Taiwan had <strong>2.4 million barrels</strong> of proven oil reserves in <strong>January 2006</strong>. During the first half of 2006, Taiwan produced 7,910 barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil, of which only 800 bbl/d was crude oil. Almost 90 percent of Taiwan’s oil production comes in the form of refinery gain, resulting from the country’s large petroleum refining sector. EIA forecasts that Taiwan will consume 973,000 bbl/d of oil in 2006, virtually all of which will come from imports.</p>
