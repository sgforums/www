              <p><br>Australia leasing out their mines to public listed companies is alot like Singapore selling out land to overseas investors. The only difference is Australia (like what you claim, uses it to subsidise her citizens), whereas we use the sale of land to increase their reserves. Even with the behest of an economic oil crisis, the government failed to use those sale of land or reserves to help her citizens through difficult times.

              <p>What a stubborn nutcase you are, still hanging on to your crap of leasing when it is royalties, ROYALTIES! idiot!. and it was $2 billion alone in 2007. You know how much that is? A hell lotta money with no end in sight with their huge reserves to spend.</p>
              <p>And then you twist it now,in this post, that our govt didnt spend a dime to help the People. We have no ROYALTIES and yet, our society had came up with whatever we could scrap to help. You are certainly not a Singaporean if you don't even know what was done to help. Do your own homework if you are a true singaporean with a conscience.</p>

              <p>You are obdurate in your stupidity. And don't hope now to switch to Taiwan from Australia to support you low intellect as you did when i prove your HK theory flawed. If you don't even know how the royalties came about, then you know nothing enough to bring Australia to subject your arguments. Those royalties come from mineral and petroleum mining corps.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Can we say the same for spore?</span> NO, cause we have NO natural resources. Who cares how much Aus petrol is subsidised? we in spore don't use aus pumps.</p>
              <p>The issue that you are evading pertains to your illusion that australians have an easier life, after taxes still have much money and free care and my answer to you is that of course they can, simply because they can afford to - with unending natural resource royalties, high taxes and 10%GST and other revenues. <strong>How can you use Aus to compare with us - a continent against an island. Aren't you plainly stupid or what?<br></strong></p>

                                      excuses for <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">everything</span>? Good
                                      for you, maybe you will find someone who pays you for that, but for
                                      the time being, your attitude is yet another sign that you are
                                      simply living in a fantasy world.</p>

              <p>Let's see</p>
              <p>Quite a few forumers questioned you on it. Your questions can be answered by anyone, not necessarily by me. This is the thread you started; you should be the one who is defending your stand because you opened it to the floor.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you are just an attention seeking troll.</p>
              <p>Hereby, I challenge you to come up with sensible questions (which I'm pretty sure is damn hard for you). Talk so much about having questions, but you failed to put any out. Are you all talk and no substance, and still living in denial, as per the points you your 7 signs of living in denial thread?</p>
              <p>It's obvious. A sensible person with a good question would not ask</p>

              <p>A
                  sensible person would post out for the greater benefit, and expect
                  questions and comments from everyone. Only attention seeking trolls do
                  such things like what you are doing, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consistently whining</span> like
                  a spoilt (and autistic) kid just because I do not want to reply your
                  childish question about being ready. Have a good question? Just post out for everyone here to see and comment. Whine
                  so much for what?</p>
              <p>So, what questions do you have for the post about petrol in Luxembourg being more affordable to its people than petrol in Singapore to Singaporeans? Do ask if you cannot understand it as fast as everyone else here. Remember to be sensible and not to ask questions that contradicts your previous postings hor</p>
