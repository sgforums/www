              <p>there is no distinct advantage of knowing tt your bus will
              arrive @5.30pm today at a designated bus-stop at 9am yesterday

              <p>Because in Germany, you might want to travel far and long without being able to use the internet</p>
              <p>So you plan your trip for today, and you also get to plan it for the day you plan to return home, without ever needing to check again. You can even know when you will reach home, so that you can be in time for your next programme.</p>
              <p>Of course for a 9-5 work commute, you wouldn't check; you would have most likely memorized or know the timings of the buses you take home. In this case, there's no need for things like Iris at all; the bus arrives at the exact same time everyday.</p>

              <p>Taiwan does not produce oil.</p>
              <p>Canada need to import oil because their oil reserves are mixed with sand and other materials etc. It is very expensive to extract fuel oil in such reserves. However with such rocket-high oil prices, the Canadians are starting to assess way to drill for their own oil reserves.</p>

              <p>You should know how infrequent their train arrives late if you have been there. Why don't you compare the late buses or the infrequent times our MRT has stopped service in some stations? In addition, it is your own lazy self if you did not check whether you have to reserve your seat. Fancy taking infrequent situations to prove a point. Why are you not doing that with PAP? Furthermore, the best comparisons to MRT in Singapore is not the trains that you have to reserve your seats, but rather, the U-bahn; this shows how little you know about their system. Just go and check if you will ever be not able to board the U-bahn at any time. Compare that to Singapore NEL, you might not even get into the train at Boon Keng station at 8 in the morning.</p>
              <p>Even nearer home, someone in this forum has posted a rail network for one of Japan's cities. The MRT network in Singapore pales greatly in comparison to Frankfurt, Munich, Paris, and that city in Japan. Remember, this is not talking about regional or inter city trains.</p>
              <p>There is never a real need to take taxi because the buses and U-bahn are extremely efficient. You will always know when the bus or train is coming. If you missed it, it's your fault for being late. Sure, taxis are expensive; one drive from Frankfurt airport to Darmstadt Uni cost around 50 euros (town to town). But you can compare to Sg taxis, which cost you 14 bucks (non-peak hour) from around Bendemeer road to Yishun Safra (consider the much shorter distance).</p>
              <p>And who told you they prefer to drive? Where you get your info from?<br>You should also know that it is extremely cheap to own cars there.<br>Petrol <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with respect to earnings</span> are cheap. There is also no COE.</p>

              <p>To be objective, yes, the public transport is still in its infancy in Singapore. The next 25 years remains to be seen. Singapore definitely has the potential; I'm not denying.</p>
              <p>Which still means one thing: It is definitely not one of the best in the world at the moment. That's the point I'm driving into the head of that froggy troll who is still in self-denial.</p>

              <p><br>Oil like gold has a universal market price, the only reason why the market price of petrol is different from Singapore is because the government here taxes $0.40 per litre. Brings back previous arguments where you said there was no universal market price for pork. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If gold or petrol has different price, it will encourage arbitrage activities to occur within borders, like Singaporeans or Thais going to Malaysia to fill up their petrol.</p>
