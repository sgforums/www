              <p>just found this out:</p>
              <p>Luxembourg GDP per Capita (PPP) is $80500<br>Their unleaded petrol price is 1.296 Euros, which is around 2.03955 USD from XE.com</p>

              <p>Neither is Luxembourg's price of petrol in 2007. It's only reasonable and sensible to compare the more current prices. And it is obvious you have totally no idea what is meant by purchasing power parity (PPP) with your above statement. Go read up before making yourself look even more stupid.</p>

              <p>Maurizio, we have read what you have posted and I dont think there is any need for you to bring this up because the two country in concern doesnt qualify to be a non oil producing developed country.</p>
              <p>1) Taiwan do produce their own oil from their own oil field</p>
              <p>2) Thailand is not a developed country</p>
              <p>Btw, what do you think of the flying frog method of comparing petrol affordability? Would like to hear what you have to say.</p>

              <p>ya la ya la. Act stupid somemore. The more you post, the more mistakes you make, which you have silently avoided. I guess I need not point out those which you have already silently avoided because they already showcase your stupidity and incoherent brain very clearly. If I made any mistakes, I will point it out myself even if no one else does it. So does Maurizio. For you, ya la, you will think you are always right (signs of self-denial).</p>
              <p>You don't even understand what was said and what you have posted. Which part of my statements did I even discredit wiki or say that the information is flawed? Don't put words into my mouth (as usual).</p>
              <p>You keep sounding and posting like you have that many questions to stun the world, yet when challenged, this is all you can give. Come on, you sounded so confident before this.</p>
              <p>And you are still acting like a spoilt brat. Just because Maurizio didn't answer you, you have to keep jumping up and down just to make him reply you. Aren't you just attention seeking? My comments were directed at you, not him; he has no obligations to answer any of your childish questions.</p>
              <p>It seems extremely clear that you are still in self-denial. Talk so much, yet none are in tune with what you have posted earlier. Please get your thinking straight before displaying your stupidity yet again.</p>

              <p>I agree. Your calibre is too low to even handle a proper discussion. Your supposedly 'wonderful' questions seems to have disappeared in thin air, and have to resort to merely putting words in others mouth to prove some point which you coined from nowhere.</p>
