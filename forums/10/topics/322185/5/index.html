              <p>Singapore is expensive because other than the hefty petrol price, they slap a $0.40 (approximate) tax per litre. This adds to the cost of the petrol which goes into the government's pocket, for which they fail to provide good welfare and healthcare. Other countries which charges high tax rates for petrol provides free medical healthcare. What has our government provided? They hide the profits from the hospitals, in the budget statement, they provided expenditure for ministry of health for $2.6 billions, but they don't show you the income earned from these hospitals. Then they tell stupid citizens like DeerHunter that they give alot of subsidies, only a fool (or a dog) like DeerHunter would believe.</p>

              <p><br>Maurizio, I think you need to understand what I mean when I said NON-OIL producing DEVELOPED country. Your reply above only show your lack of understanding of the question and you eagerness to tell the world you are smart. Unfortunately you got em ALL wrong  (again) without even going into comparing the pricing.</p>
              <p>Canada has one of the biggest oil reserve after Saudi Arabia and Russia leh. New Zealand and Australia are both oil producing country. And for the rest, do you call them as developed countries?</p>
              <p>Good try, but no cookies.</p>

              <p><br>yes, if you know your transport will arrive 15mins later, perhaps you can do some paperwork with client before the transport arrives, rather than not knowing the timing for the transport, spend like 30mins waiting at the best stop. if you have spare time before the bus arrives, you can also do other errands, like going to the bank, post office, meals nearby so that you can utilise your time more efficiently.</p>
              <p>Germany is a big country, bus routes might be quite long unlike Singapore. same with Australia, the place you are emigrating to, buses in the suburbs can be a pain, that's why most families have cars.</p>

              <p>If you think Singapore doesnt have the one of the best public

              instead of just using German train network to prove your
              point. The last time I was in Germany, my train arrive
              40mins late. When I board the train, I couldnt even get a seat

              <p>You should know how infrequent their train arrives late if you have been there. Why don't you compare the late buses or the infrequent times our MRT has stopped service in some stations? In addition, it is your own lazy self if you did not check whether you have to reserve your seat. Fancy taking infrequent situations to prove a point. Why are you not doing that with PAP? Furthermore, the best comparisons to MRT in Singapore is not the trains that you have to reserve your seats, but rather, the U-bahn; this shows how little you know about their system. Just go and check if you will ever be not able to board the U-bahn at any time. Compare that to Singapore NEL, you might not even get into the train at Boon Keng station at 8 in the morning.</p>
              <p>Even nearer home, someone in this forum has posted a rail network for one of Japan's cities. The MRT network in Singapore pales greatly in comparison to Frankfurt, Munich, Paris, and that city in Japan. Remember, this is not talking about regional or inter city trains.</p>

              <p>There is never a real need to take taxi because the buses and U-bahn are extremely efficient. You will always know when the bus or train is coming. If you missed it, it's your fault for being late. Sure, taxis are expensive; one drive from Frankfurt airport to Darmstadt Uni cost around 50 euros (town to town). But you can compare to Sg taxis, which cost you 14 bucks (non-peak hour) from around Bendemeer road to Yishun Safra (consider the much shorter distance).</p>
              <p>And who told you they prefer to drive? Where you get your info from?<br>You should also know that it is extremely cheap to own cars there.<br> Petrol <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with respect to earnings</span> are cheap. There is also no COE.</p>
