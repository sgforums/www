              <p>How on earth can you use S$ petrol price and divide it with US$
              per capita GDP?</p>
              <p>And btw, Singapore per capita GDP in 2007 is S$52994, not
              S$49700 and in 2007, petrol price is still below S$2 per L</p>

              <p>If petrol price / per capita GDP is a good indication of
              affordability, then can I say that Singapore petrol price is
              actually "cheaper" than in Malaysia, a net oil exporter?</p>
              <p>Before you made the above statement have you ever ask yourself
              if GDP is a reliablie indicator to make that conclusion? Have
              you consider using real disposable income as comparison?</p>
              <p>Plus, have you also consider the average miles an average driver
              have to travel in luxembourg as compared to Singapore?</p>
              <p>Conclusion? More like half fuck anaylsis good enough for the
              dumb and blind. Eagle, are you sure you are a scholar and not a
              faker? And you know what, I am so glad that you are not a PAP

              <p>Think about it smart guy. You are giving us so many restrictions to adhere to.</p>
              <p>1) Must be a developed country.</p>
              <p>2) Non oil exporter (or just simply country with no significant natural resources)</p>
              <p>3) Now you are also telling everyone to consider the average miles travelled in the comparison of both countries.</p>
              <p>4) I think next you will say must be the same size as Singapore.</p>
              <p>Now can you answer my one last question. <strong>Just give us one country to compare with Singapore that meets your description</strong> <strong>of a fair comparison</strong>. I doubt there are any in this land we called Earth.</p>
              <p>I guess we had enough of your half-fucked question with all the red-tapes. You are just getting onto our nerves. The garmen did not even dare to say that we have the cheapest petrol. I doubt they can even find a source of comparison by your high class standards.</p>

              <p>Did you fail math or have failed to understand US policy? According to a CIA estimate in 2005, out of 20 million barrels per day consumed, the US imports 13 million barrels. Considering that the price of US oil is governed by worldwide demand, whether or not the US produces any oil is [i]irrelevant[/i]. In fact, one of the reasons for the high price of oil now is largely because of the falling US dollar and the fact that the world's oil is largely traded in US dollars. So much so that some oil producing countries even contemplate switching to the Euro to earn more profit, and for good reason. Of course if they did that, the US Dollar might plunge and we will all be in quite a lot of deep shit. Saudis charge so low for petrol? Didn't you know the Saudis heavily subsidize lots of stuff? US subsidize petrol? Say it ain't so! They can't even bring themselves to tax the fucking oil companies properly! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now here's an additional tidbit: Norway produces a fair bit of oil, and the the petrol tax is a stunning 63%! Try to beat that!</p>

              <p>again and again TS is being stupid.. by giving all the restrictions and then try to proclaim that since <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>under those restrictions</strong></span> no one is able to give a country which has cheaper petrol than singapore(and guess, by whose standards<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">), singapore is doing fine!</p>

              <p>So again, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which part of the above sentence is about your korean petrol price</span>? Did I even minutely mention you spout rubbish because of your korean petrol price? If you want to understand it that way, it's your own business. Not Maurizio, not me, not others. Seems like you are merely zhuo zei xin su.</p>
              <p>You are definitely putting words in my mouth and deliberately misunderstanding the context of the sentence.</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm challenging you to be more sensible and exhibit some intelligence, if you have it. Please <span style="text-decoration: underline;">point out the exact statement in which I said that you were sprouting
                                          rubbish <strong>when you say</strong> the price of korean petrol should be about
                                          S$2.30 per litre instead of Maurizio's article which
                                          claim S$1.50 per litre?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, where's your korean article? Don't avoid this. I will really say you are spouting rubbish about the korean petrol price if till now (after so many hours), you cannot even produce evidence of what you have read and commented.</p>
