              <p>Maurizio, we have read what you have posted and I dont think there is any need for you to bring this up because the two country in concern doesnt qualify to be a non oil producing developed country.</p>
              <p>1) Taiwan do produce their own oil from their own oil field</p>
              <p>2) Thailand is not a developed country</p>
              <p>Btw, what do you think of the flying frog method of comparing petrol affordability? Would like to hear what you have to say.</p>

              <p>Gas prices at AAFES and NEX pumps on bases in Japan and Okinawa will top $4 a gallon for the first time Saturday, three weeks after South Korea and Guam surpassed the mark.</p>
              <p>Midgrade unleaded gas in Japan and Okinawa will cost motorists <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$4.004 a gallon</strong></span> after midnight Friday, a jump of nearly five cents from the previous week, according to the Army and Air Force Exchange Service. Navy Exchange prices follow those set by AAFES.</p>
              <p>Regular unleaded gas, meanwhile, continues to climb in South Korea and Guam, where prices Saturday were to rise 5 cents to $4.147 and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$4.189 a gallon</strong></span>, respectively.</p>
              <p>Premium unleaded also increases slightly, to $4.379 a gallon in South Korea, and $4.419 in Guam.</p>
              <p>Diesel fuel, where sold, will remain unchanged across the board: $4.497 per gallon in Japan and Okinawa, and $4.757 in South Korea.</p>
              <p>At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, where Marine Corps Community Services controls gasoline sales, the price remains at $3.47 per gallon for unleaded. The price has been unchanged since December.</p>
              <p>The record prices at AAFES and NEX pumps mirror stateside trends. The U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline rose for the twelfth consecutive week, up 4.3 cents a gallon to $4.082, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>

              <p>Maurizio, have you read this article I posted earlier? According to <em>Oil and Gas Journal, </em>not politician, Taiwan do have oil reserves (and LNG too) and their estimated oil production was about 880bbl/day. Beside that, are you also aware that CPC, their government owned petrol companies are also involved in many oil exploration projects in Africa and Asia region?</p>

              <p>As for the petrol price of Korea which you have indicated, may I suggest that you varify your numbers again because the information I got is alot higher than what you have presented.</p>
              <p>Are you certain that Japan is not a oil producing country?</p>

              <p>Gas prices at AAFES and NEX pumps on bases in Japan and Okinawa will top $4 a gallon for the first time Saturday, three weeks after South Korea and Guam surpassed the mark.</p>
              <p>Midgrade unleaded gas in Japan and Okinawa will cost motorists <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$4.004 a gallon</strong></span> after midnight Friday, a jump of nearly five cents from the previous week, according to the Army and Air Force Exchange Service. Navy Exchange prices follow those set by AAFES.</p>
              <p>Regular unleaded gas, meanwhile, continues to climb in South Korea and Guam, where prices Saturday were to rise 5 cents to $4.147 and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$4.189 a gallon</strong></span>, respectively.</p>
              <p>Premium unleaded also increases slightly, to $4.379 a gallon in South Korea, and $4.419 in Guam.</p>
              <p>Diesel fuel, where sold, will remain unchanged across the board: $4.497 per gallon in Japan and Okinawa, and $4.757 in South Korea.</p>
              <p>At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, where Marine Corps Community Services controls gasoline sales, the price remains at $3.47 per gallon for unleaded. The price has been unchanged since December.</p>
              <p>The record prices at AAFES and NEX pumps mirror stateside trends. The U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline rose for the twelfth consecutive week, up 4.3 cents a gallon to $4.082, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>

              <p><br>Flying frog, I will give you another chance to make yourself look like a fool "AGAIN". Before I do that, can I assume that you, this little brainless EAGLE believe that the petrol price is Korea is currently about S$1.50 per litre because Maurizio13 said so? YES or NO?</p>
              <p>PS. My guess is that this stupid flying frog is going to switch topic to talk about something else because he has got no balls to say YES or NO.</p>
