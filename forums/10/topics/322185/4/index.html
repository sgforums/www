              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Creator Comments</strong>: This elusive cryptid is also know as the King of Flying Frogs.<br>It´s a flying frog from the South American rainforests that has very advanced flying traits. These frogs actually fly in true flapping style through the humid air above them.<br>In 1987, two were caught and photographed, but had died and decomposed badly by the time they were taken to a civilized port.<br>The 8-inch frogs are reported to have made a type of membrane wing from their back legs. The front legs are also webbed and used for flight, probably for steering.<br>If the existence of this frog were confirmed, it would be the only animal vertebrate to actually use flapping flight other than bats and birds.<br>(text from cryptozoology.com)<br><br><br><strong>Anuran Aerorex</strong> By <a href="/stories/stats.asp?uid=26881"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">renatodornas</span></span></a><br>for the <strong><a href="/contest.asp?contest_id=5067"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Cryptozoo 6</span></span></a></strong> contest.</p>

              <p><strong>Creator Comments</strong>: This elusive cryptid is also know as the King of Flying Frogs.<br>It´s a flying frog from the South American rainforests that has very advanced flying traits. These frogs actually fly in true flapping style through the humid air above them.<br>In 1987, two were caught and photographed, but had died and decomposed badly by the time they were taken to a civilized port.<br>The 8-inch frogs are reported to have made a type of membrane wing from their back legs. The front legs are also webbed and used for flight, probably for steering.<br>If the existence of this frog were confirmed, it would be the only animal vertebrate to actually use flapping flight other than bats and birds.<br>(text from cryptozoology.com)<br><br><br><strong>Anuran Aerorex</strong> By <a rel="nofollow" href="/stories/stats.asp?uid=26881"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">renatodornas</span></span></a><br>for the <strong><a rel="nofollow" href="/contest.asp?contest_id=5067"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Cryptozoo 6</span></span></a></strong> contest.</p>

              <p>Singapore does have a good transport public system... Definitely NOT the best! You took a train in german, sure it was late. So? Have you tried all the public transportation in the world? If yes, then you may compare. If not, dont anyhow judge.</p>
              <p>Singapore petrol the cheapest! you make me laugh! Your statement makes my stomach hurt from uncontrollable laughing.... Hahahah</p>
