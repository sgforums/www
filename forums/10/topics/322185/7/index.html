              <p>Hmmm</p>
              <p>just found this out:</p>
              <p>Luxembourg GDP per Capita (PPP) is $80500<br>Their unleaded petrol price is 1.296 Euros, which is around 2.03955 USD from XE.com</p>
              <p>So the ratio is 2.534*10^-5</p>
              <p>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/lu.html<br>http://www.aaireland.ie/petrolprices/</p>
              <p><br>Singapore GDP per capita (PPP) is $49700 which is around 36416.1 USD<br> unleaded petrol price say $2</p>
              <p>So the ratio is 5.49*10^-5</p>
              <p>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/sn.html</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conclusion: Singapore has less affordable petrol prices for its citizens and residents</p>

              <p>Is the petrol price of S$0.25/L in Saudi Arabia the retail price that you are questioning ?</p>
              <p>Why should Saudi Arabia follow any market price for refined petrol - when each countries have their own pricing policies to meet respective political agenda ?</p>
              <p>Why should you be surprised, or expect anyone to be ?</p>
              <p>Saudi Arabia is flushed with cash by pumping oil - with enough to stuff the Saudi citizens to be coddled from cradle to grave.</p>
              <p>While Singapore has build its sovereign wealth to be near the amount owned by Saudi Arabia, with this being achieved by pumping the pockets of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Still, Singaporeans do not expect any coddling from this Government but only for a small iota of compassion for the present hardships faced.</p>

              <p>What kind of argument does the government give you when you ask that they forgo the petrol tax?</p>
              <p>They don't believe in giving subsidies, so now not taxing is considered a subsidy.</p>
              <p>Then they tell you, by decreasing the petrol tax, it will encourage demand. It's like telling Singaporeans that if rice is cheaper EVERYBODY will eat an extra bowl. While I can't deny that if something is cheaper, a small percentage of us will increase consumption by a bit, but that increase is marginal, not dramatic as the government will want us to believe.</p>
              <p>At current prices as compared to 2-3 years ago, the price of petrol has increase astronomically, it's not like in the past where SG$40 will fill a tank of a japanese car. Even with the waiving of the $0.44 cents petrol duty, it will not make motorist consume that much, because at SG$1.80 per litre, it's still expensive.</p>
              <p>Moreover, waiving the petrol duty means less revenue for the government, it doesn't mean government is taking out money from reserves to subsidise.</p>

              <p>non-oil producing countries MUST impose tax.</p>
              <p>The reason that these developed countries impose tax is to receive revenues for their welfare programs (unemployment) and free healthcare.</p>
              <p>Some countries like Australia don't impose petrol tax, their petrols are cheaper than Singapore, yet they provide free healthcare. Singapore tax alot but no benefits whatsoever.</p>

              <p>Are you aware that Australia is flushed with natural gas, oil, iron ore and coal, I am just wondering why Australia are still paying so much for steel, gas and petrol. Why didnt they sell $0.25 petrol like saudi arabia?</p>
