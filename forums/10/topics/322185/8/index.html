              <p>i guess its not the cheapest neither it is the most expensive.</p>
              <p>And i dun know how the discussion veered into this but I guess on one hand there is nothing wrong to say that Singapore's petrol is not expensive compared to alot of countries. That is a fact</p>
              <p>However on the other hand, the other argument is it also must be noted that how other countries priced their petrol is none of our business. It is of no consolation to drivers like us in singapore to know that other countries petrol is more expensive but yet see our petrol price increase by almost 50% over a year ago. No matter how cheap it can be, it is still 50% more expensive and it definitely affects our pocket.</p>

              <p>Luxembourg GDP per Capita (PPP) is $80500<br>Their unleaded petrol price is 1.296 Euros, which is around 2.03955 USD from XE.com</p>

              <p>My interpretation of what you are saying is that the Australians are suffering because Australia government sell away their country natural resources to oil companies, and then impose heavy taxes on the australians income just to ensure there is welfare for the country?</p>
              <p>Universal Market Price - Is that your OWN interpretation or is that a internationally known phrase use to describe what you are saying?  </p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Do you who extracts the natural resources in Australia? This is a response to your from another thread which you conveniently cower away.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, your point of contention has always been natural resources. But do you know how mining industry works? Do you think that the Australian Government is directly involved in the mining and sale of these natural resources? Think again.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining">While exploration and mining can sometimes be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small business, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, mostly publicly-listed companies. See <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Category:Mining companies</span></span> for a list. However, what is referred to as the 'mining industry' is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources, the other specializing in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies dependent on public investment. The mining sector is typically large and multi-national companies sustained by mineral production from their mining operations.</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">A number of large multinational mining companies including <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">BHP Billiton</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Newcrest</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rio Tinto</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Alcoa</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chalco</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Alcan</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Xstrata</span></span> operate in Australia. There are also a lot of small mining and mineral exploration companies listed on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Australian Stock Exchange</span></span> (ASX). Overall, the resources sector represents almost 20% of the ASX market by capitalisation, and almost one third of the companies listed. <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[8]</span></span></sup></a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Mining contributes about 5.6% of Australia's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gross Domestic Product</span></span>. This is up from only 2.6% in 1950, but down from over 10% at the time of federation in 1900. <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[9]</span></span></sup> In contrast, mineral exports contribute around 35% of Australia's exports. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal (35% of international trade), iron ore, lead, diamonds, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">rutile</span></span>, zinc and zirconium, second largest of gold and uranium, and third largest of aluminium. <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[10]</span></span></sup></a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Of the developed countries, perhaps only in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Canada</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Norway</span></span> does mining play as significant a part in the economy; for comparison, in Canada mining represents about 3.6% of the Canadian economy and 32% of exports <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[11]</span></span></sup>, and in Norway mining, dominated by petroleum, represents about 19% of GDP and 46% of exports.<sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[12]</span></span></sup> By comparison, in the United States mining represents only about 1.6% of GDP<sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[13]</span></span></sup>.</a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Despite its export importance, the mining sector employs only a small proportion of the workforce - roughly 129,000 Australians, representing only about 1.3% of the total labor force <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[14]</span></span></sup>.</a></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Essentially what the government does is sell the land to these stock exchange listed mining companies and leave the sourcing and procuring of minerals to these private companies. The government gets paid for the lease of the land in the form of either a fixed sum or annual sum, alot like the selling of commercial land in Singapore. The money obtained from the sale or rental of these mines goes into helping the citizens of Australia as claimed by you. But where has the money from the sale of commercial land in Singapore gone. Unless you going to start arguing with me, telling me that these publicly listed companies on the stock exchange gives donation to the Australian government for no apparent reason, that I have nothing else to comment.</span></strong></span></p>
