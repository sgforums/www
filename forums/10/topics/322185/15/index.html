              <p>And you seem even more stupid by copying the PPP definition from wiki with totally no analysis and understanding on your part why it could or could not be used. If it was, as you had copied, difficult to compare due to <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">differences in the quality of goods and services</span>,</em> what makes you think you can even start a thread on the comparison of petrol prices between Singapore and other developed countries? Any comparisons wouldn't make much sense in your opinion, and thus rendering your whole thread invalid and insensible.</p>

              <p>Maurzio13, seems like many people (including your sissy sidekick) here believe your S$1.50 per litre korean petrol is bullshit. Do you have anything to say?  </p>

              <p>Gas prices at AAFES and NEX pumps on bases in Japan and Okinawa will top $4 a gallon for the first time Saturday, three weeks after South Korea and Guam surpassed the mark.</p>
              <p>Midgrade unleaded gas in Japan and Okinawa will cost motorists <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$4.004 a gallon</strong></span> after midnight Friday, a jump of nearly five cents from the previous week, according to the Army and Air Force Exchange Service. Navy Exchange prices follow those set by AAFES.</p>
              <p>Regular unleaded gas, meanwhile, continues to climb in South Korea and Guam, where prices Saturday were to rise 5 cents to $4.147 and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$4.189 a gallon</strong></span>, respectively.</p>
              <p>Premium unleaded also increases slightly, to $4.379 a gallon in South Korea, and $4.419 in Guam.</p>
              <p>Diesel fuel, where sold, will remain unchanged across the board: $4.497 per gallon in Japan and Okinawa, and $4.757 in South Korea.</p>
              <p>At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, where Marine Corps Community Services controls gasoline sales, the price remains at $3.47 per gallon for unleaded. The price has been unchanged since December.</p>
              <p>The record prices at AAFES and NEX pumps mirror stateside trends. The U.S. average retail price for regular gasoline rose for the twelfth consecutive week, up 4.3 cents a gallon to $4.082, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>
