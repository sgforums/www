              <p>"it's those who are silent, reading and observing that means more" - simply means, for your dull witted stubborn brain, that their reactions, whether they agree or disagree with me - meant more. I am only excercising my freedom of expression of speech here, which you are determined to undermine. Whether others excercise theirs, i do not force them to, unlike you, who continually thinks that others who disagree with your idotic views have no right to disssent,  but just simply because they disagree with you and you need to insult them and not use facts or reason. How about now a taste of your own medicine? -</p>

But then came 2 other forumers whom I cant remember their name, they agreed to disagee with Maurizio and then Eagle join in.</p>
              <p>Isnt this a classic example of a balless chicken running around without a brain in his head? hhahaha.</p>

              <p>Wonders? Can you explain what wonder there is? You still have not shown me proof of just one forumer who disagreed with you and you have not insulted before. I'm not letting you off on that.</p>
              <p>And you are still evading my question. You mentioned a few times that I'm a scholar.</p>

              <p>So having not even discussed with you much before, how would you
                                      know or not if I'm a scholar or not? Just because TS said so and
                                      you believe it? Or are you a clone that I have talked with
                                      beforehand?</p>

              <p>Are you another nutcase wannabe? Sue over remarks here? Dumbass. Intelligence seems to be dropping low here with you guys around. No wonder the opposition political party seems to have run out of people to put in power, with the likes of you clowns here. You guys here are actually giving the opposition political party a bad name and reputation.</p>
