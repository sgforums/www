              <p>By asking me that question is only goes to show you are
              as dumb as a sheep can be. or should I say you are letting a
              blind man giving your a ride home</p>
              <p>Are you aware that flying frog has made a huge blunder
              in the above statement?</p>
              <p>How on earth can you use S$ petrol price and divide it with US$
              per capita GDP?</p>
              <p>And btw, Singapore per capita GDP in 2007 is S$52994, not
              S$49700 and in 2007, petrol price is still below S$2 per L</p>

              <p>If petrol price / per capita GDP is a good indication of
              affordability, then can I say that Singapore petrol price is
              actually "cheaper" than in Malaysia, a net oil exporter?</p>
              <p>Before you made the above statement have you ever ask yourself
              if GDP is a reliablie indicator to make that conclusion? Have
              you consider using real disposable income as comparison?</p>
              <p>Plus, have you also consider the average miles an average driver
              have to travel in luxembourg as compared to Singapore?</p>
              <p>Conclusion? More like half fuck anaylsis good enough for the
              dumb and blind. Eagle, are you sure you are a scholar and not a
              faker? And you know what, I am so glad that you are not a PAP
              supporter because if you are, I think I am going to give up on PAP
              too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I am still waiting for someone to tell me which non-oil
              producing developed country offers cheaper diesel and petrol than
              Singapore. </p>

              <p>Flying frog, how can a scholar make such stupid mistake? I bet
              you didnt even realise how dumb you are until I bring this up
