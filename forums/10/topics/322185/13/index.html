              <p>Did you fail math or have failed to understand US policy? According to a CIA estimate in 2005, out of 20 million barrels per day consumed, the US imports 13 million barrels. Considering that the price of US oil is governed by worldwide demand, whether or not the US produces any oil is [i]irrelevant[/i]. In fact, one of the reasons for the high price of oil now is largely because of the falling US dollar and the fact that the world's oil is largely traded in US dollars. So much so that some oil producing countries even contemplate switching to the Euro to earn more profit, and for good reason. Of course if they did that, the US Dollar might plunge and we will all be in quite a lot of deep shit. Saudis charge so low for petrol? Didn't you know the Saudis heavily subsidize lots of stuff? US subsidize petrol? Say it ain't so! They can't even bring themselves to tax the fucking oil companies properly! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now here's an additional tidbit: Norway produces a fair bit of oil, and the the petrol tax is a stunning 63%! Try to beat that!</p>

              <p><br>If you are so keen to compare petrol price of net oil importing countries, talk about reasons for high oil price, US$ etc, you can always start a new thread and I will be more than willing to discuss that in details with you.</p>
              <p>This thread is about comparing Singapore petrol price to similar economy facing similar challenges so please dont contaminate it with irrelevant materials.</p>
              <p>Have you ever ask yourself why countries like Norway are imposing high petrol tax, and countries like Sweden are moving towards renewable energy source?</p>

              <p><br>I think that is what everybody (including you?) is hoping so that they wont be embarrassed by their own stupidity in believing what Maurizio said about S$1.50 per L petrol price the Koreans are paying.</p>
