              <p><br> Please accept my sincere apology for the late reply as I was out of
              the country.</p>
              <p>""You are saying that you contacting the moderators who have the
              IP address and login history for a deal you started is not fair and
              square?""</p>
              <p>Would you kindly please quote the sentence which I mentioned the
              above?</p>
              <p>I have already started a thread asking moderator to verfiy
              if I am Gazelle, DeerHunter and Bentsb05. As you can see
              moderator is not interested to entertain your stupid baseless
              claim.</p>
              <p>Instead of asking moderator to verfiy, why dont we arrange a
              meeting in the shoutbox with YOU, Eagle, me and
              Gazelle or Deerhunter or Bentsb05 (only if i
              can get them to participate). And I would like you to talk to me,
              while Eagle talk to either Gazelle
              or Deerhunter or Bentsb05 </p>
              <p>Do you have the balls to DEAL with me? Or are you going to
              chicken out like th sissy Eagle?</p>

              <p>Me chicken out? It seems more likely you cannot give everyone here a good and satisfactory reason why I should even entertain you on your deal. Here, we see Gensis throw you a deal that you don't even want to accept, yet you can be so thick-skinned to want me to accept yours without giving any reason at all. If this is not stupid and childish, I don't know what else to say.</p>
              <p>And it seems extremely clear. Almost all replies from the forumers who registered before May08 are against you. You continue to deny your stupidity and childishness will only reflect on your self-denial, as pointed out by you in your other thread</p>

              <p>I can even tell you easily how, in case you want to log in multiple accounts. Super easy method.</p>
              <p>The simplest method would be to use both Firefox and IE at the same time. The main reason is because they use different cookies.</p>
              <p>In addition, you can even use different internet proxies to do so. You can even minimize the browser size so that you only see the shoutbox. This way, you can fit 8 or more shoutbox in one screen.</p>
              <p>Bearing in mind there will always be some lag in shouting, you can key in all the browsers, then use your mouse to click all one after another in quick succession. The effect will be continuous reply by all accounts</p>
              <p>But I not so bo liao as you to want to start Eagle1 and etc</p>

              <p>I can even tell you easily how, in case you want to log in multiple accounts. Super easy method.</p>
              <p>The simplest method would be to use both Firefox and IE at the same time. The main reason is because they use different cookies.</p>
              <p>In addition, you can even use different internet proxies to do so. You can even minimize the browser size so that you only see the shoutbox. This way, you can fit 8 or more shoutbox in one screen.</p>
