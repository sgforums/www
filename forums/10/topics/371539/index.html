              <p>The Banks Own the Fed, and the Central Banks Own BIS</p>
              <p>by    Washington's Blog</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=14673">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=14673</a></p>
              <p id="message_view_subject">You know that the 12 Federal Reserve Banks are <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8198-Economic-Policy-Examiner%7Ey2009m5d22-Is-the-Federal-Reserve-really-a-federal-agency">owned by private banksters</a>.</p>
              <p>And you've heard of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), which is the "Central Banks' Central Bank".</p>
              <p>But you probably don't know who owns BIS or how it is regulated.</p>
              <p>Spiegel <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,635051,00.html">provided</a> the answer last month:</p>
              <blockquote>The BIS is a closed organization owned by the 55 central
              banks. The heads of these central banks travel to the Basel
              headquarters once every two months, and the General Meeting, the BIS's
              supreme executive body, takes place once a year.</blockquote>
              <p>So the private banks own the Fed (and other central banks), and the central banks, in turn, own BIS.<br><br>Interestingly, Spiegel points out that BIS is largely immune from regulation, oversight or taxes:<br> Formally registered as a stock corporation, it is
              recognized as an international organization and, therefore, is not
              subject to any jurisdiction other than international law.</p>
              <p>It does not need to pay tax, and its members and employees enjoy
              extensive immunity. No other institution regulates the BIS, despite the
              fact that it manages about 4 percent of the world's total currency
              reserves, or €217 trillion ($304 trillion), as well as 120 tons of
              gold...</p>
              <p>Central bankers are not elected by the people but are appointed by
              their governments. Nevertheless, they wield power that exceeds that of
              many political leaders. Their decisions affect entire economies, and a
              single word from their lips is capable of moving financial markets.
              They set interest rates, thereby determining the cost of borrowing and
              the speed of global financial currents.</p>

              <p>Modifications of productive and commercial organization and of
              financial practices made it almost impossible after 1919 to restore the
              financial system of 1914. Yet this is what was attempted. Instead of
              seeking to set up a new financial organization adapted to the modified economic organization, bankers and politicians insisted that the old
              prewar system should be restored.</p>
              <p>These efforts were concentrated in a
              determination to restore the gold standard as it had existed in 1914.
              In addition to these pragmatic goals, the powers of financial
              capital­ism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a
              world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the
              politi­cal system of each country and the economy of the world as a
              whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the
              central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements
              arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.</p>
              <p>The apex of
              the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle,
              Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central
              banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank, in
              the hands of men like Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, Benjamin
              Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Rist of the Bank
              of France, and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, sought to dominate
              its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate
              foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the
              country, and to influence cooperative politicians by sub­sequent
              economic rewards in the business world.</p>
              <p>In each country the power of the central bank rested largely on
              its control of credit and money supply. In the world as a whole the
              power of the central bankers rested very largely on their control of
              loans and of gold flows. In the final days of the system, these central
              bankers were able to mobilize resources to assist each other through
              the B. I. S., where payments between central banks could be made by
              bookkeeping adjustments between the accounts which the central banks of
              the world kept there.</p>
              <p>The B. I. S. as a private institution was owned
              by the seven chief central banks and was operated by the heads of
              these, who together formed its governing board. Each of these kept a
              substantial deposit at the B. I. S., and periodically settled payments
              among themselves (and thus between the major countries of the world) by
              bookkeeping in order to avoid shipments of gold. They made agreements
              on all the major financial problems of the world, as well as on many of
              the economic and political problems, especially in reference to loans,
              payments, and the economic future of the chief areas of the globe.</p>
              <p>The B. I. S. is generally regarded as the apex of the structure
              of (inancial capitalism whose remote origins go back to the creation of
              the Bank of England in 1694 and the Bank of France in 1803. As a matter
              of fact its establishment in 1929 was rather an indication that the
              ccntralized world financial system of 1914 was in decline.</p>
              <p>It was set
              up rather to remedy the decline of London as the world's financial
              center bv providing a mechanism bv which a world with three chief
              financial
              centers in London, New York, and Paris could still operate as one. The
              B. I. S. was a vain effort to cope with the problems arising from the
              growth of a number of centers. It was intended to be the world cartel
              of ever-growing national financial powers by assembling the nominal
              heads of these national financial centers.</p>
              <p>The commander in chief of the world system of banking control
              was Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, who was built up
              by the private bankers to a position where he was regarded as an oracle
              in all matters of government and business.</p>
              <p>In government the power of
              the Bank of England was a considerable restriction on politi­cal action
              as early as 1819 but an effort to break this power by a modification of
              the bank's charter in 1844 failed. In 1852, Gladstone, then chancellor
              of the Exchequer and later prime minister, declared, "The hinge of the
              whole situation was this: the government itself was not to be a
              substantive power in matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money
              Power supreme and unquestioned."</p>
              <p>This power of the Bank of England and of its governor was
              admitted by most qualified observers. In January, 1924, Reginald
              McKenna, who had been chancellor of the Exchequer in 1915-1916, as
              chairman of the board of the Midland Bank told its stockholders: "I am
              afraid the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks
              can, and do, create money. . . . And they who control the credit of the
              nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their
              hands the destiny of the people." In that same year, Sir Drummond
              Fraser, vice-president of the Institute of Bankers, stated, "The
              Governor of the Bank of England must be the autocrat who dictates the
              terms upon which alone the Government can obtain borrowed money."</p>
              <p>On
              September 26, 1921, <em>The Financial Times</em> wrote, "Half a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could upset
              the whole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing
              Treasury Bills." Vincent Vickers, who had been a director of the bank
              for nine years, said, "Since 1919 the monetary policy of the Government
              has been the policy of the Bank of England and the policy of the Bank
              of England has been the policy of Mr. Montagu Norman."</p>
              <p>On November 11,
              1927, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> called Mr. Norman "the currency
              dictator of Europe.". This fact was admitted by Mr. Norman himself
              before the court of the bank on March 21, 1930, and before the
              Macmillan Committee five days later.</p>
              <p>Montagu Norman's position may be gathered from the fact that
              his predecessors in the governorship, almost a hundred of them, had
              served two-year terms, increased rarely, in time of crisis, to three or
              even four years. But Norman held the position for twenty-four years
              (1920-1944), during which he became the chief architect of the
              liquidation of Britain's global preeminence.</p>
              <p>Norman was a strange man whose mental outlook was one of suc­cessfully
              suppressed hysteria or even paranoia. He had no use for govern­ments
              and feared democracy. Both of these seemed to him to be threats to
              private banking, and thus to all that was proper and precious in human
              life. Strong-willed, tireless, and ruthless, he viewed his life as a
              kind of cloak-and-dagger struggle with the forces of unsound money
              which were in league with anarchy and Communism.</p>
              <p>When he rebuilt the
              Bank of England, he constructed it as a fortress prepared to defend
              itself against any popular revolt, with the sacred gold reserves hidden
              in deep vaults below the level of underground waters which could be
              released to cover them by pressing a button on the governor's desk.</p>
              <p>For
              much of his life Norman rushed about the world by fast steam­ship,
              covering tens of thousands of miles each year, often traveling
              in­cognito, concealed by a black slouch hat and a long black cloak,
              under the assumed name of "Professor Skinner."</p>
              <p>His embarkations and
              de­barkations onto and off the fastest ocean liners of the day,
              sometimes through the freight hatch, were about as unobserved as the
              somewhat similar passages of Greta Garbo in the same years, and were
              carried out in a similarly "sincere" effort at self-effacement.</p>
              <p>Norman had a devoted colleague in Benjamin Strong, the first
              gov­ernor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Strong owed his
              career to the favor of the Morgan Bank, especially of Henry P. Davison,
              who made him secretary of the Bankers Trust Company of New York (in
              succession to Thomas W. Lamont) in 1904, used him as Morgan's agent in
              the banking rearrangements following the crash of 1907, and made him
              vice-president of the Bankers Trust (still in suc­cession to Lamont) in
              1909.</p>
              <p>He became governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the
              joint nominee of Morgan and of Kuhn, Loeb, and Company in 1914. Two
              years later, Strong met Norman for the first time, and they at once
              made an agreement to work in cooperation for the financial practices
              they both revered.</p>
              <p>These financial practices were explicitly stated many times in
              the voluminous correspondence between these two men and in many
              con­versations they had, both in their work and at their leisure (they
              often spent their vacations together for weeks, usually in the south of
              France).</p>
              <p>In the 1920's, they were determined to use the financial power
              of Britain and of the United States to force all the major countries of
              the world to go on the gold standard and to operate it through central
              banks free from all political control, with all questions of
              international finance to be settled by agreements by such central banks
              without interference from governments.</p>
              <p>It must not be felt that these heads of the world's chief
              central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They
              were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the dominant
              invest­ment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and
              were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The substantive
              finan­cial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment
              bankers (also called "international" or "merchant" bankers) who
              remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private
              banks.</p>
              <p>These formed a system of international cooperation and national
              domi­nance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than
              that of their agents in the central banks. This dominance of investment
              bankers was based on their control over the flows of credit and
              invest­ment funds in their own countries and throughout the world.</p>
              <p>They
              could dominate the financial and industrial systems of their own
              coun­tries by their influence over the flow of current funds through
              bank loans, the discount rate, and the rediscounting of commercial
              debts; they could dominate governments by their control over current
              gov­ernment loans and the play of the international exchanges. Almost
              all of this power was exercised by the personal influence and prestige
              of men who had demonstrated their ability in the past to bring off
              suc­cessful financial coups, to keep their word, to remain cool in a
              crisis, and to share their winning opportunities with their associates.</p>
              <p>In this system the Rothschilds had been preeminent during much of the
              nine­teenth century, but, at the end of that century, they were being
              replaced by J. P. Morgan whose central office was in New York, although
              it was always operated as if it were in London (where it had, indeed,
              originated as George Peabody and Company in 1838). Old J. P. Morgan
              died in 1913, but was succeeded by his son of the same name (who had
              been trained in the London branch until 1901), while the chief
              decisions in the firm were increasingly made by Thomas W. Lamont after
              1924. But these relationships can be described better on a national
              basis later. At the present stage we must follow the efforts of the
              central bankers to compel the world to return to the gold stand­ard of
              1914 in the postwar conditions following 1918.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>WELLS: I agree with much of what you have said. But I would like to stress the point that if a country as a whole adopts the principle of planned economy, if the government, gradually, step by step, begins consistently to apply this principle, the financial oligarchy will at last be abolished and socialism, in the Anglo-Saxon meaning of the word, will be brought about.</p>
              <p>The effect of the ideas of Roosevelt's "New Deal" is most powerful, and in my opinion they are socialist ideas. It seems to me that instead of stressing the antagonism between the two worlds, we should, in the present circumstances, strive to establish a common tongue for all the constructive forces.<br><br>STALIN: In speaking of the impossibility of realizing the principles of planned economy while preserving the economic basis of capitalism I do not in the least desire to belittle the outstanding personal qualities of Roosevelt, his initiative, courage, and determination. Undoubtedly Roosevelt stands out as one of the strongest figures among all the captains of the contemporary capitalist world.</p>
              <p>That is why I would like once again to emphasize the point that my conviction that planned economy is impossible under the conditions of capitalism does not mean that I have any doubts about the personal abilities, talent, and courage of President Roosevelt. But if the circumstances are unfavorable, the most talented captain cannot reach the goal you refer to.</p>
              <p>Theoretically, of course, the possibility of marching gradually, step by step, under the conditions of capitalism, towards the goal which you call socialism in the Anglo-Saxon meaning of the word, is not precluded. But what will this "socialism" be?</p>
              <p>At best, bridling to some extent the most unbridled of individual representatives of capitalist profit, some increase in the application of the principle of regulation in national economy. That is all very well. But as soon as Roosevelt, or any other captain in the contemporary bourgeois world, proceeds to undertake something serious against the foundation of capitalism, he will inevitably suffer utter defeat.</p>

              <p>Before posting something like that, are you sure that the ordinary person reading it has enough information to relate to it? I don't. </p>
              <p>You cant expect everyone else to be able to digest this much information just because you can. I doubt if anyone is able to plough through this much unfamiliar information, while maintaining an open mind.</p>
              <p>For instance, look at the article I posted. It makes 2 assertions and provides the evidence to back it up while staying short and readable.</p>
              <p>What I've learnt is that in order to successfully inform others, you have to make it easy for them to absorb the information; not to post walls of text.</p>
