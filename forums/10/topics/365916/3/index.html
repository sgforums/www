              <p><br>Men are equal??? well, in my tender age, i already know men are not equal, more so in we women. Men can never be equal, the lady statue on the supreme court holding the balance weight had never been equal, it slighted one sided, that shows that men created laws are not equal too, there is no such thing as FAIR, you can be near to it, but there can never be a fairness where both side are happy about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men are born uncivilise, cannibals and irrational, but somehow they are just trying their best to be civilise and rational, as for canniblalism, instead of eating each other, they do it in a more civilise way, take away your wealth, your property, your rights, your future, your freedom, and sometime, your soul.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So dun fall into men trap, be able to understand that men are afterall creature of destruction for the gain of oneself. With that, i rest my case.</p>

              <p>Just admit it if you hate Peranakans la. I can understand that because I have met anti-Peranakan people before. In fact, my superior at my previous job was anti-Peranakan. Yeah, she hated the whole lot of them. (I didn't leave my job because of the prejudice though.)</p>
              <p>If this was a fair discussion, the topic will only limit to LKY and his policies.</p>
              <p>This thread is like some thread to single out the Peranakans who support LKY and those who don't i.e. same as people on a black list and people not on the black list.</p>
              <p>Honestly, this thread is like whipping up an angry crowd. You may not realise it but there are people who DO take your views seriously and think that Peranakans are plainly trouble in Singapore. (with probably an assumption that since Peranakan are an ethnic group and related, they have the same thoughts and ideas)</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm Peranakan before you ask me that question, and I'll say that I have no special views on LKY being a baba. If LKY intended to be pro-Peranakan, he would have recognised the Peranakan as a separate race rather than put the whole lot of us with the Chinese. (akin to the special status of the Malays in Malaysia) But no, he didn't.</p>
              <p>I agree with what annilator47 had said as well.</p>
