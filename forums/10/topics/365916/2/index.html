              <p>well, i think we needed a common language among chinese and mandarin was afterall the "common language" in China thus the implementation of the "speak mandarin" campaign.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000099;">I have always admired my father for his dedication to Singapore, his determination to do what is right, his courage in standing up to foreigners who try to tell us how to run our country.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000099;">But <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>my father was also the eldest son in a typical Peranakan family.</strong></span></span> He cannot even crack a soft-boiled egg - such things <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not being expected of men, especially eldest sons, in Peranakan families...</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://hongjun.blogspot.com/2009/04/dr-lee-wei-ling-why-i-choose-to-remain.html">http://hongjun.blogspot.com/2009/04/dr-lee-wei-ling</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A significant category of Chinese, although one not listed in the census reports, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>were the Baba Chinese or Straits Chinese.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>They were Chinese who after long residence in Southeast Asia <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>spoke Malay or English as their first language</strong></span></span>, and whose culture contained elements from China, Southeast Asia, and sometimes Europe as well.</p>
              <p>An indication of the size of the Baba Chinese community was provided by the 1980 census report that 9 percent of Chinese families spoke English at home. Stereotypically the Baba were the offspring of Chinese migrants and local women. In the nineteenth century, they tended to be wealthier and better educated than the mass of immigrants and to identify more with Singapore and Southeast Asia than with China.</p>
              <p>In spite of their language, the Baba considered themselves Chinese, retained Chinese kinship patterns and religion, and even when speaking Malay used a distinct Baba dialect of Malay with many loan words from Hokkien.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Never a large proportion of Singapore's Chinese population</strong></span></span>, in the late nineteenth century they took advantage of opportunities for education in English and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>promoted themselves as loyal to Britain.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore, many Baba families spoke English as a first language and produced many of the leaders of Singapore's independent political movements, including</strong></span></span> <strong>Lee Kuan Yew.</strong></p>
              <p>Although the Baba, in a sense, provided the model for the current Singaporean who is fluent in English and considers Singapore as home, the community fragmented in the early twentieth century as Chinese nationalism spread.</p>
              <p>After the 1920s its members gained no advantage, economic or political, from distinguishing themselves from the rest of the Chinese population and tended increasingly to become Chinese again, often learning to speak Chinese as adults. In the 1980s, Baba culture survived largely in the form of a well-known cuisine that mixed Chinese and Malay ingredients and in some families who continued to use English as the language of the home...</p>

              <p>What makes one a 'baba' or a 'nyonya' ?</p>
              <p>According to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/peranakan">Answers.com </a>- which provides comprehensive details that largely described a group of Chinese migrants as the 'Peranakans' - who have settled in the 'Nusantara region' during the Colonial era, assimilated into local communities, and have adopted partially or in full Malay customs.</p>
              <p>Those who have settled in the British Straits Settlement of Penang, Malacca and Singapore - are also called Straits Chinese.</p>
              <p>However, although the 'babas' and nyonyas' in the Peranakan community are mostly of Chinese origins, the term will also include those who arrived from India.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can LKY be considered to be a 'baba' - as a fourth generation son of an early immigrant from China ?</p>
              <p>References taken <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/lee-kuan-yew">from his memoirs </a>had shown that his 'Hakka' great-grandfather - Lee Bok Boon (born 1846) had emigrated to the Straits Settlement in 1862, and since had a blurred lineage leading to his own father.</p>
              <p>His mother born in 1907 and probably a third generation immigrant was already considered a "Hokkien Nyonya" - and was a housewife well known for her great culinary skills in Chinese cooking with a light blend of Malay recipes that has become a characteristic signature of the 'Baba-Nyonya' cuisines, and published in her own cook book.</p>
              <p>LKY could probably be considered a 'baba' - considering that by the time of his own generation, he could hardly speak a word of Hakka, and would have been subjected to the greater influence of his mother especially when his relationship with his father was known to be frosty - (from 'No Man is an Island' - James Minchin).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, does it matter if he is a 'baba' or even belonging to any ethnic group, when he does not even acknowledge his own origins - as the son of a Salesman and a Housewife ?</p>
              <p>Does all this matter when he hold so dearly to his beliefs concerning the eugenics of the intelligent ?</p>

              <p>chia, have u hatred for the Peranakan ?    lky though a Peranakan, he does not represent the whole Peranakan community, so don't drag the whole  Peranakan to be with LKY.</p>
              <p>Don't let your hatred for lky be an offence to the  Peranakan people by dragging them into the picture.</p>
              <p>Shake my head, really don't know what happen to your brain.   Perhaps, it needs some upgrading and getting rid of baggage for it to function well.</p>

              <p>Date: 25 Feb 1994 13:04:16 -0500 "At home we use fruit that is not fully
                  ripe, such as a slightly unripe mango, because this has the right
                  sourness and sharpness of taste. The best sugar to use is gula Jawa
                  (brown sugar made from juice of the flower of the coconut palm. It is
                  sold in hard cakes; the amount needed is cut off and crushed, or scraped
                  off. Gula aren is similar, but comes from the sugar-palm. A general name
                  for both types is gula merah, 'red sugar', and similar palm sugar are
                  found elsewhere - e.g. jaggery in Burma and gula Malaka in Malaysia).
                  However, I also use dark, soft, brown sugar or Demarara sugar, and
                  either of these is quite satisfactory.</p>
              <p>In Indonesia, we would usually add also bengkuang (yam-bean) and jambu
                  (guava or the fruit - not nut - of the cashew are types of jambu).  Peel
                  and segment the pomelo (or ugli, etc). Slice the cucumber; this may be
                  peeled or not, as you prefer. Prepare the other fruit, washing and
                  peeling as required, and cutting everything into small pieces. Put the
                  pieces straight into a bowl of cold water with 1 tsp of salt. When you
                  are ready to serve, drain off this water and pile all the fruit in a
                  plate or bowl.</p>
              <p>For the bumbu: Pound all these, except the tamarind water, until they
                  are smooth; add the water and mix well. You may need to add another tbsp
                  of tamarind water. This bumbu should look like a fairly thick, sticky
                  syrup. To serve, pour all the bumbu over the fruit and mix well; then
                  serve and eat as you would an ordinary fruit salad. Alternatively, put
                  the bumbu in its own small bowl, and let everyone help themselves."</p>

              <p>You said you didn't talk about hating other races...but you blamed the Peranakans for one of the reasons for Singapore to be "run to the ground" in your statement below.  And why mentioned about Peranakans in Malaysia (MCA)?  Are you inferring that the Peranakans in Malaysia are the cause of problems in Malaysia?  Please show statistics that Peranakans have held top positions civil service in Singapore for the past few decades in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Hitler and the Nazis blamed the Jews for the ills of their country...and that led to some of the most atrocious acts in History.</p>

                                  <blockquote>Despite signs of revival since the 1980s, a gradual
                                          extinction of the Peranakan culture and lifestyle will probably take
                                          place in decades to come. The fast-dwindling Singaporeans, steeped in
                                          Peranakan culture and practices, are becoming an endangered species
                                          which may fade into oblivion within the next 120 years or so. </blockquote>

                                          "An interesting read on the origins of Peranakans. After the telecast
                                          of the Little Nonya TV series on Mediacorp Channel 8, there is this mad
                                          craze for "anything Peranakan" - from Peranakan food, music and fashion
                                          to history and tourism. An influx of visitors to Malacca to see for
                                          themselves the Peranakan culture.</p>
                                  <p>But as the article says, is this sustainable? What will happen after
                                          the craze dies off? Is a TV series enough to revive the interest in
                                          Peranakan culture and the willingness to preserve that for the future
