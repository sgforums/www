              <p>Peranakan Singaporeans, what are your views on Lee Kuan Yew as baba?</p>
              <p>Do you feel proud of him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000099;">I have always admired my father
              for his dedication to Singapore, his determination to do what is right,
              his courage in standing up to foreigners who try to tell us how to run
              our country.</span><br><br><span style="color: #000099;">But <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>my
              father was also the eldest son in a typical Peranakan family. </strong></span></span>He cannot
              even crack a soft-boiled egg - such things <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not being expected of men,
              especially eldest sons, in Peranakan families...</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://hongjun.blogspot.com/2009/04/dr-lee-wei-ling-why-i-choose-to-remain.html">http://hongjun.blogspot.com/2009/04/dr-lee-wei-ling</a></p>

              <p>A significant category of Chinese, although one not listed in the census reports,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> were the Baba Chinese or Straits Chinese. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>They were Chinese who after long residence in Southeast Asia <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>spoke Malay or English as their first language</strong></span></span>, and whose culture contained elements from China, Southeast Asia, and sometimes Europe as well.</p>
              <p>An indication of the size of the Baba Chinese community was provided by the 1980 census report that 9 percent of Chinese families spoke English at home. Stereotypically the Baba were the offspring of Chinese migrants and local women. In the nineteenth century, they tended to be wealthier and better educated than the mass of immigrants and to identify more with Singapore and Southeast Asia than with China.</p>
              <p>In spite of their language, the Baba considered themselves Chinese, retained Chinese kinship patterns and religion, and even when speaking Malay used a distinct Baba dialect of Malay with many loan words from Hokkien.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Never a large proportion of Singapore's Chinese population</strong></span></span>, in the late nineteenth century they took advantage of opportunities for education in English and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>promoted themselves as loyal to Britain.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore, many Baba families spoke English as a first language and produced many of the leaders of Singapore's independent political movements, including </strong></span></span><strong>Lee Kuan Yew.</strong></p>
              <p>Although the Baba, in a sense, provided the model for the current Singaporean who is fluent in English and considers Singapore as home, the community fragmented in the early twentieth century as Chinese nationalism spread.</p>
              <p>After the 1920s its members gained no advantage, economic or political, from distinguishing themselves from the rest of the Chinese population and tended increasingly to become Chinese again, often learning to speak Chinese as adults. In the 1980s, Baba culture survived largely in the form of a well-known cuisine that mixed Chinese and Malay ingredients and in some families who continued to use English as the language of the home...</p>

               MORE than 150 years old, the
              three-storey Baba House at 157 Neil Road will open its doors to the
              public from 15 Sept. Steeped in Peranakan culture, the House's first
              and second floors will give visitors a glimpse of the past -- while the
              third floor will feature more modern aspects of the culture.<br><br> Managed by the NUS Museum and the NUS Centre for the Arts, the House
              was officially opened (4 Sept) by Singapore President and NUS
              Chancellor, Mr S R Nathan. The two-day celebrations also saw VIPs which
              included Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr George Yeo as well as
              ambassadors and key leaders of regional Peranakan associations.<br><br> Restoration work on Baba House started in 2007. It is the first house
              of its kind to be featured as a restored heritage and architectural
              project under the supervision and consultation of Urban Redevelopment
              Authority and the School of Design and Environment of NUS. Some 60 to
              70 per cent of the furniture in the house such as the ancestral shrine
              and two wedding beds belonged to the Wee family.<br><br> <span class="imgdesc"> <img src="http://newshub.nus.edu.sg/headlines/0908/images/babahouse4sep-facade.jpg" border="0" alt="WELCOME">
              <p style="margin: 5px 0pt; padding: 5px; background-color: #eeeeee; width: 255px;">WELCOME: Baba House throws open its gates to the public from 15 Sept.</p>
              </span> The plot was bought by Chinese shipping tycoon Wee Bin in 1860 and the
              previous owner of the house, Wee Lin, is a 6th-generation descendant of
              the Wee family. In 2005, Miss Agnes Tan, the last surviving daughter of
              the late Straits Chinese community leader Tan Cheng Lock, donated $4
              million to NUS to acquire and restore the house to teach young people
              about Peranakan history, culture and architecture. Miss Tan's nephew,
              Mr Peter Lee, an art historian, writer and committee member of the
              Peranakan Association, is the honorary curator for Baba House.<br><br> Mr Lee Kip Lee, President of the Peranakan Association, said at the
              opening ceremony that the Baba House represents an "old and ongoing
              love affair" between the Peranakan community and NUS. "It also
              represents the idealism, vision and generosity of our forefathers,
              which Agnes Tan continues to express, and which we hope will remain to
              inspire not only our community, but all communities of Singapore," he
              said.<br><br> NUS President Prof Shih Choon Fong said the Baba House provides rich
              resources for the University's faculties and departments, including the
              School of Design and Environment, its Architectural Department, the
              Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, and the Southeast Asian Studies
              Programme. "These departments were also privileged to participate in
              the archaeological study as well as the restoration process led by the
              Urban Redevelopment Authority," he said.<br><br> Besides guided tours, visitors can also take part in lifestyle
              programmes such as Heritage Cuisine and the Book Circle. For more

              Ah Chia, though you appear to read or get your info fairly widely you don't seem to have an open mind. You're especially unable to see beyond the ethnic box. 
              
              Why must one think and behave according to one's ethnic group? One should conduct oneself as a member of the whole humanity.
