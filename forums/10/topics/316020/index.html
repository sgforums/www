              <p><strong>Gates says 2nd US carrier sent to Persian Gulf as 'reminder' to Iran</strong></p>
              <p>Apr 29, 2008</p>
              <p>Defense Secretary <strong>Robert Gates says the latest move to add a second
                  U.S. aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf could serve as a "reminder"
                  to Iran.</strong> But he says it's not an escalation of force.</p>
              <p>Gates
                  is insisting that the U.S. is not laying the groundwork for a strike
                  against Tehran. But he says Iran is giving the Taliban in Afghanistan a
                  continuing flow of support.</p>
              <p>Gates spoke to reporters in
                  Mexico City after meeting with Mexican leaders. His comments come as
                  U.S. officials continue to complain that Iran is increasing its efforts
                  to supply weapons and training to militants in Iraq.</p>

              <p><em>Looks like Mr.Wright's predictions hit the mark!</em></p>
              <p><strong>Iran's New Alliance With China Could Cost U.S. Leverage</strong><br><br>By Robin Wright<br>Washington Post Staff Writer<br>Wednesday, November 17, 2004; Page A21 </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TEHRAN -- A major new alliance is emerging between Iran and
                              China that threatens to undermine U.S. ability to pressure Tehran on
                              its nuclear program, support for extremist groups and refusal to back
                              Arab-Israeli peace efforts.</p>
              <p>The relationship has grown out of China's soaring
                              energy needs -- crude oil imports surged nearly 40 percent in the first
                              eight months of this year, according to state media -- and Iran's
                              growing appetite for consumer goods for a population that has doubled
                              since the 1979 revolution, Iranian officials and analysts say.</p>
              <p>An oil
                              exporter until 1993, China now produces only for domestic use. Its
                              proven oil reserves could be depleted in 14 years, oil analysts say, so
                              the country is aggressively trying to secure future suppliers. Iran is
                              now China's second-largest source of imported oil.</p>
              <p>The economic ties between two of Asia's oldest
                              civilizations, which were both stops on the ancient Silk Road trade
                              route, have broad political implications.</p>
              <p>Holding a veto at the U.N. Security Council, China
                              has become the key obstacle to putting international pressure on Iran.
                              During a visit to Tehran this month, Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing
                              signaled that China did not want the Bush administration to press the
                              council to debate Iran's nuclear program. U.S. officials have expressed
                              fear that China's veto power could make Iran more stubborn in the face
                              of U.S. pressure.</p>
              <p>The burgeoning relationship is reflected in two huge
                              new oil and gas deals between the two countries that will deepen the
                              relationship for at least the next 25 years, analysts here say.</p>
              <p>Last month, the two countries signed a preliminary
                              accord worth $70 billion to $100 billion by which China will purchase
                              Iranian oil and gas and help develop Iran's Yadavaran oil field, near
                              the Iraqi border. Earlier this year, China agreed to buy $20 billion in
                              liquefied natural gas from Iran over a quarter-century.</p>
              <p>Iran wants trade to grow even further. "Japan is our
                              number one energy importer for historical reasons . . . but we would
                              like to give preference to exports to China," Iranian Oil Minister
                              Bijan Zanganeh said this month, according to China Business Weekly.</p>
              <p>In turn, China has become a major exporter of
                              manufactured goods to Iran, including computer systems, household
                              appliances and cars. "We mutually complement each other. They have
                              industry and we have energy resources," said Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's
                              former representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
              <p>China's trade with Iran is weakening the impact on
                              Iranian policy of various U.S. economic embargoes, analysts here say.
                              "Sanctions are not effective nowadays because we have many options in
                              secondary markets, like China," said Hossein Shariatmadari, a leading
                              conservative theorist and editor of the Kayhan newspapers.</p>
              <p>Accurate trade figures are difficult to get, in part
                              because trade is increasing so rapidly and partly because China's large
                              arms sales to Iran are not included or publicized. But at the second
                              annual Iran-China trade fair here in May, Chinese Vice Minister of
                              Commerce Gao Hucheng said trade had increased by 50 percent in 2003
                              over the previous year, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.</p>
              <p>Beijing has also provided Iran with advanced military
                              technology, including missile technology, U.S. officials say. In April,
                              the Bush administration imposed sanctions on Chinese manufacturers of
                              equipment that can be used to develop weapons of mass destruction.</p>
              <p>The Iran-China ties may be partly a response to the
                              United States, analysts here say. President Bush's strategy has been to
                              contain both China and the Islamic republic, said Siamak Namazi, a
                              political and economic analyst, "so that's created natural allies."</p>
              <p>The growing presence of U.S. and other Western troops
                              in Central and South Asia and the Middle East is another joint concern.
                              In the English-language Kayhan International, Ali Sabzevari wrote in an
                              editorial: "Politically, the two countries share a common interest in
                              checking the inroads being made by NATO in Asia. . . . The presence of
                              outsiders does not bode well for peace and security."</p>
              <p>The countries also share concerns over radical Sunni
                              Muslims. Most Iranians follow the rival Shiite strain of Islam; China
                              has more than 20 million Muslims, and the government has been facing
                              Muslim unrest in some of its western cities. The dissidents receive
                              support from Islamic groups in Afghanistan and the countries of former
                              Soviet Central Asia -- the region that straddles both Iran and China.</p>
              <p>Islam has historically been a link between the two
                              civilizations. It made its way to China via Persia, the ancient state
                              that was based in present-day Iran, Iranians note. Many Chinese Muslims
                              pray in Persian, not Arabic. Their everyday language is Turkic, but
                              their alphabet is Persian.</p>
              <p>But in recent times, ties between China and Iran have
                              not always prospered. In the midst of the unrest that led to Iran's
                              revolution, one of the last foreign leaders to visit Shah Mohammed Reza
                              Pahlavi before he was overthrown in 1979 was Chinese Communist Party
                              chief Hua Kuo-feng. "The visit left a very strong negative feeling
                              about China among Iranians," said Abbas Maleki, director of the Caspian
                              Institute, a Tehran research organization.</p>
              <p class="lastPar">But today, China with its one-party
                              political system appears to feel fewer restraints than do Western
                              nations in dealing with the world's only theocracy. "For China, issues
                              like human rights don't affect your relations with Iran," Namazi said.</p>
