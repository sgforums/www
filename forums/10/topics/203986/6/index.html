The victim was repeatedly pounded on his face and right temple until his head swelled with concussion.<br><br>As his caregiver, I reported the assault to a nearby police post but was told that a magistrate court's order was required for the police to act. The reason was that the police would not investigate unless there was bleeding and/or bone fracture.<br><br>Despite being puzzled by the bureaucracy, I complied and obtained the magistrate's order for the old man. Unfortunately, the police merely followed up with some questioning of related parties and told me later that they would not pursue the case further. The police classified it as a "civil" case.<br><br>How do the authorities expect a feeble and handicapped old man surviving on social welfare money to have the means to take up legal recourse on the matter? In the end, he dropped the case.<br><br>I can vividly remember the smile of satisfaction on the assailant's face the instant we told the Subordinate Court's mediator to close the file.<br><br>From what I gathered, the volunteer who carried out the assault still continued his service at the centre and a staff who stood up as a witness to the assault had been sacked. Where's justice?<br><br>The role of our police has been significantly altered over the past ten years to include security, such as the threat of terrorism.

            <div class='col-md body'>The Book of Great Learning 'Daxue' (one of the 'Four Books' in classical Confucian texts), puts it this way: "Objects have a root and an end, matters have a commencement and a conclusion. Knowing the proper order of things is the key to the right path."<br><br>For order in society the citizenry must follow the established order, which in our case, is the set of laws set out in the Statutes. No law is perfect and it is not possible to anticipate every situation in complex day-to-day interpersonal interactions. There is a mechanism for law reform to improve our laws, which must consider the bigger picture as to what is good for society in general than an individual case in point.<br><br>It would be easy to make 'voluntarily causing hurt' a seizable offence but that would have the effect of making Singapore much closer to a police state, when domestic conflicts and sibling rivalry become the subject of a criminal investigation.<br><br>Allowing the police to decide which case to investigate which to ignore is a disaster in the making. It gives too much arbitrary power to the police, encourages corruption, and leads to non-uniformity in law enforcement.</div>

As I pointed out, the police officer at the scene was not a doctor and failed to recognize a fracture. The law in this matter is very clear as I have also mentioned previously:<br><br>"I REFER to the letters by Dr Vincent Chia Wei Meng ('When does an assault become a criminal case?') and Mr Daniel Chan Wai Piew ('Implications on public security troubling') in The Straits Times on Aug 17.<br>The offence of voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323 of the Penal Code is a non-seizable offence.<br><br>The key difference between a seizable and a non-seizable offence is that for seizable offences (such as murder, rape, voluntarily causing grievous hurt or causing hurt with weapons), police officers are legally empowered to arrest without a warrant. For non-seizable offences (such as misappropriation of property and mischief), police require a warrant of arrest or an order from a magistrate to make an arrest.<br><br>Section 323 cases can range from a parent disciplining his child by slapping him, to family disputes, to scuffles between quarrelling persons, to bullying cases arising from road rage or a staring incident.<br><br>Many of the cases reported under Section 323 arose between adults in situations of dispute which get out of hand and the parties get into a fight. Most family-related cases are resolved amicably without police intervention. These parties often do not necessarily want to seek redress through the legal system.<br><br>Dr Chia expressed concern over the safety of his family and friends following the assault on Dr Liew. He also asked if members of the public should call the police if they witnessed assaults.<br><br>Police investigation showed that Dr Liew was assaulted by two persons at a deserted back lane near a coffee shop. When he returned to the coffee shop and members of the public noticed he was injured, they called the police, not realising that he had already done so. Police investigators pursued the information given by Dr Liew but he was not able to identify the alleged assailants.<br><br>The public should continue to report such incidents. When alerted, police will respond and step in to prevent an incident from escalating in the public place, and ensure that public peace is restored.<br><br>When a report of voluntarily causing hurt that has occurred and stopped is received, police officers respond and go down to the scene to establish the preliminary facts of the case by gathering evidence or speaking to witnesses, if any.<br><br>If any party is injured, police will advise them to seek medical treatment. The medical report can then serve as useful evidence in any subsequent court proceedings.<br><br>If the alleged perpetrators are still at the scene, police will ascertain their identities. If police assess that the circumstances of the case exceed Section 323 and is a seizable offence, such as voluntarily causing grievous hurt or where a weapon was used (as defined under Section 325 or 324 of the Penal Code), they will arrest the suspects in question.<br><br>Even if the offence remains only one of voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323 but police assess that the circumstances of the case make it one of clear public concern, the investigating officer would apply for an order to fully investigate the matter on behalf of the aggrieved party.<br><br>These would include cases where the assailant is a bully taking undue physical advantage of the vulnerable, especially young children, infirm persons, senior citizens, the disabled or intellectually-challenged persons.<br><br>For other situations of voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323, police will advise the aggrieved party to lay a Magistrate's Complaint if he would like to take the other party to court. The magistrate, after considering the facts presented, may then empower police to investigate the case.<br><br>This process enables the magistrate to decide on the veracity of the complaint. This is important as the indiscriminate use of process may encourage mischievous or even malicious complaints, resulting in harassment to the defendant of a dispute and a waste of public time and resources.<br><br>Police actions need to be properly calibrated after careful assessment of the circumstances of each case. Police would like to assure the public that in cases where there is clear harm to public interests and vulnerable victims, even where the offence may turn out to be a non-seizable one, police will seek powers to lawfully investigate and prosecute the offender.<br><br>Audrey Ang (Ms)<br>Assistant Director<br>(Media Relations)<br>Singapore Police Force<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>POLICE'S ASSURANCE TO PUBLIC<br><br>Police would like to assure the public that in cases where there is clear harm to public interests and vulnerable victims, even where the offence may turn out to be a non-seizable one, police will seek powers to lawfully investigate and prosecute the offender."<br><br>(Straits Times, 23 Aug)</div>
