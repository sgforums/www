            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: red;">Implications on public security troubling</span></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">I REFER to Ms Audrey Ang's reply, 'Police explain actions taken in assault case' (ST, Aug 16). While Ms Ang may have clarified Dr Liew's case, I find some statements relating to general public security more appalling than appeasing.<br>I always look up to our men in blue as our first line of defence when things go wrong. I shudder to think that our law enforcers can become, or seem to be, powerless, as in the case of violence involving Dr Liew, who suffered a bloodied nose.<br><br>If I have read it correctly, the police stand is this: if you have been attacked by someone, first go for a medical check-up. The police can only 'exercise full powers of investigation' if you have serious injuries.<br><br>If all policemen were to follow this 'standard operating procedure', are we not allowing the culprits more time to escape, thus enabling and emboldening them to repeat their crime somewhere else?<br><br>Daniel Chan Wai Piew </span><br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asiaone.com/portal/site/STI/menuitem.d101d0824e62a86feb0f0210a06310a0/?vgnextoid=dc12758920e39010VgnVCM1000000a35010aRCRD" rel="nofollow">ST Forum</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from straits times forum.<br><br>I refer to the letter "Assault 'a civil case', so no police action" by Ms Liew Sok Kuan (ST, Aug <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br>The attack reminds me of an elderly man who was assaulted by a volunteer at an old age centre in Bukit Merah two years ago. The victim was repeatedly pounded on his face and right temple until his head swelled with concussion.<br><br>As his caregiver, I reported the assault to a nearby police post but was told that a magistrate court's order was required for the police to act. The reason was that the police would not investigate unless there was bleeding and/or bone fracture.<br><br>Despite being puzzled by the bureaucracy, I complied and obtained the magistrate's order for the old man. Unfortunately, the police merely followed up with some questioning of related parties and told me later that they would not pursue the case further. The police classified it as a "civil" case.<br><br>How do the authorities expect a feeble and handicapped old man surviving on social welfare money to have the means to take up legal recourse on the matter? In the end, he dropped the case.<br><br>I can vividly remember the smile of satisfaction on the assailant's face the instant we told the Subordinate Court's mediator to close the file.<br><br>From what I gathered, the volunteer who carried out the assault still continued his service at the centre and a staff who stood up as a witness to the assault had been sacked. Where's justice?<br><br>The role of our police has been significantly altered over the past ten years to include security, such as the threat of terrorism. However, a rethink of police duties must be done but not at the expense of public safety.<br><br>Jimmy Ho Kwok Hoong<br><br></div>
