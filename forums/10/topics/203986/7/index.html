            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">The key difference between a seizable and a non-seizable offence is that for seizable offences (such as murder, rape, voluntarily causing grievous hurt or causing hurt with weapons), police officers are legally empowered to arrest without a warrant. For non-seizable offences (such as misappropriation of property and mischief), police require a warrant of arrest or an order from a magistrate to make an arrest.<br><br>Section 323 cases can range from a parent disciplining his child by slapping him, to family disputes, to scuffles between quarrelling persons, to bullying cases arising from road rage or a staring incident.<br><br>Many of the cases reported under Section 323 arose between adults in situations of dispute which get out of hand and the parties get into a fight. Most family-related cases are resolved amicably without police intervention. These parties often do not necessarily want to seek redress through the legal system.<br><br>This process enables the magistrate to decide on the veracity of the complaint. This is important as the indiscriminate use of process may encourage mischievous or even malicious complaints, resulting in harassment to the defendant of a dispute and a waste of public time and resources.<br><br>Police actions need to be properly calibrated after careful assessment of the circumstances of each case. Police would like to assure the public that in cases where there is clear harm to public interests and vulnerable victims, even where the offence may turn out to be a non-seizable one, police will seek powers to lawfully investigate and prosecute the offender.<br></div></blockquote>Certainly this particular response bears merit. Some controls have to be in place and followed to prevent people from making false allegations and wrongful accusations against innocent parties. If police investigate everything based on one person's account, the likelihood of system abuse by the public will definitely increase.<br><br>That being said, i don't think the spokeswoman worded her response with any conviction, leading me to wonder whether she really believed her own article. What she did was to simply throw the book at an increasingly disillusioned public over what looks like lethargic and administrative bureaucracy by a police force more interested in <span style="color: darkblue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>filling up the right forms </strong></span></span>than <strong><span style="color: indigo;">actively pursuing the right course of action</span></strong><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Dr Chia expressed concern over the safety of his family and friends following the assault on Dr Liew. He also asked if members of the public should call the police if they witnessed assaults.<br><br>Police investigation showed that Dr Liew was assaulted by two persons at a deserted back lane near a coffee shop. When he returned to the coffee shop and members of the public noticed he was injured, they called the police, not realising that he had already done so. Police investigators pursued the information given by Dr Liew but he was not able to identify the alleged assailants. </div></blockquote>Did the police pursue the information on the spot or did they pursue it only after the incident was upgraded upon vigorous appeal, and then only after Dr Liew had to undergo extensive surgery?<br><br>The lack of urgency was still not explained by the police and their dispassionate response is hardly encouraging.<br><br><strong><br><span style="color: darkblue;">POLICE'S ASSURANCE TO PUBLIC<br><br>Police would like to assure the public that in cases where there is clear harm to public interests and vulnerable victims, even where the offence may turn out to be a non-seizable one, police will seek powers to lawfully investigate and prosecute the offender."<br><br>(Straits Times, 23 Aug)</span></strong><br><br>After this jolt in the back, the actions (or inactions) by the police are making people wonder just how many similar cases have slipped under the radar screen in past years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>letter was in Today yesterday. (notwithstanding that the assailant may be a mental case)<br><br><strong>"Bashed up by adult"</strong><br><br>Letter from Zarina Jaffar<br><br>On Sept 24 at about 5.30pm, my 12-year-old son, who had just returned from the library, called to inform me that he would be at the playground behind my block in Woodlands to chat with some friends.<br>.<br>Barely half an hour later, I received a call informing me that my son had been beaten up. He had been punched in the nose, jumped on and kicked repeatedly by an adult male of about 30 years of age. My son's three friends had stood there frozen in shock.<br>.<br>My husband and I rushed to the scene to find our son lying on the floor with a bloody nose, crying.<br>.<br>Other adults in the area just looked the other way. When I tried to find out what had happened, they gestured as if to say, don't bother me. But I understand why they did not want to get involved.<br>.<br>While I would like to commend the police for their prompt response to my call, I was disappointed that they couldn't do much.<br>.<br>As this is a non-seizable case, the police are not empowered to arrest the man until I lodge a formal complaint to the magistrate.<br>.<br>My son said he had seen this man on a few occasions, sometimes talking to himself and, at other times, acting friendly. This seems to suggest that he could be mentally troubled.<br>.<br>If the talk among my neighbours is to be believed, my son may not be his first victim. My boy did not provoke him but was attacked out of the blue.<br>.<br>From my understanding, the police can take action only when there is serious injury or a loss of life and limb. My boy had a swollen nose and cuts on his head and was given outpatient treatment. This is termed as a "simple injury".<br>.<br>I should think that any form of assault, especially unprovoked and involving a young victim, should be covered by the Children and Young Persons Act Â— no matter how "simple" it is Â— and the police should have the right to act without a court order.<br>.<br>Making our own enquiries, we found out which block and probable floor on which assailant lived. But this information was of no use as the police couldn't do much.<br>.<br>My husband is even toying with the idea of giving the assailant as good as our son got.<br>.<br>It seems there is a loophole in the law that can be easily exploited. All along, we had believed that any form of assault, however minor, gave the police the power of arrest.<br>.<br>I am glad the man did not have a weapon with him at that time or the consequences would have been graver.<br>.<br>We find it a hassle to lodge a complaint with the magistrate and are willing to let the matter rest if it is proven that the assailant is, indeed, mentally ill.<br>.<br>However, I do hope the authorities will ensure that he seeks medical help. Otherwise, he will continue to be a menace to residents in my neighbourhood."</div>
