Not only does it make them look silly, it makes the law itself look  stupid outright.<br><br>When a gang of 6 beat up a defenceless individual, obviously the public will expect the police to act, and act swiftly to deter other would-be aggressors. Failing to do so would mean our police are weak and lack the will to enforce the letter of the law in such circumstances.<br><br>After all, our police force are always preaching prevention rather than reaction.<br><br>This case highlights their hopelessness and failure to act as required.</div>
