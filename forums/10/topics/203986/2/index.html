To the point that if you do get assaulted to the point of disfigurement, you must complain to the magistrate's court before the police takes action.

So gathering more than five people to wear brown T-shirts is more serious than gathering more than five people to bash up an innocent bystander?<br><br>So if I do get bashed up in the presence of policemen, they will not haul those pricks away and simply tell me to report to the magistrate's court?

An assault is an attempt or offer to apply unlawful force to the person of another.<br><br>Assault is a crime as well as a civil wrong. If the wrongdoer is prosecuted, and summary proceedings are taken and the accused is convicted and punished, or the case is dismissed and the magistrates award a dismissal, no further action or civil proceedings may be taken in respect of the wrong.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The police officers on the ground should have the benefit of the doubt to refer the case to the Magistrate Court since the distinction between crimes and civil wrongs does not lie in the nature of the act itself but does depend on the legal consequences which follow the act.<br><br>2. A crime is a different category but hard to define specifically. However, it is a public offence against the state, and the object of the charge is to punish the offender, not to compensate the victim.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div></blockquote>I think someone must have given this moron a lobotomy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
