Though he mentioned that an ambulance was not required, the nearest available officers were despatched immediately, followed by paramedics.<br><br>At the same time, all officers on the ground were alerted to look out for motorcycles bearing the two registration numbers that Dr Liew provided to our operator.<br><br>On arrival at about 12.25am, the police officers were informed by Dr Liew that two men from a group of six to eight had punched him - once in the face, and once in the stomach. He was observed to be bleeding from the nose.<br><br>Based on the initial information given, the case was classified as voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323 of the Penal Code. However, such a case requires a magistrate's authorisation before the police can exercise full powers of investigation. Dr Liew was given a police medical-report form and a referral letter to lodge a complaint with the magistrate.<br><br>He was, however, advised to contact the investigation officer should his medical examination reveal any fracture or other serious injury as the case may then fall under a different classification.<br><br>Our officers also proceeded to conduct enquiries at the scene.<br><br>Later that same morning, Dr Liew visited a neighbourhood police centre and provided his medical report, which indicated a fracture. This development was communicated to the investigation officer, who then reclassified the case that very same day to voluntarily causing grievous hurt (under Section 325) which did not require the lodging of a magistrate's complaint.<br><br>Dr Liew was informed that the case had been reclassified. Ms Liew also called the investigation officer at about 9pm the same evening and the officer informed her that police were investigating.<br><br>The Head of Investigation also spoke and wrote to Ms Liew and her brother to assure them of police action a few days later, following written appeals she had sent.<br><br>We acknowledge that our responding officers at the scene should have treated the incident more seriously, based on the circumstances that led to the assault. Had this been done, it would have been unnecessary for Dr Liew to be advised that he needed to make an application to a magistrate.<br><br>Nevertheless, this lapse has not compromised the investigation. The leads provided by Dr Liew were followed up on. One of the motorcycle numbers was invalid and the nearest match was established to be unrelated to the case, while the owner of the other motorcycle was identified and assisted in the investigation.<br><br>An identification parade had also been arranged for Dr Liew. We will continue to keep him updated on the investigations.<br><br>Audrey Ang (Ms)<br>Assistant Director<br>(Media Relations)<br>Singapore Police Force</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>CASE GRAVER THAN WAY IT WAS TREATED<br><br>We acknowledge that our responding officers at the scene should have treated the incident more seriously, based on the circumstances that led to the assault on Dr Liew.</strong></span></span><br><br>So the police are writing it off as misjudgement on the part of their officers, but insist action was taken at the scene; the only exception was that it was woefully inadequate.<br><br>Considering how govt agencies close ranks and protect themselves, i doubt that any disciplinary action will be taken against the pair of officers in question.</div>

Though he mentioned that an ambulance was not required, the nearest available officers were despatched immediately, followed by paramedics.<br><br>At the same time, all officers on the ground were alerted to look out for motorcycles bearing the two registration numbers that Dr Liew provided to our operator.<br><br>On arrival at about 12.25am, the police officers were informed by Dr Liew that two men from a group of six to eight had punched him - once in the face, and once in the stomach. He was observed to be bleeding from the nose.<br><br>Based on the initial information given, the case was classified as voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323 of the Penal Code. However, such a case requires a magistrate's authorisation before the police can exercise full powers of investigation. Dr Liew was given a police medical-report form and a referral letter to lodge a complaint with the magistrate.<br><br>He was, however, advised to contact the investigation officer should his medical examination reveal any fracture or other serious injury as the case may then fall under a different classification.<br><br>Our officers also proceeded to conduct enquiries at the scene.<br><br>Later that same morning, Dr Liew visited a neighbourhood police centre and provided his medical report, which indicated a fracture. This development was communicated to the investigation officer, who then reclassified the case that very same day to voluntarily causing grievous hurt (under Section 325) which did not require the lodging of a magistrate's complaint.<br><br>Dr Liew was informed that the case had been reclassified. Ms Liew also called the investigation officer at about 9pm the same evening and the officer informed her that police were investigating.<br><br>The Head of Investigation also spoke and wrote to Ms Liew and her brother to assure them of police action a few days later, following written appeals she had sent.<br><br>We acknowledge that our responding officers at the scene should have treated the incident more seriously, based on the circumstances that led to the assault. Had this been done, it would have been unnecessary for Dr Liew to be advised that he needed to make an application to a magistrate.<br><br>Nevertheless, this lapse has not compromised the investigation. The leads provided by Dr Liew were followed up on. One of the motorcycle numbers was invalid and the nearest match was established to be unrelated to the case, while the owner of the other motorcycle was identified and assisted in the investigation.<br><br>An identification parade had also been arranged for Dr Liew. We will continue to keep him updated on the investigations.<br><br>Audrey Ang (Ms)<br>Assistant Director<br>(Media Relations)<br>Singapore Police Force</span><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>CASE GRAVER THAN WAY IT WAS TREATED<br><br>We acknowledge that our responding officers at the scene should have treated the incident more seriously, based on the circumstances that led to the assault on Dr Liew.</strong></span></span><br><br>So the police are writing it off as misjudgement on the part of their officers, but insist action was taken at the scene; the only exception was that it was woefully inadequate.<br><br>Considering how govt agencies close ranks and protect themselves, i doubt that any disciplinary action will be taken against the pair of officers in question.
