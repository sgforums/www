              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: A strong economic rebound and robust growth of 13 to 15
                   per cent projected for the year for Singapore spell good news for 
                  wages.
                  <br> <br> Labour chief Lim Swee Say said he is optimistic that workers will get better wage increases this year compared to last year. 
                  <br> <br> But he added that companies have to be mindful of the way they share the fruits of labour with their workers.
                  <br> <br> ".....what the tripartite partners are mindful is that as we reward, of course, we'll reward in a fair manner," said Mr Lim. 
                  <br> <br> This means rewarding workers based on contribution and performance.
                  <br> <br> Mr Lim said that the wage increase should be put into three baskets - a 
                  fixed increase, an annual variable and a monthly variable. This is to 
                  ensure that companies are always prepared for the next rainy day.
                  <br> <br> Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a global conference on service
                   excellence, Mr Lim also expressed concern that the push for 
                  productivity could take a toll on some workers.
                  <br> <br> Mr Lim said: "We received feedback through our union leaders that some 
                  of the workers are finding this overtime becoming too excessive. When we
                   talk about improving productivity, we're not talking about getting 
                  workers to work longer hours, because that is not sustainable. 
                  <br> <br> "So we have to find ways to work smarter, in a more productive manner, 
                  so that higher output need not necessarily be done at the expense of the
                   work-life balance."
                  <br> <strong><br> One company that heeded this call is Japanese food chain Sakae Sushi. It
                   added Vitamin E to its sushi rice for product differentiation.</strong> <br> <br> CEO of Sakae Holdings, Douglas Foo, said: "The adding of Vitamin E does 
                  not require additional time, so to speak. And you don't have to stay 
                  longer to do that. If you can finish things in a much shorter time, but 
                  the output you get is a lot better, I think that's what we're trying to 
                  do in the productivity movement."
                  <br> <br> Mr Foo also encouraged small and medium enterprises to leverage on innovative breakthroughs to gain a competitive edge.

              <p>CNA wrote that Sake Sushi heeded its productivity call? Hahaha. I dunno abt the sushi industry but Sakae Sushi is where it is today because it constantly innovates. There's no need for prompting from any of the govt bodies. Perhaps Douglas Foo has good links with the press and wants to do SPH a "favour" by saying he has gone along with the productivity initiative.</p>
              <p>The headline goes: "Workers can expect a better pay rise." That's quite misleading huh? Are private enterprises going to play along? I think at the end of the day, the Labour chief has no idea about their individual bottomlines, so he should stop this tripartite nonsense of saying that NTUC helps the people.</p>

              <p>The obvious is seen here, GDP is an indication for public sector performances, obviously, most civil servants will get paid increases and that include the Govt and Ministers. If you are smart enuf to understand him, he is talking direct for workers but indirectly for himself and his colleague ministers paid hike.</p>
              <p>During the downturn, many workers paid were either cut or freezed, it goes on for about 2 years, and today, he dare to say that he is expecting paid to rise??? I think it is more of a make up for the lost and the sacrification of the workers during the downtime, there is actually no paid increase at all, just a make up of what was suppose to be given earlier.</p>

                      making embarrassing gaffes shocked Singaporeans again with yet another 
                      “improvisation” of the English language.<br> Speaking to reporters on the Customer-Centric Initiative, Mr Lim urged 
                      every worker in the service sector to adopt a productivity target and to
                       strive to be the best.<br> <em>“If every one of us in the service sector in Singapore can adopt the 
                      same mindset, in terms of having a service quality target, a 
                      productivity target, an innovation target – maybe with the three coming 
                      together, there is hope we can achieve a breakthrough in a very 
                      widespread manner.”</em><br> He added that with stiff global competition, gunning for gold is now not good enough.<br> <strong>“If you’re the best today, strive to be better. If you’re better 
                      today, strive to be ‘betterer’ and if you’re ‘betterer’ today, strive to
                       be ‘betterest’ so that over time, Singapore’s service standards can 
                      just keep getting better, ‘betterer’ and ‘betterest’”,</strong> he was quoted as saying in Channel News Asia.<br> Mr Lim, who is also NTUC Secretary-General, is famous for coining the 
                      phrase “cheaper, better and faster” to exhort Singaporeans to increase 
                      their competitiveness in 2007. A few weeks later, Mr Lim received a 
                      massive 60 percent pay rise from the PAP. He is set to receive a 8.8 
                      percent pay hike this year.<br> Though Mr Lim is not in charge of any ministries, he earns more than $2 
                      million dollars a year, or 4 times the annual salary of U.S. President 
                      Barack Obama, thanks to the “generosity” of Singapore taxpayers.<br> <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/07/03/lim-swee-say-if-youre-%E2%80%98betterer%E2%80%99-today-strive-to-be-%E2%80%98betterest%E2%80%99/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/07/03/lim-swee-say-if-youre-‘betterer’-today-strive-to-be-‘betterest’/</a></p>

              <p>So long as our Ministers remain paid proportional to the highest 8  
              earners in the 6 best paid professions, the life of Singaporeans can  
              never be expected to be too good.<br> This is because then Ministers would be much too pro business,  
              sharing the same mercenary (profit at all costs- i.e. Profit Above  
              Principle/ 'PAP') ideals as CEOs are oft accused of.<br> We all know that for most part, a CEO's key KPIs are that of  
              company profitability- which is what essentially determines their 
              salaries.  Thus said, it would be better if PAP could find a better way 
              of pegging  ministerial salaries factoring in the <strong>median </strong>of all Singaporean's  salaries (possibly including those overseas)- whilst making these calculations  transparent.<br> Though such a new calculation would result in relatively lower  
              salaries then the currently overheated PAP determined ones, a new scheme
                would go far in  convincing all Singaporeans that their leaders are 
              not  like any other exploitative CEO (recall many an irresponsible 
              banker  CEOs, BP CEO Hayward etc- whose profit minded objectives oft 
              compromise  the integrity of society at large, are accused of 
              overworking and under  paying workers, polluting the env. etc) but are 
              citizen's true chosen leaders, not exploiters of Singaporean labour but 
              leaders trusted by all to maintain social  stability and economic 
              progress, especially  for our future generations; - unlike notorious 
              CEOs whose companies are not just bankrupt but also require government 
              bailouts to avoid 'spillover effects'.<br> What  better election show of a good character is there but but 
              frugality  on part of a leader, as our nation weathers crisis after 
              crisis.<br> <br> Whilst SG is unique in many ways, we are not immune to natural limits 
              e.g: "Whatever we do when we get extraordinary rains like  we had 
              recently, no amount of engineering can prevent flooding... unless  you 
              want to lose half the roads and have canals." ~ MM Lee, ST 22July  2010 [<a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20100722-228385.html">link</a>].<br> Novel  as our Ministerial salary schemes may be, nature and logic 
              dictates that  Corrupt officials would be corrupt, no matter how much 
              they are paid,  how sustainable is it for SG to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSIN16441320070405">pay our Ministers not to be corrupt</a>?<br> <br> The  most true and talented Singaporeans, especially those not out to 
              earn a  quick buck would then feel comfortable either in civil service 
              or in  government and Singaporeans wouldn't be unreasonable in their 
              expectations of their leaders so long as they feel that all are in it 
              together and for the long term. <br> For most, an excessive pay doesn't confer much quality-of-life  
              improvement. In anycase, for the really talented, surely they would be  
              able to earn a comfortable living post retirement having done well in 
              government  service, as public speech requests and book sales would only
               be one too many.  Without the title of 'Minister Mentor/ Senior 
              Minister' the impact of  their opinions about society would be equally 
              resounding, no matter what appointment prefix they have.<br> As for those whose esteem is so dependent on the size of their salary, 
              let them foray into the focused world of business. In the midst of a 
              committed government elected by a wise and knowledgeable populace, they 
              would find politicians then hard to bribe. May that be the national 
              future we can proudly all look forward to.<br> <br> References:<br> - [AFP22Jul2010]: 'Flood response not sufficient: Lee Kuan Yew':
