              <p>In the recent forum at NUS, undergrads who have questions for MM Lee were asked to email them beforehand for vetting. This is a mark
              departure from previous forum where MM Lee would take questions from
              the floor. Apparently, the Jamie Han episode is still fresh on his mind, and those in
              the varsity administration. Out of a total of 500 questions
              submitted via email, only 9 were carefully selected to enable MM Lee to
              prepare for the forum. In addition, they even get his good friend Prof
              Tommy Koh to be the "forum moderator" to help him out, even though
              there weren't any debate at all. MM Lee certainly came out looking good
              and wise without the likes of Jamie Han, or Dr Catherine Ng present to
              spring a surprise on him <img class="inlineimg" title="Roll Eyes (Sarcastic)" src="http://www.sammyboy.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> <a href="http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=5534">http://kentridgecommon.com/?p=5534</a><br> <br> <img src="http://www.kentridgecommon.com/wp-content/themes/themasterplan_tma_v1.3.1%202%202/tma/images/latest/lky.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="556" height="417"><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>A discussion of the national issues raised during the Kent Ridge Ministerial forum<br> </strong></span> <br> During the Kent Ridge ministerial forum, Minister Mentor (MM) Lee Kuan Yew addressed <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>9 pre-selected questions</strong></span>. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>According
              to Professor Tommy Koh, the forum moderator, the students who wished to
              ask MM questions were told to submit them via email, and out of a total
              of 500 possible questions, the 9 best were selected.</strong></span> Thus, this article will attempt to address national issues that were
              brought up during the forum. Although issues pertaining to other
              countries were also discussed, this article will only focus on national
              issues.<br> <br> <strong>Fuel emissions, recycling and the environment</strong><br> <br> MM pointed out that Singapore ranks among the countries with the
              highest fuel emissions per capita. However, he also cautioned that it
              would be very difficult for Singapore to reduce fuel consumption, which
              is essential to the running of the manufacturing industry. The fact
              remains that such emissions are considered negative externalities. Also
              known as “diseconomies” and external costs, they are related to the
              environmental consequences of production and use. The air pollution
              produced will inevitably impose costs on our entire society.<br> <br> The issue of emissions as in most cases have a regional dimension to
              it, however this regional aspect wasn’t discussed during the forum. The
              forest fires in our neighboring Indonesia produces the annual haze,
              which leads to deterioration of air quality, that will have a negative
              effect on our health. Thus, at the ASEAN level, a mechanism to engage
              our neighbors on this topic is imperative. Measures taken can range
              from transfer of agricultural technology that do not involve “slashing”
              and “burning” to fire-fighting assistance to quickly stem the spread of
              forest fires.<br> <br> Turning to recycling issues, MM mentioned that Singaporeans are not as
              disciplined as the Japanese when it comes to recycling materials. He
              alluded to the fact that a typical home-maker would find it
              inconvenient to segregate the waste and dispose them in the appropriate
              recycling bins. Perhaps, <span style="color: black;">a
              probable suggestion might be to offer fiscal incentives to households
              that attempt to recycle, e.g. a respectable amount in exchange for an
              amount of recycled waste contributed.</span><br> <br> On the whole, it would be a good idea to focus on increasing energy
              efficiency and developing “green technologies”, as suggested by Reform
              Party’s chief, Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam. To do that, we will have to build
              up our R and D capabilities in that area. This venture is a long road
              itself, but the long-term benefits is that the transfer of technology
              to our industrial sector will lead to the reduction of emissions and
              hence, negative externalities. Such “green technologies” can also be
              harnessed to create smart devices (possibly spectrometry technologies?)
              capable of detecting recyclable materials, e.g. one that is able to
              segregate recyclable waste from those that are non-recyclable.<br> <br> <strong>Gini coefficient, social class and minimum wage</strong><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>MM believes that the implementation of minimum
              wage will lead to structural unemployment as companies will seek to
              find cheaper means of production, e.g. through mechanization.</strong></span> In another separate dialog, MM pointed out that a high Gini coefficient
              is also a worldwide phenomenon that is not only limited to East Asia.
              However, it may not seem obvious to some but the Gini coefficient and
              implementation of a minimum wage are both intrinsically connected. A
              high Gini coefficient which indicates a great income disparity will
              make the setting of a minimum wage even harder.<br> <br> Those at the right tail end (high end) of the wealth distribution curve
              occupy the higher end of the social classes. The children of such
              families usually do well, given the fact that their family can afford a
              good education in a good school up to tertiary level. MM again alluded
              to the example of an elite Chinese family who sent their children to
              good universities overseas, and the latter usually ended up in high
              places in the corporate world.<br> <br> Thus, the main issue is how we can really help uplift the bottom 20% of
              the country. They do not enjoy the luxury of connections (which MM
              candidly pointed out as an important uplifting factor) to lift them out
              of their predicament. A probable solution could perhaps include more
              representatives of the bottom 20% interests at the policy-making level
              so that their interests will receive adequate attention. However, the
              fact remains that the bottom 20%’s interests cannot be ignored.<br> <br> <strong>Integrating new citizens into Singapore and Singapore’s demographics 50 years later</strong><br> <br> MM candidly described the moves taken to help new citizens integrate
              into the Singapore society such as segregation to prevent the
              establishment of little Indias and Chinas.<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> The usual case is that the new migrant integrates into the society of
              his adopted country on his own initiative. When Singaporeans migrate to
              an overseas destination, the onus is on the latter to integrate into
              the society of his adopted country. Thus, a potential migrant into
              Singapore shouldn’t be any different.</strong></span> The general
              trend is that those foreigners with a long-term view towards settling
              in Singapore will usually try to integrate into the Singaporean
              framework. Such phenomenon can be observed at universities whereby
              foreign students, who harbored intentions of securing a permanent
              residency, attempt to be part of Singaporean cliques. However, the
              government intervention in the integration process is perhaps a
              safeguard against potential social problems arising due to
              misunderunderstandings between local Singaporeans and our foreign
              counterparts.<br> <br> MM ominously pointed out the increasing outflow of Singaporeans, and
              the Singapore 50 years down the road may comprise substantially of new
              citizens of today. <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Thus,
              whilst the government on one hand tries to bring in a new pool of
              citizens, it should also attempt to address the issue of Singaporeans
              departing in droves. The fact remains that more than 50% of Singaporean
              youths between the age of 15-29 years of age wish to migrate, and it is
              a phenomenon that the government cannot ignore. </strong></span>If not, MM’s vision of a Singapore of new citizens 50 years down the road will eventually become a reality. <br> <br> ====================<br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;"><strong>For local news from non-local mainstream media, visit: <a href="http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com/">http://singaporenewsalternative.blogspot.com</a></strong></span><br> <br> .</p>
