              <p>Poorer.</p>
              <p>Heard about the abolishment of Estate Tax duty just today. Why abolish sumthing that is out to minimise the income gap??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>SINGAPORE will abolish estate duty, or taxes collected on wealth left behind after an individual’s death, Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam announced on Friday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘If we make Singapore an attractive place for wealth to be invested and built up, whether by Singaporeans or foreigners who bring their assets here, it will benefit our whole economy and society,’ he said in his budget speech in Parliament.</p>
              <p>It will cost the government $75 million a year, he said.</p>
              <p>Singapore inherited estate duty from the British. The rates originally were high - and until 1984, the top rate was 60 per cent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current rates are much lower - five per cent for the first $12 million of dutiable assets and 10 per cent thereafter.</p>
              <p>On the removal of the estate duty from the tax regime, with immediate effect, Mr Shanmugaratnam said: <span style="color: #ff0000;">‘Estate duty is a means to rebalance opportunities with each new generation and prevent wealth from being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands over time.’</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘It was especially relevant at the time when the bulk of wealth comprised land that was passed down through the family. Today, however, wealth is being created in many more ways and by a wider group of entrepreneurs, many of whom start off with little.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘Wealth is also being managed today on a global basis. Proponents of removing estate duty have therefore argued that removing it would encourage wealthy individuals from all over Asia to bring their assets into Singapore, thus supporting the growth of the wealth management industry.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘Ordinary Singaporeans have also argued that having worked, paid taxes on their income and property, and built up their savings, they want to be able to pass it on to their families. Some are in fact liable for Estate Duty when their estates receive large life insurance payouts.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Minister said the current low exemption limit for non-residential assets, set at $600,000, compared to the higher limit of $9 million for residential properties in fact tends to affect the middle and upper-middle-income estates disproportionately compared to wealthier ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘I have therefore decided to remove Estate Duty from our tax regime, with effect from today. It is not just a practical or expedient measure, but one that on balance will be in our collective interest.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>‘If we make Singapore an attractive place for wealth to be invested and built up, whether by Singaporeans or foreigners who bring their assets here, it will benefit our whole economy and society, not just the individuals who build up their wealth. It is not a zero sum game.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On why this should be retained, the minister said: ‘It is an efficient tax, set at a low rate in relation to the full value of the property, especially for owner-occupied homes. You cannot tax-plan it away. It also does not affect our middle and upper-middle-income estates disproportionately compared to wealthier ones.’</p>
              <p>‘This is why most countries have some form of tax on property - including even Hong Kong, which like us does not have capital gains tax and has already done away with Estate Duty. Only Ireland does not have a tax on residential property, but the Irish have capital gains tax, inheritance tax and gift tax.’</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Onli the rich will haf assets &gt;9million. So obviously the abolishment will help the rich ppl ( read : civil servants i tink u noe who i am refering to ) secure their wealth to be passed down to the next generation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Obviously, a certain Lee is expected to pass on soon, so he can leave his assets to his future generationss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is pathetic. In my opinion, it's very unethical to see the rich spend money like water while the poor need to scrimp and save on meals just to make ends meet. The income disparity in Singapore is climbing so how the gahmen can turn a blind eye on it is simply appaling.</p>

              <p>i think this is a perverse move.</p>
              <p>the minister also seemed anxious to abolish the tax; of all the changes to be implemented this was the only one that took immediate effect.</p>

              <p><br>I think if not wrong for every 1 local left, there is another 4 waiting to replace the local. Last time, PM Lee said 800 locals</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>left each year but MM Lee said 1000 left each year but could the migration figure be much higher? There is too much competition from foreigner to locals. Sometimes the forign profeessional not interested to stay permanently be it white collar or blie collar.</p>

              <p>They should not abolish the estate tax. The tax collected should be used to help the poor, sick, handicap and the aged especially in today increasing prices of food, transportation and many other items.</p>
              <p>The government always say that there is not enough to help the sick and the poor and hence the money need to be given to some but not the others.</p>
