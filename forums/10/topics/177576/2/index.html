Singapore does NOT have a free economy in practice. Notice the prevalence of the tripartite wage system which clearly shopws a government-controlled labour market. If you need further proof, turn to your adjustable CPF contribution rates - forced savings controlled by the government - and TLCs and GLCs. All these show massive government management of the economy, which does NOT feature in a free economy at all, or at least features in VERY SMALL amounts.</div></blockquote>Err.. massive management of economy will mean countries like USA and Canada where the govt can be the source of 50% of the economy.<br></div>
