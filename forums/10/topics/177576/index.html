            <div class='col-md body'>i think LKY had really dedicated his life to the prosperity of the nation. From the turbulent communist era, separation from Malaysia, then the task of rebuilding the nation from scratch, getting other nations to recognise our worth, getting scolded by opponents and citizens..he has done it all. He has brought our country to where it is today.<br><br>And i think his way of governing the nation, while not entirely democratic, is not wrong either. I don't think we could have prosper as much if we were to do it any other way. People back then were uneducated, and their views of how the country should be run is naive. I mean, imagine if we were suayed by the communists, we would have still remained a third world nation now! And if we had let foreign ideas seep in back then, we probably would have a government as messy as the US, the Europeans etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Free market is the key to our economic success. Singapore is ranked number 2 in economic freedom while Malaysia is ranked 68 and indonesia is ranked 134. Therefore the less economic freedom explains why Malaysia and Indonesia are still so backward. By simply allowing people to trade whatever thay want to trade and produce what they want to produce. Singapore has turned into a first world country. The general rule is "the more the goverment controls the market, the worse it becomes". That is why socialism never worked at all(failure of USSR and the opening up of china's market by Deng Xiao Ping). By the way Hong Kong is ranked number 1 in economic freedom and it has since a long time. So it is not suprising to learn that Hong Kong is more developed than Singapore whether Hong Kong have LKY a not. Wages in Hong Kong goes up as the living standard goes up and social services are cheaper because of the freer market there therefore there will be more competition and competition will only drive down prices and produce better quality goods and services<br><br>This is the index of economic freedom and notice when the list goes down the countries are poorer.<br><a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cfm</a><br><br></div>

Singapore is ranked number 2 in economic freedom while Malaysia is ranked 68 and indonesia is ranked 134. Therefore the less economic freedom explains why Malaysia and Indonesia are still so backward. By simply allowing people to trade whatever thay want to trade and produce what they want to produce. Singapore has turned into a first world country. The general rule is "the more the goverment controls the market, the worse it becomes". That is why socialism never worked at all(failure of USSR and the opening up of china's market by Deng Xiao Ping). By the way Hong Kong is ranked number 1 in economic freedom and it has since a long time. So it is not suprising to learn that Hong Kong is more developed than Singapore whether Hong Kong have LKY a not. Wages in Hong Kong goes up as the living standard goes up and social services are cheaper because of the freer market there therefore there will be more competition and competition will only drive down prices and produce better quality goods and services<br><br>This is the index of economic freedom and notice when the list goes down the countries are poorer.<br><a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cfm</a><br><br></div></blockquote>I believe that I posted up a commentary by Phillip Bowring on the inaccuracy of the Heritage Foundation's classification fo Singapore and HK as economically free. Singapore does NOT have a free economy in practice. Notice the prevalence of the tripartite wage system which clearly shopws a government-controlled labour market. If you need further proof, turn to your adjustable CPF contribution rates - forced savings controlled by the government - and TLCs and GLCs. All these show massive government management of the economy, which does NOT feature in a free economy at all, or at least features in VERY SMALL amounts.</div>
