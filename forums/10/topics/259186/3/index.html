            <div class='col-md body'>This thread reminds me of a ST article recently which said that a survey showed that more and more s'poreans are more than happy to work after the age of 62. They do so cos they r afraid they may not have enuf savings to retire on and cos of boredom. The article even said the govt encourage them and dat it was a good thing.<br><br>Let me ask something. Which normal human being in the world does not want to retire and enjoy life in their golden years? The article is written in such a way that as though working thru ur golden years is something to be proud of,so noble to contribute to GDP and to the wallets of those at the top whose bank accounts are bursting wif their millions of peanuts(dollars) salary.That article was one of the crappiest piece of s**t i ever saw.<br><br>One thing i learnt abt reading local papers is dat it hones my CRITICAL thinking skills.Even better than learning GP. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

S Pass applicants must be minimally paid a fixed monthly salary of $1,800. <strong>There is a 10% quota for S Pass holders at the company level, and a levy of $50 applies for each S Pass holder.</strong> S Pass holders paid a fixed monthly salary of more than $2,500 qualify for dependant privileges.<br><br>Pass (Work Permit):For semi-skilled and unskilled foreign workers that do not qualify for S Passes.<br><br>Source country restrictions apply for all industry sectors. For instance, <strong>Services sector companies are allowed to recruit R Pass workers from Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea and Taiwan only.</strong> Companies employing R Pass workers are also subjected to the prevailing sectoral controls such as dependency ratio and levy. R Pass holders are not eligible for dependant privileges. Work Permits are also issued to foreign domestic workers.<br><br>So FT from China and India are not allowed to work on R Passes in service sector companies whilst FT with S Passes are limited to 10% quota at the comapny level.<br><br>There is no quota for professionals, managers, executives and specialists who are paid at least $2,500.<br><br>(<a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/communities/work_pass/overview_of_work_passes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/communities/work_pass/overview_of_work_passes.html</a>)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the case of Singapore job market is really having nobody but we ourselves to blame.  At the end of the day who make the hiring decision ? who cultivate these behavior. As a matter of fact for professional individual at the age between 35 to 40 yrs old, the person performances level is at its best because individual would have 6 to 8 yrs of relevant work experience. They know the do's n don't.

If he were as old as he said, he had chances to make the difference, and if he hadn't, he can still blame the government, because the PAP government has created an environment that has little tolerance for those who can make it. But you still has himself to blame, the most.<br><br>However, the way the frustration comes out from his mouth reflects his bearing and virtue, or rather the absence of self restraint. Hope in real life he does not go f ing around. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> If he really has two grown up sons, I wonder if he would ask his sons to f themselves when they disagreed with him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Anyway, one of the most important functions of this forum is for people to vent their frustration.... can't take anything here seriously.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Right.  Well the problem can't be serious, since we have not seen much coverage in our responsible media on the people supposedly suffering from this horrendous fate.  Our media <strong>is</strong> very responsible you know, they will surely be keen to dutifully expose such atrocities.  Our government is the best in the world too and will never do anything to hurt their own people!  Why, it may even have been an elaborate conjuration of the opposition to undermine support for the ruling party!<br><br>*dramatic gasp, swoons*  Oh the thought!!  Quick, fix the opposition!
