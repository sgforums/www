Job market is tough and all the hype on TV is just hype. So many people just repeat the media propaganda. Reality is staring in our faces if we even bother to see it. Look at the number of Taxis, people in low paying jobs and etc.<br><br>So don't bother to study so hard, or work so hard. Other than elites, the rest of the population can only hope to be a cab drivers, toilet cleaners, road sweepers, dish washers, burger flippers and other low level jobs if the bangala or the old people didn't get to it first.  PRC, Foreigners and even bangalas might get into better jobs than locals. Trying to make ends meet in singapore will continue to be harder and harder and this is not a welfare state.

Therefore Singaporeans, he concluded are choosy.<br><br>So over 35ers.<br>Put aside your papers, certs, degrees. Don't be choosy. You need money to survive in Singapore. So work, grab any job you can get. The younger ppl are cheaper and robust, so too are the FT. You are old and prone to sickness, so get out of the way, into jobs that provides support for the young ppl and FTs, that keeps the economy strong, and Singapore Inc going.<br></div>

Sad, most of us can't afford to migrate and I also worry for my old age if I can manage to cope with the cost of living here.  Remember the toad called Lee Hsien Loong said more than once that he is not making this a welfare state.  He sounded so heartless whenever he said this.  Doesn't he know what goes around comes around, what goes up must come down!!  So heartless, doesn't he afraid his cancer will recur!!  Oh whatever God, please deal with this fellow!  Fxxk !!!  Think we should give the present ruling party a break and get a new political party or the existing opposition party to take over!!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
