              <h1>SPH: An insider speaks</h1>
              <p>I had no illusions about the independence of the local media when I first started my job  in StraitsTimes, under SPH.</p>
              <p>I knew that my work would be edited, and possibly censored for
                  political safety, and I was mostly fine with that – no media channel
                  anywhere in the world is entirely free from some form of editorial
                  trimming, after all. But there is such a thing as a free press but
                  certainly not one in Singapore.</p>
              <p>What I didn’t bargain for was individual self-censorship, unspoken
                  policies and rules, and the stoutness with which people swallowed their
                  journalistic dignity and integrity (because it does exist, even
                  strongly, in some places) to toe the company line. Incredible as it
                  seems, reporters in Singapore do have the same fierce pride in their
                  work as reporters anywhere else; only pitifully and sadly they cannot
                  demonstrate their beliefs. After all its a job.The omnipotence of the
                  CPF.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Its on the cards that there will be a general election in 2010. It’s
                  hard for me to swallow the indignation I feel whenever I see the local
                  media doggedly ignoring its news sense. We have seen it all before. We
                  will see it again. And again. We see it every day.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Articles and TV programmes are edited to balance out pro-opposition
                  views; awesome camera opportunities – like the opposition rallies – are
                  studiously left out of media coverage; banal and unfair quotes and
                  tactics are highlighted and headlined simply because they are tools of
                  the ruling party and the lap-dog media will comply.  But the truth will
                  out. The voting public are not as blind as they seem. For those that
                  WILL get the chance to vote, that is.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>There are many things journalists see that the eyes of the public
                  are not privy to, and that we would like to report on but can’t. Please
                  remember that when you read an article or watch a broadcast that seems
                  particularly, emetically subjective.</p>
              <p>And help spread the word that a lot of us in the media are sorry
                  that we can’t do the j<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ob we want to. It may not mean a lot to you, but
                  it sucks for us that for every day, people’s opinions of us plummet –
                  despite the fact that we work our asses off in 14-hour days with no
                  breaks on weekends or public holidays to bring you OUR (or it THEIR)
                  version of the news. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We are just doing a job..for THEM.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>And for those who think it’s as easy as quitting your jobs and
                  following your conscience – grow up. This is a job. It puts food on our
                  tables. We can all get up and leave, but it’s ridiculously easy to
                  replace us with more party-line-spouting drones. And it’s also likely
                  that we’re doing something about it, in our own little ways, even if
                  it’s as small as writing about and expressing our dissatisfaction with
                  the system from the inside. But we cant tell you about it.</p>
              <p>After all, walls have ears inside here too. And some of those ears
                  are positioned to hear everything, sometimes for some who want to just
                  get on with company at the expense of dobbing their own friends. But
                  that is another sad story.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clearly the pressure coming from the head is overwhelming, and it is
                  no surprise whatsoever that that pressure should translate down the
                  chain, so that the executives chastise the editors, the editors
                  chastise the journalists, and so on, if anyone steps out of line, and
                  that perpetuates self-censorship because ‘you might as well mutilate
                  your own article before they get to it, and in any case there’s no
                  point in drawing attention to yourself’.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Will it make some people squirm after reading this.</p>
              <p>Doubt it. There is no soul.</p>

              <p>PS: Thanks Soul_rage, for your voluntary effort to be my personal assistant and remind my fellow citizens to be cautious when statistics are qouted. Be aware, as your effort is voluntary, there's no pay and not because of your rudeness or crap about me.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><br>Stop beating around the bush. Just answer the simple question</p>
              <p>Did you or did you not say Statistics is not Science?</p>
              <p>You really have no guts to admit your lack of knowledge.</p>
              <p>Amongst the pro-PAP supporters, sgdiehard still has some credibility. You on the other hand, really are a disgrace.</p>
              <p>But continue on! :) You will help us people to be more aware of bootlickers for the govt that are only good at making rubbish remarks.</p>
