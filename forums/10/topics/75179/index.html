I think we as a society is coming to a stage where we have to think of sustainability. How are we going to make this place home in this big bad world?<br><br>I think we should start by proclaiming that we are a country that accepts everyone (that includes the gays, lesbians, trans-gendered, disabled, and mentally unstable). This I think will tell everyone that we are a loving society. Human rights must be championed by the government too if we are going to continue attracting people from all over here to SG. How are we going to compete in this globalized world? We have the tools, we have the policies, but there are going to be other countries that can provide better incentives to business and people to go there. What we need to build is our diversity in order to assure that we value humans, I think that will allow us to continue prospering as a society.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>singapore needs dreamers and risk takers.<br><br>or rather, an infastructure to support them. with less red tape.<br><br>regarding homosexuality. i do not think it is right. of the ones that i know, it is not an in-born thing to them, but rather a side effect of a traumatic experience.<br><br>however this has been argued to death, no one side can prove each other right or wrong. so let's just leave it at that, and discuss other more pushing issues.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SGglobalist:</div><div class="quote_body">I think we should start by proclaiming that we are a country that accepts everyone (that includes the gays, lesbians, trans-gendered, disabled, and mentally unstable). This I think will tell everyone that we are a loving society. Human rights must be championed by the government too if we are going to continue attracting people from all over here to SG. How are we going to compete in this globalized world? We have the tools, we have the policies, but there are going to be other countries that can provide better incentives to business and people to go there. What we need to build is our diversity in order to assure that we value humans, I think that will allow us to continue prospering as a society.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>I have a problem with what you are saying here. To proclaim something like that, we must be sincere and truthful about it. I do not think that all Singaporeans have that mindset to accept homosexuals and all that. If we still proclaim it, how different is it from a lie? In fact, it's a blatant lie. It's not going to benefit anyone in the end and Singapore would be screwed up.</div>
