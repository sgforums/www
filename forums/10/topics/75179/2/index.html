            <div class='col-md body'>Don't see why homosexuals should create any discomfort, i mean if the gay or lesbian do not try to enforce their views or make a move on you, why bother about how they wish to live their lives?<br><br>There is homosexuality in nature, male dolphins i believe often stimulate each other's penis. But it is more of a form of sexual release in the absence of a mate.<br><br><blockquote>We are in a world where hatred is fought with hatred. I think what SG needs is to be different. Hatred must be fought with love. We need to tell the world that we as a society is a loving society that truely accept everyone.<br><br>I think to bind S'poreans to SG is to make this place a place for everyone. I think we as a society is coming to a stage where we have to think of sustainability. How are we going to make this place home in this big bad world?<br><br>I think we should start by proclaiming that we are a country that accepts everyone (that includes the gays, lesbians, trans-gendered, disabled, and mentally unstable). This I think will tell everyone that we are a loving society. Human rights must be championed by the government too if we are going to continue attracting people from all over here to SG. How are we going to compete in this globalized world? We have the tools, we have the policies, but there are going to be other countries that can provide better incentives to business and people to go there. What we need to build is our diversity in order to assure that we value humans, I think that will allow us to continue prospering as a society.<br></blockquote>And for this, that's what the entire worlds needs but i don't see that happening in the next few centuries or so.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all that replied.<br><br>I am saddened by reading most of your comments. Especially the one that said "fight hate with hate".<br><br>From what I gather, we have been living with this realist ideology for too long. The ideology that if one wins the other looses and there is no in between. To build a sustainable environment for all, this to me is not a route that we as humans should travel. There should be win win situations and we have to learn to compromise. If we are all so self centred, where do you think this world will end up? I think it will be nuked away. Look at all the religious wars and colonial occupations, what were their main reasons for attacking and fighting? I think one was because they could not just live and let live, and that they assumed that their way was the correct way, their religion was the correct religion so the fighting began. Look at the colonization of the Americas, where Columbus thought the natives were barbarians and uncivilized even though it has been proven that they, the 'barbarians' had their own way of life, and were different but not wrong. However, Columbus and his crew imposed their culture, their way of thinking on the natives. Look at natives all over the world now where they are being oppressed by the governments of their lands, how do they feel? Maybe because this is SG and we are brought up in an environment that has sheltered us from these global suffering.<br><br>I still don't get it. If a homosexual do not come on to me, or do me harm, why would I hate him/her then? I think most of the people that replied have preconcieved ideology of homosexuals, and are socialized to think that their way is the correct way so other ways are wrong. The fact that if one is a homosexual then he/she is condamned to a life of imposed ideology and that they are scums is wrong. Look at the chinese and how they were treated in the 'west'. In the 1800s they were looked at and thought of as 'stupid and cunning' basically scums of the earth. We should ask ourselves why that happened. why did the west think the Chinese were lesser then them?<br><br>How about the disabled then? Are we to think that they are lesser than the abled, and that their lives means less than the abled? How about the ex-con who has changed his/her life after prison? Are we going to condamn that person for life? Please give me a break man. I know that we are all different in one way or another, but do we have to oppress those that are not the same as us? Yes we might not agree with homosexuality but to oppose homosexuals from legally proclaiming their love for fellow homosexuals is it wrong or correct? They are not hurting others through their actions are they? We are not dealing with binary oppositions here. Everything is mostly in the grey, what we need to learn is to get along man. I have lesbian friends and gay friends and they don't seem like scums to me, just ordinary humans. Why ar so many people concerned about what goes on behind close doors. Lets concentrate on the public sphere that affects us all. Homosexuality is not a crime. If you get raped by either a guy or a woman, then thats rape. Why would you be concerned about what sex raped you.<br><br>I am just rambling on here. Sitting here "china eyed" and spacing out. So please lets just live together in harmony man. Homos are humans too.</div>

So I dont think that the "public's" view point is that credible. If you studied statistics, you will know that it is all based on the sample size that they surveyed etc. not the 'whole' population.<br><br>Some of the readers spoke about how "society" does not accept gays or lesbians, I really wonder if it is just them speaking on society's behalf or they conducted a islandwide survey of all people in SG because I am part of society and I accept them.<br><br>One thing I know though, to create change, it starts on the individual level not on a societial level.<br><br>As for gays, if they can be influenced to be straight, are you telling me that straight people can be influenced gay too? So you are saying that sexuality is not innate but socialized? As for peer pressure, I know that it only the willing gets pressured. I think you should teach your child self determination so that he will learn to believe in himself not what others want him to do. I dont think that teaching him to 'other' others will help with his development as a human being because then he will grow up to hate or discriminate against others.<br><br>Lastly as for turning someone gay, I think that is just a stupid way of thinking about homosexuality and it is all based on fear.

However do not tell me if one day your son tell u he is a gay, u will be happy or feel nothing about it. If one day your son tell u he desires to be a transervite, and love to cross dress, u will feel nothing to it too ? I am not saying I will disown him or tear his skin off from him, I am just reflecting that as a parent to see your son being a gay, it is not something to be happy about. R u going to be so happy about it and pop the champagne if this happened to u ?<br><br>What does being a gay means ? The most important problem is they will not have a child of their own. I am not talking about adopting children, I am talking about really physically give birth to a real baby which has your genes etc in it. Tat to me, is something undesirable. If u ask me, leaving behind a decendents means u have left part of u behind in this world.<br><br>Second, being gay at tis time and society, it just means u r not going to be well liked by certain portion of the population. This is harsh but true. Maybe in this forums people will feel being gay is nothing etc, but to other people, they r unnatural. As wat men_@_arms say, people r linking gays with "wierd", "abnormal" and bla bla bla. They r going to go around giving peopel tat kind of feeling. Even at countries tat is more liberal than singapore, there r bound to be people tat keep their distance from gays. If your son is going to be despise as such, will u be elated ?<br><br><blockquote>u can't protect a person from knowledge... i would rather have a good conversation with a well-read and intelligent gay-man than to sit down with a narrow, ignorant, homophobe. </blockquote>Can u ? Is the effect of media really tat weak ? Years ago people r still conservative about pre marital sex etc. Why now in singapore it has become a common thing ? If it is not due to the movies and shows, what has cause the spread of these practises ? True, I can not cover up his eyes and prevent him from knowing about gays. However I do not want him to have this feeling tat being gays r absolutely okie and there is nothing to it. Is tat something wrong I have done here ?<br><br><blockquote>ultimately, we all gotta realise that its plain stupid to see them as sexually threatening to us.<br><br>not all gay-men wanna have sex with your son, stupidissmart... </blockquote>Have I ever suggest anything tat resembles your above statement from my reply ?

I dont think that teaching him to 'other' others will help with his development as a human being because then he will grow up to hate or discriminate against others. </blockquote>Is everything just black and white ? Does it means tat people can either be a straight or gay from birth ? Can't it be something in between ? Wat is the natural explantion for people being gays and lesbians ? There is an inbalance of XX and XY chromosome or hormones in the body. Is nature such tat if either a person have a very large female hormone or male hormone and nothing in between ? There are even birth defects such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia where people develop female reproductive organs in the interior of the body while having a male genetalia. Wat is so strange about people having genes tat can either sway to being a gay or being straight ?<br><br>One particular evidence tat environment did play a role in the sexual configuration of people. Twins. Twins have the same DNA structure and thus produce the same hormone level etc. If one of the brother turn out to be gay, the probability tat the second brother be one is 50%. Wat does it implies ? Nature do play a part in determining the sexual orientation which I do not disagree. However Environment also play a crucial part in it too. That is why even if one is suppose to be "born" gay as in twins, he can still lead a straight life.<br><br><blockquote>Lastly as for turning someone gay, I think that is just a stupid way of thinking about homosexuality and it is all based on fear. Where is the prove that someone will be turned gay if he/she mixes with them. That is just full of BS if you ask me.

Studies have shown tat animal been injected with the opposite hormones DO NOT change their sexual preference. It only change their arousal level. How can u safely say tat environment do not play a part in determining a sexual orientation ?<br><br>Know about the stanford prison experiment ? Normal and average people took on the roles of prisoner and prison warden. The startling result is these people actually conforms to their roles tat was being assigned to them. The prison wardens "acts" like real prison wardens and start stripping the prisoners, met out punishment such as sh!tting in buckets and cleaning it with their bare hands. The prisoners on the other hands experience acute emotional disturbance and rage. They exhibited disorganized thinking, uncontrollable crying, withdrawing, and behaving in pathological ways. The experimenters forgot that they were there to observe and collect data. Instead, they started to assume the role of prison staff and supervisor.<br><br>http://psychology.about.com/library/weekly/aa060100b.htm<br><br>Does environment influence people ? U decide.</div>

If all your friends are gays and u mixed often wih them, there is a high chance u will becomes one too... </span><br><br>We r not going to hunt all the gays and burn them on stakes... I just hope tat watever they do, don't let me or my children see or hear it... To me if my son suddenly tell me he is a gay, It will be something really sad.....</blockquote>Yah right.. I share my views and wat do I get out of it ? Please read back to my first line.<br><br><blockquote>i'll never totally accept your position, just as u'll never totally accept mine... but it doesn't help for u to get touchy and personal. </blockquote>Who is the one tat start to get touchy and personal in the first place ? When I offer some alternative views wat happened ? How is my tone when I first address this issue ? Is the culture here so aggressive tat every single remarks will be treated with sarcarsism and insults ? I just give a personal opinion and I get hit left, right, up and down for it. Next time I will keep my mouth shut and not offer any suggestions and views on sensitive issues, much like typical panja type discussion.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>i don't deny that it is a provocative thought... but i do not intend to use it to offend you... merely to challenge certain commonly held assumptions about sexuality. </blockquote>U do not intend to offend me, but u highly likely know the potential of it. I HAVE BEEN OFFENDED, and I DON'T CARE wat is your original intentions when u made tat statement. Using BAD EXAMPLES in BAD TASTE, BAD FASHION to justify something FOR the public by ATTACKING <strong>1</strong> individual who had done NOTHING is intolerable.<br><br><blockquote>i can't help the other person if he loves to hold on to imagined insults and keeps hurling it back. </blockquote>Imagined insults ? WHy don't u ask the opinions of other people ? Tat is IMAGINED or DIRECT ? No matter how I see this statement<br><br><blockquote>not all gay-men wanna have sex with your son, stupidissmart... </blockquote>It is a pure insult. Simple straight-forward insult.</div>
