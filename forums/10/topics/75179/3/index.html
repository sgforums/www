Please tell me wat bashing had I performed ? Please read back to the posts I had posted on the evidence of environment playing a part in being a gay. Have u come up with any proof yourself ?

Please, for goodness sake, read before giving judgement.<br><br><blockquote>HOWEVER, after saying that, the education one recieve should help filter out these fears, and we should be able to notice and check ourselves for such behaviour. </blockquote>Education ? Sorry man, there r scientists and religions tat do not take their likings of gays. Tis is not a problem of education but point of view. It doesn't mean the people tat do not like gays r <strong>CONFIRMED</strong> wrong and should be corrected. Is there only one right side to stand on ?<br><br>Lets talk about women rights. There r people tat support giving out more right to women and there r people tat want to restrict it. R u sure there can only be 1 "right" side to stand on ? If u support women right U R DEFINITELY WRONG ? There r people tat support Iraq war and people tat were against. Is there only <strong>one</strong> side to stand on ? Couldn't it be both sides have their reasons thus their stand remains ? Why need to "educate" people into your own beliefs ?<br><br><blockquote>Do you know that , in some countries, i.e. Canada, if your opinion stirs discrimination and is baseless, some people, like me, call it hate speech. That is also why in law, there is a slander clause. </blockquote>I have given out my facts and points but u refuse to believe it. I have posed several question which u have clearly ignored. Did I give out hate speech ? From my point of view, u r the one tat is giving out hate speech by not providing any facts or points tat support your stand. Maybe your definition of hate speech is just "I hate your stand so yours is a hate speech".<br><br>BTW, wat have I said tat seems to be inappropriate or slanderous to gays ?<br><br><blockquote>I started this thread because I wanted to talk about how some people dislike gays and lesbians based on fear, and I think I have proven my point. Thanks so much Stupid Is Smart. </blockquote>Don't mention it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Tis is a real fact of our society. Glad it open up your eyes.<br><br><blockquote>The arguement there was to accept your son the way he is not who you want and dream him up to be. acceptance was the main point. </blockquote>Now tat is strange. I cannot feel dissappointment ? I must be happy no matter wat my son becomes ? Is just "education" and intellectual important while <strong>behaviours and characters </strong>r not important ? If my son is a genius but love to murder peeple and cut people up, I should still be happy ? Did I say I am going to disown him or kill him ? I just express my dissappointment and sadness on this fact. Is tat wrong ?<br><br>Lets use the example of the person "f**king dog and shoving candles up their arse (He is nobody's sons or have any relationship with anyone). If someday your son tells tis to u, can u smile and take as though nothing has gone wrong ? Won't u prefer him to be just normal ? So wat if he is a top RI student or president scholars ? If he is a sex maniac and love to inflict pain on himself, it is still something worth to be dissappointing about.<br><br><blockquote>How would you feel if you were not accepted in a country because of your skin colour?

If u don't feel comfortable about racism or religions or sexual preferences, why pretend or be a hypocrite and says "There is no such things".<br><br>U complain here and there, will there be any changes ? Am I wrong to state out facts of society ?<br><br><blockquote>Please give me a break, Stupid Is Smart, I suggest reading up about what sociologist mean by "othering" and while you are at it, read up about orientalism too.

Tat is why things such as incest, gays, animal sex etc are not endorsed by society then. Almost all proper religion or society encourage people to reproduce and reproduce correctly. Chinese have a saying tat "There are 3 ways of being unfilial. One who do not reproduce is the greatest unfilial act". U may argue tat all these r old laws and old views. However they r also fundamentals laws of human society. Without reproduction, a society will cease to exists. Naturally, this is fed into people thinking as they evolved. Naturally, some people will be repulsed by the actions of gays. Why ? Because these r unacceptable behaviours in the past and they do not have any beneficial effect on overall society. To decrease the number of people from going tis route, people r taught from the past to discourage gays behaviours.<br><br>Talking about science, homo supporters came out with examples of dolphins rubbing the sexual organs of the same sex.

Why r u supporting people to become gays ? U can do the "right thing" (no discrimination) in the short run but ends up malignant to human society in the long run. Now society r facing the problems of population control. Developed countries r not reproducing enough people to replace the one tat had dies. In future more countries wil be considered as developed. R u really being noble or short sighted for the development of society ? R u really doing the right thing ?<br><br>My stand is I do not go around beating gays or shunning them. I do not think highly of people doing tat either. My stand is WE DO NOT ENCOURAGE OR PUBLICISED GAYS ACTIONS either. We do not reject the peopel who are gays, but we do not support any actions tat will encourage the number of gays to increase. Is tat wrong ? U want the proportion of gays to increase ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>it is not always true that homosexuals will engage in exclusively homosexual relations... did i not address that earlier? </blockquote>Neither is it true tat homo goes for outside male flings outside their normal married lives. There r many gay couples planning for marriage between 2 men. Besides gays, after they get married to women, then get attached to a gay secretly is not healthy either... If I am the wife it will be a real shocker..<br><br><blockquote>not to reduce humans to animal behavior, but humans are essentially mammals... if this behavior is naturally occurring in lower primates (not just dolphins), then it may be not that "unnatural" after all and the prejudices that society attach to them are essentially constructed and not self-evident... </blockquote>Actually most animals do practise incest, even lower primates.<br><br>I agree tat gays are sometimes born "gays". However before they change into it, they get influence by the environment before they take their stand. If all "gays" r born gays, then we expect twin brothers or sister to have the same sexuality since they have the same genetic link. However studies show tat if one of the brother is gay, the other brother being gay is only 50%. If "born gay" is true, then we should expect 100% or at least at high percentage such as 70% etc since they have the same bio data. Environment do play a part in determining one sexuality.<br><br><blockquote>i do not support the movement. and i do not "support pple becoming gay" ... they are pple who have made a choice and secure in their sexuality... they don't need my approval and they certainly do not deserve my judgement. </blockquote>I do not shun or hate gays.

They are pple who have made a choice and secure in their sexuality... they don't need my approval and they certainly do not deserve my judgement.<br><br>However I do not support publicity or promotion of their sexual behaviours such as giving speeches in speaker's corner (Not here but the physical speaker corner)<br><br><blockquote>i just recognise their individuality and not judge them based on their sexuality. it is not that i "support" them, but that i do not see that part of people as being relevant in any way in my valuation of them. </blockquote>Please forgive me if I had misunderstood your intentions. It is just tat I do not encourage people to promote gays behaviours and I was attacked by it. Naturally I would have think the other party must be in favour of supporting or promoting gay behaviours.<br><br><blockquote>and developed societies produce less children with or without gay people. it is misleading to lump this in. they are 2 different matters... </blockquote>I only can say tis is not a healthy behaviour for the totality of society. If they had decided to be one don't condemn. If they want to influence other, don't encourage. Which one is better for society, a population of 2% gays or a society with 20% ?<br><br><blockquote>all in all, i don't see how it is the wrong thing to do to recognise pple as individuals and not subscribe to narrow prejudices. </blockquote>well... I have probably said many times tat we should not condemn gay people. We should not encourage them to "encourage" or influence more people toward being gays.<br><br>Anyway just another interesting phenmenon... In girl school there r a lot more cases of lesbian couple than in normal mixed schools. Most grew out of it after some time. I see tat as another example of environment changing the sexuality of people.<br><br><blockquote>why would it increase? my personal opinion is that one's sexuality is, to a large extent, fixed. society might condition one to go one way or it may not. </blockquote>From wat I see, it is highly likely since we r dealing with psychology as well.<br><br><blockquote>you and i, secure in our masculinity, would not suddenly decide to go the other way... this argument is a weak one often used by pple insecure with their own sexuality. </blockquote>If u r young and still "undecided", before we r fixed in our own sexuality, won't the environment affects you ?<br><br>Another interesting example is the case of a man, being taught and discipline as a girl, wearing skirts and blouse etc. HE grew out thinking himself as a girl and he has a preference to guys too.<br><br>Wat u had experienced will influence how u become.

Do you think that is correct? When gamblers advocate gambling have you thought that they might be trying to state that they want the liberty to make their own decision as long as they are not hurting others? In the past, women were thought as "breeders", and were not allowed voice to vote, or  a say in society, including raising their own children.<br><br>If sexuality is constructed, being straight or gay makes no difference then. But the fact that gays/lesbians are discriminated and oppressed shows that there are no laws to stop this discrimination and to stop people from publically harming others. It places them in the same position as the women and slaves of the past. While I am at it, I think there should also be laws to stop age discrimination besides sexual orientation...<br><br>I have heard that so many people are out of work and the old and experienced, even though they are fully capable, are not getting jobs because of their age. I have also heard that companies are also preselecting interviews by asking for the person's age.<br><br>So,<br><br>homosexuality, unnatural as some might see it, does not allow them to make others feel like s*|t.

            <div class='col-md body'>This question of hate v love is an unusual one. For one thing, i sense the reason violence is a result of hate is based on restraint, patience. This in turn requires education and a broad-based knowledge of human culture, characteristics and diplomacy.<br><br>I venture to believe that humankind will forever be plagued with wars and perpetual violence. Look at the present. Terrorism is really muslim fanatics answering a 'spiritual' call  from one of their own. Was it any different when we examine the crusades? Back then, another 'spiritual' voice spoke and the attempted subjugation of the muslims began. It seems the course has run a full circle.<br><br>Arrogance no doubt plays a part in violence. The arrogance of the once mighty Roman empire that spanned most of Europe from Egypt to Germania crumbled to in-fighting and political squabbling. Even more arrogant was the misguided pride that the aryan race of 'perfect' beings could only be achieved by the slaughter of millions. Nazi culture spawned racism to levels beyond our worse nightmares.<br><br>To say combat hate with love is the way forward is to merely scrape the surface. Religion, colour of your skin, homosexuality, all these are basic examples that hate is fuelled by blind belief, bigotry and sheer ignorance in that order.<br><br>Love could not possibly burn through so venomous an assault.</div>
