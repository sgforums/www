              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle"> NTU students come alive</span></strong></p>
              <p>Angered by the censorship of their university media, students of the
                  Nanyang Technological University (NTU) demonstrated their leadership by
                  organising a historic protest at Hong Lim Park this afternoon. <br><br>Several
                  students were on hand to express their disquiet over the campus
                  censorship of news of Dr Chee Soon Juan's visit to the university a few
                  weeks ago. <br><br><em>The Nanyang Chronicle</em>, a university press, and campus television <em>Nanyang Spectrum</em><a href="http://cedmedia.ntu.edu.sg/gallery2/v/videos/NanyangSpectrum/"> </a>had their reports banned by the school's administration. <br> <br>With a banner that read "Responsible Press For Students", the
                  speakers described the situation that led to the axing of the media
                  reports and called on the university not to continue its policy of
                  censorship. A petition was presented for the nearly 70 people who
                  showed up in support to sign.<br><br>SDP leaders were present to
                  support the effort. Dr Chee arrived towards the end of the speeches and
                  answered questions from the media, including student reporters from the
                  <em>Nanyang Chronicle</em> and <em>Nanyang Spectrum</em>.<br><br>He
                  commended the students for their initiative and leadership. "University
                  life is a journey of discovery and a time where students develop
                  character and leadership skills," he said. "To do this they need a free
                  flow of information."<br><br>He urged students to take the initiative
                  to organise a "democracy week" to raise political awareness by inviting
                  political parties to speak on campus, discussing the constitution,
                  debating the state of local media, and so on. <br><br>The protest made its way into international news as <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-35804320081005?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0">Reuters</a> and the <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20081005/tap-singapore-politics-students-protest-06f3cb7.html">Agence France Presse</a> wrote reports.  <br><br><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/news1/ntu_student_protest.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="350" align="left">But
                  the event was not confined to the Park. Back on campus, students draped
                  a banner to express their displeasure at the university's heavy hand. <br><br>Read the report by <em>The Enquirer</em>, an online newspaper set up independently by students after the censorship episode, <a href="http://enquirer.sg/2008/10/03/protest-on-campus-censorship-continues/">here</a>.<br><br>The
                  website calls for donations as it is not funded by the university. The
                  effort is worthy of support and the wider blogging community should
                  actively do so.<br><br>The National University of Singapore has its own version of the <em>The Enquirer</em> called <a href="http://campus-observer.org/"><em>The</em> <em>Campus Observer</em></a>. It was set up by students who did not want its contents to come under the control of the NUS administration.<br><br>In
                  the meantime, the NTU Students' Union have rejected a requested by the
                  SDP's Chairman, Mr Gandhi Ambalam, to organise an event where the party
                  can address students. Its Vice-President, Mr Samuel Chee, said that
                  NTU's students are already exposed to a diversity of views.<br><br>Dear Mr Gandhi Ambalam,<br><br>On
                  behalf of the Nanyang Technological University Students' Union (NTUSU),
                  we would like to thank you for expressing interest in giving students a
                  diversity of views and opinions which our students in NTU are
                  constantly exposed to from time to time on top of our heavy curriculum.
                  <br><br>Hence, we have to decline your request for a forum.<br><br>Thank you once again.<br><br>Best Regards,<br><br>Samuel Chee<br>Vice President (Internal Affairs)<br>18th Students' Union Executive Committee<br>Nanyang Technological University</p>
