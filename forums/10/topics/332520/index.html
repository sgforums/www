              <div id="post_message_1616837">Hello fellow forummers, there will be an open dialogue regarding ‘Media Freedom on Campus’ at Hong Lim Park this coming Sunday, 5th Oct, 4.30pm. <br><br>I make this post as an announcement and an appeal to the better judgment of all of you. <br><br>I sincerely believe that the whole issue is about raising awareness in hopes of improving the quality of our university education, specifically in this case, Nanyang Technological University (NTU).<br><br>We can only hope to achieve greater heights in the educational arena by promoting critical thought and intellectual exchange. Potential leaders can be groomed and nurtured when the university environment evolves into one that promotes and encourages students to speak out. <br><br>By organizing this event at Hong Lim Park, we hope to raise awareness about the entire issue and invite intellectual discussion regarding the freedom of information. The university should ideally be a place that facilitates and stimulates critical exchange.<br><br>Therefore I hope that the open dialogue will be one that is fruitful for all stakeholders of NTU, and also an insightful one for all concerned members of the public.<br><br>Do join our Facebook Group if you believe in our cause.<br><br><a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=31594527756&amp;ref=nf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #22229c;">Stand Up for Media Freedom on Campus</span></span></a><br><br>In addition, if you feel strongly and want to hear, discuss, and express opinions regarding the issue, do join our online event invite.<br><br><a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/event.php?eid=39594160711"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #22229c;">The Big Hong Lim Show</span></span></a><br><br>You can also read more about the entire issue from <em>The Online Citizen</em>.<br><br><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/09/ntu-censors-campus-news-coverage-of-chee-soon-juan-visit/#comment-21898"><span style="color: #22229c;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"NTU censors campus news coverage of Chee Soon Juan visit (updated)"</span></span></a><br><br><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/10/ntu-students-to-hold-stand-up-for-media-freedom-event-at-speakers-corner/#comment-23574"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #22229c;">"NTU students to hold 'Stand Up For Media Freedom' event at Speaker's Corner"</span></span></a></div>

              <div id="post_message_1616838">Below is our press release.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>NTU students to hold ‘Stand Up For Media Freedom On Campus’ outreach event at Speaker’s Corner, Hong Lim Park<br>4:30 – 6:00 p.m., Sunday, 5th October 08</strong><br><br>A group of NTU students and alumni will be protesting against NTU’s recent censorship of a campus newspaper article, described by a university professor as “totally harmless”. <br><br>They will be using the Speaker’s Corner as a platform to publicise their views about the importance of greater press freedom and the marketplace of ideas, particularly in an institution of higher learning such as the university.<br><br>Attempts to air their views within campus got vetoed in a manner similar to the initial news censorship; given how this group cares for freedom of information, it will now seek a public platform to respond and spread awareness.<br><br><strong>History</strong><br><br>On the 26th and 28th of August, Dr Chee Soon Juan, Secretary-General of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), visited NTU to distribute flyers and interact with the students as part of a tour to “raise political awareness”.<br><br>The Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information's (WKWSCI) print and video broadcast media covered the event. However, both were soon axed by the university’s administration. The video broadcast was aired within the university’s TV network for three days – before it was ordered to be taken off air; the print article – initially approved to run by NTU’s president – got the cut just before it was due for print. A WKWSCI professor described the print report as “totally harmless”.<br><br>This censorship angered many WKWSCI students, especially those who had produced the various media reports. One subsequent protest banner erected on a designated exhibition space within WKWSCI was taken down by university security personnel within an hour; a student journalist’s news article about the response to the media blackout was prematurely cut as well.<br><br>In this climate, the group of WKWSCI students and alumni have felt that their very education is being compromised. They are now questioning the veracity of what they were taught in class: the critical debate of ideas, the role of freedom of information in rigorous journalism training. <br><br><strong>Agenda</strong><br><br>They will make a series of speeches mainly to:<br><br>1. Raise awareness on this issue for both the public and the university population <br><br>2. Talk about the experience of having a neutral news article cut for fear of its subject<br><br>3. State their values and stand on press freedom<br><br>4. What they have done thus far regarding this issue, and what they hope to see regarding higher levels of freedom of information in the future<br><br>5. Highlight how this incident has undermined the very education that the University hopes to provide to students<br><br>6. Engage university or school professors if possible</div>

              <p>I understand where most of you are coming from when you talk about media freedom as whole that cannot be separated between state and institution.</p>
              <p>The state media is an entirely different discussion here. Like what a poster, (human) said, this is perhaps symptomatic of the state, but what we're specifically concerned about our campus media because the university is supposed to be an autonomous institution of higher learning.</p>
              <p>We firmly want to engage our university in allowing for greater media freedom in campus simply because we see the potential value of the freedom in helping to propel NTU forward as a world-class university.</p>
              <p>We are not turning this into a political-fest, nor was the original intentions political to begin with. Thus we are steering clear of "media freedom", in the loosest of definitions. Regardless, the reason why the platform used is public despite our "domestic" concerns is because of the university's refusal to allow us to speak in campus.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we have no choice but to go to our next best alternative, a public space that is sanctioned by the state.</p>
              <p>And yes, I do think the level of media freedom in NTU is almost stifling, worse than the state, and thus we are attempting to push it up one notch. The open dialogue we intend to hold has nothing to do with breaking the status quo of society per se, but just NTU.</p>
              <p>We definitely are not foolish to the point of pushing for a media freedom "wider" than what the state has allowed!</p>

              <p><br>On the contrary, this open dialogue has been held by the communications school in NTU. There is still hope for the future! At the very least we are reacting and not accepting.</p>
              <p>We are incensed at the actions of the university because what they have done really goes against the ideals and lessons we have learnt so far. Yes, are not foolish, nor stupid, and understand the difference between ideal and practicality.</p>
              <p>Still, university is often felt to be the last vestige of idealism, and we would like to actually keep university as idealistic as possible, before we step out into the real world and fold to the harsh reality.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><br>Our entire school system is based on the notion of passive students that must be "taught" if they are to learn. . Our country  each year not just giving students a second-rate education, but at the same time actively preventing them from getting an education on their own. And I'm angry at how school produces submissive students with battered egos. Most students have no idea of the true joys of learning, and of how much they can actually achieve on their own.</p></div>

              <p><br>I believe SpectrumTV and The Online Citizen have video footages. However due to the nature of editing, and the fact that these 2 media sources are student-ran, I think you would need to wait for close to a week...and also...not too sure if SpectrumTV will be allowed to air what they filmed today hahax...</p>
