With the findings that resulted in 5 additional charges, it is not likely that the death of the girl was an accident. It was not just murder, there was thief. There wasn't just lust, there were greed. He will get what he deserves.<br><br>Just can't imagining how a decent looking guy, the famous honest good singaporean man can do such things. Brought the family, wife and children to the company family party one one day and the next day brought a subordinate to the nearby hotel 81. Appeared as with a fatherly image, looking after the young little girl, a subordinate, from China, only to take advantage of the girl. It is more than just being "itchy". He is a wolf in sheep skin. He brought pain to the girl's parents and relatives, he also brought shame to his own wife and children.<br><br>A lighted match in the wrong place will burn down anything, it is just a matter of time.

So what makes you think that these evedence are fabricated while the evidence collected by our police force against the suspect in the kallang murder are not fabricated.<br><br>In any case, the investigation should be objective and transparent. If there is transparency in the investigation, no one would accuse the authorities of fabricating evidences.<br><br>By denying the suspect to meet up with his lawyer or to be heard in public right from the beginning of the investigation, the suspect is being put in a very disadvantage situation. This is because as everyone knows, first impression counts.
