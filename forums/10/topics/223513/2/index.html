            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by oxford mushroom:</div><div class="quote_body">Market forces will decide your remuneration, and the market has suddenly become much larger with globalisation. Given the willingness of foreigners to accept low pay and work in all kinds of jobs, even if they are over-qualified for them; employers have greater choices. And it's not just Myanmar maids, graduates in SiChuan are working as maids in Beijing.<br><br>If you possess skills that are in demand, you command higher salaries. If others can do the same job and are willing to accept lower pay for it, you lose your job. It's that simple.<br><br>You can't live on such low salaries? Well, these foreign workers have shown that they can and still send money home. The fact is: we don't want to live on such low salaries. Then we will just have to offer employers something much more than what foreigners can do.<br><br></div></blockquote>Mr Oxford Mushroom, are you on high again with those magic mushroom from Koh Samui ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Regarding the article you posted above, I sincerely appluaded the Burmese maid's attitude. However you have disappointed me. You fail to understand the differences between the cost and standard  of living in Burma and Singapore. Are you stiill thinking that Singaporeans are still  living in likes of the Fifties where $300 can provide a family with very decent means ? Well, life here has changed aplenty.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Maybe you have another motives,you are trying to influence the educated to leave Singapore and migrate abroad ? Or the not so well educated ones to leave the country illegally to work as low end workers in the developed countries with the likes of Chinese illegal immigrants abroad ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Despite your so called high end education, you just fail and failed badly to understand these simple economic basics, the widening disparity between the rich and poor in Singapore. Please do not compare us with Third World countries while aiming to be First.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
