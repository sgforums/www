The expenses of myanmar is diff. She can work and suffer for a few years beside she can go back to her country and retire and enjoy life. U think we can do the same like her?<br><br>Let me give u another example, if USA wants to employ singaporean doing an operator job for 1500USD/per mth working 15 days. u think how many singaporean will apply? Given with the market now, I think alot of ppl might rush to grab. 1500USD is almost equal to 2400SGD. Some graduate are also not getting this pay in singapore. And 15 days only!! U finish ur work and fark off...who don't want to do? And do you know what I see? Alot of fillipino, burmanese, vietnamese, laos, mexicans, blacks and some other south east asia countries ppl are working as an operator.<br><br>On the other hand, yes, I agree some singaporeans are picky. Times is bad, we can't choose over things we liked as compare to what we have in the past.</div>

Yet less then 30 per cent of those recommendations from three separate committees were adopted.<br><br>The Government was supposed to get out of business, and yet remain as the lynch-pin in a pseudo-privatise economy that remains largely in the hands of previous GLCs that were reformed but continue to be in Government hands.<br><br>Is it any surprise that the sluggish status quo will continue despite the glowing economic reports of growth coming from narrow sectors of the Singapore economy ?<br><br>If I am not mistaken, Oxford's PhD is in the medical field, which leave him even more entire out-of-touch with the economic reality faced by Singaporeans, while he is overpaid in UK offering patronising and chastising remarks with such arrogance.<br><br></span><br><br></div>
