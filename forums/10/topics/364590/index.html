              <p>To describe it this way is not very fair to Temasek Holding. As the great financial tsunami ripples through the economy, it seems indeed like a bargain to buy into the distressed company. On restrospective we knew it might seem alot to pay for, but thats impossible to predict.

              <p>Anyway, government policies are very intricate. To spend on free healthcare and transport would mean there are no reserves and we will incur a budget deficit. Say goodbye to our MAS exchange rate monetary policy and bye bye to infrastructure spendings. We will be like US, UK and Japan with huge budget deficits. You can't manage an independent monetary policy and fiscal policy when your hands are tied down by a huge budget deficit. Expect SGD to float wildly under attacks from speculator and trade will be disrupted (not forgeting trade and stability is our competitive advantage).</p>
              <p>Back to Temasek Holdings, the annual compounding return since 1974 is 18% by market value. We have one of the finest SWFs and sufficiently transparent with annual report (Temasek Review) available on the website. Despite huge losses, it has a very strong track record and good performance in 2008. They have risk management team in place as well though the VAR in 2009 is scary (16% prob of losing 40 bn on a portfolio of 180 bn).</p>
              <p>So judge for yourself, is a good investment company one who never ever lose money (which is probablity extremely rare -- i haven't seen one yet) or is it one that invest prudently and gives its stakeholders a fair share of return consistently...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't agree. With tons of money in reserves, the govt can easily afford to provide free transport to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>citizens</strong></span>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SMRT is tipped to make 850-900 million in revenues this year. 80% of that comes from commuters (the rest from leasing out space at the stations), or around 700 million. Assuming 20% of that revenue comes from <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>non-citizens</strong></span>, the govt will have to shell out about 550 million a year to SMRT toward subsidizing free transport for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>citizens</strong></span>. That's just half a billion dollars. If the govt sets aside 20 billion, all <span style="text-decoration: underline;">citizens</span> can ride the trains free for a decade! So, your assertion is incorrect.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Healthcare is certainly a bigger burden than transport, but I believe the government can lighten the burden on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">citizens</span></strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the past 4-5 years, public hospitals have been seeing around 300,000 admissions (outpatients are about ten times as many). Assuming all of them were <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">citizens</span></strong>, and assuming the govt hands out $10,000 to each one (feel free to change that number, it is just a convenient one for me), it still adds up to just $3 billion a year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Temasek lost more than $60 billion! That sum could have gone towards subsidizing healthcare for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">citizens</span></strong> for a couple of decades.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People like you have an irrational fear of welfare and govt spending. And before you or anyone else pops up with "oh, that will require insanely high taxes," let me point out that Singapore collected over $37 billion in taxes in 2008! Surely taking out a couple of billion wouldn't hurt. Perhaps you think it will!</p>
