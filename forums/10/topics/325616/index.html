              <p>This will be a totally new and radical concept to increase our national birthrate, and may offend both conservative and liberal elements within our society. But then, an idea is better than to have no ideas, and a discussion is to objectively look into the concept and tweak it to make it better or perhaps offer another better alternative. For better or for worse, here it goes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Many Sporean men feel disadvantaged that they are the only ones to serve the nation while the women do not, in the interest of sexual equality, together with the sacrifices men have to make in their careers right up till they are 45 years old.</p>
              <p>2. There are successful career couples who love to have more children but are infertile, or fear giving birth, and not so well off couples who are fertile, but fear the cost of having more children, as well as successful middle aged career single women who fear giving birth or could not find the right man in time, missing on their biological urge and clock to have children and yet would love to have children as companion to share love and concern to old age.</p>
              <p>So how are we to reconcile such concerns and turn in to a benefit to the continuation of our society?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Birthrate Increase Social Engineering Plan</strong></span></p>
              <p>Aim: To increase our national birthrate</p>
              <p>Timeframe: 7 years experimental project.(renewable if necessary)</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage1</span></strong></p>
              <p>Couples whom are not so well off will be encouraged to have more children. They will get existing benefits and on top of all, they will be given a $1200 rebate on tax on each birth ( Equivalent salary of our NSmen)</p>
              <p>All medical expenses, including supplements, will be borned by the State (we the taxpayers). Once the child is borned, they will be given, free of encumberances to the State. These mothers must NEVER ever seek to find out whom these children are, espacially after these children had grown up, and the State (we the citizens) will not acknowledge such claims. Such terms will be strictly volunteerily done before they are placed on this programme. If they do not agree to the terms, they need not be placed on this track.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage 2</span></strong></p>
              <p>The State will then qualify career couples and single women whom wants children and assign the child to them for adoption. THIS IS NOT SELLING OF CHILDREN! There will be no money involved. Only qualified and children loving parents will be assigned to children. These parents will then look after these children and love them as their own, and contribute an additional tax of $1,200 a year till the child turns 18 years old, purpose being to offset taxpayers contribution for the biological mother's medical expenses.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage 2A</span></strong></p>
              <p>Should there be more children leftover without adoptive parents, they will become children of the State, and they will take on the sirname of our head of state, whom will protect and look after them using our funds(tax).</p>
              <p>They will be treated equally, with no social stigma, for their 'parents' are our head of state, and given full equal opportunity in all, shelter, food, clothes, medical attention, education.</p>
              <p>By age of 18 ( or 21 for Ugrads), they will then serve our country for a period of 7 years, in military, civilian or civil service, to return a debt of honour of which we taxpayers had borned during their development. Afterwhich, they will be free to stay or leave our country, which we will not interfere with their lives.</p>
              <p>I know this is a radical plan, and had sought to balance out the duties between child, parents and the State(taxpayers). With such a plan, perhaps there may be an increase in our birth rates, and a continuiaty of our national group amongst the race of humans. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: There may be some belief in Eugenics. It is total utter nonsense, believed by no academics of repute. Most of us early singaporeans came from middle classed and poor families, and made Spore great. It is Nurture, and not Nature, that makes well rounded and intelligent children. And such children, more often than not, DO need a good home environment to be nurtured, sadly a fact most not so well off parents would agree if they have more than 2 children.</p>

              <p>How can a government expect any support from its people which has no second thought in selfishly pushing away responsibility towards its own citizens by kinds of uncaring policies like leaving them in a lurch in bad time or replacing its own dischanted citizens just to get even or branding them as quitters.</p>
              <p>Has such a government any more moral authority to expect citizens to listen and cooperate with any such revival or loyalty programs for its survival sake?</p>

              I'm going to treat this as a joke. Its actually quite funny. Without discussing the morality of the issue (i.e can you sell babies?), lets see if it will work.
              
              I guess you are going to basically pay some poor people $1200 to have a kid to sell. Its a 9 month job (give or take, + some time for recovery). Which works out to less than 200 per month. Take into account the puking, difficulty in walking, etc, unless that person is dirt poor, I don't think anyone will one to take this kind of lobang.
              
              Then you assign the child to another family when it is born. Adoption has always been tricky, rich/successful people don't want just any kid. They want one with good genes, can study, etc ,etc. Even in sperm banks there are records of the person who donated the sperm. Not many people are going to adopt a kid whom they know nothing about the parents. 
              
              So they adopt a kid, give it care and love, AND still have to pay an extra $1200 per year for 18 years? Are you kidding? Who would do that? If I had the money, I would rather get a surrogate mother, I will know who the person is, what she ate during pregnancy, whether the baby got dropped on his head, etc .
              
              At the moment, there are plenty of kids up for adoption, even without this policy.  How many of them are actually placed in kind and loving homes? If we are such big believers in nurture, why don't we adopt kids from Indonesia and China? No need to pay people to give birth to them right?

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Clarifications:</p>
              <p>1. I am an adopted child of a family of 10,  and do know what 'emotional states' you people talk about. The so uncalled for 'slavery' or 'commodity' you talk about doesn't exist.</p>
              <p>My adoptive parents provided every of my need. I signed no bond to them. All they ask of me is to study and work hard, do no crime, be loyal to our citizens no matter who rules the State, and was free to pursue my interests.</p>
              <p>As i grew up, i realized my debt to them, for giving me the precious gift of life to grow up in Singapore, to know each beautiful day in my life and experience the sad from which i learnt. And this debt is a 'debt of honour', that is beyond any price value, a debt my fellow sperm brothers and sisters will never have to chance to know life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. I have the greatest respect for women. They are not procreation factories. They are human. But women, rich or poor, are biologically intuned to maternal instincts. They provide the greatest nurturing a child can have, the love, the concern, and the care. To place them in military service as NS is a mistake, against their nature. They make better mothers than soldiers. The plan calls for volunteer service, and not forced service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. This plan was thought up by me with much consideration and not some by-the-minute harebrained scheme. The BISEP plan is to add 'muscle' to our national citizenships, instead of relying solely on fickle mercenary FTs who stay for the money. We cannot rely on them forever, for they go where the money is, and would need to build up our resource.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. Japan had embark on a modernistic drive since the 1900s and have a headstart in realizing an 'aging population'. Their young now pays a heavy price to contribute to society to look after the old.</p>
              <p>Singapore is on the way towards an 'aging' population, and would suffer the same fate - our young paying more taxes. Fortunately, our soveriegn poverty fund had been a source of funds to complement our taxes for social spending. Can we be assured it will continue in our volitale financial world?</p>
              <p>Many claim that they will go overseas when spore sinks. But in truth, how many will be able to do so? The young and educated, the rich, can flee and would be wanted by host countries. But what the lower middle classes, the poor, the old, the children, whom are the backbone of our country and our future?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. And no, i represent no political party. I am fully responsible for my post alone, for brickbats, and apologise sincerly if i had alarmed or offended anyone here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Thus, this BISEP plan is to add muscle to our national citizenship, a plan for our future as a nation, a gift of life and love to children to grow up in our stable and peaceful country, protected and defended by hundreds thousands young citizens to continue the human race within our borders.   </p>

              <p>Your mother must be in a very distressed state to have to give you up to someone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If given a choice.. I am very sure she would have kept you and give you what your adoptive parents had given you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To make a mother part with her own child is a very heart wrenching and cruel thing to do .. let alone for a mere $1200.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think a mother's love and the bonds to her baby can be signed away on a piece of paper...sorry to say.. you are wrong.</p>
