              <p>They have to be more creative than this:</p>
              <p>Someone suggest NS duty rebate for fathers. Thats a good idea if it comes about. Not only does it save money for SAF but also rids the burden of fathers having to serve NS duty and concentrating more on their career. But leave them still liable to be called up for war.</p>
              <p>I belive this trade off is worth it as having children is a form of NS duty itself. A nation's psyche starts from the family at home. Then comes NS.</p>

                              <p>This will be a totally new and radical concept to increase our
              national birthrate, and may offend both conservative and liberal
              elements within our society. But then, an idea is better than to
              have no ideas, and a discussion is to objectively look into the
              concept and tweak it to make it better or perhaps offer another
              better alternative. For better or for worse, here it goes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Many Sporean men feel disadvantaged that they are the only
              ones to serve the nation while the women do not, in the interest of
              sexual equality, together with the sacrifices men have to make in
              their careers right up till they are 45 years old.</p>
              <p>2. There are successful career couples who love to have more
              children but are infertile, or fear giving birth, and not
              so well off couples who are fertile, but fear the cost
              of having more children, as well as successful middle aged
              career single women who fear giving birth or could not find
              the right man in time, missing on their biological urge and clock
              to have children and yet would love to have children as
              companion to share love and concern to old age.</p>
              <p>So how are we to reconcile such concerns and turn in to a
              benefit to the continuation of our society?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Birthrate
              Increase Social Engineering Plan</strong></span></p>
              <p>Aim: To increase our national birthrate</p>
              <p>Timeframe: 7 years experimental project.(renewable if
              necessary)</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage1</span></strong></p>
              <p>Couples whom are not so well off will be encouraged to have more
              children. They will get existing benefits and on top of all, they
              will be given a $1200 rebate on tax on each birth ( Equivalent
              salary of our NSmen)</p>
              <p>All medical expenses, including supplements, will be borned by
              the State (we the taxpayers). Once the child is borned, they will
              be given, free of encumberances to the State. These mothers must
              NEVER ever seek to find out whom these children are, espacially
              after these children had grown up, and the State (we the citizens)
              will not acknowledge such claims. Such terms will be strictly
              volunteerily done before they are placed on this programme. If they
              do not agree to the terms, they need not be placed on this
              track.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage
              2</span></strong></p>
              <p>The State will then qualify career couples and single women whom
              wants children and assign the child to them for adoption. THIS IS
              NOT SELLING OF CHILDREN! There will be no money involved. Only
              qualified and children loving parents will be assigned to children.
              These parents will then look after these children and love them as
              their own, and contribute an additional tax of $1,200 a year till
              the child turns 18 years old, purpose being to offset taxpayers
              contribution for the biological mother's medical expenses.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stage
              2A</span></strong></p>
              <p>Should there be more children leftover without adoptive
              parents, they will become children of the State, and they will
              take on the sirname of our head of state, whom will protect and
              look after them using our funds(tax).</p>
              <p>They will be treated equally, with no social stigma, for their
              'parents' are our head of state, and given full equal opportunity
              in all, shelter, food, clothes, medical attention, education.</p>
              <p>By age of 18 ( or 21 for Ugrads), they will then serve our
              country for a period of 7 years, in military, civilian or civil
              service, to return a debt of honour of which we taxpayers had
              borned during their development. Afterwhich, they will be free to
              stay or leave our country, which we will not interfere with their
              lives.</p>
              <p>I know this is a radical plan, and had sought to balance out the
              duties between child, parents and the State(taxpayers). With
              such a plan, perhaps there may be an increase in our birth rates,
              and a continuiaty of our national group amongst the race of
              humans. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: There may be some belief in Eugenics. It is total utter
              nonsense, believed by no academics of repute. Most of us early
              singaporeans came from middle classed and poor families, and made
              Spore great. It is Nurture, and not Nature, that makes well rounded
              and intelligent children. And such children, more often than
              not, DO need a good home environment to be nurtured, sadly a
              fact most not so well off parents would agree if they have more
              than 2 children.</p>

              <p>The neccessity, aims, financing, reasons and logic provided is true and valid, an issue our society will face if we are to survive as a nation, espacially for those who cannot leave the country, should our country sinks (IF), no matter which political party is ruling over us. However, there is a fatal flaw in the whole design - the biological mother. The simple post by Elindra fired the arrow.</p>
              <p>As i am an adopted child, i believe that some mothers would give away their children easily, as was my case. There are even reports annually of parents ill-treating their child, some killing their children, some giving them away, some neglecting them, not only amongst the poor, but even the rich.</p>
              <p>Thus, why not let these women, rich or poor, serve a higher calling, the way we all sporean men served to protect and defend our nation, to provide children for those whom are capable and whom wants them?</p>
              <p>But perhaps, as Elindra had pointed out, there may be some women who will develope a bond with the baby inside her. Giving it up may rent an emotional scar in her being. She is also a human, a fellow citizen, do our society have the heart to do such a seemingly heartless thing to her, even if she is the only one amongst many who don't mind?</p>
              <p>I don't know. It may be a bad concept plan. Perhaps someone can come up with a better solution to our low birth rate, leading to an aging population and higher taxes extracted from our next generation?</p>
              <p>Would forsaking our flag be an option, as recommended by our neighbours who would love to see Singapore sink, as well as those ex-singaporeans who would love nothing better than to be proven right in their decision to abandon Singapore?</p>

              <p>A higher calling? I hate higher callings. How can people's joy, in this case their children be offered against their will to serve a "higher calling"? Do you understand what you are saying? You are saying that these parents who are poor have to give birth to children and watch as their children is given to others. "Children of the state"? Singapore is a democratic country, japan is facing these problems too. But are not coming out with all these things.</p>
              <p>Therefore, on point</p>
              <p>1. Singapore is not quite so desprate yet as to use these solutions.</p>
              <p>2. Children are not to be used as a commodity. Lets take the example of the women. They were once being used as commodity. But they fought. By using children, we are exploiting them in the worst case ever. For children are too powerless to fight for what they want.</p>
              <p>3. Japan is also at a stage of ageing population, they are not yet thinking of such things.</p>
              <p>4. This is a democratic country. Therefore, people have freedom of choice over their own children.</p>
              <p>5. Do not even dream that we will agree with you on this. Even if you are able to argue your points so well we cannot argue back, on a moral level, we will not agree to such things.</p>
              <p>6. As soon as this is implemented, fewer people will want to give birth. Parents love for their children are such that they do not want their children to suffer. Even before birth, the love is still there. And because of it, your plan will not work out. In the worst possible situation, there will be very few people giving birth.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>there is alot of hate and objection in this thread. he did mention at the beginning that some of you might find it offensive. Im just going to agree that yes this plan is good <strong>without</strong> an extended national slavery for these kids and they should be given a fair chance without being born with dept, but this idea is still far from being accepted by current social mindset, maybe in a hundred years time where values change. and by then we dont really need a solution anymore, the original singaporeans will become a minority group.</p></div>

              <p>Dear 951,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your post. I fully deserved your emotional outburst directed towards me, even if some of the points i raised you had misunderstood, for we are dealing with a fully emotionally charged subject, a bitter truth that we all will have to face up to eventually.</p>
              <p>However, i do take issue with your use of the word 'commodity' on children to support your indignation.</p>
              <p>Children are never a commodity or slave. Eversince the dawn of civilisation, mankind had realised they represent our future on this beautiful planet we live in, and had strive to protect them and even give their lives to let them inherit a better world than the one they lived.</p>
              <p>It is only a minority of human that see children as commodity and slaves, such as farming communities that had problems getting labour, and nomadic cultures that sees children as a means of living in comfort, having several of them through numerous wives.</p>
              <p>But in Singapore, we treasure and cherish our children, sporean men ready to give up their lives to protect them, parents giving them the gift of life and having the fullest intention to let them inherit a better world, as evident in our social and education spending, even as some of them forsake our society eventually by leaving our shores. Thus the charge that we treat children as 'commodity' or 'slaves' is an unworthy, contemptible and heartrending accusation of our society.</p>
              <p>But there are some mothers who would readily give up their children, one way or another.</p>
              <p>I personally encountered a foundling under a HDB block. The less than a year old baby was swathed in quilt and cushions in a basket, with a note seeking someone to take good care of her. She was a  lovely fair skinned chubby baby.</p>
              <p>I reached down to her to pull her quilt cover down as it was a hot morning, and her chubby tiny fingers reach up to grasp my finger and gave me the sweetest smile i had ever experienced in my life, and looked so trustingly to me. I look around, but there was no one around, except for this baby abandoned under the stairs. I called the police and let them handle the affair.</p>
              <p>I am only human. I couldn't help but wondered why such a sweet and lovely child could be abandoned. Which mother could be so heartless? Even no matter how poor, our society will always help, even if limited. That night, i went to a coffeeshop when it was about to close and ordered several bottles of beer, to get myself drunk to forget the iniquity and unfairness others inflict on a child, and the life of this poor innocent baby. My beer tasted exceedingly salty that night....</p>
              <p>Sorry that i had digress. Whatever the agreements or disagreements to the BISEP plan when fully understood, it would had been food for thought. </p>

              <p>Had you ever had only 80cts in your pocket and had to walk 15km home just because you don't have 10cts more to take a short bus trip?</p>
              <p>Had you lived on just red bean bun for lunch?</p>
              <p>Had you seen how a child just drink only water or ravage dustbins for scrap?</p>
              <p>Had you seen how parents whom love their children, had many, and yet could not even afford to pay electricity bills for home, let alone education for their children?</p>
              <p>Fortunately there are not many such people in Spore, as our State( our society) had contributed a lot, but being only a population of est 3million of middle class, there is only how much we can offer.</p>
              <p>It is easy to lay claims that 'no mother should be made to give up their children' if one lived in palaces and knows not the realistic suffering others go through-be him/her rich or poor.</p>
              <p>Throughout the course of civilisation, there had always been rich and poor. In Spore, we had done everything we could to elevate the largely poor into an afluent middle class. But no matter how, there will still be some who fall through the cracks. But this topic is not really about the poor, but how we can help increase birthrate by having Sporeans have more babies, regardless of rich or poor.</p>
              <p>Many claim to want babies, but put off by raising costs. It would seem thus that they are not prepared to sacrifice for their child and see child bearing in terms of monetary calculations. Thus, it is this specific target group who would be probably fertile and given the monetary incentive to give birth and spare the costs of rearing the children, leaving it to those whom love and want children, rich or poor. </p>

              oh well at least it wasn't what I expected when I read the first few paragraphs.
              
              I was expecting him to say all women will be made to do national service by having a kid at 18 years old. Care of the child will be by state or wahtever.........
              
              anyway back to the topic. Weird idea economically might be viable, but no way pple are going to accept it. And I shudder at the fate of the kids
