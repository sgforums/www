So by allowing Zahari's story to be told, it's comparatively balanced.<br><br>When you listen to his tale, you will understand why he is so emotional.<br><br>In most cases, for us laymen, the truth always lies in between. But the issue here is that the government is intent on making us listen to their version as the holy truth.<br><br>If you want to build up Singapore into a mature nation, this is not the way to go. I've said so many times, ideology should not get in the way of pragmatism, especially when we want to become an information hub, yet there is this anachronism in place that only serves to make us a laughing stock abroad, in places where we ARE COMPETING with for talent and expatriates.<br><br>Does this advance the cause of national growth? No. Definitely not. What you will get are materialistic immigrants and expats who may be less socially mature because they are willing to accept that financial success is the only benchmark, and not other forms of benchmarks that measure a society like socio-cultural freedom and political maturity.<br><br>I wonder if remaking Singapore actually works when you have things like these happening. It's bad enough to log into Newsnow and see a whole page of links showing international newspapers and EU papers slamming us for either banning their MPs from talking at a forum on international democracy and liberalism, and in the words of MP Samuelson, "threatening them with arrest".<br><br>Gee, it's damn hurtful to see Singapore ripped apart in the foreign arena for things that we ordinary citizens didn't do, and it's we laymen who suffer when we go abroad for visits and business.<br><br>They should really think long and hard, and logically too.</div>
