            <div class='col-md body'>First broadcast: 25 July 03,<br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/analysis/030725_jagdish.htm" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Radio Singapore International </span></a><br><br>Producer: Bharati Jagdish<br><br><span class="small"><span style="color: darkred;">Singapore took out a full-page advertorial in the Asian Wall Street Journal today to counter a media blitz by Malaysia on the protracted dispute over the price of water<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Malaysia had launched an eight-day media campaign in the Malaysian press and the Asian Wall Street Journal, accusing Singapore of making huge profits from the sale of Malaysian water to Singapore.<br><br>Malaysia has also released a 20-page booklet on the water issue which it says is intended to "set the record" straight.<br>This came three months after a booklet "Water Talks? If only it could" was released by Singapore stating its position on the dispute.<br><br>Singapore's advertorial in the Asian Wall Street Journal today states that the Singapore government is still ready to resolve the water dispute with Malaysia in accordance with the terms of the 1961 and 1962 water agreements.<br><br>Central to the discussion, is not how much Singapore pays for the water but how any price revision is decided upon.<br>In the advertorial, Singapore also pointed out that Malaysia had first agreed and then changed its mind on the price of water.<br><br>In October last year, Malaysia unilaterally broke off the talks.<br>That left arbitration as the only recourse as provided for in the two water accords.<br><br>However, political observers have questioned the wisdom of both countries in running advertisements to make their points.<br>They say that quiet diplomacy would have been a much better option.<br>Professor P. Ramasamy (PR) is from the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.<br><br>PR: "One cannot take a legal or moral perspective on these things. One should take a more diplomatic perspective on this. Singapore might be right and Malaysia might be right, it's all relative. I think what can be done is basically, just put things aside, and I don't agree that Singapore should have come out with those letters, even though Singapore might have thought they were right, given all the controversies. I also don't think it was right for Malaysia to come out with the subsequent publication. I think the best, amicable settlement is through quiet diplomacy. By politicising the issue, by putting it in the press, I think they have really created problems for themselves. I think both are childish."<br><br>Mr Arun Mahizhnan (AM) is Deputy Director at the Institute of Policy Studies in Singapore. He says that the advertorials did not do anything to elucidate the matter for the public either.<br><br>AM: "In terms of public communication, there is a need to tell the larger public what the issues are, but I'm not at all sure that an advertising campaign is the right way to go about it. This sort of campaign will generate a lot of heat, but very little illumination. Then, when there is a tit-for-tat kind of response from both sides, nobody wins in the end and those who believe that one side is right, will not really be persuaded by this kind of campaign because the campaigns, by necessity, will have to be very brief and you can't really discuss the complexities of the issues in a newspaper ad campaign.<br><br>"In a way, I suppose, Malaysia had been prompted to do this sort of thing by certain publications on Singapore's side, but whether the newspaper ad campaign is the right response, I'm not at all sure. Neither am I sure that Singapore needed to respond through the advertising campaign. I suppose I can understand the compulsion that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs felt about this, but at the end of it all, we really need to go back to the negotiating table. That's where the real dialogue will take place, not through the mass media."<br><br>But can negotiations really be revived successfully at this stage. Arun Mahizhnan.<br><br>AM: "Neither Singapore nor Malaysia have failed to negotiate any other way. They have been trying very hard. This just happens to be a wrinkle, as far as I'm concerned. They had in the past, and I believe they will continue in the future, to negotiate in the normal diplomatic way as they have done very often. Once in while, things do flare up. That's understandable because there is a lot at stake and this has been simmering for a long time. So while this is rather upsetting to both sides, I don't think it will continue as the modus operandi."<br><br>Professor P. Ramasamy (PR) from the Universiti Kebangasaan Malaysia stressed the importance of not jeopardising the current relationship with continuing advertisements.<br><br>PR: "These two countries have a historical relationship. Malaysians have relatives in Singapore and vice-versa. Singapore is very crucial in terms of the development of Johor. There are so many common interests. I don't understand why these leaders would make very egoistical statements which actually spoil the whole thing. The best policy is to stop publishing and do some quiet diplomacy."</span></span><br><br></div>
