            <div class='col-md body'>My sympathies to the hostages taken by the radical group. But what can we say..the world is now changing. Our main threat is no longer form neighbouring countries nor nuclear bombs. Terrorism is the way to go now. Its like..a new fab...ever since the US backed out from a middle east country because of a terror suicide attack on its troops housing..it has shown that terrorism works.And now it has been an ever so 'popular' tactic. I agree also that the US can no longer backup. U cannot leave now and let them be run by another dictator.. they should stay n control the situation..but as we all know..the situation isnt getting any better..innocent contrators , aid workers , juornalists are being killed. mutilated and hunged at lamp posts..i mean...the US doesnt seem to be getting any gratefullness...i dont seem to understand, maybe its in thier blood..they just wanna kill. main n riddle u with holes.THey think they can run thier own country already with Saddam gone..unfortunately.I think i got sidetracked in the topic! ANYWAYS! backing away means we stand in to terrorism. 3 japs is nothing compared to the 2000 killed in Sept 11 or the Madrid bombing of more then 200 dead..its a price to pay to fight terrorism.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why I put Japan only grade 3 terrorist and not grade 2 ? Because Japan not yet fighting other countries.

            <div class='col-md body'>Those governments are dumb. Why get themselves into this mess? Our government is dumb too. They had once offered to send help to Iraq or something but US says there's no need or what. That's good otherwise maybe our fellow Singaporeans might be in the same state as those captured Japanese. &gt;&lt;<br><br>You know, let the idiots who started the mess clean it up. Namely the Americans and British (and those who invaded Iraq if there's any other). Why should the other countries suffer because of the mess they insisted to start?<br><br>I'm so amused that quite a number of Americans who agreed on the war previously are now on the opposition camp they once despised.<br><br>My heart goes out to the 3 captured Japanese who had been abandoned by their government for the sake of face and to suck up to the US government.</div>
