He only a cabbie. Not that I blame him. He is very decent except he is too face proud for his own good. You know la. Taxi driver cannot earn much one what. Thing I don't like is, he bloody stingy with his own family. Seldom even want to take my mum for a good meal. Then people doing mlm outside persuade persuade only, he buy their stuff at stupid price. Go out with friends also like to anyhow waste money.<br><br>For the life of me I cannot understand why Singaporeans are so pig headed. You are only near rich when you have more than a million in cash excluding property etc. No money still want to pretend for what. NO matter how much you "dress" yourself up. No money means low class or no class. It doesn't make a difference. You got see millionaires associate with "classy" people with no money want mei? Give me a break. Maybe thats why the govt needs CPF man. Because many Singaporeans too pig headed like my dad to even know how to maintain his own finance. </div></blockquote>u should apply Sunzi Bingfa....Art of War strategy i would recommend u is to become MLM member and earn his money.......whahahaaa</div>
