            <div class='col-md body'>What do you guys think about this?<br><br>I figure the PAP will never do that, even if it was to the detriment of our country if they do not.<br><br>I wonder if they are caught in the web of groupthink... where they figure what they are is best for everyone the hell with what everyone thinks?  But is their "best for everyone" is actually "best for the Party"?<br><br>Most have been subverted.  Veloo even gave examples of Vivian Balakrishnan from being someone who would run alternatives for the powers into one who toes the party line, for better or worse of the people.<br><br>Would a split be good?  Will it even happen?<br><br>Personally, I think Veloo hit the nail right on the head.  There needs to be a change.  The PAP is running the country to the ground... our youth has lost its spark, mired in apathy... or worse, mistrust and resignation...<br><br>Alas...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It takes someone with vision, a strong hand and the guile to form a breakaway party from the ruiling PAP.<br><br>These ppl must fit the profile of having the qualifications and experience to convince our local population that they have what it takes to be an alternative to the PAP with equal capabilities.<br><br>Somehow, i doubt our PM will ever warm to the idea. Our SM will surely scoff at such an attempt.<br><br>The only way this can happen is that a major disagreement within the ranks of the PAP forces several players to leave the PAP circle and start a new one...as part of the opposition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sadly, some of the best brains that have left the PAP are the retired Cabinet Ministers, who are restricted from any acts of Opposition due to the oath of office that they have made.<br><br>Even for those who have left the PAP, I believe that their oath of commitment to the Party has also restricted their freedom after leaving the Party.<br><br>Those who have left the PAP, and breached their oath of allegiance have paid a heavy price for their seeming betrayal to the Party.<br><br>Sadly, their action and personal bravery is not seen as an act of LOYALTY to Singapore.<br><br>It seems that allegiance to the Party takes higher precedence than allegiance to SINGAPORE.<br><br>Such is the twisted logic that exist, in which only members of the Ruling Party has expressed "TRUE LOYALTY" to Singapore, and all others are considered uncommitted "fence sitters".<br><br>If anyone dare to hold an opposing or alternate view, then you do so at the risk of your own economic and pollitical future in Singapore.<br><br>Sadly, many LOYAL Singaporeans have paid a heavy price, by having their character profile and integrity assasinated; forced to leave Trade Unions, University Posts, Public Employment.<br><br>Petty vindictiveness even go to the extent where the Tax Department, Licensing Authorities, Legal Departments, and a multitude of government services, are mobilised to prevent any SINGAPOREAN from ever expressing their version of LOYALTY to Singapore.<br><br>Again, LOYALTY to the Ruling POLITICAL Party comes BEFORE Loyalty to SINGAPORE.<br><br>Little wonder that "Play Schools" and "Kindergartens" are only allowed to exist in the void decks of HDB blocks, if it is runned by the Ruling Party, so that the "education" of the Young starts at even before the "Kindergarten" Stage.<br><br>This seems to be a familiar practise found in the People's Republic of China; and yet we are frightened of hidden Communist Cells within our Society. With the ghosts of a underground communist cells being used to label and frame any intellectually talented Singaporeans who dare to be vocal, and will not co-operate or join the Ruling Party.<br><br>Where will this bring us ?<br><br>Will the present structure of uncorruptible Government outlast the next generation of "talented leaders" - who are handpicked from a restricting and diminishing pool of local Singaporean Talent ?<br><br>With the "Talented" being enticed to Public Office by the "Million Dollar Remuneration Package", and not for the Honor of Public Service.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, we all have the PAP's answer to Veloo...<br><br>The all-knowing, all-powerful PAP tells someone who thinks "out of the box" that his suggestion is "Simplistic, unrealistic".<br><br>In the reply, the usual song and dance was given.. lots of self-praise, lots of BS about "without PAP, all would have been lost".<br><br>Sheesh... they did a lot for the country, but what have they done for the country lately?<br><br>The country is more important than things like loyalty to party... loyalty to party is important, but it shrinks to nothing beside loyalty to country.</div>
