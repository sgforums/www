            <div class='col-md body'><br>US expected to restrain executive pay<br><br>http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/us-expected-to-restrain-executive-pay/2007/03/09/1173166980733.html<br><br>INVESTORS should be seen but not heard when boards of directors are setting salaries for top executives, John Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, told US Congress on Thursday.<br><br>"Corporations were never designed to be democracies," said Mr Castellani, whose organisation represents chief executives of large US companies. "While shareholders own a corporation, they don't run it."<br><br>But many members of the House Financial Services Committee voiced support for the legislation to restrain executive compensation. The bill would allow shareholders to take an annual non-binding vote to express their approval or disapproval of executive pay plans.<br><br>Committee chairman Barney Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts, introduced the bill on March 1 in response to shareholder advocates who have been calling for "say-on-pay" votes to dampen the growth of compensation packages.<br><br>Mr Frank said such votes would discourage excesses without imposing heavy regulation. "There have been past efforts to have the government set salaries," Mr Frank said. "That would be a mistake."<br><br>Bill co-sponsor David Scott, a Democrat from Georgia, said he supported say-on-pay votes because compensation had become "dangerously outsized." With CEO pay rising far more rapidly than average wages, "rank and file employees are being left behind," he said.<br><br>In 2005, annual median CEO pay in the US was $US13.5 million ($17.4 million), up 16 per cent from 2004, according to Corporate Library, a research group.<br><br>Harvard Law School Professor Lucian Bebchuk said that in 2003, the average CEO got about 500 times as much pay as the average worker, compared with a multiple of 140 in 1991.<br><br>In a number of countries, including Britain, Australia and Sweden, shareholders already vote on executive compensation.<br><br>But in the US, where private-equity funds often generate lavish compensation for top executives, the "hounding of public-company CEOs may have a major cost," University of Chicago professor Steven Kaplan said.<br><br>"CEOs can and will leave public companies to do something else. And it is the better CEOs who will tend to do so."<br><br>Many Republicans expressed worries about CEO pay, if not outright support for the bill intended to head off such pay for poor performance.<br><br>"I am troubled by news media reports of enormous compensation packages for corporate executives, especially when they seem to reward incompetence," said Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the senior Republican on the committee.<br><br>"Lavish executive compensation packages for CEOs have contributed to the growing public perception - justified or not - that the rules in corporate America are rigged in favour of well-insulated insiders."<br><br>The House committee is expected to approve the legislation at a March 21 meeting.</div>
