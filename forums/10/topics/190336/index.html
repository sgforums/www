Singapore is our home indeed, and we should not escape the responsibility in keeping the island clean and safe, and making it a better society and economy... so...

Please read and mind your word. First of all in my post I did not mention that ( you are saying most of us, the singaporeans do not contribute or did not contribute to singapore? ) I never say most singaporeans never contribute to Singapore. Yes, I agree that you may have done your contribution like what you have mentioned above, but that does not apply to all. And what i have post previously I never said anything in my words that i am applying to every singaporean. If you blame government for all these taxes and increase of living expenses here and there, if you are not happy with it, you can migrate to other country. I agree we must have opposition in Singapore, but that dosent mean we can blame the government for these and that. If you think you can do better, go and try to be a gorvernment in Singapore and try to build Singapore since 1965 till now 2006 without increase of taxes and living expenses ok. By the way what you mean by ( You fool <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). I am not one, but I think you might be.</div>

First of all, to all my dear Singaporeans, you people keep on talking about who to vote and why we vote, and what we vote for even the elections is over. You people always demand things here and there. Demand good oppositions, demand good government, demand low tax, demand upgrading, demand government to low the price of this and that. BUT in the other way, have you all give it a thought? Did you people contribute back to the society? Not just the money you make when there is charity show or flag day. Just ask yourself, what have you all done that have really help Singapore and the mankind.<br><br><strong>Instead of demand and asking, we should try giving and contributing.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>How about you, what have you done?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What the general Singaporeans have done for the last 10 years is to be the most obedient people in the whole world in fattening the reserves and some one assets, getting miserable salary and allowing foreign talent in getting all the jobs, sponsoring oversea foreign talent huge sum of money and medals money but seeing local sport authority refusing to invest on the local female gym team to go asian games.<br><br>What the singaporeans have done is already admirable to the extent that we have become mockery of other nations.<br><br>We see money invested to laying beautiful tiles on the corridor and fancy garden instead of the ever increasing number of old people digging aluminium cans from the dustbin.<br><br>I guessed I have to start getting a taxi and cleaner training certificate as what the PM have stated in his national rally speech last year.<br><br>It is kind of irony that the people can laugh when the PM quoted the example of the cleaner as that is their eventual destiny if they cannot repay the life-long debts that they are presenting serving.<br><br>Singaporeans - Life-Long Debters and Slaves.<br></div>
