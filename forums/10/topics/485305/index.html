Younger people pay a lower premium, while older people pay a higher sum.<br>The Government is now planning to introduce MediShield Life, which covers people for life.<br>There has been some discussion about pre-funding for MediShield Life ("Problems with pre-funding" by Mr David Boey, last Tuesday; "Merits of pre-funding" by Ms Maria Loh Mun Foong; last Thursday; and "Caring for the old should be the norm" by Mr Geoffrey Kung; Forum Online, last Thursday).<br>The aim is for the insured person to pay a level premium to cover him for life. This is akin to<a style="color: #005688;" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_insurance"> a life insurance policy</a>.<br>In both cases, the claim rate is lower for younger people and higher for older people. Pre-funding allows a person to pay a level premium that is deemed by an actuary to be sufficient for his lifetime.<br><strong>There is, however, one key difference that makes pre-funding not feasible for MediShield Life.<br>In a whole-life policy, the sum assured is fixed for the duration of the contract.<br>For medical insurance, the cost of treatment is expected to rise over the years due to inflation. Also, the cost depends on the choice of hospital and specialists, and can vary significantly from one claim to another.<br>Some countries have adopted measures to make medical treatment more affordable for older people through cross-subsidies and supported by general taxation. They do not try to achieve this goal by using pre-funding under individual contracts.</strong><br>Tan Kin Lian<br>Copyright © 2014 Singapore Press Holdings.

              <strong>Already, the element of prefunding exists in the form of medisave</strong>, whereby individuals involuntarily contribute to a medical savings account with extremely limited usage options unless they have proven terminal illness conditions of extremely short life-expectancy: e.g. strict claim limits, limits based upon claim type/ treatment incident: e.g. in-patient vs out-patient, claim per chemotherapy treatment; ban on claims for cosmetic treatments, acute illnesses(cough n colds etc) etc.<br><br><strong>Compared to <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_insurance">whole life insurance (insurance on life or the occurrence of a terminal illness)</a>, insurance covering medical treatment is a whole lot more complex if not unpredictable </strong>with the possibility of involving <strong>unlimited</strong> claim incidences depending on the onset, severity and permanence of the medical condition (e.g. kidney dialysis which last lifetime). Life insurance on the other hand is one of the simplest forms of insurance, contractually involving ONLY ONE POSSIBLE CLAIM: I.e. a FIXED, PRE-AGREED lump sum benefit payable upon a terminal event/incident (death or terminal, incurable illness); henforth after the claim, the life-insurance policy/contract is ceased (payee is either terminally ill but 'paid', or else dead in sudden accident (estate gets paid): the sum assured is FIXED (or equals the total amount of accrued principle including bonus eqrned over years if the policy value exceeds the guaranteed death/ terminal illness payout sum.)<br><br><strong>In medical insurance however, the total payout sum is IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT due to advances in medical technology, medical costs inflation, lifespan of the individual, quality of care expected, frequency of hospitalisation, availability of domestic help (some people cannot be discharged because care givers not free/ 'busy' etc)</strong>:<br>Just like NHS in the UK/ USA national pension schemes, bankruptcy awaits due to an excessive claims to premiums record: with even government support doing little to improve finances when claims eventually far outpace all premiums paid.<br><br>Medishield-life sows the seeds of failed promises. There is no free lunch in this world; no solution to an unhealthy lifestyle (diabetes, smoking, obesity etc). Where preventive healthcare fails, no insurance scheme can restore the loss without the high risk of bankruptcy or extremely high running costs.<br><br><strong>Prefunding already exists in the claims restricted nature of the CPF medisave account.</strong> If gahmen focuses on healthy lifestyle/ preventive healrthcare amongst all, boosts up medifund to fund the medical cost of the needy only, then there is reduced need to prefund the moral hazard of what is basically a fools errand to manage (prefunded Medishield-life premiums), and thus reduce the risk of medishield/ worse: compulsory Medishield-life eventually succumbing to become another bankrupt/exposed ponzi scheme.<br><br>Senior generation Singaporeans should also not ill forget the words of Lee Kuan Yew as they marvel at his son's mathematical acrobatics as he "<em>derails the idea of having individual accounts for CPF and Medisave.</em>":<br>

              <p>Fact that Singapore is justifying introducing more foreigners as citizens is proof that the Singapore gahmen did not plan for an aging population:</p>
              <p>Healthy lifestyle campaigns: none significant: so many $inkies are diabetic/ full of chronic disease that they need Medishield-life: a prefunded ponzi like scheme to subsidise.</p>
              <p>Enough savings and affordable cost of living: NONE since they let the property price go out of hand (and further still with subsidies for asset-rich folks(Medishield-life subsidies for asset rich folks)): which means forever escalating costs of living: a massive problem for retirees etc.</p>
              <p>Many gahmen policies are ponzi in nature, it is just that the people don't notice mostly  because other country gahmen also run similar/ worse ponzi schemes.</p>
              <p>Many of these ponzi schemes result in war: local or otherwise, and then the cycle continues under one dictator or another...</p>
