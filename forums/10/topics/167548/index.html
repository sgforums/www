            <div class='col-md body'>There's no contradiction between supporting the death penalty and not supporting its mandatory nature.  All it means is that some judgement needs to be exercised when sentences are passed.<br><br>Unfortunately, unless some radical fundamental changes are made in Singapore's courts, I doubt this will happen.  After all, since even before Yong Pung How took over the bench and announced his mandate, I don't believe there has been any change in the government's policy of making the judicial processes more efficient, which translates into turning it into a rubber-stamp process.  Why waste time thinking about something when you can go with a mandatory sentence without a second thought and move on to the next case?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't find any prolem with the death sentence per se, but what is it about its being mandatory that gives it more deterrent effect than a non-mandatory death sentence?  Even if the sentence is not mandatory, if the case is proven the sentence will most likely be passed, so anybody planning to commit the crime will still know what they're in for.<br><br>For certain crimes, the nature of the case pretty much determines if the convict's life should be forfeit.  For example, there's no reason why someone who's murdered someone in cold blood should be given the benefit he knowingly denied someone else.  Such a sentence may be passed if the death penalty exists but is not mandatory.<br><br>On the other hand, there's more harm in an inflexible mandatory system than in one where judges are trusted to consider and accommodate for the mitigating circumstances.  No system of law is perfect, and as such the only sensible thing to do is to provide leeway for dealing with cases that are not run-of-the-mill.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>As I understand, capital punishment is made mandatory for serious crimes to take the decision on sentence from the judges. The argument against it is that judges should be given leeway to consider litigation and other circumstances. The argument for it is that judges are then free from interference or harassment in their sentences. In Indonesia the religious supporters demonstration outside of courthouse is harassment. We have also seen pressure from Philippines, America (in the case of canning) and Australia on judgment involving their nationals. Â“MandatoryÂ” ensures that if a minister, a wealthy businessman or even a judgeÂ’s grandson were caught trafficking, he meets the hangman.<br><br>Death penalty for arms possession, armed robberies and kidnapping appear rather irrelevant now as these crimes are no longer Â“profitableÂ” relative to the risk involved. And anybody who robs with an arm is likely to be using a toy gun, and kidnappings are committed for other reasons than for ransom of money. I think in these cases, Â“mandatoryÂ” should be abolished for judges to consider the different circumstances. These are no longer syndicate crimes and if the syndicate does exist, they are not likely to threaten and influence judgments.<br><br>We canÂ’t say the same for drugs related crime. Illegal drugs abuses are still rampant in the region. Illegal drugs trafficking is a highly profitable business, Singapore remains an attractive transit point in the international drugs network. We should continue to put on the wall Â“drugs trafficking means deathÂ” and stay firm in what we do.<br><br>We may, and probably should review the types and amount of illegal drugs involved for mandatory drugs, as I understand cannabis is less addictive now but mixture of ice with certain substances enhances the feeling but becomes 8 times more addictive.<br><br>We should never amend, let alone abolish, any or part of our judicial process, under the pressure of foreign bodies, to please the media or politicians, or as a compromise to any ideologies.<br></div>
