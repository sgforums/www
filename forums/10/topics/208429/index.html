Cossman MD<br><br><blockquote> As we exited the parkway and stopped at a red light, the cabbie opened his window and pointed to a three-storied light green building with a red neon caduceus flashing over the entrance.<br><br>"You can get a great hernia repair in there for $390," he said.<br><br>I was stunned. ......<br><br>"Three hundred ninety dollars out the door, tax and license? No ups, no extras?" I asked. Obviously, being an American, even as a doctor, I was unprepared to have an adult discussion about the cost of a surgical procedure in such stark economic terms.<br><br>I gave the cabbie a big tip and got up to my room as soon as I could to find out more about Singapore health on my laptop. The cabbie had it about right. The state of healthcare in Singapore by all the usual measurable parameters (per capita doctors, per capita hospital beds, admissions per 100,000 people, frequency of CTs and MRIs, life expectancy and infant mortality) was excellent.<br><br><strong> Comparing Singapore healthcare with ours was starting to look like Singapore Airlines versus US AirwaysÂ—which is fine if you like flying 1985 Plymouths. But here's the kicker. The price tag for all this is is only 3.8% of GDP, compared to versus 15% in the United States</strong>. Even more remarkable, government spending on healthcare is less than one-third of the total, whereas here it is more than half. Actually, it's a lot more than half if you add up Medicare, Medicaid and the enormous tax subsidy of employer-sponsored insurance. Somehow, the private markets for healthcare are working in Singapore but not here, which is odd because the United States is the recognized world leader in markets and the efficient use of capital.</blockquote>--- Dr. Cossman is the medical director of the vascular laboratory, the director of vascular trauma and the director of resident education in vascular surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

            <div class='col-md body'>An interesting article by the Minister of Health:<br><br>LAST week, I met Health Minister Gao Qiang in Beijing. We chit-chatted and shared our experiences. We both knew that it is tough being a health minister.<br>This is because patients expect us to do magic. They expect us to deliver a very high standard of medical service but at a very low cost, preferably free. These objectives are almost contradictory. How can we deliver First World health care at Third World costs?<br><br>Early this week, I read a newspaper article (ST, Aug 4) which quoted Indian Tourism Minister Ambika Soni as saying that India offers 'the best treatment for one-fifth of the cost (in the West)'. For example, bone marrow transplants cost US$30,000 (S$47,000) in India as compared with US$250,000 in the US. Likewise, cardiac surgery in India costs a quarter of that in the US.<br><br>But hospitals offering US standards of care are rare exceptions in India.<br><br>The bulk of health care in India remains at Third World level. Hence, it is possible for a few hospitals to offer US standards of care while leveraging on the large number of health-care workers who remain on Third World wages.<br><br>The challenge is to keep wages and costs at Third World levels while the rest of the health-care system moves to First World standards. It is almost impossible.<br><br>With globalisation, the wages of health-care workers as well as the prices of medical products are converging. Cross-border migration of health-care workers is now common. For a small country like Singapore, we import most of our medical products, like drugs and X-ray equipment. We have to pay international prices for these imports.<br><br>With people living longer and mothers producing fewer babies, uncontrollable healthcare costs can potentially wreck our finances, not to mention create major political problems.<br><br>Singapore is fortunate that our founding fathers were successful in developing the economy. With clean water, clean air and good sanitation, the health of our people has improved over the years. We now enjoy high life expectancy and very low infant mortality rates.<br><br>Our [health-care] system today is not perfect but it is not bad. WHO has rated our system as among the top 10 most cost-effective in the world.<br><br>Today, we spend only 4 per cent of our GDP on health. The average public hospital bill size for the unsubsidised Class A ward is about one month of the average salary. In the heavily subsidised Class C ward, the average bill ($786) is less than a week of salary.<br><br>For the high standard of medical care that hospitals provide, we think this is very good value for money.<br><br>Five aspects of managing a health-care system<br><br>First, we work on the basis that health-care cost will continue to rise. While we do our best to manage medical inflation, we know that the trend is rising. The reason is simple. Doctors and nurses will continue to command high salaries and advances in medical science will continue to churn out new drugs and new equipment which are more expensive than their replacements.<br>The key to managing health-care cost is therefore to ensure that there is a constant and expanding flow of money going into the health-care sector to pay for new services. There is no short cut to this problem.<br><br>We are more likely to succeed if we share the financial burden widely. If we load the burden on one payer - whether the government as in the British system, or the employers like the American system - we will cause very severe strains. In Singapore, we involve both the Government as well as employers, and in addition, we rope in patients and their families as well. Our health-care system is supported by all the major stakeholders: Government, employers, patients, family members, insurers and charities.<br><br>Second, we believe that the health-care market can work better under competition. Market competition is the best way to allocate resources efficiently. Compared to other economic sectors, the health-care sector is notoriously unproductive. But there is no fundamental reason why the health-care market must fail. It fails only because we allow it to fail.<br>For markets to function, there must be timely information so consumers and producers can make rational decisions. When we want to buy a mobile phone, we shop around for the best prices for the functions that we desire. But how many patients shop around before they go for their cataract eye operation or knee cap replacement? And how can they shop around when information on how much patients pay for such operations is not easily available?<br><br>In Singapore, we are trying to push out timely and relevant information. We gather data from our hospitals and publish them regularly.<br><br>Third, we must empower patients and get them to take greater responsibility for their own health. This is particular so in the management of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. If we manage chronic diseases well, we are more likely to avoid or at least delay or minimise the onset of future medical complications requiring costly treatment.<br>Patients should take responsibility for their own health and work with their doctors and change their lifestyle. Eat healthily, exercise regularly, avoid obesity and smoking, take medication as prescribed by their doctors while regularly monitoring their own health and looking out for signs of complications. Many pilot studies of such structured disease management programmes have shown the benefits to the health of patients, while saving them money.<br><br>Fourth, we must revive the important role played by the primary health-care sector. In many countries, this sector has been marginalised as patients and doctors flock to the more glamorous tertiary sector. An over-swing to the tertiary sector has been a major contributor to escalating health-care costs in many countries, without any corresponding improvement in health outcomes.<br>As a rule, we need to keep patients away from unnecessary care by specialists at expensive hospitals. When a patient who can be adequately treated by a GP is instead managed by a specialist in a tertiary hospital, it means a waste and abuse of expertise.<br><br>Often, financial incentives and remunerations for the doctors work against the right siting of care.<br><br>When insurers reward high-intensity, high-cost surgical treatment but do not reimburse GPs who provide low-intensity, low-cost health education and dietary advice to their chronic sick patients, we should not be surprised that the outcome is disappointing.<br><br>Fifth, we should exploit globalisation to help lower cost. While globalisation is itself pushing up wages of health workers, we should leverage on it to average down our cost.<br><br>(Straits Times, 9 Sept)</div>

With clean water, clean air and good sanitation, the health of our people has improved over the years.

The average public hospital bill size for the unsubsidised Class A ward is about one month of the average salary. In the heavily subsidised Class C ward, the average bill ($786) is less than a week of salary.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">A heavily subsidised bill for Class C ward at $786 ?<br><br>Will the amount of $786 be less than a week of salary ?<br><br>The Minister of Health must be referring to his own weekly salary, and not that of a Singaporean from the Lower Income Group that form the bulk of Singaporeans in the Class C ward.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>For the high standard of medical care that hospitals provide, we think this is very good value for money.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Whose <span style="font-style: italic;">'value standard'</span> is used to determine a sense of 'good value for money' - the <span style="font-style: italic;">'value standard'</span> of the MILLION DOLLAR salary of the Minister, or based on the typical Lower Income - {or Lower and Upper Middle Income } - Singaporean wage earner ?</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Five aspects of managing a health-care system<br><br>First, we work on the basis that health-care cost will continue to rise. While we do our best to manage medical inflation, we know that the trend is rising. The reason is simple. Doctors and nurses will continue to command high salaries and advances in medical science will continue to churn out new drugs and new equipment which are more expensive than their replacements.<br>The key to managing health-care cost is therefore to ensure that there is a constant and expanding flow of money going into the health-care sector to pay for new services. There is no short cut to this problem.<br><br>We are more likely to succeed if we share the financial burden widely. If we load the burden on one payer - whether the government as in the British system, or the employers like the American system - we will cause very severe strains. In Singapore, we involve both the Government as well as employers, and in addition, we rope in patients and their families as well. Our health-care system is supported by all the major stakeholders: Government, employers, patients, family members, insurers and charities. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Is it any fairer when the sharing of the financial burden is based on an opaque cost accounting system which Singaporeans have no access to ?<br><br>When will the bubble burst if costs continue to rise ?<br><br>Will the day come when costs will reach the levels that currency has to be dealt with in six-digits ? </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Second, we believe that the health-care market can work better under competition. Market competition is the best way to allocate resources efficiently. Compared to other economic sectors, the health-care sector is notoriously unproductive. But there is no fundamental reason why the health-care market must fail. It fails only because we allow it to fail.<br>For markets to function, there must be timely information so consumers and producers can make rational decisions. When we want to buy a mobile phone, we shop around for the best prices for the functions that we desire. But how many patients shop around before they go for their cataract eye operation or knee cap replacement? And how can they shop around when information on how much patients pay for such operations is not easily available?<br><br>In Singapore, we are trying to push out timely and relevant information. We gather data from our hospitals and publish them regularly.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Unfortunately, in Singapore, while lip service is given to the term <span style="font-style: italic;">'market competition'</span> - such equilibrium of market forces is always thwarted when it does not meet with Government goals. </span><br></div>

This is particular so in the management of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. If we manage chronic diseases well, we are more likely to avoid or at least delay or minimise the onset of future medical complications requiring costly treatment.<br>Patients should take responsibility for their own health and work with their doctors and change their lifestyle. Eat healthily, exercise regularly, avoid obesity and smoking, take medication as prescribed by their doctors while regularly monitoring their own health and looking out for signs of complications. Many pilot studies of such structured disease management programmes have shown the benefits to the health of patients, while saving them money. </strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Can those Singaporeans in the Lower Income, and those in the Lower or Upper Middle Income - have the luxury of time and money to enjoy such empowerment to look after our own health ?<br><br>Many Singaporeans in these income groups have to take on double occupation just to make ends meet and with enough to see to the education of their children in a highly competitive school system.<br><br>In a population of 4.5 Million, what is the numbers in the Lower Income, Lower or Upper Middle Income, and the Higher Income Groups ?<br><br>If we were to look at the incident rates of 'First World Health Problems' - there will be a higher percentage from those in the Higher Income and Upper Middle Income; and a lower incident rate found in the Lower Middle Income Group.<br><br>Chances are that 'Third World Health Problems' will continue to be found in  the Lower Income group - with such diseases being 'tuberculosis, poor dietic diseases, malnutrition, veneral diseases, cancer due to heavy smoking.<br><br>The 'First World Health Problems' are more exotic - ranging from diabetese to heart and liver conditions due to over rich diet - euphemistically classified as the 'Rich Man's Diseases'. </span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Fourth, we must revive the important role played by the primary health-care sector. In many countries, this sector has been marginalised as patients and doctors flock to the more glamorous tertiary sector. An over-swing to the tertiary sector has been a major contributor to escalating health-care costs in many countries, without any corresponding improvement in health outcomes.<br>As a rule, we need to keep patients away from unnecessary care by specialists at expensive hospitals. When a patient who can be adequately treated by a GP is instead managed by a specialist in a tertiary hospital, it means a waste and abuse of expertise.<br><br>Often, financial incentives and remunerations for the doctors work against the right siting of care.<br><br>When insurers reward high-intensity, high-cost surgical treatment but do not reimburse GPs who provide low-intensity, low-cost health education and dietary advice to their chronic sick patients, we should not be surprised that the outcome is disappointing.<br></strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">When a Health or Medical Insurance scheme is managed by a 'profit orientated' entity, the obvious outcome to be expected is a reluctance to pay out; and after payment is made, it is very likely that the insurers will balk at continuing with a person who will straddle them for the remaining life span.</span><br><blockquote><strong><br>Fifth, we should exploit globalisation to help lower cost. While globalisation is itself pushing up wages of health workers, we should leverage on it to average down our cost.<br><br>(Straits Times, 9 Sept)</strong></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Globalisation is another term for 'economies of scale' by sharing costs and capacities at a global level.<br><br>Leveraging on what others can do better and cheaper was supposed to be the secret of Singapore's economic success since the 1960s, when we decided to move away from Primary Industries - in animal and vegetable farming to concentrate in building our wealth through our human resources and talent - { 'it is surprising that we were more talented in the 1960s' } - by going into manufacturing and other services.<br><br>Beyond all the above, the fact remains that we will be chasing a vicious circle of cost increments, if the limited financial resources of each individual Singaporean is to be depended on to meet our individual medical and healthcare costs.<br><br>The Government will always be needed to invest in the provision of all infrastructure - whether economic, education or health - and such costs will always be recovered from the Citizens who will have to pay a fee to utilise such services.<br><br>For Singaporeans - in the Lower Income, Lower and Upper Middle Income Groups, while consumption of normal economic services can be met from a portion of the daily or monthly wages, larger capital outlay will consume the bulk of the wage, with little left for savings to look after ourselves in the later life.<br><br>The best way will be for a National Insurance scheme paid by the State - which can be funded from the profits generated by investing our Reserves; and/or from the surplus of taxes collected from the Citizens.<br><br>Multiple combination of such a scheme can be developed for a National Insurance that is to be owned by Singapore Citizens, in which the funds accumulated in this National Insurance will be professionally managed to grow annual surplus returned to this fund - which will be used to pay for all the medical and health care expenses in Secondary or Tertiary Costs.<br></span><br><br></div>

Also, you have to make your appointment at least a month in advance, or else you won't be able to get the slot you want.</div>

And somemore have to pay $ one. I switch to private doctors, paid much more, but still took at least 2 hours to finish an appt.<br><br>The newspapers in UK are unlike those in Sg. They're not dictated by the govt at all, so they're free to report anything they wish. Of course there are sometimes isolated cases which I've also heard of. But on the whole everytime I've needed to utilise the NHS i've been left feeling more than impressed. Sometimes it's papers like The Sun which needs something more "shocking" to sell. But at least the brits push themselves for improvement even though their system is pretty good, unlike singapore, who would rather sit on their laurels instead of improving even more.</div>
