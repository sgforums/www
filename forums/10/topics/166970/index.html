The so called help will only help themselves.<br><br>For example, the new way to determine whether public transport fees will increase or decrease. Somehow, I don't think so. Assuming that Singapore's economy is improving at a constant rate, our transport fees will increase. Even if economy not improving, there is another factor which will increase the fare. Consumer something. That factor is very dependent on consumers. So unless consumer spends less, the fares will increase.</div>
