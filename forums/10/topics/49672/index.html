            <div class='col-md body'>Tycoon's ex-China bride pens her tale<br>Giving former husband a pseudonym, she writes about marriage, divorce and legal battles, but book may not be sold here<br><br>By Neo Hui Min<br><br>THE Beijing woman who started talk of the 'China bride syndrome' here after an acrimonious divorce case with her wealthy Singaporean husband, has written a book on her experiences in Singapore.<br><br>Entitled Wo He Hao Men Da Guan Si, or Taking On A Tycoon In Court, the book is not yet in book shops, but a weekly Shanghai newspaper, Shanghai Yizhou, has printed extracts.<br><br>'I would say that almost 100 per cent of the story is true. I have been bursting to tell my side of the story and now I've done so.' - Madam Shi Fang, in her book Wo He Hao Men Da Guan Si (Taking On A Tycoon In Court)<br>It is the tale of how she met her former husband, her relationship with his family, how her marriage fell apart and her three-year legal battle.<br><br>Now 37, Madam Shi Fang gives her husband the pseudonym Mr Ye Shun'an in the book, and does not name his family. But she claims that most of the account is based on her life here.<br><br>She told The Straits Times in Mandarin by phone: 'I would say that almost 100 per cent of the story is true.<br><br>'I have been bursting to tell my side of the story and now I've done so in this book.'<br><br>A former tour guide, Madam Shi wed Mr Koh Pee Huat, son of shipping tycoon Koh Nai Tor, in 1990 in Beijing.<br><br>After 1 1/2 years, she filed for divorce, claiming a share of their home, shares in the Kohs' company, and maintenance of $4,133 a month.<br><br>COURT BATTLES<br><br>MR KOH Pee Huat married Madam Shi Fang in 1990. About three years later, she obtained a divorce from him on the grounds of desertion.<br><br>The High Court ordered Mr Koh to pay her a monthly maintenance of $2,300 and a lump sum of $46,700.<br><br>But she asked the court to increase her maintenance to more than $4,000 and order that she receive a half-share of their Jalan Pelepah home in Pasir Panjang and a share in the family business.<br><br>She lost the appeal.<br><br>In 1995, she took Mr Koh to court for fabricating false evidence in his affidavits, in their disputes over maintenance. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail for falsifying evidence. This was reduced to one month after he appealed.<br><br>But she did not get more maintenance from him. Instead, she was granted a settlement of $250,000 once she vacated the Jalan Pelepah house and withdrew all claims to it. She appealed for more but lost the case in 1996.<br><br>In 1998, she was back in court. This time, she was tried for allegedly making a false declaration in her divorce affidavit against Mr Koh. She was acquitted.<br><br>The court awarded her much less. She lost her appeal.<br><br>The case led to the Chinese-speaking community here labelling her a Xiaolongnu, or 'little dragon girl', a derogatory term used in recent times to describe women from China who compete with Singaporean women for their husbands and boyfriends - and their wallets.<br><br>In the published extracts, Madam Shi writes of Singaporeans' prejudice against Chinese nationals.<br><br>There is a scene of her overhearing Singaporeans saying: 'Chinamen are so scary. When they have rice, they take not one but two portions.'<br><br>Her retort is that 'Singaporeans think that eating little is high-class behaviour'.<br><br>And in a description of a fight with 'Mr Ye', which arose because he had accused her of keeping a necklace they had bought for a friend, she says that he retorted: 'Have you had enough? Who asked you to be a PRC?'<br><br>PRC refers to People's Republic of China, the official name of mainland China.<br><br>Up till today, Madam Shi feels she has been wronged.<br><br>'I feel that media reports were very biased against me. I was portrayed as an airhead and nobody asked me for my opinion,' she said.<br><br>Friends and journalists egged her on to tell her side of the story in a book.<br><br>Since returning to Beijing in 1998, she has been busy writing, and completed the book only last year.<br><br>The articulate woman now lives in Shanghai and has spent the past two months at her publisher's office editing bits that could land her in legal trouble.<br><br>Does she fear a lawsuit?<br><br>'Absolutely not, because everything is factual. I can prove it,' she said.<br><br>As she is reluctant to edit out her take on Singapore's judicial system, the book may not be distributed here.<br><br>Mrs Anamah Tan, the lawyer who represented Mr Koh in the divorce case, said that if defamatory, the family could sue her even though the book was not distributed here.<br><br>Mr Koh Pee Huat could not be contacted for comment.<br><br>Meanwhile, Madam Shi is looking forward to publishing an English version.<br><br>After that?<br><br>'I really don't know yet. I've been so busy lately, I'm just hoping to have enough time to get a haircut,' she chuckled.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Is there some bias in the Court Ruling in the first proceedings by awarding such a paltry sum - of $2,300 monthly and a lump sum of $46,700 - to a legally married spouse of a Singaporean Citizen, simply because she is a foreigner; and especially one originating from Mainland China ?<br><br>Under any circumstances, a Singaporean Wife of a scion from a rich family would have been entitled to more when there are parallel court rulings under similar circumstances; as in the ruling of an English woman claiming similar rights to the properties and wealth of her Indonesian husband residing in Singapore. There was also the divorce case of a Singaporean Stockbroker who had to split half of his belongings with his Singapore born wife; as well as in another divorce case, where a Singapore born wife was entitled to her share of her Caucasian husbandÂ’s artifacts and collections on top of the share of the home and monthly maintenance.<br><br>Such prejudicial rulings by the Singapore Courts against a foreign born spouse who seek justice from the Singapore Judicial System can have repercussions when similar actions are taken by Singapore born spouse seeking redress from the Judicial System of another country.<br><br>With regards to the manner that she prefer to dispose of her court ruled compensations, one should not be too harsh in judging her character. It is simply an issue of individual life style and priorities.<br><br>After going through the stress of such bitter divorce proceedings that would have cost her quite a fair sum, I wonder how much of the compensation would have remained after paying for all the legal costs.<br><br></div>

Of couse, i will back to singapore and stay there for do not know how long times.<br><br>I am sure about all of my batch's scholars are top students in our school and we r still top students in NUS not only in sense of study/reasearch but also in ECAs.<br><br>There r some PRCs are not good also but the average level is pretty good already.<br><br>Cheating??? u know what, I do not know why we need to cheat to win those stupid guys in my class..<br>Do not think boz of ur English education make u more honest.<br><br>We r good boz every one of us here r the tops among 1 million populations in China but how many millions do u have in Singapore.<br><br>Peasonally, I stay in singapore not boz of the bond in the first place. I have spent half of teenages in Singapore. Most of my friends are here and my network is here. It is good for my career developement.<br><br>Singapore is small. There r not that much talent is not boz of Singaporean is not good but boz of the population pool. If u really want to have a good future, Singapore need to get talents.<br><br>Singapore goverment is really smart. It is really a good deal to take lots of PRCs here. By statistic, 2/3 of them have stayed here and are working here. I do not think we just treat Singapore as a step.<br><br>Do not think we take of ur working place. We r creating more job optunities for u. Man, u should trust ur goverment, they r all wisdoms.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by greengoblin:</div><div class="quote_body">I agree wholeheartedly with you CX.

Nah...it is because they can't get any places in countries like the US that they have to come here.<br><br>About them raising our standards...blah....those that come here {espcially in NUS} are second rated ones....and THEY ARE NOT the top students here...I have seen classes where PRC flunk like crazy {don't give me the crap that they are hard working or whatsoever...hardworking in cheating maybe...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">}<br><br>Of couse, there are some good honest ones...but they are by far few ... it is easier to comb a hay stack to search for needles than to find such PRC among the population here....<br><br>Let's face it...the govt is damn stup importing some of these people here...esp those who don't bring results...and bleed our people dry and then move off the greener pastures abroad when they are done...so who are the quitters here...and the parasites ? </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let us talk about research then...<br>many China appliciants for graduate programs claim to have attended many conferences and have recommandation letters to back them up. The truth is that...many of them just registered for the conference and pulled out at the last minute...leaving no time for the organiser to change the details in the conference schedule...hence giving people the wrong impression that these so called China graduate applicants have gone to speak at the conference itself.<br><br>Moreover, a close scrutiny of the so called recommandation letters reveal close grammtical and sentense structure of the applicant and the person writing the recommandation letter of the letter....it really brings to mind about the honesty of the appliciant and their research capabilities.<br><br>To my knowledge, the China appliciant now is not as good as their predecessors say 10 years ago. The Indian scholars show a greater tendancy to work harder than them.<br><br>While there are still some good PRC scholars, the true fact is that they are diminishing in numbers. The universities here should take a close look before hiring them.<br><br>{FYI, I have taken a class of which half are PRC students...and none made it near the top ten...those who scored are the local students and malaysians...and that subject was supposed to be their forte...mathematics}</div>
