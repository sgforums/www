Based on general unhappiness so far generated, people have seen through NKF as caused by government's own tax-and-create-huge-reserve policies that don't benefit them. Ministers cannot deny or cover up such problems. Government has to change fast all its past excesses. It is of no use just try to explain NKF away or push it to Durai.</div>

People are more educated now and they can see that once this justification exercise is over, there will be the same persistent denials of same NKF problems in GIC, Temasek, LTA, EDB, JTC and HDB where large powers are concentrated without solutions to the 20 major problems posted. There will be the same lack of accountable decisions without producing fully justified benefits.<br><br>Nothing seems to change and GIC or Temasek will not one day be more accountable and transparent with decisions that can be scrutinized e.g. how much reserves to build, how many cents in per dollar reserve to come back from risky ventures to benefit in lowering costs of medicare for citizens or temporary help during short-term unemployment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope, I dont think the NKF scandal will be the main focus of the election. The Press has been "very" helpful recently and is giving out a lot of information and blunders that the former NKF has done. I think by making NKF the highlight these few months, the public will become tired of the whole NKF scandal and thus when elections come, the NKF scandal cannot be used to its full effectiveness.</div>

Reserves also have led to extravagant spending on 7 wonders and unwarranted foreign investments in areas that do not benefit the citizens.<br><br>If reserve is to be built, it has to be used not for self-rewards but for lowering people's high costs of living and solve persistent unemployment problems.<br><br>It is only when reserves will account for  patients' or people's interests that reserves should then be accepted.<br><br>Other than re-defining purpose of reserves with accountability and transparency, people will demand change to existing assumptions about reserves.</div>

People are more educated now and they can see that once this justification exercise is over, there will be the same persistent denials of same NKF problems in GIC, Temasek, LTA, EDB, JTC and HDB where large powers are concentrated without solutions to the 20 major problems posted. There will be the same lack of accountable decisions without producing fully justified benefits.<br><br>Nothing seems to change and GIC or Temasek will not one day be more accountable and transparent with decisions that can be scrutinized e.g. how much reserves to build, how many cents in per dollar reserve to come back from risky ventures to benefit in lowering costs of medicare for citizens or temporary help during short-term unemployment.</div></blockquote>yah. all wayang niah...after sometimes natural death....cannot dun do anything so they do something for the sake of appeasing people.</div>
