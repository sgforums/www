            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I will break things down into the problems we are currently facing.<br><br>1) Singapore is too dependent on other countries. e.g water from Malaysia, natural gas from Indonesia. Foreign workers on construction sites. By analysing this, we are actually on the "being pushed" side. Looking at the water issue, you know what i mean.<br><br>2) Singaporeans are working too hard and too tired working coz' we have no choice. Why? Coz' our land is too small and we have no natural resources, therefore we muz work harder to balance the scale. But this will lead to some social issue or in fact we are facing it now-----too stressed and some even migrate...<br><br>3) Falling birth rate. Well this problem arised from problem 2. Everyday working so hard go home too tired to 'do it'...Of coz the main problem is Singapore cost of living is too high and bringing up a child requires effort and money. Looking at now busy parents, where got the time to teach right values and give proper care to the child. And the child grows up to have a lot of problems. By looking at the recent news, i need not to go into further details.<br><br>4) Our educational system. Well looking at the system now we are having. I can say it is complete joke. What we are learning now in schools is 1/2 1/2 and we are learning too much irrelevant stuffs which most probably not be useful. Also we are not given a choice or not emphasised on learning specifed skills when we are young, therefore when we go out to work, we still need to spend extra time upgrading and thus lead to problem 2. Spending all the time on a few specific skill and specialise on them are more enjoyable and less stressful compared to study all kinds of subjects where actually just for scoring high marks.<br><br>E.g I now holding a diploma for multimedia infocomm technology, but i wasted 4 years in sec sch learning chemistry, physics, history geography whereby i most probably forget. Then the 3 yrs in poly i can tell you what i learned is still not enough to equip myself in the workforce. Therefore Singapore employ foreigners instead of us coz they have better knowledge but i can tell u they know nothing of other things rather than the specific knowledge they specialised. Bill gates started programming at the age of 5 if i am not wrong and he don't study like history, geography, chemistry etc..but look at him...how much did he earn every minute?<br><br><strong>For us guys, we are at a greater disadvantage if we are holding IT related diploma and i assume a lot of us do. After having diploma and serving <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 yrs NS</span>, we came out at the age of about 22-23.By that time what we learned during poly may be outdated coz IT trend go so fast and 2 yrs makes a damn difference. If study U then 4 more yrs that is about 27. Look for a job then only manage to survive if salary about $1500. After marriage settle down still need to work and work until we die.</strong><br><br>5)Emerging economy India and China. Well looking at the trend, China will catch up with Singapore around 15 years time. The problem China still facing now is the corruption and security issue. Compare them to Singapore, we are having this advantage. But once their government do something to it. China will be better than Singapore.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Based on the main problems that I mentioned above, I think the main problem that also the main reason that Singapore will still be same or be worse in future is because Singapore is too small with no natural resources. We are working too hard to balance the scales but this is no good to the society in the run. <strong>But we can do nothing about it and we can only try our best to maintain what it is now.</strong><br><br>If you read Romance of the three kingdoms, i think you will know Zhuge Liang who was a great leader and strategist. During the time where Zhuge Liang was aiding Liu Bei in charge of the government in Xinye which was a small city that is hard to defend with no natural resources. But with Zhuge Liang's governing, Xinye developed in a prosperous city like Singapore. But he did tell Liu Bei that in the long run, things will not look good coz the fact that Xinye is too hard to defend and low population. Therefore in the end, they gave up Xinye and moved to a bigger and more resources Jingzhou. But of coz, the movement from Xinye and Jingzhou was due to war by Cao Cao great army where even Zhuge Liang himself knew cannot defend even with his great tactics and well trained soldiers. <strong>But who can ensure in future Singapore will not face a war?? Even if we managed to win a war, but the damage going to cause is aso too huge. </strong><br><br>Think about it the natural fact and feel free to comment and flame me if u like....</div>

I knew exposing to different subjects will determine you what specialisation u going to do in future. But our educational system has done it in a way that scoring high marks will have good future. Thats the truth, failing a subject and you will be condemned. So in fact government should instead helps student specialise when young instead of studying all kinds of subjects and <strong>requiring them to score </strong>else cannot make it to sec poly or U etc.<br><br>Well, i do agreed partially about the part where youth whine about little work. But now we are not living in our grandfathers' time where almost everyone works as labourer. Now we must compare to where everyone is studying and then go out to work and compete with others for just a small admin job. Well now we are facing like finishing 10 homeworks as a student and a labourer carrying 10 tons of goods per day. The stress is the same. But i do agree that we are living in a better condition compared to our grandfathers' time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldnt say Singapore is going to be the same or worse in future,coz no one knows what will happen in future.But one thing is for sure,if got chance to leave this place,i will definitely choose to leave.One reason is our country is too small,of coz,this is not our government fault as its the way our nation was borned.But in such a small island country,no matter how good the development are,there will still be a limit,n this limit will always pose a threat to our economy development.Another reason is Singapore is a "one party rules" nation,in other words,sort of a dictatorship country or socialist country.This method of ruling has been proved to be useless as time goes by,Soviet Union has fallen,Philipphines in the hand of dictator Marcos has fallen,East Germany has fallen,so does Suharto in Indonesia,Romania in east Europe etc,the list can go on......So let us make a deep thought,if a country as big as Soviet Union cant even survive with a one party rules system,what makes our politicians think that our tiny little country can make it?Its time for our country to change to democracy system,even Taiwan which is more dictatorial than us has switched to democracy,why cant we?Democracy might not be the best system,but it prove to be a better resolution compare to other type of ruling.If Singapore continue to be a "one party rule" nation,i am going to leave this place for good.</div>

It is more complicated. One way of looking at things (not saying whether it is right or wrong) is that Singapore is too small to be divided by rivaling factions, look at how the democrats and republicans slaughter each other in Washington, sometimes, even normal families will not even allow their sons and daughters to get involved with rivaling politically inclined families. I read that a long time ago, so no idea how relevant this example is but those rifts are true.</div>

Local people probably demand higher pay, better treatment, shorter hours.</div></blockquote>Not only cheaper but more hardworking and smarter, for example, graduates from some indian tech university.. IIIT? Does anyone have any memories? It was featured in the newpaper once. I'm not sure about this but I remembered its high requirements for entrance was unreasonably high, Basically, he said that MIT was no kick, this I remembered very well, apparently they went through hell's training and when they go to the states, they find things which others believed to be tough as easy.<br><br>Thats why people are outsourcing, no choice, if we close ourselves to our little world, than we will die.<br><br>Personally, I don't worry so because I am confident of surviving, relocation for work is no problem and I am always open to new ideas and make use of newfound resources. If you can't fight em, don't, make use of them. There is no reason to keep viewing China as rivals and in the position of an enemy. Same goes for India or even some south american nations.<br><br>If we can have an advantage over them, than make full use of it rather than lamenting what the possible future be. Thats my 2cents anyway,<br><br>Think of an elephant, rather than standing in its path, ride on it.. before it threatens to throw you off, poke a small wound and introduce germs into it, soon it will rot and bacterial and fungal will grow and multiply, den it will spread all over the body and by the time it realised what is happening, it will be too late and will simply die. No matter how big it is, even an elephant, it will simply die and get wasted by vultures. Ok, bad analogy, but it delivers the point.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what sans-culotte, I know how you feel. I only ord from army last June with a general diploma in business and no experience and also have problem finding job in the market. Too bad we got no money to go get a degree course. The army part, I agree with you wholeheartly. How much can we remember after that. Lets face it. Almost none. As such degree holders usually got an advantage there cause they effectively start their studies after NS. Can't be help. If you don't have a high education and you don't have a lot of money in Singapore, you are expandable.<br></div>
