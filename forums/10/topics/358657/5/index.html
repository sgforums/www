              <p>Actually, since you are still 14, I suggest you concentrate on your studies and having a fun filled childhood.</p>

              <p>Don't worry about such things until you are 18.</p>

              <p>I can see that it is your personal interest to know more on our politics. Yah, i personally feels that guys are somehow interested in politics. Just imagine, when you come to a stage to buy a HDB flat, you'll hear about the good and bad things of buying a house from HDB etc. It will eventually leads to politics.</p>
              <p>E.g Spent so much money to buy a pigeon hole</p>
              <p>- property prices low but HDB houses are far too expensive</p>
              <p>- HDB is govt managed</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>etc etc... so, welcome to the world of politics!</p>
              <p>And its never early to know all these. You know who the f**k is LKY since primary school or even younger right? This is the starting of exposing politics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I totally agree with charlize that you continue to observe but hey, don't go too deep in. Its very depressing! Don't let all these affect your secondary school life! School lives are to be worked hard and enjoy every bit of it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, spare sometime to read more via the internet as it is more open. You'll be able to hear words from both side. Don't be blinded by one side and forsake the other. You must decide for yourself which side to believe in and is your judgement a fair one?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, welcome to SG Forums! Enjoy the craps here while face the bashings from those got-nothing-to-do forumers! =)</p>

              <p>You've got to realize that this forum is filled with bigots who are against everything the government does. Some of these deluded uncles here have no minds of their own and merely regurgitate the verbal diarrhoea of fervent anti-PAP activitists like Atobe. Others are losers who blame the government for every misfortune that befalls them: losing a job to a foreigner, losing a scholarship to a foreign student, bypassed for promotion by a PSC scholarship or losing a girlfriend to an elite..</p>
              <p>The Opposition parties have themselves to blame for constantly shooting themselves in the foot so as to render themselves unelectable. When their own leaders admit to voting for the ruling party, who would join their ranks? Everyone competes under the same rules. The Opposition parties have never been able to gather enough candidates to compete every seat...that is not the PAP's fault. The Opposition parties have not been as successful with getting the support of the minority races and have difficulty fielding a GRC team....that's not the PAP's fault. Majority rules in a democracy...what we are hearing is the constant whining of the defeated.</p>
              <p>It's time for opposition party leaders to grow up and take responsibility of their own deficiencies.</p>
