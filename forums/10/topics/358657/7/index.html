              <div>If she is in a state of limbo (as u put it) hope someone wise and close to her would read this book to her : Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Illyich. It might resonate with her in so MANY ways.</div>

              <p><br>It will be an irony for her to know that in Tolstoy's book, the selfish, overbearing and arrogant husband did not feel any compassion for the wife even as he was dying.</p>
              <p>This book must have been read by LKY as he had also to struggle with his frustration in the finite human life, which seem to limit the time available for him to see the end-game of what he believe to be his own creation.</p>
              <p>Like a kid playing LegoLand till adulthood, it becomes an irritant when the wife takes over the mother's role in nagging him to go to bed as there is work to be done the next day. Soon, the kid in the Adult will realise that time is running short, when in his old age he has to come to terms that the fun with LegoLand has to be continued by someone else, and he has to find a way to control his fears that his carefully crafted intended plans may not be fully followed.</p>
              <p>It is a reflection of the vanity in LKY to believe in his own infinite relevance to every and all things around him.</p>
              <p>Is it any wonder that he continue to occupy a seat in Parliament at age 85, when he has called for everyone in his generation to make way for rejuvenation ?</p>

              <p>Is there any use to award Mrs LKY with a special National Day award for being LKY's shadow throughout his political life ?</p>
              <p>Amazing that Vivien Tan did not bother to highlight the fact that LKY admitted that he had consulted his shadow before making every major decision.</p>
              <p>Obviously her current status of being in a limbo state in the Twilight Zone is a reflection of her Karma for the wrong advise given that had LKY move to ruthlessly destroy the countless number of lives in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Is there no shame or conscience left in Singaporeans to act with a certain honest decency ?</p>
