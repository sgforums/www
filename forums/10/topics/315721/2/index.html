              <p>But its that the actual goal/aim of the Exchange Program. And
              the program is called Exchange. What do you exchange if you just

              <p>I'm not sure about what your exchange programme does exactly. <br><br>But from my experience, although such programmes are meant for exchanging views between the students of host countries and the local students, it usually does not happen at all. The intention of the organisers is there, but sadly, it is rarely realised. However, when it does happen, although rarely, there's no necessity to have different races to portray any of the cultural views here.</p>
              <p>It seems more likely now that the word 'exchange' is used when foreign exchange students come in and local exchange students go out. Something to that effect.</p>

              <p>Ghana?</p>
              <p>Here's something:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>The background of the whole process of African
                      decolonization was built up in the wartime and early postwar periods,
                      but the trigger on the chain reaction of the decolonization process was
                      the defeat of the Anglo-French effort at Suez because of America and
                      Soviet pressure in October 1956. As might, perhaps, be expected, the
                      process began in a British colony, the Gold Coast, now called Ghana.</em></p>
              <p><em>     The independence of Ghana was a personal
                      achievement of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, who returned to Accra from an
                      educational process in Pennsylvania and the London School of Economics.
                      The year before, in 1946, the Gold Coast obtained the first British
                      African Legislative Assembly that was allowed a majority of Africans.
                      Nkrumah's agitations, including the founding of a new political party,
                      the Convention People's Party, under his own control, earned him a
                      two-year jail sentence. While he was still in jail, his party won 34 of
                      the 38 seats in the Assembly in the election of 1951; therefore he was
                      released from confinement to take control of the administration. With
                      good will on both sides, a transition period of six years gave Ghana
                      its independence, under Nkrumah's rule, in March 1957.</em></p>
              <p><em>     Within a year of independence, Nkrumah faced the
                      typical problems of post-colonialism that we have mentioned: a rapid
                      fall in cocoa prices upon which Ghana's international trade position
                      depended; disease in the cocoa trees, which required destruction of
                      thousands of trees over the violent protests of their peasant owners;
                      dissension between the pagan, commercial, coastal area, in which the
                      Convention People's Party was based, and the more pastoral, Islamic,
                      remote interior.</em></p>
              <p><em>Nkrumah soon showed his readiness to handle all problems with
                      ruthless decision.</em></p>
              <p><em>The "sick" cocoa trees were cut down; political
                      opponents were silenced in one way or another; Nkrumah was ballyhooed
                      as the father of all Africans, the unique genius of the African
                      revolution, the mystic symbol of all black men's hopes.</em></p>
              <p><em>A Five-Year
                      Plan for economic development (1959-1964) promised to spend over 92
                      million dollars. In 1960 the previous British-granted constitution was
                      replaced by a new republican constitution that was amended almost at
                      once by a clause allowing Nkrumah to rule without parliament whenever
                      necessary.</em></p>
              <p><em>The leader's Pan-African hopes were reflected in a clause
                      that permitted "the surrender of the whole or part of the sovereignty
                      of Ghana" to a union of African states.</em></p>
              <p><em>By the end of the same year,
                      political party designations were abolished in Parliament, and the
                      Preventive Detention Act (which allowed Nkrumah to imprison his enemies
                      without charge) was used to arrest the chief members of the political
                      opposition. Ghana embarked on an economic war witl1 the Union of South
                      Africa in protest against the latter's extreme segregation of the races
                      and on a somewhat weaker system of economic reprisals against France in
                      retaliation for its nuclear-explosion tests in the Sahara.</em></p>
              <p><em>Vigorous
                      activities at the United Nations, in African affairs (chiefly in
                      opposition to any Pan-African movement that would not be dominated by
                      Nkrumah), in balancing the two sides of the Cold War while seeking
                      economic aid from both, in establishing a Ghana shipping line defiantly
                      called the "Black Star line," and in constructing a gigantic
                      hydroelectric and aluminum manufacturing complex on the Volta River,
                      kept Nkrumah's name in the world's press...</em></p>
              <p><em>...   <strong>The ordinary African is very remote from either future
                      preference or infinitely expandable material demands.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em>He generally has
                      preference for the present, and his demands are often nonmaterial and
                      even non-economic, such as his desire for leisure or for social
                      approval.</em></p>
              <p><em>The African has a fair recognition of the immediate past, a
                      dominant concern for the present, and little concern for the future.</em></p>
              <p><strong><em>Accordingly, his conception of time is totally different from that of
                      the average Western man.</em></strong></p>
              <p><em>The latter sees the present only as a moving
                      point of no dimension that separates the past from the future.</em></p>
              <p><em>The
                      African sees time as a wide gamut of the present with a moderate
                      dimensioned past and almost no future.</em></p>
              <p><em>This outlook is reflected in the
                      structure of the Bantu languages, which do not emphasize the tense
                      distinctions of past, present, and future, as we do, but instead
                      emphasize categories of condition, including a basic distinction in the
                      verb between completed and incompleted actions that places the present
                      and the future (both concerned with unfinished actions) in the same
                      category.</em></p>
              <p><em>We do this occasionally in English when we use the present
                      tense in a future sense by saying, "He is coming tomorrow," but this
                      rare use of the present to indicate the future does not blur our
                      conception of the future the way constant use of such a construction
                      does in Bantu.</em></p>
              <p><em> ...In addition to his present preference, the Bantu has a list of
                      priorities, in his conception of a higher standard of living, which
                      contains many non-economic goals.</em></p>
              <p><em>A fairly typical list of such
                      priorities might run thus: food, sex dalliance, joking with one's
                      friends, a bicycle, music and dancing, a radio, leisure to go fishing.</em></p>
              <p><em>Any list such as this, with its high priority for non-economic and
                      basically leisure activities, does not provide the constantly expanding
                      material demands that are the motivating force in the West's economic
                      expansion.</em></p>
              <p><em>Nor is the African's strongly socialized personality, which
                      shares all its successes and wants with others and constantly yearns
                      for the social approval obtained by sharing income with kinfolk and
                      friends, capable of supporting any economy of private selfishness and
                      individual capital accumulation that became the basis for the
                      industrial expansion of the West...</em></p>

              <p>This type of thing very hard to question there on their selection criteria also. They will tell you they select based on merits, not on race. Those type of criteria also too dead to consider so many other factors.</p>
              <p>I have a few such stories also, where the criteria very stupid one, resulting in able and extremely interested people not getting shortlisted in place of those less interested ones.</p>

              <p>I have done all those you mentioned before, in 4 different programmes, and I believe those few interested parties learned more about Singapore from what we tell them than what they see of the party.</p>
              <p>Example: Taiwanese and China Chinese actually thought Singaporeans could only speak English, and till the Taiwan coordinator assigned to the Singapore team was one that was trained in English. And we showed them otherwise. But the race distribution was not well spread out at all though...</p>
              <p>Then for Germany, out of the 30 sent for homestay, there were only 1 indian and 1 muslim.</p>

              <p>Probably, if the selection criteria includes a selection essay.</p>
              <p>Or if I were you, I would email the coordinator about this viewpoint and request to reconsider my application. No harm trying for something that you would really like. This is the best you could do now, because the system wasn't created by us. Basically, you will have to sell your point across and drive it into their heads (can be very thick sometimes). You never know if they suddenly decide to increase the number of participants. Happened before (the increase in number) for my friend in the Germany homestay programme.</p>
              <p>But... I have to say... no guarantees, and don't expect too much...</p>

              <p>"Taiwanese and China Chinese actually thought Singaporeans could only speak English"</p>
              <p>Thats not that far from the truth. Unless you have been to a Chinese school and was in the Chinese stream, apart from everyday ordinary Mandarin, Singaporean Chinese cannot converse in more sophisticated, refined and fluent dialogue. Best example - ask LHL to write his own Mandarin speeches like Kevin Rudd of Oz.</p>
              <p>In Malaysia, it is pretty similar. I recall this article I read so and so of some big bank (Malaysian working in Singapore) transferred to China branch but cant take up CFO post because of poor Mandarin skills, despite being ethnically Chinese.</p>
