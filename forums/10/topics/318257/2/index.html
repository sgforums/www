              <p>but i wouldnt say that that ALL the policies that they introduced are useless. The attraction of MNCs to tuas is a masterstroke. In this little island without any resources, that would be a good way to ensure employment and generate income,</p>

              <p>the economy is consist of the workforce, i can't see how they are different... like what i said above, they have a subset r/s......</p>
              <p>back to the main question, i can't see how singapore's pursuit of foreign talent (one of our main 'economic policy' now could benefit the local people, i think it benefits the regime in terms of the money generated, i can't say it benefits the country, because the distribution of the money 'rarely' goes back to the people.........., so this way its at the expense of the local people. Other countries like japan even through after the economic slowdown after 1980s and aging population, refuse to import 'talent', they are still doing very well, as one of the most developed country in the world.</p>
              <p>Singapore is run like a company, with profits over the employee's welfare i think.... singapore in itself is a migrant society, many of our forefathers are not born and bred here. sad but true. thus, i believe it will continue this way......</p>

              <p>Regarding the FT part, I would agree to a certain degreeÂ it's bull-shit.</p>
              <p>Still remember? FT is good! Create more jobs by stimulating economy!</p>
              <p><img title="Laughing" src="http://politics.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>
              <p>And guess where the job goes?</p>
              <p>But it's a fallacy with a grain of truth, sad to say. It is a rat race. We face a chronic labour shortage here and some jobs will definitely have to go to FTs if any company wishes to stay here or any of our companies can survive. Working at a SME last time, I can recall at least 5 foreign colleagues. The other locals kept contemplating changing jobs.</p>
              <p>As for Japan, they've only just stemmed their deflation, now starting to get a little steam back.</p>

              Snowxx,
              
              It is a very complex topic. It is not easy to go into historical aspect as well of our economic management. There had been so many policies in terms of restructuring the education system, phasing out of this or that industry in order to reach a value-adding economic strategic model based on creating technology start-ups. 
              
              We made many "U" turns on many industries including the ship repairing or electronic and wafer fab but our leaders are not well versed in these areas being lawyers and generalists not passionate in creating innovations within certain new technologies.
              
              So they have failed to make much headway in any of these restructuring except may be in getting into ship repairing and rig building which actually were not started by the government but the result of GLCs taking over some original private sector's industries. 
              
              You had summed it up well. We are over-relying on foreigners and foreign investments so heavily as we are not likely to be in the right direction down as seen in dropping of wages of citizens and taking over of many jobs by foreigners and draining out of our own talents sidelined by government due to such widespread mistakes in treating practical knowledge applications and innovations.
              
              My short answer is we are not likely to create a sustainable economic competitiveness to keep up or be equal to the first world like the smaller Swiss or Finland or even Korea which did not selfishly selling out their own citizens in any economic downturn with all the hypocrisy and twist and turn to press down the citizens.
              
              So for a small window of opportunity open to us due to rise of China and India and general world recovery we hear our leaders claiming success one more round to make it look like they are the one who have restructured the economy ...
              
              Is what our leaders are doing a sound and sustainable development capable of moving upwards over time to reach the first world or is our economy merely taking a ride and temporary ride and our leaders are claming credit again like before forgetting we need to achieve much more in terms of practical knowledge application as a culture of the of the people in order to say they are truly successful.
              
              Economy, work force, education, skill training and strategic practical knowledge application in every field are all issues of nation building which are so intertwined that we cannot over-simplify them in GDP growth for a few years or rising incomes of the upper 20% of population to claim success.

              The Noisy Lion,
              
              This is a complex topic as I have said. I do not dispute some good has been achieved but certainly not all have been good or first world as claimed. Read the four points I have posted of promises made but not achieved to date. I am waiting for our biomedical or biotech to achieved some major breakthrough if we are all that first-world. Do not boast of achievements if one does not have what it takes to reach the pinnacle of success. 
              
              So I would suggest you too do not be so prickly about my or other's views on this topic.

              <p>Â i can't see how singapore's pursuit of foreign talent (one of our main 'economic policy' now could benefit the local people, i think it benefits the regime in terms of the money generated, i can't say it benefits the country, because the distribution of the money 'rarely' goes back to the people.........., so this way its at the expense of the local people.</p>

              <p><br>It benefits the country bro in the long run..... they employ top (and expensive talent) to make critical decisions and run the ship.</p>

              <p>Here comes the sad part. As Singaporeans.... you have to fit into either of those categories. Make it into the "expensive talent" category and you should do well.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The rest will have to fit into the "cheaper" labour category. Thus some of you might be feeling "competiton" and "spoiling of market" by foreign talent.</p>

              Covert corruption can be dealt with more effectively but legal or legalized corruption such as by deliberately contriving the benchmarking of salaries to the highest paid CEOs without basis or apple-to-apple comparison through getting their own elected MPs to use majority votes to push such self-taking of public monies through its circus parliament to escape punishment of otherwise illegal act under the Company or Trust Law or CBT,
              
              Because the leaders know or should know this manner of taking of public monies by wrongful and immoral or illegal due to conflict of interest in such passing of such self-rewarding laws and because they can so far succeed in making it look like legal or rule of law and citizens cannot say prove otherwise they will avoid queries for many years unless there is a bigger number of civic citizens who would express total outrage or condemnation as seen in NKF.
