            <div class='col-md body'>Much has been said about whether chee is comparable to nelson or not but that is really beside the point. no one ever made that comparison in terms of values or character but rather in terms of situation.<br><br>looking at chee's case, whether he is delusional does not change the fact that there is a historical precedence of disproportional legal action against those deemed a threat to the leaders. i wont even say they are a threat to national security or stability, or even a threat to the leader's integrity as always claimed. Look at JBJ, Tang, Francis Seow etc etc..if historical precedence is of any use it is this; it shows an established pattern of treatment of those who addressed issues that put leaders in a critical light or even unfavourable position. perhaps there is some truth in the opposition criticisms there that could not stand the light of day brought about by questions? we do not really know because there was no open debate, where allegations were allowed to be made and countered for all to see. instead they were 'buried'.<br><br>no one is perfect, therefore i do not believe that our leaders are always right and their policies always wise and beneficial to the general public, although i have to qualify the statement by saying that so far, for most areas they did a pretty fine job.<br><br>but thats why we need an opposition. to point out the alternatives. now if the opposition is stupid, then it is to the ruling party's favour in a fair fight to discredit, through the use of logic and facts the opposition. in this way, there is no doubt who is the better man and who is fit to rule. but to use, an oxymoron, a legally 'underhand' way of demolishing your opponent even before he speaks as a way to defend your own 'credibility' is again, an oxymoronic situation. u gain credibility by showing everyone how dirty you play?? u 'bury' what your opponent has to say to maintain your own integrity? reading parliamentary debates of democracies would show that leaders and opposition debated, each with their passion and logic, on policies and even on credibility issues. this way there is really nothing to hide. you want people to respect your leadership, you go to show what u have that the others don. you don win the fight by killing the other guy before he can open his mouth and declare yourself winner.<br><br>i don particularly like chee but i do not for a moment think he is stupid. he has done what most s'poreans wouldnt dare do and given the odds, he has'nt ran away. now, doesnt that say something about him, despite his other faults?</div>

U of all the people here should know better."<br><br>Didn't u realise that after your posting there were porn and many :mrgreen<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Also, I feel that Atobe had said sth constructive and there wasn't any flaming. Mayb u could enlighten me on what u meant by "dun flame"?<br><br>As a mod, I believe u should abstain from passing judgment on the forummers or their exchange. Forummer bickering is a common feature in all forums. We are quite used to it though we believe there are better ways of solving differences.<br><br>It would be good if you could refain from interfering in discussions. Aren't internet forums avenues for us to air our different views? Aren't we too clamped up by the govt already?<br><br>May I know what did u mean by "du lan" in your response to the porn?  Was it sth I suspect - a crude term? If yes, then as a mod, I think you should be more mindful of your lang. If not, my apologies.<br><br>cheers<br>raihanraihan</div>
