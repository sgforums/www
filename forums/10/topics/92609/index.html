            <div class='col-md body'>It is amazing that through his Press Secretary, MM LKY, had issued the following statement:<br><br>"Mr Chee should learn from Nelson Mandela.

By breaking the rules and flouting the law, he is getting himself marginalised.

            <div class='col-md body'>From the Strait Times Webby:-<br><br>Chee claims SM Goh, MM Lee avoiding him<br><br>He says Monday's hearing to set damages against him took place in his absence as they didn't want to be cross-examined by him<br><br>By Lydia Lim<br><br>AFTER being absent from a court hearing on Monday to determine the damages he must pay for defaming Mr Goh Chok Tong and Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr Chee Soon Juan yesterday launched an attack on both leaders and the court system.<br><br>He said the hearing was held despite his asking for a postponement because Senior Minister Goh and Minister Mentor Lee wanted to avoid being cross- examined by him.<br><br>'It was Lee and Goh who objected to the postponement and wanted to proceed in my absence,' he said.<br><br>At Monday's hearing, counsel for the plaintiffs Davinder Singh said Dr Chee had deliberately stayed away so that he and the foreigners who fund him could 'conjure up a complaint of unfairness and, in the process, attack Singapore'.<br><br>Mr Singh also said the hearing - which ordinarily would have been held in April or May - had been postponed to Sept 6-8 to accommodate Dr Chee's schedule.<br><br>This was because in January, Dr Chee informed the court that he would be away from February to August on a fellowship in the United States.<br><br>Mr Singh said Dr Chee had the 'opportunity of a lifetime' to cross-examine Mr Goh and Mr Lee but chose instead to flee.<br><br>He did so because he did not want to be cross-examined and for the public to be reminded that he was a fraud, cheat and liar, Mr Singh added.<br><br>Yesterday, Dr Chee challenged these claims in a press statement titled 'Just Who Is Avoiding Whom?'<br><br>In it, he asked if Mr Singh's claims sounded even remotely reasonable when he was the one to ask for the hearing to be postponed so he could be present.<br><br>Calling Monday's hearing a 'charade', he gave an account of his correspondence with the courts.<br><br>He said he learnt only a few weeks ago that the hearing would take place from Sept 6-8 and asked for it to be postponed until he returned in the middle of the month.<br><br>He said that despite this, the courts set Sept 2 for both parties to come before the registrar to agree on a mutually convenient date for the hearing, a move that was 'nutty' as it was clear he would not be back here by then.<br><br>He said the registrar then said the hearing would proceed as fixed on Sept 6-8, which begged the question as to why there was a need for a meeting on Sept 2.<br>Related links<br>Watch Channel i news clip<br><br>'Be that as it may, the question still remains: Why would the plaintiffs be so anxious to push for a date in early September?<br><br>'I realised the answer when I saw photographs of Lee and Goh emerging from the courts: They did not want me to be present to cross-examine them,' said Dr Chee, who is representing himself in the case.<br><br>In the 2001 polls, he accused Mr Goh and Mr Lee of misleading Parliament over an alleged $17-billion loan to former Indonesian president Suharto.<br><br>He apologised but did not pay damages and later withdrew the apology. The High Court ruled in August 2002 that he had defamed the leaders and ordered him to pay damages. He appealed but lost in April last year.<br><br>For the first time, he also explained where he needed to be when he missed Monday's hearing.<br><br>His Singapore Democratic Party said earlier that he 'was on his way back from the US'. Yesterday, he said he was now in Taiwan for a Sept 9 conference, a date 'fixed way before' he knew of the court dates.<br><br>His wife also wanted to visit her family and for their children to spend time with their grandparents and, thus, he was staying there until after the conference.<br><br>He maintained that the dispute could still be resolved by adjourning the current hearing until his return to Singapore.<br><br>'I'd be happy to be cross- examined and then have the opportunity to do the same with Lee and Goh. Do readers here think that the former prime ministers will be willing to do this?<br><br>'It will be the litmus test to show just who is trying to avoid whom,' he said.<br><br></div>
