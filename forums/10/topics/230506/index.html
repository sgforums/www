            <div class='col-md body'>Think Temasek's investment in Shin Corp will be badly affected, a forced sale to reduce stake to 50% will definitely affect the share price adversely, I wonder how much did our dear Ho Ching loss in the Shin Corp deal.<br><br>BANGKOK : Thailand will limit foreign investors to holding no more than 50 percent of the shares or the voting rights in companies here under legal changes approved Tuesday, officials said.<br><br>"Foreign investors who altogether hold more than a 50 percent stake in a company must lower their stake within a year," Finance Minister Pridiyathorn Devakula said after a nearly five-hour cabinet meeting about the changes.<br><br>"Foreign investors who hold more than 50 percent of voting rights must also reduce their voting rights within two years," he added.<br><br>The 50-percent cap will only apply to companies that deal with areas considered important to national security, or that have an impact on natural resources or Thai culture, he said.<br><br>Stocks tumbled on the news, with share prices falling 2.03 percent after the announcement. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) was down 12.84 points to 620.98.<br><br>The cabinet approved the changes to the Foreign Business Act "in principle" on Tuesday but army-installed Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said the new regulations would not take effect for "some time," as the country tries to reassure investors about their impact.<br><br>Surayud said the government's top panel of legal advisers would continue to work on the details of the law to ensure precision and transparency.<br><br>"The Council of State is authorized to work on the details to make the law precise and transparent, without any need to be resubmitted for cabinet approval again," he told reporters.<br><br>"It will take some time for the law to take effect," he added.<br><br>"We think that it needs to be worked out in detail for the law to be more transparent, and to make investors more confident," Surayud said.<br><br>"If we explain clearly and allow investors to participate, they will agree that the law is open and transparent at a certain level."<br><br>Companies have traditionally set up operations in Thailand so that the local subsidiaries are nominally owned by Thais but controlled by foreigners.<br><br>Analysts fear the revised law could force foreign companies to sell off huge amounts of stock to Thai investors, who might not be able to absorb a large number of shares over a short period.<br><br>Investors were already nervous about Thailand, especially after last month's sudden introduction and reversal of capital control measures, which sparked a stock market crash.<br><br>The market had just recovered from that crash when the deadly New Year's Eve bomb blasts in Bangkok sent share prices plunging again last week. - AFP /dt<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_business/view/251434/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_business/view/251434/1/.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's 'the end of investment'<br><br>The chairman of the Federation of Thai Capital Market Organisations warned Thailand to brace for a halt in new foreign investment and the gradual withdrawal of foreign investment because the amendments to the Foreign Business Act passed by the Cabinet Tuesday are construed as unwelcoming signs.<br><br>Dr. Kongkiat Opaswongkarn added that foreign-invested companies operating in the retail, automobile and telecommunications sectors will be those hardest hit by the amendments which restrict foreign ownership and voting rights to 50 per cent.<br><br>The federation executive said the changes -- subject to final approval by the military-appointed National Legislative Assembly -- are deemed "unwelcoming" signals from Thailand to foreign investors.<br><br>"I believe foreigners won't put more money in Thailand as a result of apprehension over these new rules. At the same time, those already here would have to leave to comply with the cap and there will be very few Thai investors who are financially capable of filling those gaps," he said.<br><br>Dr. Kongkiat said the Thai currency and the stock market are likely to bear the brunt of the move as a consequence of such moves seen as hostile to foreign investment.<br><br>Equity research analyst Thanomsak Saharatanachai of Pattanasin Securities said a host of negative factors, including the bombs during New Year and the latest move on the Foreign Business Act are likely to slow the country's economic growth by up to one per cent this year.<br><br>Operating profits of listed companies are also likely to fall. Yet even these projected profits could disappear in the light of political certainties, including the constitution drafting being completed on schedule to pave the way for general elections.

            <div class='col-md body'>'Some investors' may pull out: FTI<br><br>(TNA) Â– Foreign investors are likely to withdraw certain Thai investments which they believe offer unattractive returns because of amendments to the Foreign Business Act, according to the Federation of Thai Industries.<br><br>FTI Chairman Santi Vilassakdanont said the amendments will impact foreign investors, particularly new players, who will need to consider more carefully to see if they will benefit from investments.<br><br>He said he believed foreign investors already involved in Thailand will not withdraw. Those who do will probably leave because they believe their investments are not attractive - but not a significant number.<br><br>Metha Chanchaemcharas, President of Plus Property Co, said the amendments might affect foreign investment in the property business in the short run.<br><br>It might make investment slower as investors consider details of the amendments and see whether it is worth investment and the measure would be adjusted later.<br><br>He projected the investors would not withdraw an existing investment amount immediately because they had to wait and see clarity of the amended Act.<br><br>Mr Metha said the investors had not only paid attention to a shareholding portion and managerial power, but also considered economic conditions and investment atmosphere for their decision to invest in Thailand.<br><br>He added the investors would need to take time to adjust themselves to the new regulations under the amended Act.<br><br>14:31 Jan 10, 2007 Bangkok Post<br></div>

Pridiyathorn, who is both deputy prime minister and finance minister, was a jaw-dropping reversal from comments he made on Tuesday, when he specifically identified telecoms companies as one of the business categories facing the proposed restrictions.<br><br>M.R. Pridiyathorn said today he had misspoken.<br><br>M.R. Pridiyathorn further backed away from the supposedly strict new guidelines when he said that the govenment would be "flexible" in applying the law.<br><br>On Tuesday, the cabinet passed regulations to limit foreigners' shareholding and voting rights in sectors deemed vital to national security to less than 50 per cent would be flexible. The new laws must pass a bureaucratic approval process, which is expected to go smoothly, and then will go into effect.<br><br>"The amount of business effected by this law is very minimal," said M.R. Pridiyathorn.<br><br>Reports that have stated as many as 10,000 businesses will be effected are "not true." About 2,400 companies are effected by the law, mainly in the service sector and including hotels, but of those about 1,060 have BoI (Board of Investment) privileges that override the law, he said.<br><br>M.R. Pridyathorn was surprised by the reaction that sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) down 2.7 per cent Tuesday, although it climbed back up 1 per cent Wednesday.<br><br>President of the Joint Foreign Chamber of Commerce Peter van Haren called the amendments a disappointment that "will have a negative effect. We're quite sure on that."<br><br>Before the abrupt turnaround by M.R. Pridiyathorn, Telenor of Norway, which owns a controlling stake in Thailand's second-largest mobile telecoms operator known as DTAC, said it intends to remain in the country despite new rules that increase restrictions on foreign investors.<br><br>"We have a long-term perspective, and we will of course behave in accordance with the law if and when it will be changed," Telenor spokesman Esben Tuman told Reuters.<br><br>"We have been in Thailand for a long time... and we have every ambition to stay there," he added.<br><br>Tuman declined to comment on the potential impact, if any, of the planned regulation on Telenor's activities in Thailand.<br><br>Peter Van Haren, the chairman of the Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce said he understood why Thailand decided to amend the Foreign Business Act but said he was still not happy with the proposed amendments.<br><br>"We still hold on to our previous opinion even after the government explained to us," he said.<br><br>Van Haren said on Tuesday the members of the Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce were "very disappointed with the move."<br><br>16:24 Jan 10, 2007 Bangkok Post<br><br></div>

The Bank of Thailand's lifting measure, announced on December 18 last year, had weakened the baht by Bt36.53 to the dollar on December 21. Exporters would like the baht to trade between Bt38-40 to the greenback.<br><br>Exporters have been suffering from the strengthening of the baht. They also foresee flat business growth if the currency keeps escalating against the dollar, making Thai products more expensive for global players.<br><br>"The baht should not be stronger than our export rivals. Otherwise, Thailand may lose export markets" one exporter said.<br><br>According to a recent BOT report, the baht has appreciated by 14 per cent against the dollar since last year. However, it was stronger by 9.3 per cent when compared with early 2005. The strong baht has prompted the country's competitiveness to ease by 8.6 per cent, which is the same rate as other Asian countries.<br><br>But major export rivals - China, the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia - have a slight edge as their currencies have not gained as much as the baht to the dollar.<br><br>The fear is that Thailand might not reach its export target of US$145.22 billion (Bt5.18 trillion) this year, an increase by 12.5 per cent, as projected by the Commerce Ministry.<br><br>Katiya Greigarn, chairman of the electronics and electrical-appliances sector of the Federation of Thai Industries (FDI), said the strengthening of the baht had hurt Thai exporters. Exports of electrical appliances, for example, will face flat growth this year because of high competition, particularly from China.<br><br>He said exports of electronic goods, the country's major export product, will confront a tough situation. Exports in this sector were expected to grow by 20 per cent to Bt1 trillion last year. However, exports this year may grow 15 to 19 per cent because Thai goods may become more expensive.<br><br>Another factor that may reduce export growth is a shortage of skilled labour. Katiya said about 50,000 labourers are needed to supply the expansion of the electronics industry in the next three years.<br><br>Somsak Borrisutanakul, chairman of the plastics sector of the FDI, said this year and next year plastic exports will remain unchanged at Bt70 billion in value.<br><br>Although plastic exports performed quite well in the first half of last year, the baht's appreciation had lowered exporters' competitiveness.<br><br>He said the federation predicted that the strengthening baht will cause flat growth this year.<br><br>"The problem will also carry on and affect export growth next year," he said, adding that exporters are trying to increase their competitiveness, but the fluctuating baht is beyond their control.<br><br>He added that other negative signals include a projection of a global economic slowdown.<br><br>This will create a domino effect upon Thailand's major importing countries such as the US and the European Union.<br><br>The International Monetary Fund projected that global trade will grow by 7.6 per cent from 8.9 per cent last year, while the world economy is expected to rise by 4.9 per cent from 5.1 per cent.<br><br>The economies of Thailand's trading partners will also show a slowdown in growth in 2007. The US economy is predicted to grow by 2.9 from 3.1 per cent; Japan's by 2.1 from 2.9 per cent, and the EU's 2 per cent from 2.4 per cent.<br><br>Chookiat Ophawongse, president of the Rice Traders Association, said the baht's appreciation had directly hit agricultural goods the most. Traders and manufacturers have had to shoulder higher production costs while the stronger baht has made imported raw materials cheaper than using local content.<br><br>The association forecasts that rice exports may not perform as well as previously projected, although Vietnam, the country's major export rival, announced that it would temporarily suspend white-rice exports.<br><br>Chookiat said the rising gap in rice prices will lower Thailand's export competitiveness. Exports are predicted to reach about 8 to 8.5 million tonnes, down from a previous estimate of 10 million tonnes.<br><br>Pornchai Chuenchomlada, president of Thai Gems and Jewellery Traders Association, said despite the rising value of the baht, exports of jewellery are expected to grow by 15 per cent to Bt172.5 billion this year, thanks to the recent US announcement to renew duty-free privileges for two more years.<br><br>He said the continuation of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for two years until December 31, 2008, will maintain the country's competitiveness. However, the baht's strength was still a negative factor for the industry's exports which would affect its targeted growth of 15 per cent this year.<br><br>Thavorn Chalassathien, chairman of the auto parts sector of the FDI, said exports of auto parts seemed to be one of the few sectors that was suffering less from the strong baht because it also relied on raw material imports. Some 30 to 50 per cent of production involves imported goods. Although income from exports will be decreased, lower costs of production will lessen the problem for auto parts' exporters, he said.<br><br>Auto parts exports are expected to increase by 15 per cent to Bt280 billion this year from this year's figure of Bt240 billion.<br><br>Other negative factors to slow down the country's export growth include the suspension of bilateral trade negotiations with trading partners, the rise of non-tariff barriers and new import standards by major markets.<br><br>Export Promotion Department director-general Rachane Potjanasuntorn said the two export products that would be hardest hit by the baht's appreciation are shrimp and canned fruits and vegetables, both of which rely mostly on domestic raw materials.<br><br>Other exports that will face tough competition next year are textiles and garments, rubber, chicken, furniture and leather goods.<br><br>Petchanet Pratruangkrai<br><br>The Nation<br></div>
