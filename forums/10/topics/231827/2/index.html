His land and buildings (immovable property) outside Singapore are not liable to duty.</blockquote>I don't really understand this thread... If you invest your money on land in singapore, u r still liable for estate tax. It is only when u invest in land overseas then u r not liable for it. However u still have to pay estate tax to that other country from where u buy for the land. In the end there is no tax exempt... tat guy still have to pay tax for everything right ?</div>
