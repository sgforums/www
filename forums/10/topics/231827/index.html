If we look at the manner in which Singapore is governed, it will be a very big surprise if the Civil Servants are allowed to exercise such a wide latitude of decision making space .<br><br>More likely, it is the Political Leaders of this government that dictate the policy pricing on all land to be sold from their land bank - perhaps to absorb the large amount of savings in the CPF accounts of Singaporeans, and to knock the profit from the developer.<br><br>All property transactions will involve our CPF, is it any co-incidence that our CPF accounts are managed by the Government, who will also help themselves to the large amount of CPF savings by all Singaporeans, borrowing at dirt cheap rates the CPF funds for supposedly infrastructural developments - which are not easily convertible into CASH.<br><br>Instead of having to return the borrowed funds into our CPF accounts - which do not enjoy any higher interest rates - the high prices set by the Government on all property sold, will result in a "write-off" to the Government  borrowings from our CPF Accounts.<br><br>Besides setting the sales price for the land to be developed - which allow the Government to take the first cut of any expected future profits of the developer - the Government also charges a stamp fee for all cycles of the transaction (from purchase of a barren land, stamp duties on contracts, to the contracts signed between the Developer and his Contractors, to the eventual multiple sales contracts with the various owners of the properties developed.<br><br>The Ministry of National Development and the URA even set the price levels on land "sold" to the HDB.<br><br>The "rich Singaporeans" - who got rich by being property developers - are not hurt by these greedy practices of this Government, as the property developers will merely add more costs onto the sales price of the project.<br><br>Are the "rich" to be blamed for the speculative aspect of the property market ?<br><br>There is a capital gain tax on any profits made, when it becomes obvious that such regular profits made will form the income of the speculator.<br></span><br><br></div>
