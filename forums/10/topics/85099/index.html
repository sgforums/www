            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like the prices of our HDB flats won't come down for sometime to come.<br><br>Forum:    the Sammyboy's Alfresco Coffee Shopâ„¢ Forum<br>&gt; Subject:  HDB units pay directors 661% more<br>&gt; From:      (GENTAN)<br>&gt; To:       (ALL)<br>&gt; DateTime: 30/06/2004 02:11:16<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Wah HDB so profitable! More good years ahead!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; HDB units pay directors 661% more<br>&gt; Bulk of jump in directors? fees, remuneration incurred by new HDB<br>Corp<br>&gt;<br>&gt; By Chua Kong Ho<br>&gt;<br>&gt; DIRECTORS? fees and remuneration paid by Housing and Development<br>&gt; Board subsidiaries rose 661 per cent to $3.04 million last year<br>from<br>&gt; $459,000 in 2002, according to its 2003 financial statement<br>released<br>&gt; this month.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Most of the expense was incurred by HDB Corp, a wholly owned but<br>&gt; separate private limited company formed last year to take over the<br>&gt; functions of the former building and development division.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; HDB Corp?s status as a private company means that it paid out<br>&gt; directors? fees and remuneration ? something that it did not have<br>to<br>&gt; do as a division within a statutory board.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Said HDB in an e-mailed statement: ?The bulk of these fees, ie $2.6<br>&gt; million, was incurred by HDB Corp, which is a private company. It<br>&gt; includes the fees, salary, bonus and other emoluments, including<br>&gt; benefits-in-kind, for the directors in HDB Corp as well as its<br>&gt; subsidiaries.?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It was responding to queries from Streats about the jump in<br>&gt; directors? fees and remuneration.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; It added: ?We wish to clarify that HDB does not pay directors? fees<br>&gt; and remuneration. It is our subsidiaries which paid such fees.?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; A check of records filed with the Accounting and Corporate<br>Regulatory<br>&gt; Authority showed that HDB Corp has 10 directors, including chairman<br>&gt; Ngiam Tong Dow, former HDB CEO and architect Liu Thai Ker, Keppel<br>&gt; Land managing director Kevin Wong, Far East Organization CEO Philip<br>&gt; Ng, Actis regional managing director Chin Bay Chong, Parsons<br>&gt; Brinckerhoff CEO Quek Sze Swee, Ministry of Defence second<br>permanent<br>&gt; secretary Tan Kim Siew and HDB Corp CEO Tan Thai Hong.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Mr Tan Thai Hong is the only executive director on HDB Corp?s<br>board,<br>&gt; a check with the company confirmed.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; While not strictly comparable, United Engineers, the largest<br>publicly<br>&gt; listed construction group on the local bourse with a market<br>&gt; capitalisation of $346.4 million, paid its directors $740,000 in<br>&gt; remuneration and fees in 2003, according to its annual report.<br>&gt; However, this excludes stock options granted by the company.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The total bill for last year?s restructuring exercise stood at<br>nearly<br>&gt; $400 million, taking into account the payouts in special<br>resignation<br>&gt; benefits and the cost of investment in the new set-up.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The annual report showed that HDB booked an additional $31.1<br>million<br>&gt; in restructuring-related costs in 2003, on top of the $218.5<br>million<br>&gt; in 2002.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; HDB also invested $142.6 million as share capital to set up HDB<br>Corp,<br>&gt; bringing the total for the restructuring exercise to $392.2 million.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; HDB?s deficit from normal operations ? which exclude costs related<br>to<br>&gt; the restructuring exercise ? climbed to $821.1 million last year<br>from<br>&gt; $557.5 million in 2002, due to an increase in the number of CPF<br>&gt; housing grant cases, lower surpluses from mortgage financing and<br>&gt; higher upgrading expenditure.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The statutory board?s annual deficit is fully covered by a<br>government<br>&gt; grant.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The annual report showed that HDB?s staff strength fell to 5,116 at<br>&gt; the end of the 2003 financial year, down from 7,861 a year earlier,<br>&gt; partly as employees were let go because of the restructuring.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Wage costs for HDB itself totalled $337.1 million, or 27.8 per cent<br>&gt; less than the previous year?s $466.8 million. totalled $337.1<br>&gt; million, or 27.8 per cent lower than the previous year?s $466.8<br>&gt; million.</div>
