            <div class='col-md body'>The only reason I believe there isn't a tendency for Racial Conflicts in Singapore is that the legal system here is pretty "efficient" in the sense that it clamps down on any behaviour that is even likely to result into a conflict.<br><br>The lack of Racial Conflicts in Singapore Today does not reflect on the levels of Racial Harmony. Racism is rampant in Singapore at all levels and everywhere. It's just unlikely to blow up into a conflict thanks to prohibitive and severe laws. What we have in Singapore effectively is Racial Tolerance, rather than Racial Harmony. :p<br><br>I hope that helps in your Project.</div>

But on the same token, there are several others who do eventually resort to racism under "stress levels"<br><br>I've been fortunate as a minority to not have been subject to too much of racism. But all my brothers have not been as lucky.<br><br>I guess one of the issues is defining when Racial Tolerance becomes Racial Harmony.<br><br>Personally I equate<br><br>1. Persistent Negative Stereotyping<br>2. Persistent Racist Jokes pertaining to one race only<br>3. Explicit Racial slurs<br><br>As Racial Disharmony.<br><br>1. Persistent Negative Stereotyping.<br><br>Consider the case of the Malay:<br><br>Several times I've come across people who say the Malays are a lazy bunch of people. They always like to "lepak" one corner. Today, this is even a hot topic in Malaysian Politics.<br><br>One of the admirable qualities of the Malay Culture, however, is that, more than most of the other races, they emphasize on the need for the family unit to be closeknit and strong. As a result, you find the tendency for Malays to not work to the point of neglecting their families. This IS a problem with for example a good number of Chinese Families.<br><br>There is no right or wrong here. Its just a different emphasis to what's more important.<br><br>Or agains consider the case of the Indian:<br><br>An Indian who doesnt defend his case (against an argument) has lost the argument.<br><br>An Indian who on the otherhand successfully rebuts a case in his favour is seen as being Egoistic and subject to taunts that "they just cannot accept defeat..." or "Indians... everything also must argue".<br><br>It is rampant, I tell you. I've come across it several times myself :p<br><br>2. Persistent Racist Jokes against a particular race.<br><br>They can be fun if they are isolated and said once in a while without malice. Or if the person saying it, "plays is fair" and tells a joke relating to his own. But there are many who make it a habit to persistently make fun of one particular race and it can be seen in duress, or close encounters (with the other race), where they emphasize on the joke again as a confirmation of it.<br><br>3. Explicit Racial Slurs<br><br>This usually is found in younger children and older folks. I cannot understand the reason for this. In kindergarten, the chinese students have a tendency to call the indian students, "Black" or "Dirty" or "Smelly". I cannot help but think just where is it that they learnt to call them by those names.<br><br>The reason I know many of these things may probably lie in the wide range of contacts I have. I used to teach in a school and racial slurs and racism is a commonplace. Fights happened everyday(!) as a result of this racism.<br><br>The other groups of people I love mixing around with are the "Youth at Risk" which make up an alarmingly sizeable population today. Same results.<br><br>And then there are the supposedly more "harmonious" ones who under "stress conditions" (like anger/disdain) burst out in a racial slur. At all other times they can maintain good friendship with the other race.<br><br>I call it Racial Tolerance because the lines are drawn pretty clearly several times. I may be guilty of being utopian, but true racial harmony I believe, is when everyone sees himself as being Singaporean and not from any of the races. They not only retain their culture, they even adopt the culture of others in their daily living. I've a group of friends who feel this way and I enjoy their company most.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and so you think racial harmony does exist.<br>it's just a smokescreen. We're still on the 'tolerant' level, not 'understanding' level.<br><br>may i ask - why is it in forms, we must fill in what's our 'race'. Aren't we all of one race which is the Human Race?<br><br>And everyone is bias/prejudicial towards or against anything and everything. That's where our preferences/likes/loves/favourites (ranging from however minimal degree to a maximal degree) in our life stem from.<br><br>Oh, anyway, hypocrites are everywhere. I see people mentioning 'there's bound to be some racial pricks out there.' but never realizing deep down within themselves, there's a lil' racism within themselves.<br><br>Of course, we won't be making a clean sweeping statement. That's where 'the black sheeps' emerge. But then again, I see a huge swelling number of black sheeps within one race all around the world.<br><br>I remembered someone posting information/facts &amp; truths about Islam in a bid to correct people's perception on Islam so they could further understand. It resulted in others firing questions back at him at such a rapid rate that he's unable to answer them all. Well, obviously, he would start asking questions of his faith. He tried so hard to give a good name and image to Islam that has been destroyed and warped by the radicals &amp; terrorists.<br><br>He lifted facts, and then they lifted facts in a counter-argumentative stance. It's all a friendly argument which somehow escalated into some sort of tension albeit in the cyberworld.<br><br>During the Kampung days, the Malays call Chinese pork-eaters, babi-cina, munjen etc, Chinese call Malays kiao tor and Indians keling-kias, but it didn't even create a spark, much less a furore.<br><br>But don't forget, racial riots did spark out in Singapore. And the govt got so 'scared' it ensured 'racial harmony.' Hmmm...<br><br></div>
