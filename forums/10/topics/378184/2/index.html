              <p>I think that all schools should be privatized and let the free market sort out the problem.</p>
              <p>The good schools will remain, the bad schools will be gone.</p>
              <p>Consistantly get bad reviews on your school? Bad luck, your teachers are gone.</p>
              <p>In Europe they have this very interesting situation. The government gives vouchers to parents and they can use these vouchers to choose any school they wish. Those schools that do not do enough to convince their parents that their school is good, their children will not go to those schools because the parents have the power to choose and they get closed down fast.</p>
              <p>So schools are always trying to improve themselves just to survive.</p>

              <p>bad idea! just when you say we need moral and civil education, you are now leaving the education of our kids to the businessmen. And what is a good school to you? high scores and marks...</p>

              <p>It's not the teachers. It's the parents. If parents don't teach the kids proper from young, they're going to assume it's 'okay'. Guess who kids follow and look up to when they are young and constantly attempting to learn to communicate? </p>

              <p>I think part of the problem is the fact that many primary kids
              don't have the habit of reading books much these days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the time now is spent playing games on the computer or
              watching TV.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Years back when television programmes were limited and there was
              no such thing as the internet, kids had all the time to just sit
              down and read - books from Enid Blyton like the Secret Seven
              series, Famous Five Series and other adventure books like Nancy
              Drew and Hardy Boys, Alfred Hitchcock and The 3 Investigators
              etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reading somehow reinforces the use of proper grammar and
              language usage though repetitive and consistent usage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would suggest starting a good and proper reading program in
              primary and secondary schools (last time they used to have it but
              not too sure about now) .<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>As much as the topic goes, how should the reform be then? Don't tell me it's the Gov job. Some good suggestions might be interesting.</p>
              <p>1) Having full day classes starting from 7.30am or 8 am to about 5pm, with canteen, lunch and tea breaks. Sleeping breaks to be introduced.</p>
              <p>2) Class size should be halved by 50% or more.Each class size should not have more than 20 students.</p>
              <p>3) Activities not involved in teaching should be handled by other admin or co-ordinators for the job. Teachers role should really just be teaching and not co-ordinate other school CCA unless she volunteers</p>
              <p>4) Actively get the chew ren to be involved in botanical, nature and volunteer work. Get them to clean toilets as well. Those caught slacking shall be shot, shit upon and shot again!</p>
              <p>*) Teachers take pay cut... Oops... Accident :D</p>
              <p>The pay cut is a joke.</p>

              <p><br>Singapore edu system take early childhood education more towards memorizing and skill learning not exploring talent and naturing. So for parent who expect School to download Brain 7.0 they are in for a surprise. Not all the child are wire the same. So for some early childhood learning in Singapore can be quite stressful, and for some it is just memorizing.</p>
              <p>the other ignorant knowledge from SG parents are childhood brain development activities unfortunately this has to do with lifestyle, food, sleep hours and posture.    </p>
              <p>In the US There is a entire section of research done on this topics on early childhood  learning and brain development.</p>
              <p>I think Sg just scrap the superficial surface and generalized it. or they had taken LKY advised that early childhood make not different...that is why our primaries school education spending is so low compare to other countries.</p>
