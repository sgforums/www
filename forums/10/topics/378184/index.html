              <p>After the Ris Low saga, many people are calling for a total reform of the way languages are taught in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Not only do the students speak and write bad English, even the teachers do not acknowledge the need for proper english. With most teachers who do not teach the English language being the worst offenders.</p>

              <p>Well British English would be the benchmark i suppose since Singapore as a nation was once part of the British Empire.</p>

              <p>I think part of the problem is the fact that many primary kids don't have the habit of reading books much these days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the time now is spent playing games on the computer or watching TV.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Years back when television programmes were limited and there was no such thing as the internet, kids had all the time to just sit down and read - books from Enid Blyton like the Secret Seven series, Famous Five Series and other adventure books like Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys, Alfred Hitchcock and The 3 Investigators etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reading somehow reinforces the use of proper grammar and language usage though repetitive and consistent usage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would suggest starting a good and proper reading program in primary and secondary schools (last time they used to have it but not too sure about now) .<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Actually, so what if some of our fellow Singaporeans are sucky at English? We can't really blame them, since some of us are brought up in chinese-educated families speaking 50%&lt; Mandarin, and vice versa. As children, we learn what we hear most the fastest. Why dont we get another Miss World Singapore to speak lousy Mandarin? Then we will blame SG's education to be inefficient in teaching proper mandarin. Nobody can be perfect, same rule applies to countries. Every single SG citizen must speak proper English/Mandarin/Malay/Tamil etc.? Not possible. I'm sure MOE already realises the need to emphasize on English education before this Ris Low saga. </p>
              <p>Off topic : I agree with iceFatboy, students nowadays are getting out of hand, even students from top schools are seen doing stupid things. Being a student myself I am getting pissed off by many of my schoolmates.</p>

              <p>I do agree with this statement.</p>
              <p>As a HR practitioner, i have come across some people who have great paper qualifications and results, but horrible EQ and work ethics. Very often when being interviewed, they have this mentality that grades and the institution which they graduated will get them the job being offered.</p>
              <p>In my previous firm, we hired this person, fresh out of university, who had great grades, a solid interview, but when after he got hired he could not cope with the rigors of working in a manufacturing environment and left after less than a year.</p>

              <p>As much as the topic goes, how should the reform be then? Don't tell me it's the Gov job. Some good suggestions might be interesting.</p>
              <p>1) Having full day classes starting from 7.30am or 8 am to about 5pm, with canteen, lunch and tea breaks. Sleeping breaks to be introduced.</p>
              <p>2) Class size should be halved by 50% or more.Each class size should not have more than 20 students.</p>
              <p>3) Activities not involved in teaching should be handled by other admin or co-ordinators for the job. Teachers role should really just be teaching and not co-ordinate other school CCA unless she volunteers</p>
              <p>4) Actively get the chew ren to be involved in botanical, nature and volunteer work. Get them to clean toilets as well. Those caught slacking shall be shot, shit upon and shot again!</p>
              <p>*) Teachers take pay cut... Oops... Accident :D</p>
              <p>The pay cut is a joke.</p>

              <p>I think that all schools should be privatized and let the free market sort out the problem.</p>
              <p>The good schools will remain, the bad schools will be gone.</p>
              <p>Consistantly get bad reviews on your school? Bad luck, your teachers are gone.</p>
              <p>In Europe they have this very interesting situation. The government gives vouchers to parents and they can use these vouchers to choose any school they wish. Those schools that do not do enough to convince their parents that their school is good, their children will not go to those schools because the parents have the power to choose and they get closed down fast.</p>

              <p>while Language is important, I feel that more important, Civil or Moral studies should be put back into the system. Students (not all) nowsadays, are alien to things such as courtesy, respect for elderly, &amp; morals.</p>
