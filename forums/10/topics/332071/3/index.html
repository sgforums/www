              <p>Barely two weeks after it placed the second order for <em>A Nation Cheated</em>,
              Kinokuniya Bookstore has ordered more copies of the book. Written by Dr
              Chee Soon Juan, the book is selling briskly and is obviously in demand.
              Select Books, a small bookshop at the Tanglin Shopping Centre, is also
              selling it. <br><br>The first part of the book delves into how Mr Lee Kuan Yew really came to power. 
               <br>Singaporeans
              have been<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> repeatedly told that Mr Lee had defeated the communists in a
              life-and-death struggle to control Singapore.<br></span><br> Declassified
              documents in London, however, show that things may not have been quite
              so heroic. The information that has surfaced<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> reveals that there was
              much behind-the-scenes machination between Mr Lee and the British. </span><br><br>Mr
              Lim and his allies were repeatedly arrested by the colonial government
              which paved the way for Mr Lee and his faction to come to power.<br> <br>Records
              indicate that in reality the British did not consider the late Lim Chin
              Siong a communist and officials stated repeatedly that his fight for
              power was well within constitutional means. <br> <br> It was, in fact,
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Lee Kuan Yew who insisted that Mr Lim be detained without trial.</span> At
              the same time, however, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he did not want to be seen openly calling for
              his comrade's arrest for fear of a political backlash as the
              charismatic Lim was hugely popular with Singaporeans. </span><br><br>And so
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Lee schemed to get the British to front the crackdown.</span> Mr Lim
              together with more than a hundred others were detained under the ISA in
              1963. He was subjected to cruel and humiliating treatment by Mr Lee's
              Internal Security Department. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Lim subsequently suffered from
              depression in prison and tried to commit suicide.</span><br><br>Historians and
              commentators have repeatedly stated that while Mr Lim Chin Siong was
              much loved and supported by Singaporeans, his nemesis Mr Lee was the
              one that London wanted to see become prime minister.<br> <br>Several
              years into the detention, Prime Minister Lee insisted that his
              erstwhile party colleague be exiled to the UK. Mr Lim was allowed to
              return to Singapore only in 1979. He died in 1996 of a heart attack.<br> <br> Apart from historical developments, <em>A Nation Cheated</em> also documents how Singaporeans have been deprived of the economic
              security that has been promised to them even as their political rights
              have been denied them.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br> This book is a must-read for those who
              want to peel the scales off their eyes and read about the side of
              Singapore that the Government won't reveal. </span>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">myths that have been
              woven about the PAP is exposed</span> and Singaporeans desperately need to
              acquaint themselves with the truth.</p>

              more than a hundred others were detained under the ISA in 1963. He
              was subjected to cruel and humiliating treatment by Mr Lee's
              Internal Security Department. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr Lim subsequently suffered from
              depression in prison and tried to commit suicide.</span><br> <br> Historians and commentators have repeatedly stated that while Mr
              Lim Chin Siong was much loved and supported by Singaporeans, his
              nemesis Mr Lee was the one that London wanted to see become prime
              minister.<br> <br> Several years into the detention, Prime Minister Lee insisted that
              his erstwhile party colleague be exiled to the UK. Mr Lim was
              allowed to return to Singapore only in 1979. He died in 1996 of a
              heart attack.<br> <br> Apart from historical developments, <em>A Nation Cheated</em> also
              documents how Singaporeans have been deprived of the economic
              security that has been promised to them even as their political
              rights have been denied them.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br> This book is a must-read for those who want to peel the scales off
              their eyes and read about the side of Singapore that the Government
              won't reveal.</span> The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">myths that have been woven about the
              PAP is exposed</span> and Singaporeans desperately need to acquaint
              themselves with the truth.</p>

              I think more constructive if we focus on building a better new regime instead of just being hell bent on destroying the old one.
              
              this is like the iraq thingie. they go in and conquer the country, but they have no idea what to do next, and in the mean time, the country is in disarray.
