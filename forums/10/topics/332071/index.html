                  an American company, had previously indicated that it didn't want to
                  sell the book because of “cultural sensitivities” whereas Times, a
                  Government owned book chain, the MPH and Popular bookstores have not
                  responded to enquiries about distribution.<br><br>Only Kinokuniya and
                  Select Books, a small retail outlet at Tanglin Shopping Centre, are
                  carrying the book. And sales have been brisk. Two weeks into the first
                  order, Kinokuniya has already made a second order.</p>

                  highlight here an excerpt from the book about Singapore being a
                  money-laundering hub of which organisations like the Transparency
                  International is taking note and the Tax Justice Network is scrutinisng.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Former chief economist at <span style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Morgan Stanley</span>,
                  Andy Xie, gave a little more insight into another method of how
                  Singapore creates wealth. Xie had written an email to his colleagues
                  that Singapore was not the success story that everyone thinks it is,
                  calling the city-state an economic failure dependent on illicit money
                  from Indonesia and China, "Actually, Singapore's success came mostly
                  from being the money laundering center for corrupt Indonesian
                  businessmen and government officials.''<br><br>The 46 year-old economist born in Shanghai, with a PhD from <span style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Massachusetts
                  Institute of Technology, made the observation after attending the
                  International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings which was
                  held in Singapore in September 2006. Xie added that "To sustain its
                  economy, Singapore is building casinos to attract corruption money from
                  China." Morgan Stanley very quickly relieved Xie of his position which
                  he had held for nine years.</span><br><br><span style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Financial
                  analyst and Singapore observer, Michael Backman, whom Goh Chok Tong
                  once lauded as "an expert in overseas Chinese" in his 1998 National Day
                  Rally speech, added that "Singapore is working hard at making itself
                  more attractive to Chinese mainlanders, be they tourists or
                  individuals, with funds to park…Casinos are being set up. There has
                  even been an influx of mainland Chinese prostitutes into Singapore's
                  quasilegal sex industry."</span><br><br><span style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">These
                  funds, according to observers that Backman cites, are not always clean.
                  One goes to the extent of saying, "Singapore has truly become the
                  global centre for parking ill-gotten gains. The private banking teams
                  are huge and in practice ask almost no questions."</span><br><br><span style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">Another
                  interviewee said that an acquaintance who made US$13 million from deals
                  in Indonesia was not enquired as to how the money was obtained despite
                  obviously working in a job that would not have allowed such amounts to
                  have been earned.</span><br><br><span style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">"Russians,
                  mainland Chinese and Indonesians are pouring money into Singapore.
                  High-end property has risen 30-50 percent in the last 18 months or so,"
                  another says. Singaporean officials make all the right noises when it
                  comes to monitoring illicit funds. Through all this the Singapore
                  Government remains largely uncooperative when it comes to meeting
                  international expectations and obligations on money laundering.</span><br><br><span style="background: #ffffff none repeat scroll 0% 50%;   -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">In
                  2006, Merrill Lynch and Capgemini reported that the number of
                  "super-rich" Indonesians living in Singapore is a staggering 18,000
                  (out of 55,000) whose wealth amounts to approximately US$87 billion.
                  Much of this wealth, complains the Indonesian Government, </span>has come from illegal activities in Indonesia.<br><br>Indonesia
                  has repeatedly proposed the signing of a memorandum of understanding
                  about cooperation with Singapore in handling money laundering. The
                  effort went unrequited until 2006. Whatever information that the
                  Indonesians needed to pursue the financial suspects had to be solicited
                  from the US.</p>

              <p><br>Will this Singapore Government hold the - "ill-gotten" - money and risk blowing up the hard earned reputation to be the Asian equivalent of the "Swiss safe haven" ?</p>
              <p>If the Singapore Government is confident that all the money is legitimate, they would not have stone-walled the Indonesians attempts to sign a Treaty that will allow investigation and extradition of those whom the Indonesian Authorities have accused to be "economic thieves" - and allow for the recovery of those "ill-gotten" gains for return to Indonesia.</p>
              <p>By protecting all this "ill gotten" gains stashed away in Singapore Banking System, this has aggravated the Singapore Indonesia politico-economic relationship.</p>
              <p>It must be naive for the Singapore Authorities to think that they can stone-wall the Indonesian Authorities on one-hand, and having the likes of Temasek and SingTel to attempt to buy into the failing Indonesian Corporations - and hood-wink the Indonesian Economic Watch Bodies with oversight on illegal monopolies.</p>

              <p>JBJ  has moved on despite having his two middle-aged sons helping him to clear his bankruptcy debts of S$200,000+ that allowed JBJ to return to politics.</p>
              <p>It was unfortunate that JBJ's heart gave up on him at the age of 82 years, when the debt was finally cleared.</p>
              <p>It is now left to another Singapore maverick - a wild card - to torment the Ruling Party, and prick their conscience with publicly exposed embarrassment - that would otherwise have lie hidden in the closet of bureaucracy or marked as State Secrets.</p>
              <p>CSJ has children that are too young to help him, and he does not have the good fortune that JBJ had with two successful sons who had been able to bail JBJ out.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans - who believe that we need a "wild card maverick" in CSJ to prick the Ruling Party - can support CSJ by buying his book.</p>
              <p>Those who do not know CSJ at all, will do well to buy the book and learn something about him and not depend on the twisted propaganda that painted CSJ in the worst colors possible.</p>
              <p>If the sale of books can get CSJ off the bankruptcy hook, it will be even better for Singapore to have him in Parliament to be a more incisive voice than the mild and accomodating voices of LTK {WP} and CST {SPP}.</p>

              <p>The profits from the sale of the book will surely be managed by the Official Assignee - as CSJ is still a bankrupt.</p>
              <p>The Official Assignee will ensure that major part of the money will be used to pay the judgement debt to those who have sued him in the Singapore Courts, and the remaining portions will go to support his family.</p>
              <p>Those who have successfully sued CSJ included MM, SM and PM - and as had happened with JBJ, all of them were too shy to pocket the money they had won from JBJ - and had donated JBJ's payment to charity of their choosing.</p>
              <p>Thanks to JBJ - those charities had received the attention from MM, SM and PM - who never believed in social welfare to support these charities anyway.</p>
              <p>The same will apply to CSJ's debt repayment, as MM, SM and PM have all taken too much from Singaporeans in terms of their FAT annual wages, and they will not want to be seen to benefit from CJS's payment.</p>
              <p>Their objective is to distract CSJ's efforts to get into Parliament, and buy time for the Ruling Political Party to continue to monopolise Parliament. It is time that is also needed to give PM LHL an easier period without a hard nosed CSJ causing LHL's cancer to recurr due to the heavy politics that must surely surface in any clash with CSJ in Parliament.</p>

              <p>the rest of the stuff is debatable, like CSJ has the power to give LHL cancer, but let's just debate on that point for now.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i bought it for 14.55 from kinokuniya too, havent had much time to finish the book due to NS. I've read up to chapter 9 and so far csj has revealed (or at least what he thinks is true) much of PAP's evils right from the begining, how LKY came to power and what is happening to the huge pool of money PAP is holding on to. For those who are sick of reading propaganda newspaper, i would recomend this book as a good source of information of what is really happening.</p></div>
