              <p>very good, you have found the source to back up your ideas. but can you just let go of the cancer thingie? it doesn't really contribute to your argument one bit.</p>
              <p>Indeed, singapore's aproach to social welfare is different from other nations. it is based more on CPF, where the government and the boss will contribute money towards your retirement, and you can draw this money when you are old. than they change it to annualties, stuff like that.</p>
              <p>unlike US, there is no welfare cheque. or australia, where the government gives you allowance if you are unemployed,  the people in singapore has to earn their retirement funds. there are still various charities you can draw upon, study bursaries, but they are more like for student, children, people with disabilities. in short, people who can't really work.</p>
              <p>i think that is the picture i am seeing.</p>

              <p>very good, you have found the source to back up your ideas. but can you just let go of the cancer thingie? it doesn't really contribute to your argument one bit.</p>
              <p>Indeed, singapore's aproach to social welfare is different from other nations. it is based more on CPF, where the government and the boss will contribute money towards your retirement, and you can draw this money when you are old. than they change it to annualties, stuff like that.</p>
              <p>unlike US, there is no welfare cheque. or australia, where the government gives you allowance if you are unemployed,  the people in singapore has to earn their retirement funds. there are still various charities you can draw upon, study bursaries, but they are more like for student, children, people with disabilities. in short, people who can't really work.</p>
              <p>i think that is the picture i am seeing.  </p>

              <p>Right or Wrong - you will see what you wish to see, and like the old proverbial saying goes : "<em>A thirsty horse can be led to the water, but no one can force it to drink</em>".</p>
              <p>If cancer is not something of concern to you, it is certainly to MM LKY - who had commented that LHL is now hung up on meditation to relieve himself of stress - as mentioned in the references in my previous post.</p>
              <p>An indication of how serious that the cancer issue is being taken, one need only to look at the set-up of the PM's office during LKY and GCT term as PM.</p>
              <p>Do you know that when LKY was in the PM chair, he had only one Minister-without-Portfolio in his Cabinet - {with Ong Teng Cheong the NTUC Sec-Gen being made a Minister without Portfolio in the PM's Office}; and when GCT was the PM, he had two Ministers-without-Portfolio in the PM's office - {then Lee Yock Suan and Lim Boon Heng} ?</p>
              <p>In LHL's cabinet, he has three Ministers in his PM's Office - S. Jayakumar as a DPM and holding a new office of Co-ordinating Minister for National Security, Lim Boon Heng and Lim Swee Say are both Ministers-without-Portfolio.</p>
              <p>This is quite obvious that LHL's workload is now split amongst three other person to assist him, and leaving him with a less stressful workload - and sufficient time for his meditation - to prolong his own state of health with no chance for the cancer to return.</p>
              <p>With the workload under control, all that is left now is to prevent external factors that can put pressure on LHL, and these are the political challenges that can arise outside of the Ruling Party.</p>
              <p>The most serious contender that will pose a challenge that can embarrass LHL and the Ruling Party is a vocal maverick such as CSJ and his SDP - if they are allowed to rebuild themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can see that the government do not pay out any cash or cheques - it is obvious that this Government do not practise Social Welfarism.</p>
              <p>Do not mix your views between support from the Charities to the under-privilege with Social Welfare - as they are two different matters.</p>
              <p>With regards to your views on <em>'Social Welfare'</em> in the <em>Singapore Style</em> that you have stated - you must be coming out of some dream land to believe that "<em>it is based more on CPF, where the government and the boss will contribute money towards your retirement...</em>."</p>
              <p>Concerning your statement that the government contribute to the CPF - I will ask you how this government contribution to the individual CPF account has helped in any significant ways for the retirement of Singaporeans ?</p>
              <p>Do you seriously believe that the miserly few hundred dollars paid out PER ANNUM as Economic Progress Payout - or some other fancy term can be considered as sufficient from this Government, when almost immediately this Government will raise the service charges for some other Government services ?</p>
              <p>On the part concerning the CPF contribution made by the Employers - Singaporeans have the wrong view that the Employers' CPF contribution is NOT <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">part</span> of the Workers' Wage</em>.</p>
              <p>CPF is a monthly contribution by every Worker at a determined percentage to be deducted from the monthly wage, and with another part being contributed by the Employer directly to the CPF. These contributions from the Worker and the Employer form the bulk of the CPF that is available to Singaporeans who contribute for their own retirement.</p>
              <p>This is NOT Social Welfare.</p>
              <p>For your understanding - you could simply google for the definition of the term "<em>Social Welfare</em>" - and the main explanation will state that the Government, or some Public or Private entities - is providing sufficient funds to help the <em>under-privilege</em> in a Society; or for the benefit of the society during contingency or extraneious circumstances.</p>
              <p>Surely, you will not consider yourself as being an under-privilege person in Singapore when you can contribute to your own CPF Retirement Fund ?</p>
              <p>During the extraneous circumstances when Singaporeans were faced with the unexpected economic downturns of 1987, 1997 and 2002 - were Singaporeans allowed to draw on the CPF funds to meet such extraneous contingencies ?</p>
              <p>The CPF remains locked, and with no cash handouts being given to support the majority of Singaporeans - many Singaporeans living in the rented HDB One-Room units defaulted on their utility bills, and had their Electrical and Water Supply cut.</p>
              <p>Social Welfare in Singapore remains a dirty word and do not exist in the vocabulary of the Ruling Political Party, and they were thrown out from the World Socialist Democrat Movement as early as in the mid-1970s.</p>
              <p>This Singapore Government has adopted Stalinist type Communism for political control on Singapore civil society, and Capitalism to manage the socio-economic environment.</p>

              <p>If you find his book interesting, you should try reading also his other books:-</p>
              <p>"<em>Dare to Change : An Alternative Vision for Singapore</em>" - 1994</p>
              <p>"<em>Singapore, My Home Too</em>" - 1995</p>
              <p>"<em>Your Future, My Faith, Our Freedom : A Democratic Blueprint for Singapore</em>" - 2001</p>
              <p>"<em>The Power of Courage : Effecting Political Change in Singapore Through Nonviolence</em>" - 2005 </p>
              <p>After reading the book written in 1994, you will note that some of his views - concerning Singapore Education and Employment - saw parallel policy changes adopted by the PAP Government in 2001.</p>
              <p>The changes had to happen as the Economic Review Committee formed and headed by then DPM LHL after the first economic recession in 1987 refused to adopt some of the recommended policy changes produced by several sub-committees.</p>
              <p><em>DPM LHL had then attempted to convince Singaporeans that all stones will not be left unturned, and then insisted that some stones are best left alone.</em></p>
              <p>With the second economic downturn that slammed into Singapore in 1997, left the Government with no choice but to adopt drastic changes that were almost identical to the recommendation in CSJ's book written in 1994.</p>
              <p>If CSJ is perceived to be mad by some skeptics, perhaps those who are insane has the better ability to see and speak the truth as it is, while those who are sane are tempered by self-preservation and self-interest.</p>

              <p>no, it is not social welfare. it is the people work for themselves, and employers matching what the workers contributed. it is more retirement fund. social welfare is taken from taxes, here the people get back what they earn, til they retire.</p>
              <p>sorry, didn't really read your post after seeing the cancer bit, so i probably miss alot of points.</p>

              <p>This woody Goh CT although always got humiliated when he opened his mouth in support of PAP policies, was able to control the country's public debts at reasonable levels.</p>
              <p>Maybe it's his economics background or maybe he's just lucky.</p>
              <p>Loony is a flop. At one time, the public was 106% of GDP. That's why many forms of taxation is used to reduce the public debt. The citizens are suffering for his reckless public expenditure.</p>
