              <p>You must have been a "nobody" at that time when CSJ did his "hunger strike" to believe that "nobody gave a damn" - as his party members refused to support the then Secretary-General CST of the SDP decision in criticising CSJ at an inappropriate moment.</p>
              <p>The entire SDP Executive Committee had instead broke ranks with CST, and had instead criticised CST.</p>
              <p>The problem with "nobody" like you in having visions of him as a moron is due to your own moronic myopia caused by your own negative obssessions and inability to know what is real and what is not.</p>
              <p>With so little "state sponsored" positive information about CSJ - how much do you know of the person before you pass judgment ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Incidentally, there is a difference in the ability in managing your own financial affairs, and when others abuse their Political Powers has a political agenda to bankrupt you in any ways possible.</p>
              <p>If you believe that skills in financial management is necessary to look after the country's money, you will need more then financial sense to demand explanations for the huge losses from the Annual Budget Surplusses incurred by GIC and Temasek - that require this present Government to get a PAP dominated Parliament to approve the drawing down of $150 Billion from the Singapore National Reserves !!!</p>

              <p><br>158, I do not advocate anything about supporting opposition, just that we should not be so net savy as to said everything must come from the net, of course all things are on the net nowadays, just google it..but then, with a book, i can read it anywhere, dun hv to carry my laptop all the while, i can love a book, but i cannot love my laptop, so to speak. If someone give me a book as a gift, i will certainly treasure it. I feel the with the infuse of IT technology, we lost some of our human emotional touch, no doubt our knowledge and know how had widened, but also abused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for CSJ, he got his own believes to live on, i have no comment on him, cos he doesn't affect my living. For a man to be successful, it can be a personal competence, it can be also be thru many undesirable ways such as corruptions, relationships, unethical action toward fellow humans etc etc. Therefore it is not just competence that make you successful, without some cunning and so call working smart, u can just be a mere doctor or lawyer.</p>

              return for buying his latest book, Dr Chee has asked me to build a
              democratic Singapore with him. I don't really know what to make out of
              it. It's not likely that he'll be running for the next elections, given
              his financial health.<br><br>Even then, how can I vote for his party if
              the PAP is most likely going to win a walkover for my constituency,
              just like in the previous few elections?<br><br>The problem with being an opposition party member in Singapore is that no one ever takes you seriously.<br><br>Think
              about it. A behemoth that's so deeply enmeshed with the media and
              economy of Singapore, versus a smattering of motivated but powerless
              opposition party members. Guess who will be taken more seriously?<br><br>The
              odds are stacked against them. The government-controlled (and this
              government we are talking about consists of a whopping 90% from the
              same party) media would be foolish to publish any ideology or
              suggestions from the people who might bring itself down.<br><br>And I'm
              not going to delve into the government's penchant to sue their rivals
              until they bleed. Or the way our Ministry-sanctioned History and Social
              Studies textbooks are written. This is after all a book review.<br><br>==<br><br>The tragedy is that these very people who the press lampoons and the government denounces are Singapore's true patriots.<br><br>A patriot wants the best for his country.<br><br>A patriot dedicates his life to improving the country.<br><br>A patriot would risk his reputation, finances and freedom for the sake of his country.<br><br>Sure, sure - many of our PAP leaders are patriots. But I dare you to prove that our opposition leaders are any less patriotic.<br><br>==<br><br>Dr Chee Soon Juan is a patriot. He examined democracy in detail and saw how it could work for Singapore.<br><br>He fought for it. And paid dearly for it, racking up jail terms and hefty debts from losing various controversial lawsuits.<br><br>But he failed.<br><br>You
              see, 'democracy' is a big word. I've recited that word in the national
              pledge for hundreds of times, but have never exactly been told what it
              really means. I recall my primary school teachers shying away from the
              question when being asked to explain what it is.<br><br>In summary, Chee was fighting for a concept no one understood.<br><br>The PAP, however, used more familiar vocabulary such as 'economy', 'jobs', 'peace' and 'security'.<br><br>The
              thing about politics is, ideology doesn't rake in the votes. Popularity
              does, and PAP had played that game well. They used vocabulary people
              understood and sold itself as a safe and comfortable option.<br><br>Most
              importantly, when they talk about vegetable prices and upgrading HDB
              blocks, they managed to get to the hearts of the everyday voters.<br><br>Chee
              Soon Juan however spoke of issues that the common Singaporean had not
              even heard of - things like 'transparency', 'freedom of speech' and
              'oppression'. The common man didn't understand, and had written him off
              as an eccentric clown.<br><br>So as long as the common man has
              affordable groceries, a comfortable home and a job, he will be content.
              He doesn't need the right to free speech (even if he did have it, what
              did he have to say?), he doesn't need the government to be transparent
              (the complexities of government and the economy boggles him anyway) and
              oppression doesn't happen to himself.<br><br>What the common man
              doesn't know is that those very same issues that he ignores are the
              ones that dictate the health of society and economy as a whole.<br><br>Take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis">California Energy Crisis</a> for example. Something as abstract as a partial deregulation of the
              energy market led to the common man having to experience blackouts.<br><br>That's where A Nation Cheated shines.<br><br>Its
              second part of the book explains how the government's strict policies
              towards controlling labour unions might not have been a good idea after
              all, that the way Singapore's economy is heading right now might be
              great for short-term growth, but detrimental to society and its income
              disparity in the long term, and how.<br><br>==<br><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f2LvH1OZ3CM/SQWUB96pZCI/AAAAAAAAETQ/1UQkEdF1FNk/s1600-h/IMG_9425.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5261774501173617698" style="cursor: pointer; width: 275px; height: 400px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_f2LvH1OZ3CM/SQWUB96pZCI/AAAAAAAAETQ/1UQkEdF1FNk/s400/IMG_9425.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br><br>A Nation Cheated starts off with Part I - an account of how Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP had gotten into power, from his viewpoint.<br><br>It's probably biased - hell, who isn't? - but it casts doubt on the PAP's (probably biased, too) version of events.<br><br>Personally,
              I didn't really care much for this part. History is history. We can
              learn from it, or draw conclusions from it, but we can't change it
              anyway.<br><br>Part II addresses Singapore's labour and economic
              policies, looking at how they might have been successful in the short
              term, but we're finally seeing some of their shortcomings in the form
              of a widening income gap, a lack of entrepreunership and the
              poorly-hidden fact that many of the government's foreign investments
              have failed.<br><br>While Chee clearly outlines the problems, the
              possible solutions he offers aren't convincing, considering that he had
              managed to squeeze all of that into a mere 5.5 page-long chapter titled
              'The alternative'.<br><br>"What can be done to improve Singapore?" is
              the question that he had answered in that chapter. However, what we
              really want to know is, "What are our opposition leaders going to do to
              improve Singapore?". The book, and possibly Chee's strategy, fails in
              this aspect.<br><br>==<br><br>A Nation Cheated ends off with a speech, and an appendix of questions and answers.<br><br>It's
              an informative read, provided you understand that books by political
              leaders - opposition or otherwise - are inherently biased.<br><br>A pity it doesn't tell us what they can do to improve Singapore.<br><br>Or for that matter, what I can do to build a democratic Singapore with Chee.<br><br>==<br><br>A Nation Cheated is available online at <a href="http://yoursdp.org/">SDP's website</a> (email them) or from Kinokuniya or Select Books in Tanglin.</p>

              <p>Kinokuniya Bookstore has placed another order for Dr Chee Soon Juan's latest book <em>A Nation Cheated</em>,
                  barely 10 days from its last one. A new batch of books was just
                  delivered over the weekend. The book is also available at Select Books
                  (Tanglin Shopping Centre)<br><br>This is despite the complete news
                  blackout by the local mass media on the book. With absolutely no
                  publicity except through this website, <em>A Nation Cheated</em> is selling robustly in bookstores.  Online sales have also seen a constant stream with orders coming in through

              <p>This is a sign that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Singaporeans are increasingly bypassing the
                  state-controlled newspapers for information. </span>The book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tackles issues
                  that the Singapore Press Holdings will not address</span> and provides
                  alternative ideas to take Singapore forward.<br><br>With
                  the recent financial meltdown in the US and the local economy starting
                  to tank, Singaporeans are beginning to realise that the PAP formula of
                  "growth" has been based on exploitation and the repression.<br><br>More
                  important, the cracks are exposing the weakness and vulnerability of
                  the system. Note:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> In spite of all the PAP hype about the soundness of
                  its policies, Singapore is the first Asian country to go into a
                  recession.</span><br><br>The fact that Singapore's GDP has managed to remain
                  afloat these past few years is not because we have been innovative or
                  that we have been productive.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our economy grew because the Government
                  decided to make our banking system so secretive and non-transparent
                  that criminals, drug barons, and tax evaders have found this place an
                  ideal place to park their ill-gotten gains.</span><br><br>Another source of
                  growth is from the flood of foreigners into this island. When you have
                  a sudden and explosive increase in the number of residents, the
                  inevitable result is GDP expansion. But you don't have to be a genius
                  to see that such an economic gimmick is a one-off that very quickly
                  runs into diminishing returns.<br><br>And the societal cost of such a
                  policy has yet to be calibrated. Singaporeans should take note <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr
                  George Yeo's recent revelation that the Government does not have a
                  masterplan to accommodate all the new inhabitants.</span> In the meantime we
                  continue to ignore<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the severe brain-drain problem where our younger
                  citizens are leaving this country in droves.</span><br><br>All this in a<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> political environment that prohibits citizens from speaking out and makes believe that things here are hunky-dory.</span><br><br>These factors are all examined in <em>A Nation Cheated</em>.
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The author warns that if Singapore's politico-economic problems are not
                  addressed soon, Singaporeans will face an increasingly bleak future.</span><br><br>Ironically, the censoring of this book is adding to the problem. Get your copy of <em>A Nation Cheated</em> if you haven't already and keep yourself informed. Remember, knowledge is power.</p>
