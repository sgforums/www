It's all various people's opinion about party, the people, the situation and what which form the future.<br><br>I am sure many forumers have their own views about politics, people and governance. We can see them all here. It's only how (how to put it) wise they (the views, I mean) are, hence how they'd shape a more constructive future, say, for your party and/or Singapore.<br><br>For me, though I don't represent any party, while with PAP (as long as the membership lasts) I do have a certain hope and expectation for it to improve.<br><br>If Mr Low is really confident about the 'some not suitable to lead' you brought up here, it's his and WP's choice of perception. But I do have my own opinion if he'd ever consult me (if at all), and others (forumers and such) would have theirs.<br><br>Anyway, challenging me in such manner won't be half as exciting as doing so to PM Lee outside the screen, I suppose Ti Lik might be a happier person doing so to some prominent person than an anonymous online. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So I suppose I'd see some of his actions in this election then instead of shadow-boxing with a supposedly nobody. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>JJ has changed quite a bit, and would be a neutral place to chat a little, he might get to revisit his swimming club as well. After election, if got time, just 1hr drink copi. Old friends were indeed quite surprised (if that's an appropriate word to use) of him in WP. While many might expect I'd be in the opposition camp, turn out wrong as well. Being outspoken has little relevance to political inclination and such, not to say... if not having to see MP, I've been hoping to stay sideline.<br><br>I don't like party politics... as much as I don't really appreciate irrational characters... Hopefully, Yaw doesn't change much.<br><br>You take care. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Nice chatting with ya.<br><br>Regards.</div>

Broaden your minds, see how MPs do things, check out the environment, spend time helping residents, talk cock with people, see reactions, go election, see constituents, discuss in meetings, see people you like, see people who don't like you, get help you'd get, get help you'd never get... ... anything can happen, can do, can motivate one.<br><br>I don't really see the need to get at each others everytime people from both camps meet, and in our case, protray PAP as bullies or what arrogant people. It's too petty. I don't like office politics, nor party politics... Action always got reaction, how I react would return what further reaction. I can't choose what action... but I can choose how to react. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yeah, I am real alright... We are all true blue Singaporeans. We are borned in Singapore, we ain't immgrants. This generation of people, just as Yaw and myself, met during kiddy times, parents talked about our results at Clementi, CNPS, grow up, go into various parties in a small compact nation... now one can go on on blind party politics, or simply acknowledge that unlike the first generation leaders, many adults now could be packed in the same schools, same clubs and so on when growing up, even in various parties.<br><br>My refrain from getting too personal against opposition members/supporters in general is obvious in spite of provocations. YP may mean Young PAP, but YP ain't necessarily barbaric. It's still the people. YP is just a name to me as well.<br><br>Who say incumbent and opposition must go into irrational fights... If you really from WP, our simple chat shows that many unhappy things can be avoided. Competition may it be, but I respect sportsmanship. Opposition will always occur in every and any regime, it's either we co-exist together in constructive manner, or waste meaningful time hoping to destroy one another... Opposition will always exist, it's how the party handles.<br><br>There are many ways to compete. I prefer one that won't cost the party so much image problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Only that will ensure long-term stability.<br><br>Nice chatting with you as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's all various people's opinion about party, the people, the situation and what which form the future.<br><br>I am sure many forumers have their own views about politics, people and governance. We can see them all here. It's only how (how to put it) wise they (the views, I mean) are, hence how they'd shape a more constructive future, say, for your party and/or Singapore.<br><br>For me, though I don't represent any party, while with PAP (as long as the membership lasts) I do have a certain hope and expectation for it to improve.<br><br>If Mr Low is really confident about the 'some not suitable to lead' you brought up here, it's his and WP's choice of perception. But I do have my own opinion if he'd ever consult me (if at all), and others (forumers and such) would have theirs.<br><br>Anyway, challenging me in such manner won't be half as exciting as doing so to PM Lee outside the screen, I suppose Ti Lik might be a happier person doing so to some prominent person than an anonymous online. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So I suppose I'd see some of his actions in this election then instead of shadow-boxing with a supposedly nobody. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>JJ has changed quite a bit, and would be a neutral place to chat a little, he might get to revisit his swimming club as well. After election, if got time, just 1hr drink copi. Old friends were indeed quite surprised (if that's an appropriate word to use) of him in WP. While many might expect I'd be in the opposition camp, turn out wrong as well. Being outspoken has little relevance to political inclination and such, not to say... if not having to see MP, I've been hoping to stay sideline.<br><br>I don't like party politics... as much as I don't really appreciate irrational characters...

PM Lee is not the sort who would go on shooting off like you aint it?<br>2. PM Lee will not pass remarks like that too won't he?<br>3. PM Lee will be willing to post his comments under his own name won't he?<br><br>Or are you suggesting that he will behave like you?<br><br>For me, I am very sure any PAP candidate will behave very much unlike you Elfred.<br><br>Relax Elfred, you can have your opinion but if you go around saying unjustified things or things that are not so accurate.... well your PAP does not like things of this sort as well you know?<br><br>You are suggesting that Mr. Low will consult outsiders on their opinion of his men? Elfred, would you do something like that? do you actually trust people whom you don't know more than the people you work with?<br><br>How come you are saying that you are expected to be in the opposition?

Broaden your minds, see how MPs do things, check out the environment, spend time helping residents, talk cock with people, see reactions, go election, see constituents, discuss in meetings, see people you like, see people who don't like you, get help you'd get, get help you'd never get... ... anything can happen, can do, can motivate one.<br><br>I don't really see the need to get at each others everytime people from both camps meet, and in our case, protray PAP as bullies or what arrogant people. It's too petty. I don't like office politics, nor party politics... Action always got reaction, how I react would return what further reaction. I can't choose what action... but I can choose how to react. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Yeah, I am real alright... We are all true blue Singaporeans. We are borned in Singapore, we ain't immgrants. This generation of people, just as Yaw and myself, met during kiddy times, parents talked about our results at Clementi, CNPS, grow up, go into various parties in a small compact nation... now one can go on on blind party politics, or simply acknowledge that unlike the first generation leaders, many adults now could be packed in the same schools, same clubs and so on when growing up, even in various parties.<br><br>My refrain from getting too personal against opposition members/supporters in general is obvious in spite of provocations. YP may mean Young PAP, but YP ain't necessarily barbaric. It's still the people. YP is just a name to me as well.<br><br>Who say incumbent and opposition must go into irrational fights... If you really from WP, our simple chat shows that many unhappy things can be avoided. Competition may it be, but I respect sportsmanship. Opposition will always occur in every and any regime, it's either we co-exist together in constructive manner, or waste meaningful time hoping to destroy one another...
