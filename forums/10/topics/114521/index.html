In a way, I do seek to avoid such irrational confrontations and what challenges. As a YP member doesn't mean just blur blur fight because this is WP, that's SDP, etc. Ti Lik, your accusations may be seemingly provocative, but have little meaning to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>My sincere advise to you is to think before you just anyohow shoot and assume. About yout ticking off, after election, I'd get Yaw for an old friend reunion on private and non-official basis if he's not that busy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>My name is Teck Guan. Nothing to hide. Glad to know you, anyway.<br><br>I usually do not like meaningless challenges or fights that don't come to something. Just wasting energy and time. When one day there is a need, you might know what sort of challenge you are picking up. I usually prefer to show weakness, than to claim strong outside... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> In the forum, I just see see look look, share some views, show some egs. Agree or not, it's not my problem.<br><br>Admitting YP member is pretty simple, I don't think anything wrong admitting. I don't see any meaning to behave as a secret society. When I cease to be one, I'd just admit I ain't. What problem? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>By the way... so by what you said about you let me stay... does it mean SGForum is really a property of WP or some anti-incumbent establishment or...? May I be enlightened? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
