              <p>Govt seeks greater protection for the mentally ill</p>
              <p>Proposed Bill also seeks to give docs greater power to detain patients to prevent harm
              		
              				 </p>
              <p>By 
              			
              							
              									Salma Khalik, Health Correspondent</p>
              <p>THE Government wants to give general hospitals treating patients with
              mental illness the power to admit them against their will if doctors
              think they are a danger, either to themselves or others.</p>
              <p>At the same time, it also plans to give mentally-ill patients greater protection against ill-treatment by hospital staff.</p>
              <p>The Health Ministry said in a statement yesterday that it is
              seeking changes to existing laws to ensure that they remain relevant.</p>
              <p>It added that the higher penalties proposed for offences 'reflect
              current economic realities and the seriousness of the offences'.</p>
              <p>A doctor in a general hospital now cannot detain a mentally-ill
              patient for further treatment if he had sought help voluntarily, even
              if the doctor fears that not doing this could result in serious harm to
              the patient or others.</p>
              <p>Such patients - those with violent or suicidal tendencies, for
              example - are discharged into the care of the police, who can then take
              them to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), where they can be
              admitted against their will.</p>
              <p> The proposed change means the doctor at the general hospital can order such patients detained for further treatment.</p>
              <p>Said the ministry: 'This ensures that such patients may be treated without delay.'</p>
              <p>These patients may also be given medical or surgical treatments without their consent, if needed.</p>
              <p>The proposed changes come amid a greater focus on mental health,
              with MOH developing a blueprint to deal with the serious problem of
              mentally-ill patients.</p>
              <p>Last year, the IMH treated close to 33,000 people for mental illnesses at its outpatient clinics.</p>
              <p>The proposed changes will come in the form of a new Bill, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Bill.</p>
              <p>This will replace the old Mental Disorders and Treatment Act.
              Another new Bill, called the Mental Capacity Bill, deals with people,
              especially the elderly, who become mentally incapacitated.</p>
              <p>While the proposed changes - which are up for public feedback -
              will give hospitals with wards or departments that are designated
              'psychiatric institutions' more power, they also seek to protect
              patients against trigger-happy or abusive doctors and other hospital
              staff.</p>
              <p>For example, only doctors who have permission in writing from the
              ministry's director of medical services are allowed to detain patients.</p>
              <p>Also, a court order is required if the treatment period exceeds six months.</p>
              <p>Penalties for ill-treating mentally-disturbed patients will also go up.</p>
              <p>The penalty for cruel treatment and wilful neglect of such patients
              will increase - with a maximum fine of $5,000, from $500 now, and a
              jail term of up to four years, instead of two, or both.</p>
              <p>A hospital employee who has sex with a mentally-ill patient will
              also face a maximum penalty of $5,000 and/or jail of up to 10 years -
              up from $1,000 and/or two years' jail.</p>
              <p>If a doctor detains a patient who is not a danger to himself or
              others, or detains him for more than six months without a magistrate's
              order, he could be fined $5,000 and sentenced to up to three years in
              jail, or both - up from $2,000 and two years' jail.</p>

              <p>Think IMH and recall two people - Robert Ho and Boon Suan Ban</p>
              <p>From another forum: Singabloodypore</p>
              <p><strong>Robert Ho threatened with IMH detention at President's pleasure</strong><br>8 April 2005<br></p>
              <blockquote>Like Mr Boon Suan Ban, Mr Robert Ho has been arrested and remanded at the <a href="http://www.imh.com.sg/"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Institute of Mental Health </span></a>(IMH)
              - repeatedly, in the latter's case. Mr Ho had gone to the West Mall
              Shopping Centre on 27 February 2005 to distribute flyers about the
              elections system in Singapore. <br><br>Later that day, the police came
              and arrested Mr Ho and brought him to the IMH. They came the following
              day and carted away his computer. About two weeks later, Mr Ho said
              that just as he was about to be discharged, the police ordered his
              continued detention because they wanted to charge him in court. A few
              days later, he was released without being charged. <br><br>The police
              later called Mr Ho's wife and told her that her husband cannot continue
              to do what he did and that they could have charged him in court and put
              him under remand in IMH at the President's pleasure.<br><br>In was a
              coincidence that Mr Ho was remanded at the IMH at about the same time
              that Mr Boon Suan Ban was incarcerated. Mr Boon is in custody at the
              President's pleasure. <br><br>A few years earlier, Mr Robert Ho was
              also arrested by the police and investigated for criminal defamation
              for posting an article about Mr Lee Kuan Yew's daughter-in-law, Mdm Ho
              Ching. His computer equipment was also confiscated then which have not
              been returned to him. Mr Ho had said then that the police had told him
              that if he stopped posting articles on the Internet, he would not be
              charged. When Mr Ho agreed he was released.<br><br>Several disturbing
              questions arise from the arrests and detention of Messrs Boon and Ho
              regarding the rule of law in Singapore. What rights are available to
              the two men and other people who are similarly detained? Is the State
              abusing its powers? What implications do the arrests have for the rest
              of us? These issues will be discussed at the public forum organised by
              the Open Singapore Centre (OSC) at Hotel Asia on 16 April 2005 at 2 pm.
              The death penalty and the impending execution of a Singaporean, Mr
              Shanmugam s/o Murugesu, will also be debated. The mother and the twin
              sons of Mr Shanmugam will be present at the forum to appeal for
              clemency for death-row inmate. <br><br><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Amnesty International</span></a> Spokesman, Mr Tim Parritt, will also speak at the forum as will Mr
              Anthony Yeo, Singapore's foremost social counselor. The other speakers
              are: Mr J B Jeyaretnam, lawyer M Ravi, <a href="http://www.thinkcentre.org/"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Think Centre</span></a> Executive Director S Samydorai, and Dr Chee Soon Juan.<br><br>As the topic "<a href="http://www.singaporedemocrat.org/news_display.php?id=703"><span style="color: #6699cc;">Death Penalty and the Rule of Law in Singapore</span></a>"
              concerns the legal community the OSC has invited most of the law firms
              in the country. It will also extend an invitation to the Law Society.<br><br>The
              forum promises to be intellectually and emotionally engaging. Make a
              date with the OSC and come and join in the discussion that concerns us
              all. Admission is free and all are welcome. </blockquote>

All abuses are to convince people I'm mentally ill to cover their grave evil. Telepathy is not a far off fiction. It's a fact.</span></p>

              <p>Well I'll never step my foot on Singapore again. Really I'm not crazy nor I'm with the opposition.</p>
              <p>But at the ruler's pleasure I've been deliberately falsely accused of being mentally ill.</p>
              <p>I've refused all medication went back to Indonesia, abandon my university study in Singapore to re-enter local university here starting again from scratch and I've graduadted since.</p>
              <p>And I've come to know that the ruler of Singapore has many friends here in Jakarta. He can also influence good people to turn bad. Good Christians to sinners.  Blood ties is nothing  also really.</p>
