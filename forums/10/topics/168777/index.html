            <div class='col-md body'>old news, but again i feel this is something to read abt<br><br>29 October 2005<br>I refer to the criticism levelled on Mr.Chiam See Tong, MP for Potong Pasir, by Mr. Chan Mia Lee in his letter, Â“Chiam should focus on bonding with residentsÂ”.<br><br>Let me first state that I am not a resident of Potong Pasir. Neither do I know Mr. Chiam personally, nor am I an opposition supporter. As a matter of fact, I have always voted for PAP candidate. But I have great respect for Mr. Chiam. Here is a man who has risen again all odds to win a seat to represent Potong Pasir. As an opposition MP, he has been an honourable Member of Parliament. He does not oppose for opposition sake.<br><br>For him to be re-elected in Potong Pasir for five consecutive terms says a lot about the level of support he enjoys from his constituents.<br><br>But here is also a Member of Parliament who is not the adviser to grassroots organisation in his own backyard. Instead, Mr. Sitoh Yih Pin, who has repeatedly failed to wrest the constituency from him, is the adviser.<br><br>In every PAP ward, the elected representative is the adviser to the grassroots organisation. Why is this not the case in Potong Pasir?<br><br>Grassroots organizations are not part of any political party. Neither should they have any political affiliation. If that is the case, why is Mr. Chiam not the adviser to the grassroots organizations in his ward?<br><br>I do not think Mr. Chiam is paranoid and insecure just because a crooner sang praises of his rival at a National Day Dinner.<br><br>A National Day dinner is not a political-party event. The crooner has no business to be singing praises of Mr. Sitoh and urging the diners to vote for him.<br><br>This is outright disrespectful to the incumbent MP. Imagine if the same incident were to take place in the Prime Minister ward. Would the Prime Minister laugh off the incident?<br><br>More likely than not, the crooner would be hauled up for interfering into local politics. The organiser would also be hauled up for turning the dinner into politics event with a permit.<br><br>Representing a constituency as a MP is a serious undertaking. It is not a beauty parade or a karaoke contest.<br><br>Did Mr. Sitoh apply any permit to hold a political rally during the dinner? If not, would he have broken the law when the crooner urged the diners to vote for him?<br><br>Under election rules, shouldÂ’nt there should be no campaigning outside of the election period? Should the police not investigate the matter and take appropriate action against the organiser and the crooner?<br><br>Mr. Chiam has repeatedly shown that he is a gentleman, even though he is an opposition member. Even Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong praised him for his gentlemanliness and said good things about him.<br><br>Why canÂ’t Mr. Sitoh and his supporters reciprocate by respecting Mr. Chiam as the incumbent MP Sure, fight him if you must be in the next election and may the better man win. But, until then, Mr. Chiam is the elected representative of Potong Pasir and deserves the respect and support that should be accorded to every MP.<br><br>In disrespecting an honourable Member of Parliament, Mr. Sitoh and his supporters are showing disrespect to Parliament.<br><br>Patrick Tan Siong Kuan<br>The Straits Times (Home15 Forum)<br>29 Oct 2005<br><br>law applies to PAP members when its against opposition? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>on a side note, the party which Chiam See Tong belongs to is the SPP( Singapore People's Party). Its interesting to hear some of the opposition parliamentary speechs.

            <div class='col-md body'>Was reading up on some past elections facts at :<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Democratic_Party</a><br><br>It was founded in 1980 by Mr Chiam See Tong, a British-educated lawyer who had contested several by-elections and elections as an independent since the mid 1970s. The party had originally wanted to contest the Anson constituency by-election in 1981 but for the sake of opposition unity, gave way to the Worker's Party candidate J.B. Jeyaretnam. It paid off, as the opposition won their first seat for the first time since Singapore's independence. The party's success continued in the 1984 General Elections, as their former leader and secretary general Chiam See Tong won the party's first and only seat at Potong Pasir which since then has been won by the opposition in following elections. <span style="color: red;">Chiam's election victory was all the more significant as it showed voters repudiated the People's Action Party's (PAP) arrogant and aloof style of campaigning, in which the ruling party at one time urged voters not to vote for Chiam because his O-level results were poorer than those of the PAP candidate.</span><br><br><strong>Anybody can confirm whether the above is true?<br>If true, who was the one who made the remark against Chiam?</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
