              <p class="first">The political problems faced by many countries in Asia can be traced back to two words: Money politics.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">
              
              </div>
              <p>And the reason such troubles have not taken root here? There is no “money politics” in Singapore, and “we have a Division One team in charge”, said Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew last night.</p>
              <p>In many Asian countries, money politics is simply the “code word” for buying votes to gain power, and after that is done, “to recover your expenses plus some profit for the next round of vote—buying”, said Mr Lee at the Tanjong Pagar 43rd National Day Celebration Dinner.</p>
              <p>“One of the big problems they now face, in other countries, is the people in power want to reserve the money, keep it for themselves. So, they exclude young able people who want to join their team ...</p>
              <p>“The result is, there is no talent inside the existing parties.”</p>
              <p>Contrast that to Singapore.</p>
              <p>“In other countries, elections do not put up a Division One team. They are a Division Three, either a B team or a C team in charge. In Singapore, we carefully select our candidates ...</p>
              <p>“Over the years, with each election, we see the quality of the MPs, their education levels, their competence, their abilities, their energy.</p>
              <p>“Their youthfulness is renewed and we have a leadership that’s able to meet the rising standards of the population,” said Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>But today’s younger generation does not understand all this, the Minister Mentor said.</p>
              <p>“They say, oh, let’s have multiparty politics. Let’s have different parties change and be in charge of the Government. Is it that simple? You vote in a Division Three government, not a Division One government, and the whole economy will just subside within three, four years. Finished.”</p>
              <p>Such proponents should study Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines, where rotating party governments have led to more mismanagement. “And a &amp;apos;freewheeling paress’ has not cleaed up corruption, although according to American &amp;apos;liberal’ democracy theories, it is designed to do so,” Mr Lee said.</p>
              <p>Even in the face of a global recession, Singapore has enough long—term investments to buffer the setbacks, noted Mr Lee.</p>
              <p>“Why are we on top of our problem? Because there’s a Government that’s planning ahead, seeing ahead, calculating ahead, making the right decision. Yes, there will be recession around the world. But we will have enough investments already going on,” he said.</p>
              <p>As a mentor and advisor to the younger policy—makers, he cited how he backed Singapore’s hosting of the Formula One in September, even though he himself was not a fan. “We cannot stay still. The world has changed — there’s a jetset that travels all over the world because they are interested in the Formula One races. Why? I don’t know.</p>
              <p>“I find very little excitement in it. They wheel around and around, and it’s over. And there’s an accident — so what? But I’m told there is tremendous exitement in the way you get the cars, the way you change wheels, the way you drive, and so on,” he said, drawing chuckles from the audience. — TODAY/ra</p>

              <p>Money Politics: Politics who pays themselves millions and wants to keep the millions to themselves and pay them more the next round they get elected. So they prevent other parties from gaining power through judicial persecution, unfair media propaganda and ridiculous drawing of electorial boundaries...</p>
              <p>1) MM is directly and indirectly saying all other countries are corrupted! How confident.</p>
              <p>2) MM forgot that our current league of MPs are not really the Division One calibre lor.. take Mas Selemat for example.. oops, I forgot, that's our fault.</p>

              <p><br>Well, that's the kind of democracy we chose when we chose not to do otherwise.</p>
              <p>Any of us can chose to do otherwise, despite the threats, vote buying, and propaganda, but if we did not, then how?</p>
              <p>Eg, Company A kept saying its competitors products or services are inferior, and gives you a lot of perks to 'patronise them instead of company B and C. You can chose to buy from A, or you can chose to buy from B or C regardless of the perks offered, or criticisms of B and C.</p>
              <p>Just remember we stay stuck with our choices till the next GE... Unlike sales, where you can throw away the products or stop buying and switch back to A.</p>
              <p>My view is die die choose B and C regardless what A says is a way of pushing A out of the business, so long as be prepared to bear the consequences of choices, then carry on.</p>
