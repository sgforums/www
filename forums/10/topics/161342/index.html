            <div class='col-md body'>i feel that if welfare means handing out cash and stuff, it should only be for needy people like those who are too sick to work, old people , handicap<br><br>for abled bodied, its should only be help like getting them a job , or if they can't support the family, maybe free text books, schooling, medical care ,food<br>and not money<br><br>as for charging more, since the govt makes the law, i'll have to say its legal, but that doesn't mean its right <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if COE was to be introduced the already high excise duty (110 -175 % of CIF) taking into account pricing it to control limited road usage should have been abolished as COE was actually presented in parliament as the fairerest way of pricing road usage or traffic congestion. Minister has said at the time of introducing COE that excise duty would be abolished because COE would then become the fairer way to price road usage.<br><br>But the government after introducing COE conveniently forgot for many years to abolish or drastically reduce vehicle excise tax which was still currently maintained at the high of 110 % of CIF cost of vehicle. This is absolutely double taxing of citizens.<br><br>When ERP was introduced, finally as a more reliable and accurate and fairer way of pricing road usage and congestion, it was stated that it will be a fairer way as compared to COE and COE therefore should be abolished or eventually be taken over by ERP or moderated.<br><br>However the government kept all three taxes on vehicle i.e. excise, COE and ERP. This is unheard of triple taxation on citizens the only one in the world doing so. No wonder people are getting very poor and cannot stand the costs of living because all government method in double and triple taxating people given the slightest excuse to do so. This kind of taxing the people is being carried out in very autocratic manner based on sheer assumptions without concern for people.</div>
