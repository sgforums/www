            <div class='col-md body'>While I am not suggesting that poor people are always responsible for their plight, but I do believe the majority of them made decisions and choose to be what they are, probably without knowing it. Some good examples are people who don't have the money, but still want to buy cars and expensive houses, ended up with loads of debts. There are also those that chose not to study and party their youth off, which is also part of their lives decision. And then the smokers who wasted a fortune on smoking and eroding their health. And also the punks who like to show off, it's really a character problem, and that's one of the reasons when they ain't doing as well as they could have been, because people tend to dislike show offs.<br><br>Obviously I do feel really sorry for certain people, where the cases were caused by genuine plight, perhaps it may be a certain illness that was caused due to a person's DNA structure and immunity system, or some extreme poverty, or certain unfortunate cases... But I do feel if people always want to have instant gratifications and splurging and partying with harmful substances towards their own body, then they should not evade responsibility of their own life after they have made their choice.</div>
