              <p>In the 60s, we needed to modernise quickly and give jobs to Singaporeans, so we invited a lot of MNCs to set up base here. It was a quick way to learn skills and stand on our own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today, past the millenium, we are still doing the same thing but now we have become cheap hunting ground instead. That explains the stagflation of lower and middle income classes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm no economic expert but has the PAP become outdated?? They thought becos they could do it back then, they could do it now. Is that the case?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can't help but comment on this in view of PAP's bid to bail out an American company (Las Vegas Sands) with our money. And also, reading CSJ's webpage on LVS has given me some insights.<a href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1439-the-road-of-las-vegas-sands"></a></p>

              <p><strong><span class="contentpagetitle"> The road of Las Vegas Sands</span></strong></p>
              <p>Tuesday, 11 November 2008</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="http://www.yoursdp.org/images/stories/items/casino.jpg" border="1" alt="" width="190" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em><br><br>"Ring-fenced"
              is the term financiers are using to describe the tumult taking place in
              Las Vegas Sands (LVS), which means to say that LVS' Singapore project,
              Marina Sands, will not be dragged down the drain even if the Las Vegas
              company goes bust.<br><br>Yes, like how Singaporeans were repeatedly
              assured that the Suzhou Industrial Park Project was in the pink of
              health right up until we packed up and handed over operations to the
              Chinese.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Ring-fenced or no, the lack of details
              on the loan to LVS is cause for worry. To be sure, the Singapore
              casino's future hinges on the one in the desert of Nevada. If parent
              Sands is going to get mired in financial and legal problems - or worse,
              files for Chapter 11 - who is going to take care of baby Marina?<br><br>It
              looks like she may have to be fostered out to Madam Ho Ching. Bloomberg
              News reports that CapitaLand, owned by Temasek, is in talks to take
              over. Reuters reports that CapitaLand denies this. <br><br>Whatever. If Sands is blown away there is every likelihood that the Government will take over the project.<br><br>But
              even if the Government spends billions of our money to ensure that
              Marina IR is completed, there's more than one way the casino can still
              become the world's most expensive non-colour pachyderm.<br><br>For
              example, does anyone in Singapore know how to develop, much less run, a
              casino? If we did, we needn't have engaged Mr Sheldon Adelson, owner of
              LVS, in the first place, right?<br><br>Wait, wait. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But if Mr Adelson really knew how to run a casino, he wouldn't be in this compost now, would he?</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>See the scatological hole the Government has gotten us into?</strong></span><br><br>But
              up until now, the PAP-state continues to resist being upfront on the
              loans, its talks with Mr Adelson, and how the IR project will proceed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It insists that the casino resort will be open and ready for business
              by end of 2009. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is like the British saying that Singapore's
              defence was impregnable even as the Japanese soldiers peddled across
              the Causeway during WWII.</strong></span><br><br>So where does all this leave us? Very
              vulnerable. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our banks are the leading lenders to LVS: UOB coughed up
              S$890m, DBS S$743m and OCBC S$572m.<br></strong></span><br>Add this to the financial
              crisis that is rocking the world and you start getting the picture – a
              very scary one. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DBS' retrenchment of 900 jobs is just the beginning.</strong></span><strong><br><br>Down the road</strong><br><br>This
              brings us to the question: Is the PAP Government in over its head in
              continuing to target industries for our economy?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Is its leaders
              hoodwinking us about the competence of its leaders?</strong></span><br><br>Our economic
              questions in the past are very different from those in the present.
              Back then, there were few roads, no cables, and not many sewerage
              pipes. Solution? Build them. And it wasn't difficult to see that the
              way out of poverty was to manufacture stuff like textile and TV sets
              and sell them to other countries.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>But the PAP, aka Lee Kuan Yew, continues to think that just because it knew what to do then, it knows what to do now.</strong></span><br><br>The
              game has changed, as if it needed to be said. The global economy has
              become extremely sophisticated and complex. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our economic problems
              cannot be solved by the few in the cabinet who pretend that they know
              which industries to target, be they building gambling dens or mapping
              genetic codes. </strong></span><br><br>Nowadays we need to grapple with anything and
              everything from minibonds to migration. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To tackle these problems, the
              people need to be involved in the building process. </strong></span> Without the energy
              and creativity of the people, our national and economic development
              will be anaemic at best. <br><br>And to be involved, they need
              freedom. Yes, political freedom. Because political freedom and the
              spirit of innovation are two sides of the same coin.<br><br>Thumb
              Singaporeans down, and you dumb Singaporeans down. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dumbing down a
              populace is not the way to an innovative future. When we cannot
              innovate, we cannot compete. </strong></span><br><br>Right now our economy is smoking,
              injecting, and swallowing drugs. The state has become rich not because
              of the industry and enterprise of the people but because a few in the
              cabinet decided to change the law to attract the world's super-rich
              people – some who made their wealth legitimately, many who would
              otherwise find themselves behind bars in their own countries.
              Incidentally, it is no secret that the IR casinos would allow even more
              illicit funds to be laundered here.<br><br>If Singaporeans haven't
              realised it yet, the PAP is taking us down the wrong road. The
              Singapore Democrats have said this before: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a government that has to
              rely on gambling to maintain economic progress is both
              entrepreneurially and morally bankrupt. </strong></span><br><br>With the latest Sands meltdown, it looks like the chickens are coming home to roost.</p>

              <p>In the 60s, we needed to modernise quickly and give jobs to
              Singaporeans, so we invited a lot of MNCs to set up base here. It
              was a quick way to learn skills and stand on our own.</p>
              <p>Today, past the millenium, we are still doing the same thing but
              now we have become cheap hunting ground instead. That explains the
              stagflation of lower and middle income classes.</p>
              <p>I'm no economic expert but has the PAP become outdated?? They
              thought becos they could do it back then, they could do it now. Is
              that the case?</p>
              <p>I can't help but comment on this in view of PAP's bid to bail
              out an American company (Las Vegas Sands) with our money. And also,
              reading CSJ's webpage on LVS has given me some insights.<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapore/1439-the-road-of-las-vegas-sands"></a></p>

              <p>So,do u think how many jobs local companies ,big or small,can create in a year?</p>
              <p>Even G 20 countries also need MNC.I think your main target is Sands</p>
              <p>and high light the valuable input from Chee.</p>
              <p>If so,then why dunt u go to the point?</p>
              <p>JOBS JOBS JOBS.No job.No talk.</p>
              <p>2.what is your ideas,then?</p>
              <p>3.Let me show u the results of different strategies of selected countries,</p>

              <p>Dunt tell me any empty words or theory.</p>
              <p>So,who can we turn to to get any better ideas for growing our pie?</p>
              <p>We are getting not so bad GDP for so many years.</p>
              <p>If u count from 1965,the difference is much wider!!</p>
              <p>FYI from 1999 to 2005,SG  average compound growth rate</p>
              <p>,ACGR,is 5.7 %!!</p>
              <p>Singapore has been growing at a rate between first and third world</p>
              <p>rates for few decades.Some foreigner academics say we are first</p>
              <p>world but grows at third world growth rate.</p>
              <p>Nvm first or third world.Three things:</p>
              <p>Jobs Jobs Jobs.U will say our salary is low.</p>
              <p>Yes.It look low.i can tell u without MNC and the EDB</p>
              <p>or IE Singapore efforts,we will be worse.</p>
              <p>Sit down and think for few minutes.</p>
              <p>Besides those primary productions,like big farm or cow rearing,</p>
              <p>which industry u cant find in Singapore?</p>
              <p>http://www.edb.gov.sg/edb/sg/en_uk/index.html</p>
              <p>look at our market share in chips,ship repairs/building etc.</p>

              <p>Actually they are changing their economic strategy for a while now, moving away from production based industry to knowledge and creative based industries. Focusing on biotech/alternate energy/3d industries.</p>
              <p>And Poh, i've read through the article and the areas you've bold out and underlined. Ultimately it's all speculation, they took some information from the newspaper and did their own conclusions. That's what i felt about it.  </p>
