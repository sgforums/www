            <div class='col-md body'>A RECORD sum was given to help needy people pay their medical bills in hospitals, nursing homes and hospices last year.<br>Medifund, the Government's fund to help the poor who cannot afford medical treatment, disbursed $39.1 million last year, the largest sum it has handed out since it was set up in 1993.<br><br>This amount marks a 20.9 per cent rise from the $32.3 million given in 2004.<br><br>The number of successful applications for Medifund money also hit a record high last year. It increased by 15.7 per cent, from 248,957 in 2004 to 288,099 last year.<br><br>Just 210 applications, or less than 0.1 per cent, were turned down last year, mostly because the patients were deemed capable of paying their bills. This rejection rate is similar to that in the previous two years.<br><br>As in previous years, the bulk of the funds - about 26 per cent last year - went to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), which treats mentally ill patients. It gave out $10.2 million last year, up from $8.5 million the year before.<br><br>The hospital has many long-stay patients, some of whom have no family. Last year, IMH had about 1,800 such patients, some of whom have stayed for more than 20 years.<br><br>An IMH spokesman told The Straits Times yesterday it disbursed 83 per cent of its Medifund money last year to inpatients. Of this amount, about half went to long-stay patients.<br><br>IMH also said there was an increase in both the number of inpatients as well as Medifund applications last year.<br><br>But this did not necessarily mean there were more needy patients because some could have been admitted more than once in a year, and applied for Medifund each time, its spokesman said.<br><br>All other large hospitals, except Tan Tock Seng and the Singapore National Eye Centre, also dished out more funds over 2004.<br><br>Tan Tock Seng granted $5.02 million last year, about $70,000 less than the year before. The eye centre gave about $364,000, down by $107,000.<br><br>Community hospitals, nursing homes and hospices distributed $2.3 million last year, slightly more than the $2.1 million in 2004.<br><br>Asked about the reasons for the increase in applications and grant amounts last year, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said yesterday: 'The growth rate fluctuates from year to year. Hence, there is no evident pattern for last year's increase.'<br><br>However, the head of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, Madam Halimah Yacob, felt the increase in applicants 'reflects more people having difficulties coping with illnesses and medical bills'.<br><br>This was probably a result of more people ageing and developing chronic illnesses, as well as a rise in health-care costs over the years, she said.<br><br>She hopes the use of Medifund can be made more flexible so people who earn more than the income ceiling can still tap it if need be. She cited an example of a middle-income couple with a child suffering from leukaemia, who recently sought her help. They do not qualify for Medifund, but are in debt.<br><br>MOH said it will grow the size of the fund and grants progressively so more cases can be helped. Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan has promised to apply for top-ups to Medifund every year.<br><br>After last year's payout, there is still $1.17 billion left. But only interest generated by the fund can be used.<br><br>(Straits Times 1 Dec)</div>
