            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, WOSE's may chew out grunts any time of the year... but they are the ones who will get the job done with their years of experience.<br><br>For example, my ex-CSM of my recce coy was a terror, so much so that even the officers tried their best not to mess up. That CSM chewed me and my buddies out countless times, and dispensed extras for good measure. But he was darned effective. Under him, everything was chop-chop and siu-siu. Cos' nobody wanted to bum around and make him mad.<br><br>After he was posted out, many of my mates agreed that he was pretty much the best damned CSM we all had... cos' he had the 'lao-jiaoness' and sheer experience of what works and what doesn't (compared to young officers) to pull off nearly anything on time and on target.<br><br>In short, those are the fellows who are harsh on you in peacetime, but will bring you back alive in war. And for that, I've plenty of respect for WOSE's.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few random thoughts:<br><br>In my opinion, officers decide WHAT needs to be done, and WOSEs focus on HOW it should be done. It is the exactly the same as the duties of the executives and the middle management of a corporation. Problems arise when an officer decides what should be done without stopping to consider if it can be done practically. This is very common because young officers do not think to consult their NCOs before making decisions. You get stupid plans that cannot possibly work and WOSEs trying to make them work "by magic".<br><br>Units operate like families. The officer is the father and the NCO under him (PS for a PC, CSM for an OC, etc.) is the mother. For example, the father decides that the children need new clothes and gives the mother the money for it. The mother then scolds them, makes them eat their lunch, scolds them until they get on the bus, scolds them while they try on their clothes, buys the clothes, then scolds them all the way home. In the same way, the PC decides that the men need more marksmanship training and obtains time at the range, ammunition, medical support, transport, etc. The PS then fucks the men upside-down until they fall in, fucks them left-right-center all the way to the range, fucks them inside-out while they shoot, fucks them some more, then fucks them until they get back and clean their rifles.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Most of the work of an officer is behind the scenes, like obtaining resources from higher ups (like ammunition in peace and artillery fire in war), planning and decision making. This work is "upward". What I mean by this is that the officer mostly deals with the people above him. In contrast, most of the work of an NCO is in the face of his men. His work is mostly "downward", dealing with people below him. Just like dad and mom.<br><br>Hope someone finds these enlightening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really think the ORCIFER are that capable in deciding what needs to be done.  Okay, to me, there are the senior officers, "MAJ" and above, and the junior orcifers, the LTs and some cases Captain. The Senior officers decide what to do with his units, and the junior Orcifers, just have to do it.  In an sense, not all the "fuck-up" officers, screw up by their choice.<br><br>In any case, I agree with the earlier post.  Most people would follow a specialist into battle than an officer.  Unless the officer is as gung-ho as Rommel.  Up to today, Rommel is the only "officer" in history, that I respect.  Patton is just crazy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The army in the past is different from what we have now, education level is high, most of the people inside have a dip, A, ITE or at least O.<br><br>The "If I just work hard, I will get promoted" idea of the past no longer applies. Nowadays, working hard or having a cert really only just gets you up to a certain level. The rest, you must really "sa ka" or "satay" your immediate superior's butt to climb up the ladder or to get the chances to shine infront of the superiors. Meaning:- faster or better promotion prospects.<br><br>Stepping on the wrong toes, that's it, confirm heta kaki forever or kiss your SAF carrer goodbye.<br><br>Now...if 1 or 2 WOs is doing the "sataying" is fine (small group of black sheeps) but whole group of wannbes WOs doing it at the sametime and at the expense of the men. You get more back-stabbing incidents than productivity. And not to say, a whole lot of "too lan" men. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>That is what I think prince38 meant by WOSE holding back SAF.<br><br>This is just my views, if I'm wrong, correct me!
