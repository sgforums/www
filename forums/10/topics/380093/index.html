              <p>I like this guy idea..There are just too many wannabes in Spore..People who think they are somebody ,belonging to certain middle/upper class. In actual fact , they are just cockcoaches to the elite class of PAP</p>
              <p><a href="http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?t=291178&amp;highlight">http://forum.channelnewsasia.com/viewtopic.php?t=291178&amp;highlight</a>=</p>
              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I'm quite shocked and disgusted by Singaporeans response to the price of HDB resale flats. On the Straits Times, there is some expression of frustration over not being able to get what they want in terms of location and price. Despite the logical and good explanations by reporters and the HDB itself that there is sufficient flats and that housing is affordable the unhappiness continues. In cyberspace, netizens express anger at the govt and unfairly criticise the HDB. On this issue it as clear as daylight that this unhappiness is self-inflicted by ordinary Singaporeans on themselves - they have become fussy, selfish, unreasonable and expect to get something just because they want it. The WORLD DOES NOT OWE YOU ANYTHING - the HDB certainly does not owe you a home in a location of your choice. If you want pay for it!!! <br><br>This whole HDB episode teaches me that Singaporeans' expectations has spiraled to unrealistic levels. Lets get real not everyone can get everything they want in Singapore. Only the top few who are qualified to be elites that the 1st cut at the meritocratic rewards, then the next tier of talents by the time it reaches the ordinary Singaporean not much is left. <br><br>What is important now is never to let this type of thing repeat and cause unhappiness. The govt has to be transparent and be frank with Singaporeans. If you not of the right caste or class, you jolly well accept what comes to you. Learn to moderate your expectations, know your position in society and understand what you deserve is tied to your position in our society. This is meritocracy. If every can get what they want, it is not meritocracy. <br><br>The next step to improve our society is to label each strata of society clearly so that people know which strata they are in and correct their expectations - this will ensure unhappiness due to mismatch expectations does not repeat. Right now our upper echelons such as top elites ministers are clearly identified. However, down to the lower middle class some people still think to highly of themselves - they want 4 room flat when they can only afford 3 room flat, they want good location when 'richer' higher caste people are ahead of them. We need to clearly define the strata of society from the scholar class right down the useless folks with low education - everyone should know their place in our society.</span></span></p>

              <p>Have I read you wrong, or are you really in support of the author as a PAP cockroach in support of his idea of a caste system - simply for the sake of identifying the proper needs of each caste ?</p>
              <p>Amazing that the author will believe that Singaporeans are looked at as cockroaches.</p>
              <p>Did the author learn about caste systems amongst the cockroach community ?</p>
              <p>Obviously he will understand that there exist a hierarchical order in nature - and also within the cockroach species as well.</p>
              <p>Is life not complicated enough that a caste system is suggested for Singapore ?</p>
              <p>The monetarised stratification is already dividing Singapore society, and mixed with the potent politics of power - it has created an untouchable class in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Why will you even bother to promote such a complicated fantasy that serves no purpose except to the PAP ?</p>

              <p>Anyone who supports or calls for a caste system in Singapore should be shot for treason against our egaliltarian Republic State.</p>
              <p>Our forefathers' efforts and funds were to help every young citizen have a chance in life thru better education and eradication of discrimination they faced in their time. As such, this was the meritocracy they envisoned for our future.</p>
              <p>A person becomes rich by saving, not by spending. Many are plainly just not financially savvy, and as such made mistakes in their purchases to fulfill their personal desires. This can be corrected by giving them and helping them with knowledge of financial prudence, not label them towards a 'caste' category.</p>
              <p>Many are only victims of our consumeristic society, and it will take strenous education to wean our young and old off it. Do we really need that 42 inch HDTV? Do we need that Ipod? Do we really need that soup up WRX? Can we maintain it all?</p>
              <p>These are questions our young must asked and accept, and base his/her spending on what he/she can afford with either her savings or at least a realistic assessment of his/her capabilities for the future in her/his career, be she/he a scholar or a roadsweeper. Everyone will be given the chance to succeed, but it will be on his/her own effort and never to be discriminated against, in our republic.</p>
              <p>Caste systems are discriminatory, and demeans the human spirit to excel. Never, ever go down that lane, or it will be the end of what our forefathers had worked so hard for our nation in our past.</p>

              <p>It is obvious that the X-rated intellect will try to hoodwink Singaporeans into thinking that "no one owe us anything" - even from the PAP Elite Talents who pay themselves <strong>their million dollar wages that come from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OUR</span> hard earned monies</strong> that they take from us without even a blink of their eyes.</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans not entitled to expect the PAP elites to deliver the goods to us ?</p>
              <p>Is it not stating the obvious fact that - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Each and everyone of us must be able to dream, of a better life for ourselves and those around us</span></em>" and that one must be realistic too in "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">we must have and know the capability to make it come true</span></em>" ?</p>
              <p>From the above premise of knowing one's capability and capacity to make dreams come true - how does the X-rated intellect hope to make - "<em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dreams and aspirations propel us to greater heights than we or others think us capable</span></em>." - when at the same time, the "greater heights of our dreams" must be limited according to our capability and capacity ?</p>
              <p>Should it not be for us to push ourselves to the best of our abilities and strive to reach our fullest potential, and <strong>not be limited by our present knowledge</strong> of our present capabilities and capacities ?</p>
              <p>Many of our NSF recruits never knew their potential and were pessimitic of their abilities until they were pushed to the maximum.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the simplistic and unchallenged X-rated intellect prefer to limit itself from knowing its real X-factor - preferring to be contented and complacent with its present X-rated known capacity and capabilities.</p>
              <p>The X-rated intellect has the equal skills as the insufferable Minister-without-Portfolio Lim Swee Say - in murdering the obvious facts of life to its lowest level of simplicity until it is nothing more then sheer idiocy personified in the messenger.</p>
              <p>It is quite obvious that the X-rated intellect must have been emulating the insufferable idiocy of Minister-without-Porfolio Lim Swee Say's abilities in delivering his 'lollipop' messages of <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/378810">‘Making the economy and workforce cheaper, better and faster’ (*1). </a></p>

              <p>Then again, Singapore isn't exactly egalitarian either.  The point of failure in "meritocracy" is that people born in merit, will have more merit assuming everybody works equally hard and are equally smart.  But if everybody works equally hard and equally smart, and that isn't merit, then what is merit?  Its back to the merit of your starting position... do you get a 200m head start in an 400m race?  Meritocracy is a contradiction of itself.</p>
