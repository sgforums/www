            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Pay revisions could erode work ethics, heart for service: MP Zaqy Mohd<br>By Pearl Forss, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 11 April 2007 2159 hrs </strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : The motivation to serve was a key theme in speeches by MPs on the third day of debate on civil service and ministerial pay revisions.<br><br>MP for Hong Kah GRC Zaqy Mohamed said the need to raise the civil service and ministerial salaries raised questions on Singapore society.<br><br>His concern was over the kind of values that were inculcated among the people if Singapore cannot find 25 good men and women to serve as Ministers and Permanent Secretaries out of a population of 4.5 million.<br><br>"By making it too comfortable for our leaders - political and civil service officers - will we erode our work ethics, heart for servitude and compassion for our people? Much the same way, we fear that increasing financial assistance for the poor will erode the work ethics of the working population. How many lives and livelihoods are at stake if our policy-makers become too comfortable and disconnected from the realities of ordinary Singaporeans," asked the Hong Kah GRC MP.<br><br>The first-time MP who entered politics when he contested the 2006 General Election calls himself a post-65 idealist.<br><br>He said he would like to see leaders coming forward with a heart to serve honestly and compassionately, "put aside their personal interests for the interests for Singapore, and not just chase their GDP and performance bonuses." - CNA /ls<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So, after getting their own multi-million pay increases they will start to say things like "We must not erode work ethics or pay hikes will erode work ethics".<br><br>What is the meaning of this kind of utterances?<br><br>Plainly it is hypocrisy - ministers can get all their pay increases and if people are to ask for same then they will tell the workers not to expect their own pay hikes as that will erode work ethics"<br><br>There is too much hypocrisy now like "building an inclusive society", "no one will be left behind". Actions of the government will be just the opposite : increase GST, HDB flat prices, medicare costs, transportation costs, utility costs and say that there is no choice as it is necessary due to oils and external foces beyond control.<br><br>On the other hand, when it comes to promoting their own kind and the elites all the recommendations will be super-charged with benchmarking (without mention of work ethics being at risk) to give them greater pays, more bonuses, surprising share options from the public funds which they can now easily give because they are now manipulated through the self-reward schemes within the GLCs etc which is considered commercial decisions which are not under the purview of the government.</div>
