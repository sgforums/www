              <p>In another forum, someone has asked this question : why are we getting soft with men and workmen complaining how stressful their jobs or family duties are.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Let us examine the whole issue in greater depth and perspective.<br><br>In the beginning, politicians fought hard for the people in spite of threats to their own lives and safety.<br><br>The after these politicians have secured their seats in parliaments, they fought no more and took their jobs for granted and people for granted.<br><br>With tweaking of laws and entrenchment of powers for themselves so easily done through controlling the people and their own MPs, judiciary and oppositions, why should they ever want to sweat it out for real achievements any more?<br><br>Just answer back on any complaints and put up some excuses and all problems got solved without fighting.<br><br>Instead of coming up with more original and creative solutions, they go for easy options.<br><br>First they started to reward themselves by exaggerating about their own abilities and their ministers' abilities and give some excuses like "we need to promote and keep talent so all the ministers become talents without trying or proving as private sector would have done.<br><br>Before the ministers solve problems as found in NKF, Mas Selamat and the latest escapes of prisoners at the subordinate court, they were already successful beyond any accountability, They expect their assumed talents and ability are beyond reproach or question, and any one who challenge them like CSJ or Gopalan will be sued and silenced to protect their assumed reputations (do they still have such reputation is questionable and not yet enquired by the Canadian Court who found for Devan Nair who won against similar case without such presumptuous assumption)<br><br>Whose fault is it when TV interviewers' first question to women being interviewed about women's role fired off the first question so presumptuously by asking how she coped with bringing her children to school and going to work.<br><br>Government also started calling critics or oppositions liars without any consciousness of their own duties of providing proper accountability of their wrongful policies being questioned. The government is no longer mindful or passionate of their duties and discharging their obligations like the old Goh Keng Swee or Lim Kim San. The convenient way is to charge the highest tax like housing tax for HDB flats instead of promoting or facilitating the people or the real fundamentals of economy.<br><br>So MM Lee was right in saying his ministers and civil servants in charge of prisons are complacent but what real solutions has he to such problems.<br><br>He changed his mind and supported his PM son by keeping mum about complacency and so People are being blamed as complacent finally. Despite the past 40 plus years we have yet to see real thing that makes for efficiency and progress. Full of rubbish easy options and blames on the people for every problem.<br><br>MM Lee is telling the whole world showing all the statistics how efficient we are with more NS deaths and dramatic prison escapes not once but twice and thrice and pretenting these are not problems but honest mistakes.<br><br>Ministers responsible will still be getting his usual 6 months of bonus so what difference will it ever make to Singapore with this kind of complacency he himself is creating which he blamed on the people.<br><br>Are we slipping into the third world when we should have become a first world long ago. According to his latest interviews by the international media everything is still working but just look around at all the latest blunders created by the nincompop ministers. How many of them can solve problems of the real world. So full of rubbish superficial pretentions and hypocrisy.</p>

              <p>The original post was about women who complained about having a lot of stress in having to work and also looking after the family. The forumer who posted this derided this attitude of the women nowadays by saying that in the old days, women looked after the whole families with more chores and responsibilities without so much as a grumble but lamented that nowadays women are so fond of complaining.</p>

              <p>The original post was about women who complained about having a lot of stress in having to work and also looking after the family. The forumer who posted this derided this attitude of the women nowadays by saying that in the old days, women looked after the whole families with more chores and responsibilities without so much as a grumble but lamented that nowadays women are so fond of complaining.</p>

              <p>Zaxis,</p>
              <p>I feel that the MPs have no problems in dealing with municipal issues like rubbish, mosquito bleeding responsively for that will be good for votes.</p>
              <p>If you try to bring up real issues facing the citizens like rising costs of living, million-dollar ministerial salaries or unfairness in suing political dissidents, they will not reply you.</p>
              <p>I wrote to nearly all MPs recently a few times on such major issues facing the citizens. One or two MPs replied me and these MPs merely tried to use selective comparison like saying other countries in the regions are worse and we are lucky to answer to my queries.</p>
              <p>A more sensitive one told me quite point blank that I am over-board and challenging him when I merely disagreed with his views.</p>
              <p>How we end up today with having all the MPs as representing the establishments and M/W instead of conscience of the people we the people perhaps have to take long to ponder.</p>
              <p>If you could help me to get one MP to bring up real issues to M/W that MP I would like to worship.</p>
