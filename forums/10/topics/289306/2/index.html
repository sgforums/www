            <div class='col-md body'>Well believe everyone knows that whoever tries to sell stuff will always say his stuff are good . Since when you will hear someone critisizing his own goods ? Same applies to everyone young and ahem old  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  . Furthermore someone who can afford to live in his own nutshell thinking that pple are able to reach any corner of sg in 20mins definitely must be " something " lar har . Frankly speaking anyone living in sg are very aware of the actual estimated time of driving ard sg roads . So like pple always say , if one to " blow a cow " at least please make sure that you don't blow too hard lar arbo will burst one you know . " Is for your own good " cos you are not the only one with brain in the human race . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

The maximum time to reach any corner of Singapore is 20 minutes as traffic is not allowed to flood the roads," he added. </strong><br><br>obviously the last 2 sentence meant peak hours where we pay ERP.<br>just ask ourselves, even if u live serangoon and go into city using CTE. it is already more than 20minutues passing 3 or more gantry. is traffic any smoother?  i live in jurong and travel to city for work. it take me average 45-1hr to reach my office using AYE via CTE.
