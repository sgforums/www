            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not worried of them as a fighting force. But like you said, they will recieve weapons training.  If somethings don't well across the border, Singaporeans will be at risk travelling into Malaysia.  I'm mean, firearms are quite "available" there to buyers.  Eg.  The number of assault rifles that go missing.... ahem. Its different from people not TRAINed to use them, people trained to use them will hit more accurately and at critical components.  There IS danger from all this.</div>

It has been reported by Janes that ST Kinetics are designing and developing one (probably based on the Bionix chassis).<br><br>My personal opinion (more like guesses) is that the 105mm gun would probably be a low-recoil gun (probably from Rheinmetall or a modified version of the L7A3) that can fire curren NATO 105mm rounds including the APFSDS rounds. The new light tank will probably be a 3-man crew, incorporating some sort of auto-loader system, advanced fire-control computers including thermal sights, 2-axis stablisation for the gun and the sight. My personal wish is also that the commander is given an independent sight (panaromic) or CCITV that allows a hunter-killer mode to be added.<br><br>I also think that SAF should evaluate the CV90-120T for the suitability. This particular armoured vehicle (hybrid tank) was actually being eval in Malaysia. I haven't seen any report about the test results and don't know how suitable it is for the local environment). Furthermore, the trial was done in the late 90s. It will be a real good option to replace the Centurions earmarked for the 32 Div.<br><br><img src="http://www.jed.simonides.org/fulltrack/charlie/cv9040_series/cv90-120/cv90-120_a1_zwe.jpg"><br><br>Some really interesting articles about the CV90-120T:<br><a href="http://www.defense-aerospace.com/data/communiques/archives/2002Apr/data/2002Apr9793/" rel="nofollow">http://www.defense-aerospace.com/data/communiques/archives/2002Apr/data/2002Apr9793/</a><br><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/cv90/index.html#cv9010" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/projects/cv90/index.html#cv9010</a><br><br>Furthermore, I would also like to see a variant of Bionix armed with the AMOS turret.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Atobe:</div><div class="quote_body">If we are to use existing chassis of a BIONIX or the TERREX AV81, it looks like the GIAT Type of Turret with a 105mm main gun is the optimal solution.<br><br>Otherwise a completely new prime mover unit will have to be R + D to carry the bigger 120mm main gun.<br><br>Click:<br><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/turrets/giat/giat3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/contractors/turrets/giat/giat3.html</a><br><br>Place your cursor indicator on the photo for more information of the subject matter.<br><br></div></blockquote>I usually are less incline to choose the French version of the TK-105 turret because the French 105mm rifled gun does not  fire the NATO standard 105mm rounds. The French have their own 105mm rounds. Secondly, their 105mm gun on the AMX-10RC are not fully stabalised and thus the whole vehicle needs to come to a complete stop before can fire.<br><br>However, having said that, Giat came up with the new TML 105 turret for the AMX-10RC that can fire the NATO rounds.  The TML 105 turret is armed with stabalised105mm NATO standard gun. The TML 105 turret has a conveyor for storing and loading ammunition rounds. The Giat Industries APFSDS (armour-piercing, fin-stabilised, discarding sabot) 105 F1 round, fired by the TML 105 gun, can destroy single and triple NATO heavy tanks at a distance of 2,200m. The hit probability is stated as higher than 90% at 2,000m.<br><br>The TML 105 turret has a Soptac fire control system, from SFIM, which provides automatic acquisition of targeting parameters for on-the-move firing against mobile targets. It is equipped with a range of modular day and night observation equipment, based on image intensifiers or infrared technology. The capabilities range from firing by day against fixed targets to on-the-move firing by day and by night against mobile targets at a distance of more than 2,000m.<br><br>This TML 105 turret seems to be the logical choice.  I would also consider a few more foriegn turrets like the one from Stringray II, M8 AGS (it has an advanced autoloader as well), etc.</div>

"The 51-calibre SB Rh 105 105-30, by virtue of high grade steel properties and chrome-plated barrel, sees its gas pressure hovering over the 600 Mpa mark. A muzzle brake and hydraulic brake minimize recoil impulse to bearable levels, but when used in conjunction with the new 1700 meter-per-second muzzle speed KE 105 round, the gun is said to offer about the same performance as a conventional 120 mm tank gun."<br><br>looks good to me....<br></div>

And these aren't even trained professional soldiers at all just think what if they were half trained. Look at chechnya and more recently 911, it took a few determined goat herders with a little imagination to cause massive deaths and mayhem.<br><br>The malaysian NS concept is a effective one, one would initially question the effectiveness of a 5 year NS program with long breaks in between, as naturally less frequency of training equates less proficient soldiers right?<br><br>But imagine using numbers of half trained guerillas disguised as civilians each armed with knowledge of tactics and mebbe 1 RPG and some rounds or METIS M, yur armoured force whereabouts will be swiftly located &amp; dispatched in no time at all. How big yur amoured force also leow.<br><br>That's why I advocate to have our own saboteur force, mebbe the government can form a foreign legion secret police unit trained to root out these guys.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh yah, and if you check out the other threads, I think SAF already put some SPIKE on some of their M113, so they can knock out tanks if necessary I guess, i can't imagine using SPIKE-armed M113 in a dedicated anti-tank role. . .<br><br>and I think Thailand had a problem with some of their tanks some time ago because they mounted a gun that had too much recoil one type of tanks and there were cracks in the chassis. . .<br><br>not very sure, read it some time ago liao, can't remember details. ..sorry</div>
