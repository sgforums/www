            <div class='col-md body'>most shareholders are small investors but their little bit of money add together is quite a sum. These people leave things to the company to use the money and do not have time for meetings.  There are only a couple of big shareholders who own preference shares but they drive these meetings and also the direction of the company and such things. Of course they also drive decisions that might possibly benefit themselves at the expense of everything else.<br>But then I am only talking about the very simple world of finance.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
