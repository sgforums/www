A 43.92% win is commendable, considering you folks are against a minister of state, a mayor and the head of CASE and not forgetting the entire establishment machinery plus the PM, SM and MM all against you.<br><br>They called you all names, character assasination and made silly comments to you people. The 140th rank media protrayed you all badly, forgeting to relay the message to the whole of Singapore--"You have a Choice!"<br><br>I am absolutely certain its due to the sucess of your election rally! Your sincerity and passion have touched many people, including many people who stay in the north and west of Singapore.<br><br>Please send my congrats to the "suicide" WP team contesting in AMK GRC. You folks have displayed incredible courage in the face of near-impossible odds. When I attended the WP rally at AMK, I am absolutely touched by their passion, not forgetting that the candidates are merely a few years older than me and were facing the PM of Singapore. I actually bothered to SMS all my friends staying in AMK to inform them that "they have a choice!"<br><br>Those who attended the WP rallies will know that deep in our heart, you guys are the winners! And you people earn our utmost respect for your sincerity and not engaging in gutter, third-world pork barrel politics. Unlike some other party!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I will never, ever forget the 05/05/06 WP rally at Serangoon stadium throughout my whole life. Thank you WP for giving Singaporeans a choice!!!</div></blockquote>May I also congratulate you and your team for your guts and the passion to serve the people when you step out seeing the system was heading in the wrong direction.  Unfortunately you and your team actions was not appreciated and understood because of the gutter, third world politics.<br><br>Your team not only fought against the opponent canididates but the whole machineries of your opponent.<br><br>You and your team may have lost but I like you to know that they have won the heart of many with your passion.<br><br>We the citizen of Singapore.<br>Majullah Singapura<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
