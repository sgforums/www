            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Calvin86:</div><div class="quote_body">Japan also has a subsidized and quality health care.</div></blockquote>Japan has a universal healthcare system funded by insurance on a co-payment scheme. The two broad categories are employee insurance and national health insurance (a third, elderly health insurance is being worked up). All citizens have to be enrolled on one of these insurance schemes.<br><br>It is not cheap. If you go to hospital, you pay 20% of the medical fee from your pocket and the remainder comes from the national medical insurance. On top of that, you pay premiums for the national medical insurance, the amount varies according to your location and annual salary, up to a maximum cap of 530,000 yen per year or about S$7,329 per year. You also need to co-pay medication costs and this insurance excludes fees for normal baby delivery and injuries caused by a third party. However, you are free to go to any hospital in Japan for your treatment. The hospitals are paid a fixed fee for the services and that is capped by the government.<br><br>A universal health insurance system like in Japan sounds great but when you look into it further, we see that they are suffering from escalating deficits because of an aging population. As a result, they had to raise the amount of co-payment (ie, cash up front from your pocket). Increasing premiums for all is not acceptable to the electorate and so the move will be towards increasing the co-payment amount and in keeping with our government's argument about personal responsibility. I agree there is a limit to everything but I feel that smokers and drinker should have to pay more health insurance premiums if we have a universal medical insurance plan.<br><br>A universal health insurance system is in line with socialist values like having the rich pay more to support the poor but of course, this might encourage the rich to set up shop in places like Hong Kong. This may erode our economic competitiveness....are we prepared to accept that?<br><br>What I think we can learn from the Japanese is the removal of all distinctions between public and private hospitals because with a universal healthcare system private hospitals will not have any customers apart from foreigners. As a result, they have bought into the national healthcare system too and accept the fixed rates prescribed by the government. The huge discrepancy in pay between doctors in the private and public sectors has resulted in a situation where two-thirds of our doctors are over-servicing just one-third of the population in the private sector.<br></div>

Please read the official statements at this link: http://www.sma.org.sg/sma_news/3704/letter_press.pdf<br><br>The 'medical board' that you spoke of was the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), which is nothing more than a trade union of doctors.

We do pay much less taxes than people in Europe. The Scandinavian nations have great social welfare and universal healthcare systems, but they also pay up to 60% income tax. I know that if I work in the UK, I get 'free' NHS treatment but I also pay 45% tax (income tax+ national insurance etc.), whilst my tax liability in Singapore is only 10%.<br><br>At the moment a large proportion of Singaporeans do not pay any taxes at all (after discounting various tax breaks). There is an article by one of the Straits Times columnists on this matter recently. If we increase the tax burden on those who are already paying taxes, especially single professionals like myself who pay more in taxes and get comparatively little back in services (restrictions on housing, no subsidies or tax breaks for wife and children etc), we would emigrate and further reduce the number of tax payers.<br><br></div>

Tax rate is an important factor for business but not the only factor. US has fairly high taxes but they atttract a great deal of entrepreneurs. Its about what value your country can give to the rest of the world. The same argument goes for wages. Business are free to move to the lowest wages but they do not always settle in a place with lowest wages.<br><br>I remember Singapore was giving so many PR to HongKongers before 1997 but no one bothered to come. A larger amount went to Canada, a place with high tax rate instead.<br><br>Rising Healthcare is not an easy problem. Most forumites ( myself included)here probably do not have enough knowledge to approach the problem. But the governments stand like " Go find a good son-in Law" or "We will only help if there are surpluses" is breeding dissatisfaction. They are telling us they have no intention of tackling the problem of high healthcare costs. If we dont have surpluses and if healthcare costs rises, thats too bad.<br><br></div>
