Hence 6k pay is quite logical.  Are u a manager?  As I have explained before, to survive in Singapore, u need EDUCATION, and proof of it.  If some Malaysian or any foreigner comes to work in Singapore, they probably have pretty good educational backing.  Unless you have the same educational backing, why compare?  Do remember, guys who have completed NS also gets a better pay.</div></blockquote>I think you fail to understand what i'm trying to get at by using the IT manager as an example. The key point is not in the comparison of pay but with such a pay and the current upcoming GST hike and income tax reduction. Who do you think will gain? Yup, sure these PRs who came to singapore to work had pretty good background, a plain UK degree as compared to my lousy honour degree in singapore. And you know what? He had to consult me on every technical issue including how to install window 2000 on his laptop. Actually that's not the important point but the income tax reduction will really make a great gaps between the rich and the poor. Should the exemption from NS for those boss esp MPs earning lots of money be abolished after the income tax reduction to make it fair? Can you ensure they will spent in singapore under the GST system to render more revenue to the nation?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If you find that its too tough gettin a job in Singapore, then take whatever you have, and find jobs overseas. Work there, Migrate there if u want to.  I promise I won't miss you.</strong></blockquote>Did i say it's tough for me to get a job in singapore? I'm worrying for the future generation of singapore esp my kids if i bother to have any in particularly son. And sorry, the baby bonus is a joke. Guess baby girl will have more benefit in singapore i guess. Do you think there's future for those local students esp guy just out from NS amid all the younger PRs who came in easily under the government policies?<br><br>And finally, is there a need for you to miss me? Are you gay or what? Sorry i'm married. so shoo. Don shotgun on me.</div>

Since no, why grant PR and make thing unfair? In SAF, not all jobs will lead to breaches of security can be taken up by these PR to force them to convert to citizen at least. Maybe they can even fill up the jobs at SAFRA club house, golf field to serve those officer pig cheaply instead of wasting tonnes of money to maintain it and hence having excuses to raise GST further.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 25 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think talking bitter and talking angry's not gonna change a thing about PRs, GST or anything else for that matter...<br><br>I believe that we need these things. Whats the point of being xenophobic? Yah Yah, i know it sux to have an outsider earn more than u and lording it over u when it could very well have been a local or better yet, yourself lording over other people but thats not the point...<br><br>Companies *need* to make sure that their foreign managers/executives working here get PRs 'cos its a long term arrangement. Its a hassle to renew the work permit every once in awhile. and if they had to do that, they'll go somewhere else where the immigration arrangements are more flexible: ie. up north, where Mahathir "promised" to make things as painless as possible for MNCs to base there...<br><br>And as much as I know that not all comparisons are valid, they do help make a point sometimes. As already mentioned, Australia charges 10% consumption tax to pay for things which can hardly be justified! Hell, they even ran out of money to buy office supplies for their armed forces recently!<br><br>Yes, things are gonna cost more, but be fair in your assessment: Did you really give a shit when u paid 3%? Did you even look at the bill and yell "WHAT! 3% GST!" every time u paid for something? Frankly, when i do eat out, its the 10% service charge that bothers me, not the 3% GST so grow up...<br><br>And if u don't like to pay a consumption tax, where would u rather we got the money to run the country? An increase in income tax including a provision to tax low income earners? Thats not equitable, much worse and really stupid! At least in consumtion taxes, one can actually control how much one pays buy consuming less. I hit a bad patch recently and I myself was surprised to realise how much u can save by putting your mind to it, exercising more prudence and making smart choices.<br><br>And people did not go to JB to shop to save money! They do it to satisfy that craving for perceived savings... Think: u drive in with 3/4 tank, u spend RM300+ on grocery shopping, eating for the whole family of say, 4.. u top up your vehicle to full tank before returning and u would've spent close to SG150-200... for a saving of how much? as if u can't grocery shop here with $150... U actually end up buying more crap there 'cos its "cheaper"...<br><br>Don't like PRs? Lucky u don't live in the EU... they can now work anywhere in the EU, regardless of their country of origin and government's not allowed to discriminate. Thats why Jean Marie Le Pen won that election in France this week... YES, its THAT BAD and THAT MUCH WORSE there...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well , many people in this forum likes to say " migrate to other countries loh " and stuff like that , of course in other countries there are different management styles and policys . Leaving S'pore cannot solve the problem once and for all , we will never know how life will be overses unless we have been there to experience it ourselves . Most of us here are S'poreans ; we grew up here , our friends and family are here , its our home and roots . Do u think by migrating to other countries can resolve  all your discontentment with our goverment ? Do u want to be second-class citizens in an Ang-Moh country ? Where else can we go ? S'pore is our home and where we really belong in this planet earth .</div>
