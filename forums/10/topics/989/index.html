            <div class='col-md body'>Haiz... I felt that staying in Singapore is just too xpensive!!!<br>at first was 3% GST, people began to talk about it then the trend went off... here comes 5% GST...<br>What they say that to reduce the deduction of income tax and increase the GST... I dunno why they come to have this idea or plan but I find this very stupid and foolish!!! They kept saying that they care for us, the people, the public... yah all bullshit!<br>the income tax deduction is mainly for those who earn more than $18,000 or more...<br>what about those elderly, the youth, the children... and also the buying of things, HDB, utilities, expenses, clinics, hospitals, schools.... they are going to increase to 2% more... although they might think that was not much... hey com'on... the more we spent the more we pay... although we can don't buy those luxury things but what if come to educations, sickness??? When all the 2% added together they will still become a big amount...<br>Why everything seems to change after the elections??? Is that what all of us want??? All they benifits are mainly for those rich people.... did they spare a thought for the poors??? and those being retrench recently???<br>I am a singaporean which I don't have a feeling for Singapore at all... I really dun even feel to serve for Singapore too! I think many of us think this but who dares to speak out... all of us dares to only comments but not protests... things will still work out to be their way! All above are just my point of view... no offence!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>l agree with what u said , the living standards here are simply too high and worse still our wages are sooo low , it don;t strike a balance at all , worse still the cost of living is getting higher and higher .The income tax is only once a year but the GST is something to face every single day and moment , do u think u can save lots of money from this income tax ? Rather u would be more worried about this GST thingy . So to conclude : Standard of living is too high yet quality of living is too low.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well move to Australia then...lucky country where the government charges 10% GST on everything, then proceeds to stiff you with a MINIMUM 18% income tax(if you work hard enough to earn more than $6000 annually) on top of that(if you're good enough to be in the top income bracket then have fun paying 50% income tax). And the money goes to:<br><br>- Setting up heroin injecting rooms in the country's biggest city<br>- Using multimillion dollar frigates to stop illigal immigrants in rickety old boats who'd probably break apart if they meet a bigger-than-normal wave<br>- paying politicians who spend the days hurling child sex-abuse charges at each other<br>- replacing older street signs that actually make sense with new ones that don't<br>- setting up a justice system who sentences criminals who rape and bash a greatgrandmother to death to a grand total of 4 year jail(available for parole in 18 months)<br>- a public transport system which is so easy to cheat its scandalous.<br><br>Thats right, if you don't like Singapore and the system you could always migrate, after all, Pauline Hanson would welcome you with open arms.<br><br>If you think Singapore's living standards are high, try getting a decent meal in the centre of Australia's second largest city for the equivalent of $4(which you can get in any hawker centre in Singapore). It's not even enough to buy you a bloody sandwich mate.<br><br>PS. Don't take this the wrong way, my point is this: The grass might look greener on the other side, but it isn't always the case.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 14 April 2002).]</div>

Viper52...<br>I dunno why people tend to compare with other countries... yah maybe sometimes it will help the country to be better... however, do they ever think for the people first... who need to strive so hard to just gain a 'name' or 'fame' for our country... freak out!<br>Yap maybe sometimes it also makes me wonder why I would prefer other countries than my own country... it's just like why people would go to Malaysia to buy stuffs and waste their petrol to travel there??<br>But people will being force to do so... they say that the hawker centre people cannot increase their price due to the increase of 2%, but did they thought of where did these hawkers buy their food from... the traders will aso count in the 2%... it's just like a cycle... u increase mine, i increase others, others increase the consumers... who suffer??? the consumers!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do we compare Singapore to other country? Simple. It helps us come to make a decision as to which country is better for me to live, find work and maybe raise a family in.<br><br>Singapore has its downsides, and yes, I don't agree with everything the government says and does(gasp!). I have been studying in Australia for the last 4 years, long enough I think for me to make a judgement on whether I think Singapore or Australia is better for me to live in. And yes, I do believe that Singapore, despite its cons, is a better place for me to live in against Australia, for it's pros.<br><br>What I take issue with you comments, novellem, is your statement, "I really dun even feel to serve for Singapore too". Why? Jus because you disagree with what the government is doing? By putting it like this, what you are doing is that you're failing to separate your country from your government. The government represents the country, but it is not the country. Instead they are the people who have been elected by your countrymen, by majority vote, to run the country. Loyalty to country is not loyalty to ruling party and vice versa. Just because you disagree with your government does not mean you must disagree with your country. One is opposition, the other treason. There IS a difference<br><br>Fact of the matter is, Singapore has its pros and cons, like everywhere else. What I feel is that many Singaporeans, in their desire to nitpick about the cons, fail to see it for the pros. I, myself was like that once. 4 years in another country changed that outlook pretty much.<br><br>Freedom of speech? An overrated thing if there ever was one. If you have too much of it, eventually everybodys desire to make themselves heard will drown your voice out.<br>Freedom of press? Come on, the only ones who believe that Western press is "free" are the Western press themselves. The only difference the Western press has from Singapore's is that the press are controlled by the media moguls, who in turn, can be bought by *anyone* with the money and influence. Free and independent indeed.</div>

Don't you think it's kind of a limitation to you? Why do you think most of the foreign talent (e.g Chinese, indonesian, malaysian etc) in singapore took up only blue IC instead of the pink IC even when the government bother to offer to them for free? Yes, to them singapore is indeed a good place to work but definitely not a good place to settle down to have kids as compared to their hometown where life is easier. Do you agree?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes...I have only lived in 2 countries only, Singapore and Australia. and yet, ask any of these other who complain about Singapore being expensive, heavily taxed etc etc. How many countries have they lived in? How did they arrive at the conclusion that they are heavily taxed? By comparing as how it was before? In the 1990s? The 80s? Or are they comparing with countries like Indonesia and Malaysia? If you want to compare like that, then yes, living in singapore is expensive. But then again, you should also compare other things like levels quality of life, incomes and exchange rates. Why compare with countries that are at a lower economic rung when we should compare with those that are on par econimically, or even higher than us?<br><br>Yes, these PRs all want to come here, earn money, then go back to their home countries and enjoy a good life later. But which advanced country does not face such an issue? Again, using where I live, a lot of my friends(be they from Singapore Malaysia Indonesia HK or anywhere) are planning to apply for Aussie PR after they graduate, to find a job here. But ask them if they want citizenship, they will give you a funny look and ask, "Are you crazy?" This is simply a result of globalization, its happening with EVERY more developed economy, and its called competition. Maybe instead of whining about how that PR comes in and takes your job for a lower pay, maybe we should show why WE are worth our higher pay. Think about it, when times are good, we welcomed them here with open arms to cope with a labour shortage, now when times are bad, you want to kick them out JUST because they don't belong here. Sorry to break your heart, but these companies are here TO MAKE MONEY. They retrench those who're not pulling their weight, not because their passport is of a different colour<br><br></div>

However, I believe they should spare some thought for the local. Life is so hard already with extra burden as a local and yet they want to suck on further thru GST from the poor while the rich esp MPs and the foreigner live off happily with less income tax and no commitment. I would think less corporate tax is enuff for lure back all the big fish and better management of national reserve instead of squandering it e.g building more SAF club house and golf club for defence purpose.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kyo23, ur Company's Malaysian PR is a MANAGER.  Hence 6k pay is quite logical.  Are u a manager?  As I have explained before, to survive in Singapore, u need EDUCATION, and proof of it.  If some Malaysian or any foreigner comes to work in Singapore, they probably have pretty good educational backing.  Unless you have the same educational backing, why compare?  Do remember, guys who have completed NS also gets a better pay.<br><br>If you find that its too tough gettin a job in Singapore, then take whatever you have, and find jobs overseas. Work there, Migrate there if u want to.  I promise I won't miss you.</div>

Seen too much rubbish from most regulars I know to want to be associated with them in anyway. I'd like to think I'm loyal to my country(feel free to disagree with me on this anyone, after all thats just IMO), and because of this will disagree with the government on their policies when I feel theres a need to and will continue to speak up for policies I think are right.<br><br>However, look at my main point of argument against the original poster. He doesn't want to serve the country because of disagreement with government policy? What gives him the right to turn his back on his national duty just because of that? I can say for sure EVERY SINGAPOREAN disagrees with government policy on some issue or another. Did they turn their backs on national obligation, or did most of them say they wanted to? That statement was totally uncalled for and really pissed me off.<br><br>I worked with the logistics side of army, and that put me in contact with a lot of drivers storemen and cooks(yes there were still cooks when I was in there) and do know of their hardluck stories and I empathised with them. and I had always questioned the need for more golf courses in land-scarce Singapore since only a MINORITY(unfortunately an influential one) plays. This minority is taking up a disproportionate amount of land and to me thats not right.<br><br>And hell yes, it boils. But that does not detract from my view that what we have is the best there is. Although it can be made better.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Viper52 (edited 22 April 2002).]</div>
