            <div class='col-md body'>Is there any criteria for the ranking of the WOSE personnals in the S.A.F.?<br>It's basically based on the personnel abilities, and the Boss that you are working for! I personally think that this shouldn't be the way. There should be standardized way for the selection to the next higher ranking.  First the number of years of service should be taken into consideration. Secondly the work performance should be also considered.<br><br>These are the main aspects should be looked into.......<br><br>Open for discussion..........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A long long time ago, during caveman days, the elders of the leopard lair, have carved up a system of ranking for their clan. I have gathered information and here is the criteria for their ranking:<br><br>Private: All cavemen enlisted to fight off dinosaurs are given these.<br><br>Lance Corporal: Leaders of the pack, given to caveman in successfully making himself an umbrella from the leaves, twigs and oil, makes other cavemen awe in wonder.<br><br>Corporal: Given to cavemen who has successfully grown mushrooms, flowers, and most importantly, wheat and grain.<br><br>Sergeant: Given to cavemen who had enough of eating vegetables and wanted meat. Cavemen must dig a trench 30 feet deep so as to trap unsuspecting dinosaur. Cavemen given one additional promotion for each kilo of dinosaur meat given to his superiors.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, an officer outranks a wosa, a sergeant outranks a corporal. watever the rank, we should be proud of it. it is given to us, based on the system of advancement. rank should be more important to a regular serviceman than nsfs because a higher ranking equates to a higher rank pay.<br><br>rank is independent of our vocation, especially if we change vocation, we still hold to the same rank. a person's rank is liable for downgrading if he has committed serious offences.<br><br>aint that all true? i am a serviceman too.<br></div>

But have you ever noticed that there is an committee, where there will decide who should be and shouldn't be.. Is this fair to those who has done good at their but disliked by his So-called Superior(Officer). Can this prevailing system been reviewed?????<br><br>Especially to the New Premium plan...<br>Does this scheme explains about the graduaty for the 10yrs?<br>The only answers I could gather is that the Least amount stated in your Start Benefit should be considered as your Graduaty..<br>In the early years the graduaty for 6 yrs of contract service would be around $10.000. But now since the Premium Plan - the Graduaty for 10 yrs is less than $10.000/-.. Is this true?<br>Can anyone clear me of this doubt!!!!<br>Million thanx if yu could do so!!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br><br>I was from a manpower dept in airforce, so I know how the ranking is done.<br><br>Basically, there is a very systematic way of ranking personnels for promotion. It is based on performance ranking and of course recommendations from officers (sorry, don't think I can give more details. supposed to be confidential). Because everybody wants to be promoted, they have to choose some over others, and yes, sometimes if the officer fights hard enough, the man will get the promotion. Sometimes, it is because some guy has been in his rank for 'quite some time', and he gets promoted over another guy who has the same ranking but younger in age.<br><br>I guess the bottomline is that the system tries to be fair, but it relies too much on arbitration and judgement of officers...</div>
