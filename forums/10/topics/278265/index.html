Bush on Friday urged China to ease political restrictions ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, scolded Myanmar, and called for greater democracy throughout Asia.<br><br>"We will encourage China to open up its political system and give greater voice to its people," he said on the sidelines of a summit of Asia Pacific leaders in Sydney.<br><br>In a wide-ranging speech, Bush defended the unpopular war in Iraq as key to promoting Middle East reforms and defeating terrorists and blamed "a handful of countries" he did not name for stalling global free trade talks.<br><br>Bush, whose prepared remarks were released by the White House, said Russia must "respect the checks and balances that are essential to democracy" and linked the 2008 Olympics to political reforms in China.<br><br>"Next year, China will host the Olympic Games, and it will be a moment of pride for the Chinese people. It will also be a moment when the eyes of the entire world will fall on Beijing," the US president said.<br><br>"We urge China's leaders to use this moment to show confidence by demonstrating a commitment to greater openness and tolerance," said Bush, who was here for the 21-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.<br><br>That amounted to a reversal of sorts from the White House's description of his position in a meeting Thursday with Chinese President Hu Jintao that he would attend the games "for the sports and not for any political statements."<br><br>The US leader urged the creation of an "Asia Pacific Democracy Partnership" to help "forces of moderation" in the region, while taking aim at Myanmar Â– formerly known as Burma Â– as well as North Korea and Thailand.<br><br>"We must work for the day when the people of North Korea enjoy the same freedoms as the citizens of their democratic neighbours," he said ahead of separate talks with leaders of South Korea, Russia and Southeast Asian nations.<br><br><span class="normal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"We must press the regime in Burma to stop arresting, harassing, and assaulting pro-democracy activists for organizing or participating in peaceful demonstrations," said Bush.<br><br>"The Burmese regime must release these activists immediately, stop its intimidation of those Burmese citizens who are promoting democracy and human rights, and release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi," he said. </span></strong></span><br><br>Myanmar's military rulers have held Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for 11 of the past 17 years.<br><br>Bush said his proposed partnership would mean "free nations will work together to support democratic values, strengthen democratic institutions, and assist those who are working to build and sustain free societies across the Asia Pacific region."<br><br>Turning to the so-called Doha Round of free trade talks, Bush insisted that Washington "has both the will and the flexibility" to revive the effort and said countries "must focus on what we have to gain, not what we could lose".<br><br>"No single country can make Doha a success, but it is possible for a handful of countries that are unwilling to make the necessary contributions to bring Doha to a halt," he said.<br><br>Bush, who was to meet later with Russian President Vladimir Putin, vowed to "advance our shared interests in the world while encouraging Russia's leaders to respect the checks and balances that are essential to democracy."<br>- AFP/so  </span><br></blockquote>Does anyone of you (including Gazelle &amp; Mushroom) also support United States stand in condeming Pro-Democracy basher regime?
