              </strong></p><h1><strong>Russia to push ruble at G8 summit: Medvedev</strong></h1><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">BARVIKHA, Russia (AFP) - Russia intends to
                      raise ideas at the upcoming G8 summit for making its currency,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the
                      ruble, a viable global reserve money</strong></span>, President Dmitry Medvedev said
                      Saturday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">Speaking to reporters after talks outside
                      Moscow with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Medvedev said
                      Russia had no say in setting the G8 summit agenda, which will focus on
                      the global financial crisis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">But he stated: "Of course we have our own
                      proposals. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We are talking about the creation of foundations for a new
                      financial architecture, indeed, a fair new financial architecture."</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">Medvedev said this included discussion of
                      making multiple currencies attractive enough for states to hold as
                      reserve currencies and use as means of payment in international trade,
                      alongside the currently dominant US dollar.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial;">"We have spoken about the possibility of
                      using the ruble for this purpose,"Medvedev said, adding: "We are not
                      dropping this idea."</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">Medvedev and his mentor, Prime Minister
                      Vladimir Putin, have for years evoked the possibility that the ruble
                      could one day become an international reserve currency like the dollar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial;">Like Russia, China has also increasingly
                      criticised the dollar-dominated global currency system and has been
                      pushing for wider use of its currency, the yuan.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">World economists however regard the
                      prospect of either money supplanting the dollar or, to a lesser extend,
                      the European euro, as a widely-held reserve currency as a long way off
                      at best.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">Russia also talked up its ideas for
                      spreading the influence of the ruble ahead of the G20 financial crisis
                      summit last month in London, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but the ideas have been greeted coolly in
                      the West and were all but ignored at the meeting.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">"These are all issues for the future," Medvedev acknowledged, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"but in my opinion they are issues for the near future.</strong></span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> <span style="font-family: arial;">"At the end of the day, we should emerge victorious from this crisis," he said.</span></strong></span></p>

              <h1>The Sinking Dollar</h1>
              <p>by Immanuel Wallerstein</p>
              <p>15 May 2009</p>
              <p><span class="norm">When Premier Wen Jiabao of China said in March of
                  2009 that he was "a little bit worried" about the state of the U.S.
                  dollar, he echoed the feelings of states, enterprises, and individuals
                  across the world. He called upon the United States "to maintain its
                  good credit, to honor its promises and to guarantee the safety of
                  China's assets."<br><br>Even five years ago, this would have seemed a
                  very presumptuous request. Now it seems "understandable" even to Janet
                  Yellen, the President of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank,
                  although she considers China's proposals concerning the world's reserve
                  currency "far from being a practical alternative."<br><br>There are
                  only two ways to store wealth: in actual physical structures and in
                  some form of money (currency, bonds, gold). They both entail risks for
                  the holder. Physical structures deteriorate unless used and using them
                  involves costs. To utilize such structures to obtain income and
                  therefore profits depends on the "market" -- that is, on the
                  availability of buyers willing to purchase what the physical structures
                  can produce.<br><br> Physical structures are at least tangible. Money
                  (which is denominated in nominal figures) is merely a potential claim
                  on physical structures. The value of that claim depends on its exchange
                  relation with physical structures. And this relation can and does vary
                  constantly. If it varies a small amount, hardly anyone notices. But if
                  it varies considerably and frequently, its holders either gain or lose
                  a lot of wealth, often quite rapidly.<br><br>A reserve currency in
                  economic terms is really nothing but the most reliable form of money,
                  the one that varies least. It is therefore the safest place to store
                  whatever wealth one has that is not in the form of physical structures.
                  Since at least 1945, the world's reserve currency has been the U.S.
                  dollar. It still is the U.S. dollar.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The country that issues the
                  reserve currency has one singular advantage over all other countries.
                  It is the only country that can legally print the currency, whenever it
                  thinks it is in its interest to do so.</strong></span><br><br>Currencies all have
                  exchange rates with other currencies. Since the United States ended its
                  fixed rate of exchange with gold in 1973, the dollar has fluctuated
                  against other currencies, up and down. When its currency went down
                  against another currency, it made selling its exports easier because
                  the buyer of the exports required less of its own currency. But it also
                  made importing more expensive, since it required more dollars to pay
                  for the imported item.<br><br>In the short run, a weakened currency may
                  increase employment at home. But this is at best a short-run advantage.
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the middle run, there are greater advantages to having a so-called
                  strong currency. It means that the holder of such currency has a
                  greater command on world wealth as measured in physical structures and
                  products</strong></span>.<br><br> Over the middle run, reserve currencies are strong
                  currencies and want to remain strong. The strength of a reserve
                  currency derives not only from its command over world wealth but from
                  the political power it offers in the world-system. This is why the
                  world's reserve currency tends to be the currency of the world's
                  hegemonic power, even if it is a declining hegemonic power. This is why
                  the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency.<br><br>So, why is
                  Premier Wen "a little bit worried"? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is clearly because over the past
                  few decades, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar has been fluctuating
                  a great deal but on the whole slowly declining.</strong></span> One of the main factors
                  has been the incredibly rising global debt of the U.S. government.
                  There are two main ways in which the United States has been able to
                  balance its books. It prints money and it sells U.S. treasury bonds,
                  primarily to other governments (so-called sovereign wealth funds). <br><br>It
                  is no secret that in recent years the largest single buyer of U.S.
                  treasury bonds has been China. It is not the only one. Japan and South
                  Korea, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, India and Norway have all bought
                  U.S. treasury bonds. But China today is the biggest buyer, and given
                  the present credit contraction, China is one of the few likely buyers
                  in the immediate future.<br><br>The dilemma for China, as for others
                  who have invested in U.S. treasury bonds, is that if the dollar
                  declines further or if there is significant inflation because of the
                  printing of money by the United States,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> their investment in treasury
                  bonds may lose them money.</strong></span> On the other hand, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what alternatives do
                  China or the others have?</strong></span><br><br> The policy conclusion that China (and
                  other buyers) are drawing is steady low-key divestment. They want it to
                  be not so fast as to cause a "run on the bank" but not so slow as to be
                  the last one out the door -- "before the stampede" as W. Joseph Stroupe
                  entitled his article in the <em>Asia Times</em>. <br><br>China is
                  reducing the amount of U.S. treasury bonds it is buying, and now
                  prefers to buy shorter-term ones rather than longer-term ones. China is
                  entering into "currency swaps" with other countries, such as Argentina,
                  so that neither has to use dollars in their transactions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And China is
                  calling for the creation of an alternate reserve currency based on the
                  Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) created by the International Monetary
                  Fund, which are based on a basket of currencies. Russia has endorsed
                  this call. </strong></span><br><br>The United States is not sure how to respond. When
                  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that the U.S. government is
                  "quite open" to China's proposal to increase the use of SDRs, the
                  dollar immediately went down in the currency market. So Geithner then
                  "clarified" what he had said. The dollar remained the world's "dominant
                  reserve currency" and this is "likely to continue for a long period of
                  time." He asserted that "we will do what's necessary to make sure we're
                  sustaining confidence in our financial markets, and in the productive
                  capacity of this country and in our long-term fundamentals."<br><br>Is
                  Geithner just whistling in the dark? More important, who believes that
                  what he says is plausible? The key to a currency's strength is not
                  so-called fundamentals but "faith" in the reality of these
                  fundamentals. <br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All the main actors are hoping there can be a
                  soft landing, an orderly transition away from the U.S. dollar.</strong></span> No one
                  wants to precipitate a free fall, because no one is sure to come out
                  ahead if that happened. But if the U.S. stimulus turns out to be the
                  last of the bubbles, the dollar could very suddenly deflate in a most
                  chaotic fashion. The way you say "stampede" in French is "<em>sauve-qui-peut</em>," which translates literally as "let him save himself who can."</span></p>

So China channelled these earned reserve into US treasury bills, pumping cheap credit into the US economy, shoring up the Dollar. <br><br>A tango China willing to play along, thinking that the benefit was mutual. <br><br>China is caught in a nasty situation. Theoretically, they can convert their reseve back into Yuan or into a new reserve currency. Technically, they may not be able to do so with the trillions Dollar reserve. China must have guessed that they may never see their reserves again - not in their previous value. The US Dollar which are fiat money are useless toilet paper.  </p>
