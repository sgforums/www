            <div class='col-md body'>I found this on the forum page of the Thai newspaper 'the Nation'  ::<br><br>Author: Story-Teller<br>Date:   25 Jan 2550 22:23<br><br>There was a farang who had needs a brain-transplant, due to old age. He was rich and willing to buy a "good brain" at any price.<br><br>The agent involved took him to a lab, and inside there were only 3 brains left - one of Chinese, one of Singaporean and the last, a Thai.<br><br>The farang started his negotiation and asked about the prices of the 3 brains available. The agent response was as follows:<br><br>1) Chinese - US$10,000<br><br>2) Singaporean - US$50,000<br><br>3) Thai - US$500,000<br><br>The farang was surpised as to the expensive price of the Thai brain, and asked the agent why?<br><br>The agent said; "Well, it is simply because the Thais seldom used their brains to think, as compared to the Chinese and Singaporean, who are always thinking of how to make more money...hence, the wear and tear of their brains are much more obvious then the Thai!"<br><br>How much do you think will Sonthi's brain cost, compared to President Hu of China and Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore?<br><br>The fact is, he is making himself a laughing stock, by claiming that Singapore tapped his phone - ask Nokia, Motorola and Eriscsson, and they will tell you that Sonthi's is simply a stupid nut!<br><br>Start using your brain, Sonthi, before it becomes even more expensive!<br><br><a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/board/thaipol/view.php?id=1197&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationmultimedia.com/board/thaipol/view.php?id=1197&amp;offset=0</a><br><br>We can all go to this site and wage war in support of the few Singaporeans there.</div>
