Everyone is. If you ask me if I would rather be locked up in a<br>room with a Bangladeshi or a British guy I'd take my chances with the<br>British, because of my EXPERIENCES.

            <div class='col-md body'>The latest news about the racism row on CBB is that the main bully, Jade, is that the perfume she has been endorsing called 'shh', has been pulled off the shelves.  To date, 40,000 people have complained to the UK's media regulator, Ofcom.<br><br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6287857.stm<br><br>This goes to show the power of the people and that people have taken a stand against racism.<br><br>We should learn from what's happening in the UK and India about this and take a stand as well. So complaining to mediacorp is the first step to stop xiaxue's propoganda. It's no point if people just talk about it in the forum and do nothing about it. How does a character like Xiaxue get to appear on her own TV Show? Because we the public, let her. So xiaxue's critics should step up to the plate and do something about it. I have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this won't be the first time she was dropped from a label. The New Paper dropped her segment because they didn't want to be tied to her less then presentable opinions on her blog. They did it rather quietly thought.<br><br>And in her current incarnation on TV, they have generally steered clear of letting her speak her mind on certain issues in GOL, keeping her involvement in the show mostly to the shallow and ridiculus. But yeah, I'd rather they drop her entirely... and maybe they will.<br><br>She's done plenty of questionable things with her blog, not just her views on foreign workers but also this time when she actually provoked the online bullying of a girl she didn't not like by dissing her openly on her blog and posting links and details to that person... and her fanboys proceeded to harrass that person until she was forced to delete her blog.<br><br>While it was an against the law for that stranger to hack her blog back then, I wonder if he/she actually did everybody a public service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not to mention a time in Jan 2006 where she tried to set up a rival blogger by impersonating him to make it look as if he was insulting somebody else, during the "Orchard Road free of Bangladeshis" campaign. Due to an error on her part in mixing up posting names, she was exposed.<br><br><a href="http://xialanxue.blogspot.com/2006/01/xiaxue-expos.html" rel="nofollow">http://xialanxue.blogspot.com/2006/01/xiaxue-expos.html</a><br><br>She is quite fortunate they didn't make it a police matter, it could be argued that her actions fell afoul of the law. Ironically it could be said she was lucky her rivals caught her early enough in the act before she caused any real damage.<br><br>One might be able to condone her controversial opinions, certainly one cannot tolerate controversial actions such as this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My goodness! I didn't realize that this xiaxue character is so sick in the head.  I  was completely oblivious to her previous actions. I only know about her racist comments on the blog entry posted on 12/1/07 because I came across her blog by accident.<br><br>If you all know what a screwed up racist  person she is, then you should say something to mediacorp. Write to them and ask them to remove her from tv. Here are the email addresses again:<br><br>local5@mediacorptv.com<br>editor@mediacorptv.com<br><br>One of the worst things she wrote about racism is that, she tries to justify her racist views by saying that everyone is racist and therefore, she is not wrong in being a racist. How crazy is that?</div>

What you are describing is what's called '' aversive racism'' or better known as hidden racism.<br><br>"subtle, unintentional form of bias that is presumed to characterize a substantial proportion of White liberals."<br><br>Because they have internalized liberal egalitarian values, aversive racists consider themselves non-prejudiced, even though they have unconscious racist feelings, and sometimes express them. "Thus, aversive racists are able to discriminate without acknowledging their prejudice because they excuse or justify their behaviour on Â‘reasonableÂ’ groundsÂ” (ibid, 290)<br><br>Quoted from:<br>Leanne S. Son Hing, Greg A. Chung-Yan, Robert Grunfeld, Lori K. Robichaud, and Mark P. Zanna. "Exploring the Discrepancy Between Implicit and Explicit Prejudice: A Test of Aversive Racism Theory" in Social Motivation: Conscious and Unconscious Processes. Joseph P. Forgas, Kipling D. Williams, Simon M. Laham, eds. Cambridge University Press. 2004.<br><br>Although the quote mentions white liberals, the term white liberals can be replaced with any other race or ethnic group.<br><br>This quote can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism<br><br>In other words, the most you can say is that you are an aversive racist, because the term 'racist' is too general and it can mean many of things, to a lot of people it can be interpreted as an insult. So be careful on your use of words.<br><br>Xiaxue celebrates ignorance and rejects education. Do you really want to be like her?<br><br></div>
