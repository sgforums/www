I think her loathsome attitude really give S'pore youth a bad name. For people who don't know better, they may think<strong> she represent the current generation of S'pore youth</strong>--- inflated ego, self-centred and spreading very very wrong value on her blog<br><br>i think she epitomize the phrase "empty vessels make the most noise", constantly putting others down to feed her ballooned ego and resorting to making controversial comments to create attention for herself<br><br>And what's really PERPLEXING to me is mediac~ock morbid fascination with her... saw her on some Channel U talkshow and now even a program that's her to host??!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>I mean even in this age of media of denegerating values, there are certaintly 1001 more deserving people to be shown on tv than her...<br><br>And lastly, i really cannot fathom how such a "character" like her has fans and is regarded as some sort of celebrity??</div>

This becomes all the more important given how some of her opinions are threading the thin line between what's just shallow fun and actually deep seated issues that are a lot more serious.<br><br>Contrast her unusually defensive and evasive stance everytime she's subject to criticism to being so outspoken when she's free to blog with nobody opposing her. Note the tatics she often uses in trying to push her point, which rest more on theatrics, character-assassination of others, and often the outright cyber-bullying of others who have little recourse to defend themselves.<br><br>I wonder if she actually dares to say the same gutter she does on her blog outright to a Bangladeshi or all the other people she has coloured in her reckless soapboxing.<br><br>In the end people will have to stand up to her. The real thing is not simply about not reading her blog if we don't like it, it's about standing up to such people to show them that soceity does not tolerate this kind of behavior- much less make a role model out of it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:<br><br><strong>The difference is this, it is true that everybody is predisposed towards racism and that it is a natural instinct to be suspicious of anybody who is different from what you are used to.<br><br>The difference is what you do with this instinct. Do you reconize it for what it is and go out to find the truth about the issue or do you let yourself be run by these instincts because they are only "natural".<br><br>Do we simply say "I'll trust any darkie less then any whitie and that's that because it's the way I feel" or do we go on and say "my instinctive feelings aside, I want to make the effort to find out the truth behind these individuals to see who is more worthly of my trust."?</strong><br><strong>What Xiaxue is saying is like all of us have anger in us, and being angry justifies most of the things we say and do while in that state. Rubbish, a person who is angry still has the choice to obey his anger or not, just as a person who has his own instinctive feelings about other races should obey these feelings or not. </strong><br><br>What ST says is true; it is very easy and convenient to 'blame' one's inherent nature for their racist behaviour. Some people will argue that their racist thoughts are at an unconscious level, thus they can't help how they feel about it and because of that, they believe that everyone has got a little bit of racist nature in themselves.<br><br>If everyone acts based on the feelings they have at an unconscious level, then you can just imagine how the world would be like. That's why human beings have logical reasoning, a sense of morals and many other factors that influence their behaviour. To say that people can't help but  follow their natural instincts is like comparing people to animals, so basically what xiaxue is saying is that human beings have the same level of thinking as animals.</div>

If xiaxue's blog was not full of bias in the first place, then there would have been less chance that her critics would be biased against her. Anyway, some of her critics are refutting her arguments using reason and logical thinking.<br><br>I don't mean to nit pick on every single mistake xiaxue does, but she uses the word 'rebuttal' wrongly in her arguments, she clearly doesn't understand the meaning of the word 'rebuttal'.<br><br>Decemberflower, you also say that:<br><br>''firstly, can you all honestly say that you like all races equally and you do not dislike anything about any race? ''<br>That is what we call a leading question and it is a way to force someone to take sides in the race debate. One can also say that it is a 'bias' question against someone who chooses to be neutral or someone who prefers to argue their views in a more logical and reasonable manner. It is not a fair question and it's aim is to 'corner' people into admitting that they might be racist.<br><br>Even if you think that xiaxue's blog is ''thought provoking, controversial, interesting views enough to keep reading'', once again, IT DOES NOT JUSTIFY HER FROM MAKING OFFENSIVE RACIST REMARKS. People who disagree with her racist remarks WILL TAKE A STAND AGAINST HER and if people like you don't like that, then, DON'T.  We are not forcing you to LIKE OUR IDEAS.<br><br>You also said:<br><br>''not everyone likes to jump on the bandwagon or is without individualistic ideas that may go against the flow.''<br><br>Just because some people choose to jump on the bandwagon, it does not mean that they should be discredited. In fact, these are the people who have got better individualistic ideas as compared to those who follow her flawed arguments blindly.</div>

She's using the rather obvious fact that  each and every single individual entertains and holds prejudiced opinions against other races to some extent to justify her own reckless heckling and blasting of people of different cultures, nationalities, and social standing.

If she is really as intelligent and outspoken as she claims herself to be, why then is she resorting to such "instinctive" justifications for her behaviour? The truth is she knows that what she writes is more or less rather repungant, but is hoping that she can make enough smoke and empty noise in an effort to seem entertaining mask up the rubbish that she's really selling.<br><br>The fact that racism exists in all of us does not change in one bit the reality of what she did... in fact it is because racism exists in the first place that we ought to fight it in everytime it shows its ugly head withing others or ourselves. She says nothing new except that racism exists... hence is okay to be racist.<br><br>Just replace the word "Bangladeshi" with "Malay" or "Indian", she would end up getting the same attention those racists bloggers did in a heartbeat.<br><br>What she did was to highlight a social problem: "That there are molests being perpetrated by opportunistic foreign workers", but the rest of her opinions on this issue consist mostly of nonsense at best, or blatant racism and bigotry being passed off as entertainment at worst. Don't forget her calls for social apartheid as well. The irony is that after all this outcry about Miss Wee's elitism... Wendy Cheng presents a not so subtle elite point of view as well... that we the Singaporeans are somehow the elite, cleaner, fairer and more worthy then the third-world foreign workers who come here and build this nation.<br><br>Her views are not really that different from some white racists in the US who view the black man as a being that is inherently sexually deviant and dangerous. The difference is that she's pushing it in a local context, against a group which has little recourse to speak up for itself.<br><br>What we see here is that she's taken a social issue, and exploited it to further her own opinions that are quite frankly... nonsense and rubbish. It is indeed a sad thing that MediaCorp has chosen such a person to entertain the masses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So for those of you who don't want xiaxue to be on TV, write to mediacorp, every complaint counts. Here are the email addresses again:<br><br>local5@mediacorptv.com<br>editor@mediacorptv.com<br><br>We should learn from our counterparts in the UK, they really took a stand in what they believe in and they really put words in ACTION. First, they bombarded channel 4 with complaints for doing nothing about the racially motivated bullying, then they got rid of Jade and finally one of her commercial contracts has been affected; they stopped making the perfume she was promoting. Now jade is on a 'clean up' campaign to try to save her public image from being ruined completely. She even claimed that the windows of her home in Harlow, Essex has been smashed.  The police, however, said that they had not been called to any incident at the address. This sounds like a desperate attempt by jade to get public sympathy.<br>Hmmm...doesn't that sound like someone we know as well?<br><br>You can check out the news on jade at:<br><br>http://entertainment.uk.msn.com/news/Article.aspx?cp-documentid=2597710</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry excuses of the "But everyone is innately racist" variety is silly as it is stupid. Of course every damn fool has some measure of that. The problem then is to paint the whole community as a bunch of molesters and what not that is unbecoming of any decent human.<br><br>Don't confuse personal preference with objective disdain and dislike. The Nazis were keen to spout nonsense similar to what she spouted out, calling the Jews robbers etc. etc. etc. I suppose you like to find company with these bigots?</div>

How many of you will truely stand up and say out loud that there is not a hint of racism in you? How many? Man or Woman? Examine yourself sincerely. I can tell you --- there is none.<br><br>We can all smile and say nice things to each other, race etc. But deep down inside, in the lifetime we spend on this earth, we would have been cursing and swearing about the other race or nationality countless times.<br><br>The reason we don't admit what we say or do as being racist, is because we packaged it to look neutral --- nice and sweet, no heart feelings. That sort of packaging, so we don't have to feel that we are racist.<br><br>XX speaks out her mind, she may be immature. She may not have understood the meaning of self-restraint. Therefore, she sticks out like a sore thumb.<br><br>I am very sure that if we are put in a terrible spot like what she have experienced, we will be openly racist throughout our lifespan. No doubt about it.<br><br>The reason we don't become openly racist, is we did not ecounter a terrible experience like she did. But deep down inside us, we sure are racist. It's a natural phenomenom.

            <div class='col-md body'>So does having racist feelings mean that it is alright for us to go out and belittle people of other races?<br><br>Does it mean we never try to look beyond them and see other people as real human beings with rights as well?<br><br>Does it mean that it's okay to use previous bad experiences with people and tie it to their colour?<br><br>The answer to all of them is no. The question is not if we are racist, it is what we choose to do with it. Wendy Cheng is certainly doing the wrong thing about it.<br><br>If you have a tooth decay do you eat more candy and say it's okay because everyone has some degree of tooth decay? Or do you brush your teeth more and visit the dentist?<br><br><blockquote>I am very sure that if we are put in a terrible spot like what she have experienced, we will be openly racist throughout our lifespan. No doubt about it. </blockquote>I would doubt that. The need to tie colour to bad experiences is still a matter of choice. That said, if the same crime was done to you by a person of the same race, would you suddenly go about disliking your own race?<br><br>The race issue is often drawn in because it's an easy way to define your attacker by... but is it rational? Is it justified? Certainly not.<br><br>So if what she is doing is not rational or justified... why are some of us trying to defend it as it could be rationally justified here? More importantly, why are some thinking that her "excuses" are valid? It's not any more valid then pulling a shooting a person of a different race and saying that due to my previous bad experience with that race, my actions are understandable.<br><br>Oh, we understand her actions... and we certainly reject them outright.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, I dont read her blog (I dont really read blogs).

Xia Xue as a celebrity blogger<br><br>Personally I felt the word "racist" is a bit too strong here. I agree that we have our own bias. Like most of us prefer prettier ladies than a plain looking one.<br><br>I felt naturally we will like to mix around with people with demographic group closer to us or demographic group that we want to be in. However, I don't think that put us to any ground that we are racist.  I don't dislike Malay or Indian although most of my friends are chinese.<br><br>As for her being a celebrity blogger, personally I have no comment on that. One thing for sure I didn't put her there and I am not interested about her anyway. Whether she is glamour today or damned tomorrow, I don't care.<br><br>However for anyone who want to be famous, what you can do is blog against everything she blog. If you can bring her down with your blogging and the so call "online bullying" I bet you can be the next Asia Blogger Award achiever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
