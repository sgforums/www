She should have phrased her sentences more accurately and refer to her molesters as 'the molesters who happen to be of *blank* race. '' That is the correct way of making a personal, non-judgemental remark. But instead she chose to say it in an imflammatory racist way, so she deserves to be criticized for those remarks.</div>

She's young. She's one of those who think that Singaporean men must stink etc. etc. etc. and that her entire existence is meaningless but must be satiated with silly indulgences.<br><br>Fact of the matter is that at the end of the day, what matters is whether you can bring in the dough.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not to mention Borat is actually a satire on the racists attitudes in soceity, showing it out to be how ridiculus in truth when played out to their logical extreme.<br><br>Xiaxue on the other hand, is more or less whitewashing and trying to sweep latent racisim under the rug at best, and at worst actively encouraging us to pay heed to these instincts.<br><br>The difference is this, it is true that everybody is predisposed towards racism and that it is a natural instinct to be suspicious of anybody who is different from what you are used to.<br><br>The difference is what you do with this instinct. Do you reconize it for what it is and go out to find the truth about the issue or do you let yourself be run by these instincts because they are only "natural".<br><br>Do we simply say "I'll trust any darkie less then any whitie and that's that because it's the way I feel" or do we go on and say "my instinctive feelings aside, I want to make the effort to find out the truth behind these individuals to see who is more worthly of my trust."?<br><br>What Xiaxue is saying is like all of us have anger in us, and being angry justifies most of the things we say and do while in that state. Rubbish, a person who is angry still has the choice to obey his anger or not, just as a person who has his own instinctive feelings about other races should obey these feelings or not.<br><br>Why should race play into the equation? If she's molested by a Ah Peh does she say that all old men are inherently lecherous? Frankly she should get off her soapbox before she's forced to eat her own words one fine day.</div>
