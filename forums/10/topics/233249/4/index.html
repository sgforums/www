Xiaxue is probably grinning away because she knows that there is not enough  proof  for her to be charged under the sedition act. So the next course of action would be to complain to the network that is currently employing her.<br><br>I think some of her critics have already questioned how she would be able to tell the difference between the different races within different nationalities.

            <div class='col-md body'>I've said it before and I have to say it again, because some people still continue to <strong>justify</strong> that it is <strong>''alright to have racist thoughts''.</strong><br><br>it is very easy and convenient to 'blame' one's inherent nature for their racist behaviour. Some people will argue that their racist thoughts are at an unconscious level, thus they can't help how they feel about it and because of that, they believe that everyone has got a little bit of racist nature in themselves.<br><br>Human beings have the ability to think with logic, a sense of morals and have many other factors that influence their behaviour. To say that people can't help but follow their natural instincts is like comparing people to animals, so basically what <strong>xiaxue is saying is that human beings have the same level of thinking as animals.</strong><br><br>Some people will also say that it's alright to have racist thoughts because they've had bad personal experiences before. To me, this is a lazy way of thinking because it is always so easy to assign blame to a particular race rather than to think about it in a more reasonable and logical fashion. Instead of criticizing the offending behaviour, they choose to pick on the race of the alleged offender instead.<br><br>I'll give you an example of what I've experienced. Currently where I'm staying, during peak holiday season, there's a lot of middle eastern tourists. Sometimes some of these groups of tourist annoy me because they don't have proper ettiquette when it comes to using the lift. Some of these groups can be very noisy in the hallway as well.<br><br>I was annoyed by their behaviour, but do I consider myself as a racist?<br>No.<br><br>Do I have racist thoughts about these people?<br>No, I don't approve of their behaviour but that doesn't mean that I don't approve of them as a 'race'.<br><br>Even if the tiniest amount of racist thoughts starts brewing in my head, does that make me a racist?<br>No, because MY COMMON SENSE TELLS ME IT IS WRONG TO HAVE SUCH THOUGHTS. I should be thinking about it in a more reasonable and non-judgemental way.<br><br>So my conclusion is that, most likely these tourists who happen to be from the middle east probably don't have much experience using the type of lifts that are in the residences. When the lift door slams right in front of my face when I try to get in, I think that they (when i say 'they', I am talking about the person/s who commited the act not the race) lack awareness of others who want to get into the lift as well, and they may lack some social skills in that area, probably, their culture, background and education has got some degree of influence on their behaviour. BOTTOM LINE IS, I don't blame their race, if I want to blame anyone, I'd rather blame the individual or group of people who committed the offensive behaviour.</div>

This is a very grey area which is being debated on until today. However, most people did complain there were elements of bullying, which were either racially motivated or due to ignorance, which instigated the racist remarks; and yes, there is some element of racism involved in both reasons.

Since you are quite brilliant in psychology, you would know when someone 'googles' racism, one the first few searches that pops up is under wiki. So it is quite likely that the person would look it up under wiki, unless the person happens to be anti-wiki, like you. And yes, most people reading wiki will know that it is a compiled by many sources but it should not mean that the info should be discredited straight away. Wiki should only be a starting point, and if people are really interested, they can go to a  library and get more books on the subject. sorry, that I AM NOT SO DETAILED ABOUT THE SOURCE, unless you noticed, most of the readers here are ordinary people, i can't say for sure whether  some have studied philosophy or not, but I don't think it's nice to be condescending towards them when I'm writing my comments.<br><br>And since you study philosophy, why don't you give your views of racism and tell us from your philosophical point of view whether racism is right or wrong or in between? Why don't you tell us how natural law relates to racism, biasness, critics, favourtism, self centredness. I haven't studied philosophy, but i know someone who does, and he's not here at the moment, but when he gets back, I will ask him.<br><br>One more thing, sorry that us ordinary people are not talking about this subject from a philosophical point of view and I really don't think that just because we don't study philosophy, we can't understand racism from a lower level of thinking and analysis. Well, i do hope that you can enlighten us.</div>
