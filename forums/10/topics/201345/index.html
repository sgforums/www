            <div class='col-md body'>Weekend, July 22, 2006<br>Elderly man arrested for hitting MP<br>AN elderly man was arrested for punching Member of Parliament Seng Han Thong on Thursday evening and leaving him with a bruised lip.<br>.<br>The punch came during Mr Seng's meet-the-people session, when the Chinese man Â— a former taxi driver Â— came to seek the Yio Chu Kang MP's help to reinstate his terminated taxi contract.<br>.<br>When it was his turn to see the MP, he reportedly raised his voice at Mr Seng and stunned those present by hitting him.<br>.<br>In a statement, the police said it received a call for assistance at about 9.35pm on Thursday. And when its officers arrived, the staff at Ang Mo Kio's Community &amp; Education Centre Â— where the session was conducted Â— had already detained the man, who is in his 70s.<br>.<br>Mr Seng had "suffered a bruised lip and had declined medical attention", the police added. The man, who was arrested for assaulting a public servant, cannot be named as the case is under investigation.<br>.<br>Today understands that the 74-year-old man, who is currently out on bail, was formerly a taxi driver with ComfortDelGro and was unhappy with the company for terminating his contract.<br>.<br>When contacted, ComfortDelGro spokesperson Tammy Tan confirmed that the man's contract was terminated in February 2002 for "rude behaviour and for a threat made against a customer".<br>.<br>Said Ms Tan: "As (he) is no longer a hirer with the company, we are not able to go into details about the case. We however stand by our decision to terminate him based on the threats he made to the customer in a letter he wrote."<br>.<br>On the assault, Ms Tan added: "The police is currently investigating the matter and we are rendering them all assistance."<br>.<br>Mr Seng is currently in Shanghai on business. When contacted, the divisonal director for the National Trades Union Congress' administration and research unit told Today that he was "all right" but declined to comment further. Nonetheless, he said that he was not unduly shaken by the assault.<br>.<br>"I continued meeting the residents until around 11pm and then went to board my flight at midnight," he added.<br>.<br>Â— Loh Chee Kong<br></div>
