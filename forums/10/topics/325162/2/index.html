              <p>Regarding the issue of whether its recognised in s'pore,
              there is no reason not to its because i know that
              defintely there are civil servants who studied in Aus uni working
              in civil service. There are no official figures on this
              to the best of my knowledge but i know they are
              surely taking. I think these graduates are from the top tier
              Unis or Group of 8</p>

              <p>Population size matters.....if ur population is small....then too many uni will definitely lower the qualities of graduates.....unless those private uni can operate with small number of elite students...which I think not....they only wanted profit.....give ppl the degree they want in exchange for money....which is especially so in msia...KL with lots of australian private sch of mediocre quality...</p>

              <p>this are world reowned universities my friend...And they have been longer than our own NUS and NTU.</p>
              <p>Btw anyone thinking our education system is unique to us  only are wrong as its obviously modelled after US/UK/AUS.</p>
              <p>many of the world's  nobel prize winners did not graduate from NUS and NTU, They graduated from their own Unis. So do that make them any less intelligent?  On the other hand, those who graduated from NUS and NTU , did they win any nobel prizes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Bil gates were to apply for NUS and NTU 20 years ago, when he was a school drop put, he would have been rejected straighaway since he was a school leaver..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the reason why i oppose the idea of a meritocracy based system. its a flawed logic. It does not measure a person;s ability or it is doing so in a narrow view...</p>

              <p>before making such a sweeping statement, pls think carefully how this situation arose. its because there is so much Competition to local Unis and too many applications + demand from international students + such small country. There are simply not enough places and merit system has been put inmto place. Anlysing this system of course there will be those who have better merits getting into them than others and this causes a "merit based selection criteria"  resulting in butterfly effect scenarios  like "those who cannot make it into uni" ....  I wish to highlight to u that those who cannot make into our local unis have graduated first class in foreign unis too... So are they considered "lousy" in the first place since they cant make it into our local unis...</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">the whole scenario is similar to car and CEO</span> where those who can afford it can get to drive in singapore. But that doesnt mean those who cant afford COE are not good drivers or lousy since they cant get a car.</p>

              <p>I already told u its not too many Uni, its the Unis themselves and their quality.   Ultimately its your final grades which matter</p>

              <p>Yes, this may happen especially with foreign Unis operating in singapore because they are not governed by their own countries. In Aus these are governed by the governmnt and and there certain criterias to be ful filled for the locals if they want to go to Uni.</p>
              <p>But i am sure our Govt is not an idiot, they are mostly letting in well known established reliable Unis like Adelaide, RMIT ect and not any others. the reason they may increase their admission places are due to demand</p>

              <p>    As I have mentioned earlier...I always used the word "generally". How many ppl actually constitute ur claim in the red line I have high lighted?? Those are singularities!!! I did not say to totally disallow foreign unis....I said there should and must have a limit. You are arguing on the basis of singularites or so called isolated case. We care about a general thread, not isolated cases!!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U still dun get it!!! In such a small countries, if there are too many unis....the standard will drop!!!</p>
              <p>U ever know guideline for grading in universities??? They go by bell curves...so those lousier uni will have more less capable students and even if u get an A in these uni....u are still overrated!!!! SO even u get a 1st class honors in such unis.....so wat???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imagine Spore having 10 or 20 unis.....wat kind of standards would be produced???? Figure it urself.....dont try to put spore in the league with Austrailer....the latter is much more populated and can afford to have many more unis.....</p>
