            <div class='col-md body'><p>SINGAPORE : The University of Adelaide plans to make its campus in Singapore its second largest within two years. By 2010, its student numbers will be doubled.<br><br>The University made this announcement at a dinner on Friday. The event was held to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its educational partnership with Ngee Ann Kongsi.<br><br>Professor John Taplin, Pro Vice-Chancellor, University of Adelaide, said: "The University has been involved in Singapore for 10 years. We have this partnership that has been operating successfully over the decade. And we think we're now ready to expand our programmes and our student numbers.<br><br>"We are based in Adelaide. We couldn't deliver the programmes in Singapore without having a partner here in Singapore that we could work with. Other Australian universities would also, I think, need a partner.<br><br>"Perhaps that's one of the lessons to be learnt from the UNSW (University of New South Wales) Asia experiment. There was no local partner and so perhaps they didn't identify some of the risks that are involved in setting up (a campus here)."<br><br>The newly-named University of Adelaide Ngee Ann is introducing new post-graduate programmes and research collaborations with Singapore. It aims to make its campus here a regional centre of excellence.<br><br>The University expects student numbers to jump from 456 to 900 by the end of next year. And it will recruit students from Singapore and other countries in the region.<br><br>Singapore is now the University's third largest source of overseas students. Most of them study in Singapore and this number is expected to increase substantially in the next decade.<br><br>Meanwhile, former Deputy Prime Minister Dr Tony Tan, who is the Chairman of Singapore's National Research Foundation, and an alumnus, launched the Singapore Adelaide Alumni Fund at the dinner.<br><br>The money will go to undergraduates who need financial assistance. Those eligible are Singapore citizens or permanent residents who are studying full-time at the University of Adelaide.<br><br>The Ngee Ann Kongsi has agreed to match every dollar contributed, up to S$250,000.<br><br>Australia is the top destination for Singapore students heading overseas for their higher education. Australia attracts 55 percent of Singaporeans studying overseas, compared to 19 percent in the US, and 18 percent in the UK. - CNA/ms</p></div>

              <p>most people cannot afford to go to Aus to do masters anyway, i guess if they offered everything, their rates may need to compete with the local Unis. Remember tey are competing with NUS, NTU,SMU for student dollars..</p>
              <p>But i think there will be more courses...thats the only way they can maintain their presence..if else its a failed venture...</p>

              <blockquote><span style="color: #ff0000;">JCU (James Cook)</span>Singapore, which started five years ago with 50 students, soon
              faced the opposite problem of having to find a bigger site when its
              student numbers swelled to 1,200. It was occupying six floors of the
              Spring Singapore building in Bukit Merah.
              <p>It is moving to a new 18,500 sq m campus in Upper Thomson Road next
              week, offering students more and bigger teaching rooms, as well as
              sports facilities. It expects to have 3,500 students by 2012.</p>
              <p>Said Ms Sharmaine, who is looking forward to the new academic year
              in the new campus: 'Looks like UNSW had it wrong. It said Asian
              students will not want to come to Singapore to enrol in Australian
              university programmes. But look at how James Cook has grown. And there
              are other Australian universities coming in as well.'</p>
              <p>She was referring to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Curtin University of Technology</span>, which
              announced in March that it had partnered Australian education company
              Navitas to set up a campus here. The venture will be financed to the
              tune of $40 million.</p>
              <p>The Perth-based university will occupy the former Institute of
              Technical Education campus in Balestier and start offering business
              degree courses to over 1,000 students before the end of the year.</p>
              <p>It hopes to add more programmes including mass communications,
              nursing, engineering and design modules and enrol up to 5,000 students
              eventually.</p>
              <p>Another Australian institution, the<span style="color: #ff0000;"> University of Adelaide,</span> which
              operates out of Ngee Ann Kongsi's Tank Road premises, intends to double
              its intake to 900 by next year.</p>
              <p>And Perth-based <span style="color: #ff0000;">Murdoch University</span>, which has been offering degree
              programmes at the Singapore Manufacturers' Federation's (SMa) School of
              Management premises in North Bridge Road, has spent $1 million to set
              up an international study centre there.</p>
              <p>It said the number of Singaporeans doing its degree courses here has
              increased sharply from just 22 in 2004 to more than 1,000 and it plans
              to double this by the end of next year.</p>

              <p>Too many University destropy the quality of graduates. We must limit the number of graduates so that only students of good calibre can get into university. Otherwise , we will be like Phillipine, with lots of useless graduates that no companies want to employ.</p>

              <p><br> yes it should be, if its not, then wat is the purpose of offering it in singapore? Remember such a move to let in foreign uni to set up campus here benefits in some way for the govt as well, and these foreign uni are also attracting international students in the asian region as well. These unis are trying to make money i think becuase of the current aus i suspect less and less people are coming to study in AUS due to the notorious high costs in doing the courses in Aus. This is due to the labour costs in Aus and the tons of  work legislations, protectionism of locals study rights which have caused high fees to be implemented in AUS for international students.</p>
              <p>if i was not wrong, there was a news on the net stating os full fee paying places to be removed in commonwealth unis and if this happens, these unis will lose $$$.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regarding the issue of whether its recognised in s'pore, there is no reason not to its because i know that defintely there are civil servants who studied in Aus uni working in civil service. There are no official figures on this to the best of my knowledge but i know they are surely taking. I think these graduates are from the top tier Unis or Group of 8</p>

              <p>Too many graudates who cannot find jobs will destroy the Uni market but i don think it will destroy the quality of graudates. I dont understand how u can say <span style="color: #800000;">Too many University</span> destropy the quality of graduates But top quality Unis like Adelaide and Curtin will not. They have always maintained a world reowned presence.</p>
              <p>as always its proper legislation, admission criterias and teaching quality which will matter, not how many Unis.</p>
