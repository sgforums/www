The Republic is now ranked 147th out of 167 countries, three rungs lower than last year, making it the lowest ranked developed country when it comes to press freedom. Malaysia is ranked 122nd while Indonesia is 117th.<br><br>RSF described The Straits Times as practising "systematic self-censorship in its domestic reporting" while noting that Today and Streats published independent commentaries on the domestic situation more often.

When less mature people have no causes for demonstrations or rallies, they will go home to watch TVs. Cap information for more years, problems locked up will grow larger. That is where the fear of spillover to street demonstration will arise. Leaders must have a clear mind to see the cause-effect relationship between 2-way communication and press control. PM Lee wants to build an all-inclusive society, he should understand this point and not hold back horse at mid-field. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

As for Taiwan, even though they have one of the most liberal press in asia, the ironic thing is that in recent years many Taiwanese have decided that china is a better place and are emigrating there in large numbers.

            <div class='col-md body'>I want Singapore to have more press freedom. As it is, even comic strip writers face censorship. Colin Goh is one fine example. In the 'Legends of Tumasix' series in his 'Concrete Jungle' strips in the New Paper, he was forced to make all manner of last minute changes for supposedly being 'politically incorrect' in his jokes. For example, he was forced to call a tithe collector 'Moneyix' instead of his proposed 'Geeastix'.<br><br>Come on.... even jokes about GST are not allowed?<br><br>At the same time, I think that some Singaporeans are simply too squemish and narrow-minded to allow for further media liberalisation. For example, the radio DJ Sheikh Haikel was sacked after a radio listener complained him making a lewd joke about girls' underwear. While the joke was in bad taste, surely it doesn't necessarily merit a sacking? That was nothing compared to the American radio 'shock jock' Howard Stern, who would do all sorts of risque things like interview guests in the buff and so on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is clearly a lot of dissatisfaction with the state of press freedom here although most ppl try not to think about it too much. The perception is that our press/media does not match our aspiration for first world status and our long term goal of making Spore a place to be proud of.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>It would be an understatement to say that most forumers agree there is plenty of room for press reform. Hence, it may be useful to discuss what model should Spore adopt, should there be movement for press reform.<br><br>Many countries have adopted an independent Press Council model with a Press Ombudsman to self-regulate and deal with complaints. Would this system work for Spore, given our diverse and different ethnic, religious and social groups? Any views or suggestions?</div>
