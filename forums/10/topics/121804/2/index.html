The perception is that our press/media does not match our aspiration for first world status and our long term goal of making Spore a place to be proud of.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>It would be an understatement to say that most forumers agree there is plenty of room for press reform. Hence, it may be useful to discuss what model should Spore adopt, should there be movement for press reform.<br><br>Many countries have adopted an independent Press Council model with a Press Ombudsman to self-regulate and deal with complaints. Would this system work for Spore, given our diverse and different ethnic, religious and social groups? Any views or suggestions?</div></blockquote>suntze,<br><br>I'm sure it would work, though perhaps one might wish to have a committee of ombudsmen to ensure that no social discrimination takes place with the dealing of complaints. But seriously, I don't find much ground for the case on diverse ethnicity and religion affecting the institution of an independent and responsible press. the key is to ensure that the press is responsible. And responsiblity has no relation whatsoever to whether or not a press is independent or not. After all, irresponsible government-controlled presses have also resulted in casualties of ethnicities and religion eg. the presses in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s or in Bosnia-Herzervsgonia in the 1990s. These were irresponsible becasue they did not bother about objectivity, the former about the Jews, the latter about Muslims.<br><br>ya, that's all. So I still think that the Independent Press COuncil would still work.<br><br>the pikamaster</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with Singapore is that we are treading deeper into a pit where objectivism does not exist anymore and whatever counts , is made up of a few vested interests that unfortunately, is not very matured and open in thought.A simple issue like pornographic manga is small talk around the world, but only in this straitjacketed island, it can make such headlines.<br><br>What does this tell you about the silent majority?Puerile, thin-skinned, lacking in ability to think for themselves, and just merely making a decision without thinking of the consequences down the road.<br><br>We cannot to make the wrong choices here.Our society is on the verge of adulthood, and whatever we make of this place will determine the destiny.From what I've seen, we have a minority of people that is growing in strength.<br>These people are those that see beyond the shallow crap that is fed to us and they are able to look and think critically and not toe the official line for the sake of it.<br><br>Then there are the current majority who has not the inkling that the wool is still pulled over their eyes and they will support the government line faithfully because they are afraid to rock the boat.These are the unfortunate recipients of initial goodwill and economic success, and they feel that we should not change, because life is good enough.When society has reached a stage where there is a lack of drive to move up the ladder, stagnancy is like a quicksand.Where we will sink into obscurity and I for one would not want to see us slide into irrelevance.This is the same majority that worships pragmatism blindly and will welcome a casino in spite of the economic and social costs.<br><br>We need a paradigm shift, a more inclusive and less panicky society.We deserve to build a better nation for our children to grow up.They cannot grow up in a place where they are told what is allowed or banned just because they are Singaporeans.Our citizenship is supposed to be a symbol of pride, not a badge of shame where the very mention draws sympathy and derision because we are infamous for silly and juvenile policies that stay alongside equally successful and brilliant ones.<br><br>The nation needs to wake up.The train of progress waits for no one, and we cannot let a musty old conductor determine whether we can board the train.Our citizenship is our ticket to doing our part to build a society of one.A melting pot where race,religion, nor thought and affiliation is a barrier to success.<br><br>Let the mind breathe, for a suffocated brain will lead to a dying heart.</div>

The solution actually can be very simple. It is all in the mind. Perceive everything as problems there will be problems. Practise good corporate governance and many so-called problems will be solved or disappear.<br><br>In introducing more policies or price increases : ask: hey this is pro-party, pro-surplus but is it good for majority of Singaporeans and businesses?<br><br>Is the cup Half-empty or half-full when it is filled half with water. By perceiving more problems, and threats, and giving legalistic and bureaucratic replies or look-good presentations will the problems be solved? More preemptive measures, more actions and people will have to bear with more control freaks with slightest jolts perceived as rocking of the boats.<br><br>Many years ago, the worries were "no surplus". When surpluses were accumulated to the extent of almost obsene, getting people to pay for lands and charging them again for flats built at market prices. People are struggling to live yet ministers will say GDPs show good figures and no worries with economy.The surpluses were meant for long-drawn raining days but not in recent heavy downpours. So how to believe in surpluses. Solution to "rock the boat" paranoid problems - be objective, and practise good accountable good corporate governance.<br><br>Government knows how to ask for more declarations of insider trading, more disclosures to businesses and public listed companies. It should ask itself to start some forms of good corporate governance for progress. How to let go and be less self-righteousness is a wonder. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
