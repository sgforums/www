In fact, if you ask any youth, he'll say that he knows at least one homosexual friend," says another youth.<br><br>"There is gap between me, the way I think and the way youths in Singapore think. But I'm not surprised because they are under so much more different influences than what I went through. They've got 100 movie channels and they've got the Internet," says V Maheantharan, director of School of Business at Singapore Polytechnic.<br><br>46 percent of youths are on the Internet for five hours or more a day, and 56 percent say they are not bothered by copyright issues related to downloading movies off the Internet.<br><br>40 percent of respondents also blog and 48 percent share original content, for example, artwork, stories and videos.<br><br>12 percent say they don't go to the cinema as often because they are downloading movies off the internet.<br><br>When it comes to money and career, half of the respondents say that remuneration is the most important factor when choosing a job, and 47 percent aspire to be an entrepreneur.<br><br>Youths also say that the three things most important to them are family, freedom and health. - CNA /ls  </blockquote></div>

What is the average age of a SG to get married? 30 years old?<br><br>Heck man...if we are "suppose" to have sex after marriage then there would be a lot of 30 yr old virgins liao..<br><br>This is really brainless reporting..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>recently on tv, there was a show dedicated to the topic on youths and underage sex. in japan, it's illegal to have sex below 18, but that's beside the point. no one gets arrested for having underage sex. the issue was that kids are starting to screw each other everyday at a younger age, and are being more and more promiscuous.<br><br>the moral of the show, wasn't about not having sex, it was about waiting for your body to be ready before having sex, and also to have the proper mindset about it. although technically, girls can start enjoying sex around 12, they aren't physically developed till around 16.<br><br>doing it too early will damage the vagina. become pregnant at that age will make it worse, the linings of the womb aren't suitable for childbirth yet. having an abortion will weaken it and they'll be having problems with having a child in the future.<br><br>i wonder how many more years before such a show can even be seen in singapore.</div>
