              <p> </p>
              <p>The last line of the Singapore Armed Forces pledge states that all of us servicemen, active or otherwise, should be prepared to defend Singapore (cue shout) “with our lives!”.</p>
              <p>Indeed, this has manifested itself very literally and very unfortunately in several instances, and mishap, understandable in the struggle to balance realism with safety, has caused many soldiers to lose their lives while in active service to the nation.</p>
              <p>The latest case of death in the SAF surrounds recruit Andrew Cheah Wei Siong who, during a 2 kilometer walking exercise at Pulau Tekong’s BMTC on Tuesday morning, collapsed and was later pronounced dead at the Singapore General Hospital where he was evacuated to.</p>

              <p>Btw, there are statistics on average lifespan. Do you think those 'isolated cases' will affect the general average?</p>

              <p>I think we have to side the the truth in here, and not let wishful thinking distort the true picture.</p>
              <p>Average life expectancy does not mean that 100 percent of the people will get to that age and then drop dead, in reality there is actually a rather wide range of ages in which people live to and then die that forms up the data we have.</p>
              <p>What this means is that we actually have quite a lot of people who die before and after the expected age when the data is all collected, we have to look at the entire sample range, but what his also means that in general, you are more or less expected to live up to that age in this country.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day we have to be objective, we cannot accuse others of using dodgy methods to make their arguments and then resort to dodgy arguments ourselves, this is a lionnoisy style of intellectual dishonesty.</p>
              <p>BTW the recruit died during a 2km walk, I am not sure what really could have been done in that case, given a 2km walk is about the most basic of basic trainings that one can have. It's sad, but certainly NOT a case of tough training.</p>
              <p>Thing is, not all deaths in NS should be attributed to NS, in my time several people did indeed die, some from NS-related causes and others simply because they happened to die during their NS.</p>

              <p>The thing is, as tragic as dying young is... it still can and will happen in our population of over 4 million. That is over 4 thousand thousand people. We have, if I remember correctly, over 3000 deaths a year in our population.</p>
              <p>Of those 3000 deaths the average ought to be that of the expected lifespan, however beyond that there will be those that die really young and really old, even if it was 10 percent of the sample, you are talking 300 people, certainly more then enough news to fill our newspapers.</p>

              <p><strong>S'pore doctor dies at Melbourne ice-skating rink</strong>  <br>She had spent 'quality time' with family before death <br>By Ng Wan Ching <br> <br>June 13, 2008       <br><br>A YOUNG Singaporean doctor collapsed and died on 6 Jun in Melbourne.</p>
              <p>Dr Nishal Kaur Bhullar, 25, was ice-skating with some friends. When she went to the side of the rink for a rest, she collapsed.</p>
              <p>Her father, Dr Pritam Singh, a well-known gynaecologist and gynaecologic oncologist here, told The New Paper that, so far, the pathologist could not tell the family why his daughter died.</p>
              <p> <br>Dr Bhullar, who graduated from the University of Melbourne one-and-a-half years ago, had been working as a medical officer at the Western Hospital in Footscray, a suburb 20 minutes west of Melbourne.</p>
              <p>Said her sister, Miss Shireen Kaur Bhullar, 20, who is studying for an arts degree in the same university: 'She loved her job. She had always wanted to be a doctor. She was inspired by our father.'</p>
              <p>The sisters were very close.</p>
              <p>Miss Bhullar, who is in her second year of university, lived five minutes away from her sister in the Parkville suburb.</p>
              <p>Both sisters had attended CHIJ. Dr Bhullar went on to Victoria Junior College before going to Melbourne for her medical degree.</p>
              <p>Miss Bhullar left Singapore after her O levels to study first in Adelaide and then in Melbourne.</p>
              <p>'During the years when we lived apart, we used to rack up huge phone bills. We would call each other three to four times a week and talk for an hour each time,' she said.</p>
              <p>She got a call from her sister's friends on Friday night saying that Dr Bhullar had collapsed.</p>
              <p>'They asked me for the telephone numbers of my parents and aunt who lives in Melbourne and asked if it would be all right for them to call. I said 'yes'. Then they told me to go straight to the hospital,' she said.</p>
              <p>An ambulance had sent her sister to the Royal Melbourne Hospital.</p>
              <p>When she got to the hospital, her aunt, who is her mother's elder sister, was already there.</p>
              <p>'They called at about 8pm. I was with a friend and I just dropped everything and rushed to the hospital. By the time I got there, she had passed away,' she said, sounding calm.</p>
              <p>One thing that gives her and her family some peace is that Dr Bhullar had spent a lot of quality time with their parents before she died.</p>
              <p>Early last month, she surprised her parents with a visit home for 10 days.</p>
              <p>'She had asked me if I wanted to go with her, but I couldn't as I had study commitments,' said Miss Bhullar.</p>
              <p>During the trip home, her sister went with her parents for a cousin's engagement in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>MET RELATIVES</p>
              <p>'It was a two-day trip and she managed to meet up with a lot of our relatives,' said Miss Bhullar.</p>
              <p>Then in the later part of May, their parents visited Melbourne.</p>
              <p>'My mother stayed for two weeks and my father came for a week,' said Miss Bhullar.</p>
              <p>Dr Singh, who appeared calm during the wake for his daughter last night, said: 'My daughter had zero health issues. She was healthy and fine until the day she collapsed. She was a very special girl.'</p>
              <p>At an earlier memorial service, Miss Bhullar was struck by how many people thought her sister was special.</p>
              <p>'They said she always had a smile on her face, was fun-loving, always lent a hand to someone in need. My sister had this ability to be very welcoming to people. She had the gift of understanding,' she said.</p>
              <p>Many people turned up at the wake in the family home in Upper Bukit Timah last night.</p>
              <p>Said Miss Bhullar: 'My sister was a much loved person. And we will get through this.' <br> <br> </p>

              Lee Kuan Yew is old (85 years).
              
              It is rare for an old person to change his lifelong habits and mentality.
              
              So, for Lee Kuan Yew to repent his deeds is not easy.
              
              Lee Kuan Yew is also quite stuborn.
              
              The best that I hope from Lee Kuan Yew is that he can die quickly.
