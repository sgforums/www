              <p>Coronary heart disease is believed to have been the cause of death.<br> <br>There were no warning signs before Mr Yussof, a technician in PSA Corporation, collapsed at 7pm on Wednesday while playing football with his team-mates from PSA Club.</p>
              <p>They were playing on the club grounds at Bukit Chermin near Telok Blangah.</p>
              <p>Mr Yussof's wife, sales and marketing officer Masiah Joony, 43, was at their five-room flat in Jurong West when she heard the news.</p>
              <p>She said: 'My husband's friend called me just after 7pm and told me to go to Alexandra Hospital (AH). My youngest daughter was with me at the time but I left her</p>

              <p>'When I reached AH, the doctors were trying to revive him but they told me they were not optimistic. After I learned that he had died, I called my children and told them to meet me at AH.'</p>
              <p>Mr Yussof had been with PSA since 1982.</p>
              <p>His death was a shock as he loved sports and had no known health problems, save for an inflamed right knee and a swollen palm.</p>
              <p>He had also undergone an operation to remove gallstones in 2005.</p>
              <p>However, Madam Masiah said her mother-in-law died of heart disease at the age of 56, and two of her husband's uncles died of the same disease in their 50s or 60s.</p>

              <p>Madam Masiah said that, with few exceptions, her husband played football every Wednesday after work.</p>
              <p>She said: 'He'd finish work an hour earlier, then change into his football gear and head for the PSA Club. After the game, he'd change and then pray before chatting with his friends and then head for home.'</p>
              <p>Her eldest child, Miss Nurul Taqiah, 18, said her father was a fan of Manchester United football club and had dreamt of visiting their home ground at Old Trafford.</p>

              <p>Miss Nurul Taqiah, who will begin studying Arts and Social Sciences at the National University of Singapore in August, said her greatest regret was that her father would not be around to see her graduate.</p>

              <p>Tat guy prob had some inherited heart problems?,... But anyway singpapore is getting more competitive with more FTs and no "clutch" to the "handicapped" singaporens, we can only expect more deaths from cardio related diseases...</p>
              <p>Maybe more people are able to live up to longer age, but at the same time, more are dying from stress related heart problems as well.</p>

              <p>Hyperfocal, to be fair... you shouldn't take single cases here and there to prove the point about population age...</p>
              <p>1000 cases out of 4 million is still too small a percentage.</p>
              <p>Even then, I still don't believe Singaporeans are living way longer than 85 years old. Supposed it is 87 yrs old (unlikely), it's impossible to believe that the govt who advocates kindness and filial piety to old folks (to schoolchildren) cannot even take the first step to support old folks for that extra 1 or 2 years of lifespan, but instead, require them to buy annuity.</p>
