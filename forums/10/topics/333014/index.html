              <p><strong> One
                  in three people living here today was born outside Singapore. These
                  foreign-born folk include new citizens, permanent residents, foreign
                  workers and students. With their numbers rising fast, Insight addresses
                  some of your burning questions on the population shifts. </strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>By Li Xue Ying</em></strong></p>
              <p>HERE are now a total of 4.84million people living in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Of these, 35per cent are foreign-born.</p>
              <p><strong>1 Who are they?</strong></p>
              <p>They fall into three groups: new citizens, permanent residents (PRs) and non-residents.</p>
              <p>In the first six months of this year, Singapore granted
                  citizenship to 9,619 foreigners. The total number of new citizens since
                  2001 is 81,553.</p>
              <p>There are 478,200 PRs here.</p>
              <p>So, what are these new citizens and PRs like?</p>
              <p>Figures just released by the National Population Secretariat
                  (NPS) indicate that they tend to be better-educated than born-and-bred
                  Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Take those granted PR and citizenship this year, for example:
                  77per cent of the new PRs and 62per cent of the new citizens aged 20
                  and above have post-secondary education. The corresponding figure for
                  existing Singapore citizens is 36per cent.</p>
              <p>While declining to give a breakdown of where these new
                  residents hail from, the NPS says most are from South-east, South and
                  East Asia. A smaller number are from the Americas, Oceania and Europe.</p>
              <p>Public data shows that the number of new immigrants from
                  South Asia is so significant that it has caused a shift in the ethnic
                  make-up of the population.</p>
              <p>Ethnic Indians now comprise 8.9per cent of the resident
                  population, which is made up of both citizens and PRs, up from 7.1per
                  cent in 1990.</p>
              <p>The bulk of foreigners here are non-residents. Their numbers have risen to 1.2million - an all-time high.</p>
              <p>Within this pool, there are two groups.</p>
              <p>The first is here on a transient basis. This group is made up
                  of work permit holders here to work as construction workers and maids.
                  As of December last year, there were 757,000 work permit holders.</p>
              <p>The second group of people are regarded as potential PRs and
                  new citizens. There are 143,000 such foreigners here on employment
                  passes and another 85,000 foreign students.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>2 Has it become easier to obtain citizenship or permanent residency? </strong></p>
              <p><strong>3 Do we really need immigrants? What if we close the door on them? </strong></p>

              <p><em>Source: The Straits Times</em></p>
              <p><strong>2 Has it become easier to obtain citizenship or permanent residency? </strong></p>
              <p>WITH the number of PRs and new citizens on the rise, the NPS says
              it is understandable that some people believe it has become easier to
              secure a red passport. But it stresses that the criteria are 'no less
              stringent' than before.</p>
              <p>New residents are admitted on the basis of educational
              qualifications, their immediate and potential economic contributions
              and how well they and their family are likely to integrate into
              Singapore society.</p>
              <p>The last factor is assessed on the basis of the applicant's
              length of stay here, the language he speaks, the culture he is from,
              whether or not he has family members here, and his contributions to
              society here. That would include his participation in grassroots and
              community work.</p>
              <p>As Singaporeans become better educated, the NPS said, via
              e-mail, 'more will be expected of potential immigrants who wish to
              apply for PR and citizenship'.</p>
              <p>It declined to give details on the number of applications and the success rate.</p>
              <p>Ms Ragini Dhanvantray, managing director of Rikvin Consultancy,
              which helps facilitate immigration here, observes that the time it
              takes to obtain permanent residency has fallen.</p>
              <p>'In the past, employment pass holders would apply for permanent residency only after working here for two years.</p>
              <p>'Now, they can apply after just six months - and about 60 to 70per cent will get it,' she says.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>3 Do we really need immigrants? What if we close the door on them? </strong></p>
              <p>IF SINGAPORE stopped accepting immigrants right now, deaths among
              citizens and PRs would overtake births in 12 years, says veteran
              demographer Saw Swee Hock.</p>
              <p>That is based on a projection of a total fertility rate (TFR)
              of 1.31. Demographers use TFR to project the average number of babies
              that will be born to a woman in a population.</p>
              <p>Singapore's TFR is now 1.29.</p>
              <p>That means Singapore's population will start to shrink in 2020.</p>
              <p>Even if the TFR goes up to 1.51, the population will still shrink - albeit later, in 2025.</p>
              <p>Prof Saw, the author of a book entitled Population Of Singapore
              and a professorial fellow at the Institute of the South-east Asian
              Studies, thus states emphatically: 'We need foreigners, forever and
              ever.'</p>
              <p>The need to grow Singapore's population is a function of the need to grow the economy, he notes.</p>
              <p>Singapore Management University economist Hoon Hian Teck says
              that with the growing prominence of the services sector, the shortfall
              in skilled labour has become more acute.</p>
              <p>'In addition, the economy has undergone an important shift
              from being a technology follower to one that also creates new
              technologies,' he adds.</p>
              <p>That means placing a high value on skilled researchers, both local and foreign.</p>
              <p>In an interview last year, National Population Committee
              chairman Wong Kan Seng calculated that for the economy to grow at 6per
              cent annually, Singapore needs an extra 87,300 workers each year.</p>
              <p>The NPS notes that as a country without natural resources,
              Singapore needs to depend on human capital for growth. And the global
              competition for talent is intense, it adds.</p>
              <p>'If Singapore does not welcome them, they will simply look elsewhere and compete against us.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> 4 Are there other ways to keep the economy growing? </strong></p>
              <p>YES, say some experts.</p>
              <p>One way is to increase labour productivity.</p>
              <p>A country's economic growth is the sum of two factors - the
              size of the labour force and its productivity. So higher productivity
              can compensate for a smaller labour force.</p>
              <p>Labour economist Hui Weng Tat, of the Lee Kuan Yew School of
              Public Policy, who has served as a consultant to the Manpower Ministry,
              believes that this is the most 'desirable' strategy.</p>
              <p>The share that labour productivity growth has contributed to
              Singapore's total economic growth has declined steadily over the past
              two decades.</p>
              <p>Prof Hui charted the decline in a paper he co-wrote with economist Aamir Rafique Hashmi.</p>
              <p>From 1995 to 2000, for instance, productivity growth averaged
              2.5per cent, and accounted for 39.7per cent of the gross domestic
              product (GDP) growth. That was down from 51.6per cent in the preceding
              five years.</p>
              <p>The figure was also low compared with those in other developed economies.</p>
              <p>For the same period from 1995 to 2000, productivity growth
              accounted for 60.1per cent of the United States' GDP growth, and
              102.2per cent of Japan's.</p>
              <p>Prof Hui projects that if Singapore's productivity growth can
              be boosted to account for 60per cent of GDP growth, the demand for
              foreign labour will steadily go down.</p>
              <p>According to his projections, at current productivity growth
              rates, Singapore will need 2.78million foreign workers by 2034.</p>
              <p>But if productivity were one percentage point higher, then
              Singapore would need only 1.48million foreign workers by 2034 - a
              difference of 1.3million workers.</p>
              <p>But such a productivity boost could prove 'elusive', he says,
              as it depends on many factors, from infrastructure to workforce quality
              and fiscal incentives.</p>
              <p>The NPS says that productivity improvement remains a key focus of the Government.</p>
              <p>The second way to grow the economy without increasing the
              reliance on foreign labour is by encouraging older Singaporeans to work
              longer, and more women to return to the workforce, says Prof Saw.</p>
              <p>The participation rates of both groups remain low compared with those of other countries.</p>
              <p>The government has been trying to do both, and has made some progress.</p>
              <p>But some, such as MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC Inderjit Singh,
              question if it is necessary to push so hard for growth year after year.</p>
              <p>Mr Singh, a businessman, says: 'I personally feel that we have adopted a 'grow at all costs' economic policy.</p>
              <p>'I would have preferred a more moderate growth and, therefore, a more moderate population growth.'</p>
              <p>He believes that the decision to build two integrated resorts
              in one go and a new sports hub, and expand the transport infrastructure
              in a massive way, is a case of 'trying to do too much too quickly'.</p>
              <p>Prof Hui says that in an island-state with a very high
              population density of 6,000persq km, 'it might be argued that the lower
              growth target path could in fact provide a higher standard of living in
              Singapore'.</p>
              <p>But lawyer and Hong Kah GRC MP Alvin Yeo is not so sure.</p>
              <p>'There is the concern that with a small, open economy like
              ours, which is so susceptible to external influences which are hard to
              predict, planning for very modest growth could result in substantial
              under-shooting of our targets.</p>
              <p>'But this is perhaps an issue which we need to review from time to time, as our economy, and society, matures.'</p>

              <p>We have said that the culture of a civilization is
              created in its core area originally and moves outward into peripheral
              areas which thus become part of the civilization.</p>
              <p>This movement of
              cultural elements is called "diffusion" by students of the subject. It
              is noteworthy that material elements of a culture, such as tools,
              weapons, vehicles, and such, diffuse more readily and thus more rapidly
              than do the nonmaterial elements such as ideas, art forms, religious
              outlook, or patterns of social behavior.</p>
              <p>For this reason the peripheral
              portions of a civilization (such as Assyria in Mesopotamian
              Civilization, Rome or Spain in Classical Civilization, and the United
              States or Australia in Western Civilization) tend to have a somewhat
              cruder and more material culture than the core area of the same
              civilization.</p>
              <p>     Material elements of a culture also diffuse beyond
              the boundaries of a civilization into other societies, and do so much
              more readily than the nonmaterial elements of the culture.</p>
              <p>For this
              reason the nonmaterial and spiritual elements of a culture are what
              give it its distinctive character rather than its tools and weapons
              which can be so easily exported to entirely different societies.</p>
              <p>Thus,
              the distinctive character of Western Civilization rests on its
              Christian heritage, its scientific outlook, its humanitarian elements,
              and its distinctive point of view in regard to the rights of the
              individual and respect for women rather than in such material things as
              firearms, tractors, plumbing fixtures, or skyscrapers, all of which are
              exportable commodities.</p>
              <p>     The export of material elements in a culture,
              across its peripheral areas and beyond, to the peoples of totally
              different societies has strange results.</p>
              <p>As elements of material
              culture move from core to periphery inside a civilization, they tend,
              in the long run, to strengthen the periphery at the expense of the core
              because the core is more hampered in the use of material innovations by
              the strength of past vested interests and because the core devotes a
              much greater part of its wealth and energy to nonmaterial culture.</p>
              <p>Thus, such aspects of the Industrial Revolution as automobiles and
              radios are European rather than American inventions, but have been
              developed and utilized to a far greater extent in America because this
              area was not hampered in their use by surviving elements of feudalism,
              of church domination, of rigid class distinctions (for example, in
              education), or by widespread attention to music, poetry, art, or
              religion such as we find in Europe.</p>
              <p>A similar contrast can be seen in
              Classical Civilization between Greek and Roman or in Mesopotamian
              Civilization between Sumerian and Assyrian or in Mayan Civilization
              between Mayan and Aztec.</p>
              <p>     The diffusion of culture elements beyond the
              boundaries of one society into the culture of another society presents
              quite a different case. The boundaries between societies present
              relatively little hindrance to the diffusion of material elements, and
              relatively greater hindrance to the diffusion of nonmaterial elements.</p>
              <p>Indeed, it is this fact which determines the boundary of the society,
              for, if the nonmaterial elements also diffused, the new area into which
              they flowed would be a peripheral portion of the old society rather
              than a part of a quite different society.</p>
              <p>     The diffusion of material elements from one
              society to another has a complex effect on the importing society. In
              the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">short run it is usually benefitted by the importation</span>, but in the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> long run it is frequently disorganized and weakened.</span></p>
              <p>When white men
              first came to North America, material elements from Western
              Civilization spread rapidly among the different Indian tribes.</p>
              <p>The
              Plains Indians, for example, were weak and impoverished before 1543,
              but in that year the horse began to diffuse northward from the
              Spaniards in Mexico. Within a century the Plains Indians were raised to
              a much higher standard of living (because of ability to hunt buffalo
              from horseback) and were immensely strengthened in their ability to
              resist Americans coming westward across the continent.</p>
              <p>In the meantime,
              the trans-Appalachian Indians who had been very powerful in the
              sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries began to receive firearms,
              steel traps, measles, and eventually whiskey from the French and later
              the English by way of the St. Lawrence.</p>
              <p>These greatly weakened the
              woods Indians of the trans-Appalachian area and ultimately weakened the
              Plains Indians of the trans-Mississippi area, because measles and
              whiskey were devastating and demoralizing and because the use of traps
              and guns by certain tribes made them dependent on whites for supplies
              at the same time that they allowed them to put great physical pressure
              on the more remote tribes which had not yet received guns or traps.</p>
              <p>Any
              united front of reds against whites was impossible, and the Indians
              were disrupted, demoralized, and destroyed.</p>
              <p>In general, importation of
              an element of material culture from one society to another is helpful
              to the importing society in the long run only if it is</p>
              <p>(<em>a</em>) productive,</p>
              <p>(<em>b</em>) can be made within the society itself, and</p>
              <p>(<em>c</em>)
              can be fitted into the nonmaterial culture of the importing society
              without demoralizing it.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The destructive impact of Western Civilization
              upon so many other societies rests on its ability to demoralize their
              ideological and spiritual culture as much as its ability to destroy
              them in a material sense with firearms.</span></p>
              <p>     When one society is destroyed by the impact of
              another society, the people are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> left in a debris of cultural elements
              derived from their own shattered culture as well as from the invading
              culture.</span></p>
              <p>These elements generally provide the instruments for
              fulfilling the material needs of these people, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they cannot be
              organized into a functioning society because of the lack of an ideology
              and spiritual cohesive.</span></p>
              <p>Such people either perish or are incorporated
              as individuals and small groups into some other culture, whose ideology
              they adopt for themselves and, above all, for their children.</p>
              <p>In some
              cases, however, the people left with the debris of a shattered culture
              are able to reintegrate the cultural elements into a new society and a
              new culture. They are able to do this because they obtain a new
              nonmaterial culture and thus a new ideology and morale which serve as a
              cohesive for the scattered elements of past culture they have at hand.</p>
              <p>Such a new ideology may be imported or may be indigenous, but in either
              case it becomes sufficiently integrated with the necessary elements of
              material culture to form a functioning whole and thus a new society. It
              is by some such process as this that all new societies, and thus all
              new civilizations, have been born...</p>

They are able to do this because they obtain a new nonmaterial culture and thus a new ideology and morale which serve as a cohesive for the scattered elements of past culture they have at hand.</p>
              <p>Such a new ideology may be imported or may be indigenous, but in either case it becomes sufficiently integrated with the necessary elements of material culture to form a functioning whole and thus a new society. It is by some such process as this that all new societies, and thus all new civilizations, have been born...</p>

              <p>The diffusion of material elements from one society to another has a complex effect on the importing society. In the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">short run it is usually benefitted by the importation</span>, but in the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> long run it is frequently disorganized and weakened.</span></p>
              <p>The Plains Indians, for example, were weak and impoverished
                                      before 1543, but in that year the horse began to diffuse northward
                                      from the Spaniards in Mexico. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Within a century the Plains Indians
                                      were raised to a much higher standard of living</span> (because of ability
                                      to hunt buffalo from horseback) and were immensely strengthened in
                                      their ability to resist Americans coming westward across the
                                      continent.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, the trans-Appalachian Indians who had been very
                                      powerful in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries <span style="text-decoration: underline;">began to
                                      receive firearms, steel traps, measles, and eventually whiskey</span> from
                                      the French and later the English by way of the St. Lawrence.</p>
              <p>These<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> greatly weakened the woods Indians of the
                                      trans-Appalachian area</span> and ultimately <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weakened the Plains Indians
                                      of the trans-Mississippi area</span>, because measles and whiskey were
                                      devastating and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">demoralizing</span> and because the use of traps and guns
                                      by certain tribes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">made them dependent on whites for supplies</span> at the
                                      same time that they allowed them to put great physical pressure on
                                      the more remote tribes which had not yet received guns or
                                      traps.</p>
              <p>Any united front of reds against whites was impossible, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and the
                                      Indians were disrupted, demoralized, and destroyed.</span></p>

              <p><em>They turn to MOM even as two MPs plan to raise issue in Parliament </em></p>
              <p>DOZENS of out-of-work foreign workers turned up at the Ministry of
              Manpower (MOM) yesterday, even as two politicians said they planned to
              raise in Parliament the question of how these men can enter Singapore
              with valid work permits but end up with no work.</p>
              <p>When The Straits Times visited the MOM branch office in Kim Seng
              Road yesterday morning, eight workers from a marine firm were queueing
              to 'lodge a case' against their employer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They said they had 'run away' from their Tuas dormitory to
              MOM because they heard that their bosses had planned to send them home
              to Bangladesh yesterday morning.</p>
              <p>'We heard our tickets were ready and that a lorry would come
              to pick us up at 7am,' said welder Mohd Mohsin Golam, 20, who claimed
              that he had not worked a single day since arriving here on April 24.</p>
              <p>'So we ran away at 6am.'</p>
              <p>All of them have been here for between six and eight months and worked, on average, for less than two months.</p>
              <p>They also claimed they had paid $8,000 or more to 'agents' for training, a work permit and a guaranteed job.</p>
              <p>Most of these agents, The Straits Times understands, are Bangladeshi, but live in Singapore.</p>
              <p>'Our group that came in early February had no work, but they
              still brought in more workers two months later,' said Mr Nahid Rana,
              26, who was promised a job as a pipe fitter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other groups of workers at the MOM complex yesterday said
              they were there to get updates on their complaints or to look for jobs.
              A guard on duty there said that more than 100 such workers turn up at
              the office daily.</p>
              <p>Inside the office, labourer Joynal Abedin stood in front of
              one counter telling the attending officer that he had worked for only
              two months and 17 days since arriving here on April 29.</p>
              <p>He had been paid for the days he worked, but was hoping he could complain about being denied regular work.</p>
              <p>'Can you give us special pass and help us look for another job,' he pleaded, crying.</p>
              <p>'If we are sent back, we will be deep in debt,' said the
              labourer, who was accompanied by Mr Faruk Hossain, 37, who arrived in
              Singapore on the same flight and claimed he had not worked even a day.</p>
              <p>The attending officer replied that he should go to his boss,
              rather than MOM, to ask for work. 'If you have worked but have not been
              paid, that is something you can come to us for,' she said, asking him
              to return later in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>He did, and was given a letter asking him to return today with his passport to see an 'employment inspector'.</p>
              <p>Both Mr Joynal and Mr Faruk have been drifting around Serangoon Road since leaving their dorm on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>'We will not be able to survive if we do not recover the fees
              we paid,' said Mr Joynal, showing his wallet, which contained only his
              work permit but no money.</p>
              <p>The sole breadwinner in a family of 12, he said he sold his
              bag and belt shop to pay the agent who had promised him a job in a
              shipyard which would pay about $900 a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Straits Times could not reach the employers of both sets
              of workers last evening and is therefore not naming the companies
              involved.</p>
              <p>When asked how workers with work permits could end up without
              jobs, an MOM spokesman said: 'We are checking with our colleagues for
              an update. It is unlikely that we can provide you with more details
              soon as investigations are ongoing.'</p>
              <p>Two MPs from the Government Parliamentary Committee on
              Manpower, meanwhile, have called on the Bangladesh High Commission and
              MOM to help solve the problem.</p>
              <p>Madam Halimah Yacob told The Straits Times that she had
              tabled a question in Parliament on how it was possible for manpower
              agencies to bring in foreign workers when they have no proper jobs and
              what safeguards were in place to prevent the exploitation and abuse of
              such workers.</p>
              <p>'This points to the need for more effective regulation and
              better control in the issue of work permits by MOM,' said Madam
              Halimah, adding that the Bangladesh High Commission could help by
              providing MOM with a list of 'unscrupulous agencies' that have left the
              workers 'stranded'.</p>
              <p>Her colleague from the Manpower GPC, Ms Denise Phua, agreed.
              The Bangladesh High Commission, she said, should 'also be the first
              port of call to assist their nationals'. Ms Phua, MP for Jalan Besar
              GRC, oversees Little India, where many of the workers have been living
              on the streets.</p>
              <p>She added: 'But MOM must take action against the unscrupulous
              agents based here and hold them responsible for the state of affairs
              and penalise them accordingly.'</p>
