              <p>If the PM, SM and MM, along with all the parliamentry members who're being paid exorbitant paychecks would cut down their ministerial pay into an "acceptable zone", I'm very sure everyone of the poor you saw on the video would be able to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>Sadly, this is impossible. The government obviously has <strong>NO </strong>justifyable reason for their pay. Especially when even foreigners mock at our economical and social structure.</p>

              <p class="first">SINGAPORE, Oct 10, 2008 (AFP) - Singapore has become
              the first Asian economy to fall into recession, analysts said Friday,
              after the government revised downward its full-year growth estimate and
              eased monetary policy for the first time in years.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">
              <table class="ad_slug_table" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td align="middle"><span class="ad_slug"><span style="font-family: Arial;">ADVERTISEMENT</span><br></span></td>
              </tr>

              </table>
              </div>
              <p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry lowered the city-state's
              full-year growth forecast to around three percent, citing a slowdown in
              the global economy and key domestic sectors.</p>
              <p>The move came as the ministry released preliminary data showing that
              real GDP declined by 6.3 percent in the third quarter after contracting
              5.7 percent in the previous quarter, the ministry said.</p>
              <p>While it did not describe the economy as being in recession, a
              technical recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of
              contraction in economic output.</p>
              <p>"Singapore will be the first Asia economy to fall into a technical
              recession," DBS Group Research said in an assessment of the data.</p>
              <p>In a move to confront the downturn, the Monetary Authority of
              Singapore (MAS) -- its de facto central bank -- said it was easing
              monetary policy for the first time in more than four years.</p>
              <p>"The Singapore economy has weakened over the course of 2008,
              alongside an escalation in the turmoil in financial markets and a more
              severe deceleration in global economic activity," MAS said.</p>
              <p>These developments meant new uncertainties for the Singapore
              economy, while slower Asian growth would restrain activity in a range
              of service industries such as transportation and tourism, it said.</p>
              <p>"The risks to external demand conditions continue to be on the
              downside, and a more severe global downturn cannot be discounted," the
              bank said.</p>
              <p>The MAS conducts monetary policy through the local currency rather than by setting interest rates.</p>
              <p>The Singapore dollar is traded against a basket of currencies of its
              major trading partners within an undisclosed band known as the nominal
              effective exchange rate (NEER).</p>
              <p>In its semi-annual statement, MAS said it had maintained the policy
              of a modest and gradual appreciation of the NEER policy band since
              April 2004 but is shifting to zero percent appreciation.</p>
              <p>Singapore is Southeast Asia's wealthiest economy in terms of gross
              domestic product (GDP) per capita but is heavily dependent on trade.
              This makes it sensitive to hiccups in developed economies, particularly
              key export markets the United States and Europe.</p>
              <p>Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a 0.3 percent
              quarter-on-quarter rise in GDP, the value of goods and services
              produced in the economy.</p>
              <p>Compared with the third quarter of last year, the ministry said
              Singapore's economy contracted by 0.5 percent in real terms, against
              0.8 percent expansion foreseen in the Dow Jones poll.</p>
              <p>In August the government had revised down its full-year GDP growth
              forecast to 4.0-5.0 percent but since then, external economic
              conditions have deteriorated more than expected, the trade ministry
              said.</p>
              <p>Analysts said the key drag on third-quarter growth was
              manufacturing, which contracted by 11.5 percent year-on-year, and the
              surprise was a sharp decline in growth of what has been a booming
              construction sector.</p>
              <p>Construction growth slowed to 7.8 percent from 19.8 percent, while
              service industries grew by 6.1 percent, marginally down from 7.0
              percent in the second quarter, the data showed.</p>
              <p>"Services deceleration should get more severe from here on," the US bank Morgan Stanley said in a report.</p>
              <p>In a speech Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that
              although growth is slowing, the financial system is sound and the
              economy remains competitive.</p>
              <p>He said that in recent years Singapore has upgraded and diversified its economy.</p>
              <p>"This will mean new and better jobs, even if some old ones are lost," he told a conference.</p>
              <p>Morgan Stanley said it expects things will only get worse for
              Singapore, and the recession will likely be more than just a technical
              one.</p>

              <p>life is already predicted to be super tough.</p>
              <p>Now, news papers show headline news to call people to brace themselves, go upgrade.</p>
              <p>I have no confidence in the future especially when Electricity price can shoot up by a humongous 22% just when OIL price has dropped by 33%.</p>
              <p>The most cute other hike that relates to oil is Transport Hike.</p>
              <p>I predict many businessmen who cannot continue to be more profitable than before might resort to price hikes using the reasons of electricity hike and telephone bill hike and transport hike among others. Every business potentially now have a good reason to hike.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, thanks for your vote. You did a great job. You.... you....sorry, I just vomited blood.... okie got to sleep liao. 2molo going to work you know?
