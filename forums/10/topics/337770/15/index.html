              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Sometimes I do not understand AndrewPKYap. On one hand he keep scolding Singapore government because they r not democratic, on the other hand he support the Abishit who is never voted, use courts power to oust out elected government, in cohort with the army and the elite to exploit the poor and rural. Is using courts and army more democracy than votes ?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Now situation is really chaotic. I never heard any high key meeting stopped halfway due to protests. The people r split between two groups and who knows the conflict can escalate. Does tis make Thai become stronger ? In disarrays, they r portraying a picture of bad investment choice, non stable government, risky tours and anything chaotic can happen in near future. No matter who becomes government now, there r people who r not happy and become democrazy</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">The best way forward is to hold an election which is wat the protesters want. But Abishit refuse. Why ? DO u really respect democracy or u support democrazy ?</p>

              <p>Politicians don't seemed to mesh very well with honour.</p>
              <p>Irregardless whether Abhisit or Thaksin is the more dirty one, the PAD set a very dangerous precedent. They show that a group of people protesting hard enough can force the government to abandon proper democractic procedures.</p>
              <p>Now, even if eventually the Red Shirts get what they want, in a few months the PAD or some other anti Thaksin camp will do the very same thing and the entire cycle will begin again. Eventually it would be the common people that suffers, while the elites continue with their power plays.</p>
              <p>My Filipino colleague put it best, the people will get drunk on People's Power.</p>
              <p>It would become so easy for any people with the money to organise a protest everytime things goes badly or when a law undesirable by the rich is about to be passed, destablizing the very structure that has the best chance of solving their problems in the first place.</p>
              <p>The Thai military and police seems to be enjoying the chaos though, i can't help feeling they're profiting from all this mess.  </p>

              <p>Politicians don't seemed to mesh very well with honour.</p>
              <p>Irregardless whether Abhisit or Thaksin is the more dirty one, the PAD set a very dangerous precedent. They show that a group of people protesting hard enough can force the government to abandon proper democractic procedures.</p>
              <p>Now, even if eventually the Red Shirts get what they want, in a few months the PAD or some other anti Thaksin camp will do the very same thing and the entire cycle will begin again. Eventually it would be the common people that suffers, while the elites continue with their power plays.</p>
              <p>My Filipino colleague put it best, the people will get drunk on People's Power.</p>
              <p>It would become so easy for any people with the money to organise a protest everytime things goes badly or when a law undesirable by the rich is about to be passed, destablizing the very structure that has the best chance of solving their problems in the first place.</p>
              <p>The Thai military and police seems to be enjoying the chaos though, i can't help feeling they're profiting from all this mess.  </p>

              <p>The credibility of the military and police are not there for the taking, most of them are also part of the protesting, remember that thaksin was once a police top leader, he is sure to get support from the police, my personnal feeling is that, protesting is becoming part of thailand jobs, i heard from my thais gals that these protestor get about 500 bahts per day, and free foods too, so alots of jobless took part in the procession, once the red shirt wins, they will change jobs to support the yellow shirt and again take the daily pay out. Funny hor. And also these thai gals who work here told me that most of the army and police are brother and father of the protestor too. So, how can they harm their own family peoples...Thai Rak Thai</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then my PRC gals put it rightly to me, instead of land of a thousand smiles, they said, land of a thousand problems. Thailand, so unique by its own.</p>

              <p>This is a very cute question.</p>
              <p>I see Abhisit persecuting the Thaksin party and they winning all
                                  the courts cases because the courts is part of the elite. Thaksin
                                  gang get banned from politic while abishit gang get a warning for
                                  conducting the same offence</p>
              <p>I see them using army forces and using monarchy laws to
                                  persecute people over the silliest of remarks. Being in a cook show
                                  can make u get banned from politics</p>
              <p>I see the elite having their arms extending from the army to the
                                  rich businesses and courts etc. Tat is why they r labeled as the
                                  "elite" party</p>
              <p>I see the unlawful protesters from the airport becoming a
                                  minister and he never get charged. i wonder why</p>
              <p>I see the army getting excessive control of the politics and
                                  geting undue bonuses for couping. No wonder they love to do it
                                  regularly</p>
              <p>I see abishit making the lives harder for the rural and making
                                  the wealthy more wealthier.</p>
              <p>And I do not see the Thaksin uses any force on protestors ever
                                  as well</p>
              <p>I do not understand why abishit refuses to hold another election
                                  after such a big change in the political scene</p>
              <p>I do not think abishit is honourable</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You make it sound like the courts, the military, the police, the media and your so called "elites" are under Abhisit's control illicitly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">It was what Thaksin tried to do, to control the state instituitions instead of letting them function independantly. It is what the cursed despot in Singapore did and is doing. If Thaksin had simply governed the country without trying to become a dictator like the Singapore cursed despot, he would probably still be in power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You ignore the fact that Abhisit is in power for only a few months.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You think that Abhisit is Jesus Christ or Superman, able to perform miracles? </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You seem to forget that Abhisit is in power mainly because Newin, a Thaksin ally abandoned Thaksin and voted in parliament in Abhisit's favour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If Abhisit subsequently behaves like Thaksin and the Singapore's cursed despot and tries to be a dictator, and selling his country out to foreigners, the Thais would kick his ass out, they are not like the dogs here.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;">It was what Thaksin tried to do, to control the state instituitions instead of letting them function independantly. It is what the cursed despot in Singapore did and is doing. If Thaksin had simply governed the country without trying to become a dictator like the Singapore cursed despot, he would probably still be in power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You ignore the fact that Abhisit is in power for only a few months.</span></p>

              <p>I think u got the order wrong</p>
              <p>Thaksin is the one trying to remove the elite from controlling the military, police etc from the "elite". Tat is why the court, army, police and king oppose him. If he control the army, why will the army coup against him ? If he control the court, why is the court biased against him ?</p>
              <p>Abishit is selected by these elite to be PM. I am not thinking he is superman or jesus christ. He is simply a face set by the elite who is in control for decades</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You seem to forget that Abhisit is in power mainly because Newin, a Thaksin ally abandoned Thaksin and voted in parliament in Abhisit's favour.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">And u seems to forget the court simply force hundreds of thaksin members out unfairly and just give verbal warnings to the elite party for committing the same action. And u also conveniently forget tat the court can also threathen the other political group and can oust them out exactly the same way. And given such a big change in political scene, they refuse to hold any election which u seems to support as well</span></span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If Abhisit subsequently behaves like Thaksin and the Singapore's cursed despot and tries to be a dictator, and selling his country out to foreigners, the Thais would kick his ass out, they are not like the dogs here.</span></p>

              <p>i think thaksin is so bent on getting/grabbing power back that he probably did more damage to the thai kingdom than good.</p>
              <p>he's lost his perspective.</p>
              <p>in the end, thaksin is not the only guy capable of running thailand. abhisit was never given a chance to administer the country proper. he has been dealing with thaksin's increasingly thuggish methods since day 1.</p>
