              <p>The desperate PAD organisation is a cowardly grouping. The claimed to have intellectuals amongst them, but i fail to see any sense of intelligence there - Why the need to have women and children there in their protest? Why hide behind skirts? Are the PAD made up of responsible men or just plain cowards?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Weapons of destruction cannot mix with women and children. They know there will be a fight. In the event temperatures rise and chaos ensues, women and children are the ones who get hurt the most.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fighting should be done by grown men, and not women and children. I strongly plead to our govt to appeal them thru ASEAN for them to send their women and children home, please.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then they can fight all they want, but please spare the women and children. At least the reds, made up of the common folks, have enough sense and brave enough to send only men to fight, in the event if talks break down.</p>

              <p>Correct. This is exactly what is wrong with the Thai situation right now. And it is affecting ASEAN as we speak.</p>
              <p>Thaksin was elected by a democratic majority. The fellas cried foul, elections were held time and time again, and his party or affiliates won fair and square.</p>
              <p>The PAD had a lot of opportunity to raise their issues in Parliament or Senate, but they didn't. I will agree with OM here, especially on the issue of infrastructural and economic paralysis.</p>
              <p>Enough is enough. The PAD have to realise that ASEAN will not wait for them to play clappers and wave their yellow shirts while Thailand is still the Chair for this year. Lots of issues need to be tackled, and having one significant ASEAN member hobbled by this is really trying the patience of the rest of the members.</p>
              <p>It's not a fairy-tale world anymore, and any nation that wants to sit around is really not going to find the aftermath nice for consumption.</p>
              <p>What the PAD is asking for, is nothing more than to a return to authoritarianism and feudal elitist politics. We have enough of those in the world, there's no need for more misguided elitism masquerading as populist democracy. Bangkok does not have a monopoly on being the voice for the whole of Thailand, it should never be that way.</p>

              is really trying the patience of the rest of the members.</p>
              <p>It's not a fairy-tale world anymore, and any nation that wants
              to sit around is really not going to find the aftermath nice for
              consumption.</p>
              <p>What the PAD is asking for, is nothing more than to a return to
              authoritarianism and feudal elitist politics. We have enough of
              those in the world, there's no need for more misguided elitism
              masquerading as populist democracy. Bangkok does not have a
              monopoly on being the voice for the whole of Thailand, it should
              never be that way.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">What are you suggesting? That the Thai people shopuld let the mass media muzzling, Military, Police and Judiaciary cronism and nepotism practicing Thaksin come back?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">GOD FORBID!</span> You are just speaking as a Singaporean living under the propaganda and fear of despots for too long.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Thais support the PAD for eliminating the despots and now tryng to get rid of the puppets of the despot, not for a military dictatorship. The PAD would not have the support if the present bunch of puppets after winning the elections, did not try to change the constituition that limits their power.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why do you think little news is coming out of the Pakistan political scene after the recent presidential elections?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benazir's husband immediately reduced his power as president, by himself, thus forcing him to work with everyone else in the political scene.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is the what the Thais want. This was the way Thai politics was run before Thaksin came along and tried to do a Lee Kuan Yew.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">ASEAN be damned, foreigners be damned, there is no way the Thais will sell their asses, like Silliporeans and sell out their country for the sake of approval from foreigners.</span></span></p>

              <p>Hmm... u don't seems to be responding to some of the crux on the current thai issue. Let me put down the points which I felt should be answered</p>
              <p>1) There r no evidence tat thaksin, or any of the prime minister of committing a corruption act whereby the state loses money or they steal the states money</p>
              <p>2) Up till now there r no evidence tat show thaksin is trying to be a despot, try to control the media or try to put in his people to the army</p>
              <p>3) Thaksin's party had repeatedly win election despite overwhelming unfair practises and the majority of the Thai people supported him. Most thai prefer his mode of governing and a person respecting democracy should accept tat</p>
              <p>4) The opposition objective is for partial monarchy whereby the king chooses the majority of the people into parliament. The opposition did not use proper measure to achieve their target and uses protest to blackmail the gov. It is against democracy but support autocracy, which is something an anti despot person shouldn't support</p>
              <p>5) The current crisis is very serious to the future of thailand. It is currently giving itself a bad reputation as well as losing billions of dollars in a period of global economic crisis. No one knew how the situation will end and several scenarios can be devastating to the country. Unless u have a lot of oil as your resources, u need foreign investors to kick start the economy. Thailand is losing tat appeal now</p>
              <p>6) u did not deny your prefered gov is one tat constantly bicker, fight, resign and do nothing to the gov. It can be autocratic, monarchy or democratic as long as no one is able to control the country. Not everyone subscribes to such anarchy</p>
              <p>7) U try to link the thai situation to japan without realising tat Japan is completely different from thailand. The prime minister quit not because there r unreasonable protests but rather their own party felt they will lose the election if the current prime minister refuse to resign. Their popularity is less than 30% and removing a prime minister has the effect of kick starting the popularity by a little before it starts to decline again. Thaksin has shown to be continuously popular with 60% of the people supporting the current gov.</p>
              <p>8) Lastly and most importantly, singapore is completely different from thailand. The biggest mistake u made in tis thread is to say tat singapore should kick off "despots" like wat thailand did. U r not really clear of PAD agenda and how undemocratic and unreasonable it is before u link it to singapore. It made u contradictory in supporting setting up of a despotic system when u claim u r against despots</p>

              <p>Correct. This is exactly what is wrong with the Thai situation
              right now. And it is affecting ASEAN as we speak.</p>
              <p>Thaksin was elected by a democratic majority. The fellas cried
              foul, elections were held time and time again, and his party or
              affiliates won fair and square.</p>
              <p>The PAD had a lot of opportunity to raise their issues in
              Parliament or Senate, but they didn't. I will agree with OM here,
              especially on the issue of infrastructural and economic
              paralysis.</p>
              <p>Enough is enough. The PAD have to realise that ASEAN will not
              wait for them to play clappers and wave their yellow shirts while
              Thailand is still the Chair for this year. Lots of issues need to

              <p>It's not a fairy-tale world anymore, and any nation that wants

              <p>I'm in full agreement.</p>
              <p>The very reason why PAD is resorting to all this nonsense is because they know that they will never go to power democratically. This is not a case of an aggrieved political party fighting for democracy. <strong>In fact, democracy has soundly rejected the PAD!</strong></p>
              <p>And by seizing the two airports, really, all they're doing is to trample on the rights and livelihood of the average Joe. What happens to the fella who desperately wants to fly home to be by his dying mother's side? What about the roadside vendor who sells souvenirs to tourists? What about the blue-collar worker who works in a foreign-owned factory?</p>
              <p>Did you think about all that, Andy? Did you stop to consider what kind of damage the PAD is doing to Thai tourism and foreign direct investment? Were you thinking of the average Joe?</p>
              <p>I believe that the <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2008statements/1779/">Asian Human Rights Commission</a> has said it best:</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Some commentators and opponents of the
              alliance have described its agenda as fascist. This is not an
              exaggeration. Experience shows that the types of systemic changes and
              regimes that follow such movements, although they may not describe
              themselves as fascist, have fascist qualities.</span></em></p>

              <p>I'm in full agreement.</p>
              <p>The very reason why PAD is resorting to all this nonsense is
              because they know that they will never go to power democratically.
              This is not a case of an aggrieved political party fighting for
              democracy. <strong>In fact, democracy has soundly rejected the
              PAD!</strong></p>
              <p>And by seizing the two airports, really, all they're doing is to
              trample on the rights and livelihood of the average Joe. What
              happens to the fella who desperately wants to fly home to be by his
              dying mother's side? What about the roadside vendor who sells
              souvenirs to tourists? What about the blue-collar worker who works
              in a foreign-owned factory?</p>
              <p>Did you think about all that, Andy? Did you stop to consider
              what kind of damage the PAD is doing to Thai tourism and foreign
              direct investment? Were you thinking of the average Joe?</p>
              <p>I believe that the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2008statements/1779/">Asian Human Rights Commission</a> has said it
              best:</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Some
              commentators and opponents of the alliance have described its
              agenda as fascist. This is not an exaggeration. Experience shows
              that the types of systemic changes and regimes that follow such
              movements, although they may not describe themselves as fascist,
              have fascist qualities.</span></em></p>
              <p><em> </em>Hell... read the whole article by the AHRC in the
              link provided!</p>

I have friends in Thailand who tell me that all the PAD i doing is making the situation worse by the day. The reason we see so many protesters in the capital is because the majority of Thaksin's supporters are poor farmers from rural Thailand. My friend actually told me that alot of Thailand's elite are unhappy with Thaksin because he got rid of corruption within the government and make it more expensive for local businessmen to do business. So he's a hero to the poor and a villian to the rich businessmen.</p>

              <p>Anyways for an out of topic amusement..Why not have a showdown. Pro-Gov protestors vs Anti-Gov Protestors. Army n Police can form a ringlike barricade and let them fight it out. Battle Royal Thai Style.. Whichever side with the last man standing wins. LOL!</p>
