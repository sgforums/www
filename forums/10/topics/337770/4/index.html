              <p>Hopefully... if they dun get forced out like its predeccesor.
              lol But anyways , brother in law doesnt mean that he IS the proxy
              right ? where is the benefit of the doubt ? where is some faith in
              him ? his profile hardly suggests he is like Thaksin.</p>
              <p>We see how this will end. But i must say that its not going to

              <p>I think it is wrong to say for sure tat the current gov is corrupted. Lets see the previous prime minister samak sundraravej. He win the election fair and square. He is performing his job as well as he can. Wat happened ? He is said to be corrupted simply because he hosts a cook show. Did he take a single cent from the state ? Nope. Did he caused the state to lose money ? Nope</p>
              <p>How about Thaksin ? His wife buy a land in an auction, they pay more than the appraised price and thaksin have no control over FIDF. And tat is the only offence tat says he is corrupted after so many years scrutinising his accounts. Is tat corruption the way we see it ? He did not take a single cent from the state. He did not make the state lose a cent. He buy a land in an auction by a entity not under his control at a high price (bought for 772 million while appraised price is 700 million) and tat is corruption ?</p>
              <p>How about the current prime minister ? He is completely clean except his brother in law is called thaksin.</p>
              <p>So how come people can say the current gov is corrupted ? The way they r charged is so trivial, so pointless tat most people will not view it as corruption the way it is understood. It is just simply politically motivated.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If a small band of people do not want the government in power, I would agree that the government should stay.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If hundreds of thousands of ah soh and ah peks are willing to possibly lay down their lives and demonstrate peacefully, then the government should honorably step aside.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Look at Japan. They prime ministers there relinguish power willingly. They could have also clinged on and say that since they won the elections, they will just continue. Only dishonorable despots will do that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You cannot wait until you can nail Thaksin and cronies/puppets for corruption and you have to get rid of him/puppets because he shows despotic tendencies. You have to get rid of his cronies/puppets when they show despotic tendancies. Despotism seems to be a Chinese tendency. The current Thai PM is "Wong".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Otherwise, if you do not get rid of the despots as long as it is "not bad", what you will end up with is a Marcos or like in present day Singapore, a bunch of despots working for self, party and cronies interests, rather than the interests of the country and you will see "legal corruption". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take for example the threads I started on the economy. When I started the first thread, the country was booming! Looking back now, those that said I was "chicken little" in that/those threads, predicting what is happening today, during a time when the country was booming; the situiation is similar in Thailand now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You do not wait until Thaksin gets absolute power and starts to close down newspapers and mass media organisation, pack the courts with his cronies, put his relatives in charge of the police and military then you do something about it. Too little, too late.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The more the Thai despots cling on to power, the more the demonstrators are right to fight on. The despots must willingly step down and step back and only then can the protesters go home.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I was in Bangkok during the years Thaksin was in power. It was apparent to me that he is another Lee Kuan Yew. It is no credit for a Singaporean to be able to spot despotic tendancies but kudos to the Thai people that they saw through his "nobel acts". They certainly received the superior education compared to Silliporeans (but that is another story)</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Without dogs willingly obey the despots, what can despots do?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Apparently the new police chief is willing to do something but will the rank and file do it? The Air-force and navy chiefs are willing to take orders from "Wong" but <span style="color: #ff0000;">will the soldiers open fire and kill their own people or just put up a token display like surrounding the airport?</span></span></p>

              <p>Somchai to step down?</p>

              <p>The only reason why the Mekong river had not turn red with blood is because he is still in power! Thai society no matter how bitter, being asians, still have respect for the top dogs.</p>

              <p>Were Somchai to step down, the reds will never allow it. The yellows will be decimated and a bloodbath will ensue, not only in Bangkok, but in the provinces as well!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>================</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I came from a priviledged family, and my oversea holidays were mainly safe and sanitised tourist spots.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But NOTHING prepared me for the squalor and deprevation i experienced when i was sent to the land of smiles in the countryside for training excercises as an NSmen!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a sporean, we may complain alot, but our poor still live in houses, have a roof over their heads, electricity, gas, lifts, covered walkways, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But over there, their toilet were holes in the ground, taps were  wells that you had to muddy your feet to collect outdoors. Electricity was the gas stove and TVs were only avaliable at the 'mama' shop - village centres which served as a 'shopping mall' - nothing more than a hut crammed with essential items.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Schools don't even have a gymnesium, let alone a proper basketball court. Simple one storey affairs, cement ground, rusty hard steel chairs and tables, not even a canteen, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dare not imagine their education syllabus.  I was horrified. Yet, the simple folks were never without a smile, unlike our pampered citizens whom would have raised hell if they were to spend a day living like them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I could go on to describe the rural folks, but you will have to live amongst them as i did to really experience what it is like to poor or as a rustic in the land of smiles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember deeply one incident of their poverty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One evening, in a heavy monsoon downpour, my fellow NSmen and I were jolted out of our sleep while travelling in a military 3 tonner truck on the way back to our basecamp after conclusion of a trainning mission, by a hard slam on the brakes from our truck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just inches away was a deceptive looking flowing 10 metres wide stream. The commander was not sure how deep the middle was and had to stop to access the situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Out of the corner of my eye, i spied a mother carrying a baby child in wrapped in her arms, thoroughly soaked in the downpour,  sitting under a tree in the pouring rain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Looking further, i saw a ruined hut, which i suspected was blown apart by the strong monsoon winds earlier.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without hesitation, I grabbed my parang and my groundsheet, jumped out of the truck, and in the pouring pelting rain, attempted to make a tent for the mother and child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My buddies, saw and understood what i was doing, and even though weary after trekking miles and climbing knolls to finally conclude a mission, did what i did and in no time, we completed a firm and secured shelter with even drainage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the only person left on our truck was the Thai liason officer, watching us with a bored expression, determined to keep his uniform spotless and dry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We took our clean and unworned green Tshirts from our waterproofed packs and gave to the mother to dry herself and her child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We even took what remained of our combat rations and gave to her, along with our water bottles. By that time, our commander was hollering at us to get back onto the truck and move on, another 2 hrs journey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But not before receiving a smile and a nod of thanks from the mother, as well as the sweet smile of a warmly coddled and innocent child sleeping contentedly under the dry shelter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In that precious magical moment in time, we, miltary brutish beasts that we were, filled with pepped up rage only hours ago to pump our adrenalin up, to complete a trainning mission of violence and destruction, connected with that sleeping foriegn child in an unearthly warmth even the cold pouring rain could not dampen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are all only humans after all, the same species, rich or poor, with a heart capable of caring for others, inspite our differences, regardless of ethnicity, language or religion, in the hour of others' need.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The point of this story is not about our volunteerism, as i am sure my fellow citizens would have done the same if in a similar situation, but rather, to continue on how the poor had been long marginalized by the authorities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had seen the bright lights of Bangkok and had even been invited to lived in the palatial homes of the rich thais, abodes which they deem unsatisfactorily peasant and need to upgrade!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And did they ever cared about the poor? Social spending is abysmal in Thai society!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some may say our country is small and thus social spending is easy. But do not forget we have no worthy resources to speak of. With equal measure, the bigger a country is, the more resources they would have to provide social spending for all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thaksin may either had been corrupt or had not been corrupt, but that can only be determined by the courts or voters, not speculations or allegations without clear evidences!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Vote buying? How much could any politician pay to get a majority. Who had that kinda money? How many would stay bought? What's the difference between paying $200 for a vote, and promising the voters 2 million jobs in 2 yrs time? Were there even conclusive evidence that Thanksin's victory in the election was by paid votes?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a long line of Thai PMs, Thaksin was the ONLY PM who cared enough to increase social spending for the poor rural folks, and connected with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which is why he is loved by the rural humble people of thailand. No one else ever represented them the way Thaksin did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And PAD intends to get rid of such represention, not only by kicking Thaksin or any other caring representatives out illegally, but even to the extent of denying full voting rights to the rural and poor folks!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> This is not a democracy PAD is advocating, but a throwback to the middle ages where tyrants and the select few elites lived, with the rest of the population kept subserviant as serfs!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An evil type of society that millions of our ancestors had shed blood and died to eradicate, and bestow upon us this generation of what we often take for granted - equality and freedom. Freedom from illiteracy, freedom from hunger, freedom from diseases, freedom from poverty, and freedom from discrimination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Constitutions are usually allowed to be amended, in order to stay relevant with the conditions of time for society. Even our own constitutions had amemdments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was once when our own MM Lee had suggested giving added weightage to votes of our senior citizens, but it was something the other founding fathers would have put on sackcloths and covered their heads with shame and sacriledge should it be put into law. It was later buried.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even recently, the opposition political party WP had sought to change our constitution to allow our young teenagers to vote.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is something that can only be put under review and consideration, and acceptance thru the vote by responsible adult citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But what we do pales in comparison to what PAD is attempting to do. They are ripping their constitution to shreds! In its place, the 'Divine Rights of King and Nobility', or a watered down version of Magna Charta?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where the rich and generals become nobles with their alotted fiefdom, the select few in the middle class made gentries, and everyone else including those suckers who were manipulated to show numbers in the yellow protest made serfs?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will not interfere with the politics of other country. I only seek that we pray and hope the poor and rural folks of the land of smiles be given their equality and due as citizens of their own homeland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May the educated yellows see it in this light, help their fellow citizens and not be led into undemocratic means paid with blood by opportunist power ambitious rabble rousers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are all of the same species, and one race - the human race. Our station in life determined by equal opportunities and hardwork, and not by another flawed ambitous human or a small group of equally flawed elitist humans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We must respect the blood shed by our ancestors who gave up their own precious lives to make us free.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: MM Lee is a great man. The Thai king is a great man too, revered by his people. Most fathers are good responsible men. Some sons grow up to be greater than their father, such as our true first amongst equals - PM Lee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some sons cannot even fit into the shadows of their father, let alone his shoes. How much do we know of the land of smiles' crown prince and his ambitions?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Had the kind and constitutional monarchist father, a loving and doting man, and currently aged almost senile, overlooked the flaws of his pampered son, the way any loving father would?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(except our cold and remote and almost unearthly MM Lee, who denied his sons the free and luxurious Istana bunglow, how more harsh could this father be, though i must add, we should be glad his sons grew up just like us common folks, bargin the price, and pay with earned income for our homes?)</p>

              <p>Why do u think the current gov r despots ? In democracy, it is one man one vote and the current gov repeatedly win the election despite massive unfavourable odds standing against them. <strong>Do u respect the election result ?</strong> During thaksin times, they have done a good job and raise the economic standard of thailand especially its rural poor and tat is why they have remained popular till today.

If they felt the mix of the people in the gov be changed, then the proper channel is for them to win the next election and proclaiming such measures in their election campaign. If they r popular, they will achieve victory. Why do they resort to such low end measures to blackmail the gov ? Why do u support tis group of people ? Why do u think they r really "liberators" and not "despots" ? Wat is your understanding of democracy ? The gov tat is divided among itself and bickers day and night ?</p>

              <p>So now u felt the army should behave as they deemed fit and it is right for them to have a coup detat whenever they felt the gov r not doing a good job. The army changes the constitution so tat the army always has some power in the parliament and they do not have to be elected. Is tat supposed to be good ? During thaksin's time, thailand is more democratic than many parts of the world and the press is never curtailed. And even in your own words, he is "becoming". In actual fact, he has done a wonderful job and he is not corrupted and he is popular. U r just assuming he is gonna be a despot</p>
              <p>The real reason is simply because u like the gov to always bicker among themselves, the prime minister keep changing and the parliament keep fighting. Whether they r autocratic or democratic, it doesn't matter. U just do not like any of them to be in control. U really like anarchy. Tis is something which u never seems to reply all tis while.</p>

              <p>So the issue is current government being proxy for thaksin , army n
              police not doing the dirty work of restoring stability through
              necessary force given the situation and the constituitional changes the
              government intended to push through the house because of things like
              this.</p>
              <p>Thaksin compared to his predeccesors pale in comparison
              to thier evils. Even  if withdrawing Thaksins  diplomatic  priviledges 
              n then ? That doesnt change much internally. How are u so sure the
              constituitional changes are to make them stay in power through illegal
              means ? Even so, wouldnt it be good to reign the military in ? Focus on
              development and the economy ? Obviously they are not giving democracy
              some time to work. They can always , vote it out . But they chose not
              to , and instead, through such short period of time and limited
              knowledge of whats really in the best interest of the nation as a whole.</p>
              <p>Now
              i understand why LKY went to great lengths to secure such measures for
              peace and stability not to mention development Singpore  is where it is
              today and also him claiming even though half correct that some
              countries are not yet susceptable to democracy.  Dun forget , Thailand
              is not Singapore. Trust me , if this goes on , there will be no stable
              democratic government EVER in Thailand. Sometimes u need the iron fist
              and a benevolent despot to bring the country as whole to a level to
              become democratic and ultimately peaceful democratic elections and
              becoming a developed nation. If they do continue to hold on to power , it will then be inevitable that they will be overthrown through a peoples power. This at the moment, is hardly really peoples power for democractic change. More like a minority power.</p>

              <p>1) September 2008 - Thailand's Election Commission spokesman Ruangrote Jomsueb said a subcommittee would investigate Somchai on "whether he (Somchai) violated the constitution by holding shares in
              Thailand's CS LoxInfo PCL, an Internet service provider that is a
              contract partner of CAT Telecom,
              a state-owned telecommunications service provider." The Thai
              constitution bars parliament members from holding shares in companies
              that do business with state enterprises, and if found guilty, Somchai
              would be disqualified as parliament member and ousted as prime minister.</p>
              <p>2) October 2008 - Thailand's anti-corruption body found Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat
              guilty of neglecting his duties in not taking action against corruption  while working in the justice department
              eight years ago. Members of the National Counter Corruption Commission
              said Somchai was wrong to suspend a corruption investigation into two
              senior officials while he was a permanent secretary at the justice
              ministry in 2000.</p>
