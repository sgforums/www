The billionaire businessman turned populist politician was deposed by the military in a 2006 coup following months of street protests against his alleged corruption and abuse of power.</span></p>

              <p>The protesters are bringing down the country for the King's sake. It's an honourable sacrifice that the world should respect. In a recession where the tourist dollars are valuable inflows, Thailand's economy has enough reserves to afford a bigger downturn. The message is clear, investors and tourists should steer clear of Thailand. The army's message is clear that they do support the actions of these protestors.</p>
              <p>The world is worried is over jobs and livelihoods, Thailand is more concerned over democracy. This is a land of wealth and smiles, they don't to be concerned over matters that other Asian countries are fretting over.</p>
              <p>Let's give our full support to the protestors in crippling their economy further.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The PAP sold Singaporeans a lie that elections is the start and end of democracy.

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">They change the rules and clamp down on democratic values to make sure that the opposition never has a real chance at the polls (like suppression of press freedom).</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thailand is a strong country. They can close their airport and the whole country can go on strike and yet they will only come out stronger.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They are not dogs and they are not sheep and they will never let public money grabbing despots rule the country...</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">They want democracy but when an elected government start changing the constituition to ensure that they remain in power forever, is that democracy?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If a government gets elected and turns the country communists, is that democracy?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The PAP sold Singaporeans a lie that elections is the start and end of democracy. This allowed them to change the rules as they please to enable them to take massive amounts of money from the people and put as much public money into their own pockets as possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">They change the rules and clamp down on democratic values to make sure that the opposition never has a real chance at the polls (like suppression of press freedom).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Thai military and police tried killing people, people that act according to their conscience previously (in previous uprisings) and the King of Siam stepped in (rightly so) to stop the murderous acts of a small group of people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">You should know what to do, either do a Thai solution or everyone curse them for their dishonorable public money grabbing, dissidents and opposition persecuting behavior with the worse curses to the third generation.</span></span></p>

              <p>There are two aspects in this Thai crisis that you have to consider.</p>
              <p>Firstly, there has been repeated elections held, and each time the Thaksin faction has won the election fairly with the overwhelming support of the rural votes.</p>
              <p>The protestors are all from the urban area of Bangkok.</p>
              <p>Why will this minority group from the capital city of Bangkok be allowed to overturn a democratic process that they are unhappy with, and hold the entire country to ransom ?</p>
              <p>Even now, many Bankok residents are fed-up with these protestors whose protests in the heart of the tourist belt have affected their livelihood; and now with the closure of the airport - it must surely affect the entire economy.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the Constitution that required change was due to the fact that the original Constitution was agreed on by all parties but remained "Works-in-Progress" that required fine tuning.</p>
              <p>When the Thai Military threw out Thaksin, they re-wrote the Constitution to give themselves the ultimate veto-powers on any decisions from a Government that is freely elected by the People.</p>
              <p>Surely, this cannot be tolerated in any Democracies ?</p>
              <p>The sad part of such a situation is that it will be used by detractors of Democracies as examples of the chaos that full democracies can bring.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, they fail to see that Thai Democracy is still "Works-in-Progress" - as Singapore was in the 1950s until this date; and saw our Constitution being totally abused by a Single Party dominated Parliament that took advantage of the total liberty to change the Constitution to serve their own convenience.</p>

              <p>Up till now, full democracies in SEA have never produced the mature democracies you seemed to crave so much and they were in countries that had far more favourable conditions than us.</p>
              <p>I regard democracy as a perfect ideal, a society where people have the power AND the responsibility. Thailand is a perfect example of wanting the power of a democracy but showing completely no regard for the responsibility of belonging in that democracy.</p>
              <p>Democracy can work, and i want it to work.</p>
              <p>But i'm not foolish enough to believe the low educated workers at the begining of Singapore's Independence could grasp the intricacies of government policies. You cannot expect them to understand forward planning, especially when it requires them to give up what they are already used to.</p>
              <p>Even now, when the majority of us have at least O level educations we still get plenty of people who react in a kneejerk manner (AndrewPKY for example)  who wants the PAP gone at all costs, even when it clearly hurts the interest of the entire country to do so.</p>
              <p>You fail to see that democracy comes with a major price of blood, as the history of Europe and America has demostrated. Instead you regard it as a magic bullet that would automatically solve problems. Would we be less hit by this economic crisis in a full democracy?</p>
              <p>Would we actually achieve full water independence considering one of the pre conditions is to convert 2/3 of an already small enough country to water catchment areas? When in a full democracy, the government would have to please the people by giving them more land to build their houses on?</p>

              <p>Hopefully... if they dun get forced out like its predeccesor. lol But anyways , brother in law doesnt mean that he IS the proxy right ? where is the benefit of the doubt ? where is some faith in him ? his profile hardly suggests he is like Thaksin.</p>
              <p>We see how this will end. But i must say that its not going to end even if he is forced out by the ever growing violent protests.</p>
