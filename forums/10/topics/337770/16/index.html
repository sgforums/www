              <p>Maybe thaksin appears to be causing more harm than good by asking the people to revolt. However he also appears to be a victim since he is the PM, he is popularly elected many times yet get ousted in a military coup, his party all get charged for no good reasons, opposition protest and camp outside airport while the army did nothing, the airport protest leader get to be a minister and rewarded while the recent protesters get hit, charged and jailed, Thaksin get charged over ridiculous allegations like buying a land more expensive than the value, his assets r frozen, the government is out to eliminate him by forcing him to have no country to stay etc.</p>
              <p>Abishit can administer the country proper if he win the election and do not use dirty tactics. Then he can be considered as "honorable"</p>

              <p>What would you do if you are thaksin? You could not return to home country because people in power wants you dead. The thai government freeze most of your $$$. The thai government chase you from one country to another country. And the best thing is you have not do anything wrong.</p>

              <p>...Isn't that the point of democracy ? Will of the majority? If the <strong>majority </strong>supports such an action who are we to say that it's wrong?</p>
              <p>Didn't democracy come about precisely that the majority wants it? Did not the Chinese Communists took over because they had popular support? Did not America gain independence precisely because the majority wanted it?</p>

              <p>bane,</p>
              <p>thaksin's lust is power. getting his monies back is secondary. if he can afford to buy man city (sell it later to the arabs for a profit), i don't think $$$ is the primary reason he's kicking up a ruckus in a big way now.</p>
              <p>by creating all these unrest that is putting the country in a perilous situation now will not help the country in anyway, especially in these times.</p>
              <p>the lost of thai credibility that he engineered to undermine the country when the asean summit was postponed is also 1 step forward, 3 steps back. you reckon world leaders will shake hands with him after what he did if indeed he's successful in his power grab?</p>
              <p>whether he is wronged is a subjective discussion.  </p>
              <p>lastly, one should also understand that in thai history; the military and the king have an intricate and integral say in how politics in run there. to separate these out will just be moot discussion.</p>

              <p>You have to admit that all politicians are fighting for power. The military is maintaining its power in the name of the king. All these three parties have no respect for the consititution, democracy, law and order.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the military couped in 2006.</p>
              <p>Secondly, PAD blocked the election, blocked the airport</p>
              <p>Thirdly, pro-taksin cancelled the APEC.</p>
              <p>So, whether peace will come is a subjective discussion even with or without thaksin</p>
              <p>But what I can say is that Abhisit has burned down the peaceful bridge between thaksin and anti-thaksin. It can be settled in peaceful means.</p>

              <p>...Isn't that the point of democracy ? Will of the majority? If
              the <strong>majority</strong> supports such an action who are
              we to say that it's wrong?</p>
              <p>Didn't democracy come about precisely that the majority wants
              it? Did not the Chinese Communists took over because they had
              popular support? Did not America gain independence precisely
              because the majority wanted it?</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">huh? Are you out of your mind? You want the possibility of having a "Dear Leader", even if it is just a possibility, to rule over you?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Without democracy there is a distinct possibility that a "Dear Leader" of North Korea and a Stalin of USSR and the Dictators of Burma will end up ruling the country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In a true democracy with real democratic freedoms, there is no such possibility.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">As long as Thailand remains a democracy, if Abhisit cocks up, then he will have to go. If Abhisits starts trying to consolidate power to become a despot, then the other instituitions of democracy will have to stop him even if the majority supports him.</span></p>
