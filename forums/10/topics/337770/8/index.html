              <p><br>Hrm alright, thanks for clarifying.</p>
              <p>But saying Thaksin used the money to bribe the poor is rather subjective isn't it?</p>
              <p>Don't Europe and Australia tax the rich heavily and give it out as welfare subsidies? They call it redistribution of wealth there, how is it different in Thaksin's case?</p>
              <p>Using taxpayers money to help the poor and to gather support for himself to remain in power...that's the whole point of having a democractic government isn't it?</p>

              <p>I am surprised though that at forums, here and elsewhere, there are Thais who seem to support PAD. This makes me think maybe they are not evil after all. I trust more the real Thai people rather than frustrated tourists or the talkative journalists.</p>
              <p>Also, the theoretical talks about democracy and classism, maybe it is a little bit of overanalysis. I am imagining myself if I am a so-called midlle class or upper middle class Bangkokian maybe I will support PAD too, and I believe those middle class and upper middle class Bangkokian actually are the ones who know the best about their country and the politics.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There definitely has to be a political solution to this whole tug of war. The problem is that the entity that is suppose to be the main power broker, has a stake in all of this, thereby ruling out any neutral intervention that will broker any sort of compromise between the two factions. I have very little knowledge about the area, but I gather that the conflict is drawn across geographical and class lines. A solution to this might be embarking upon a policy of decentralization and giving greater autonomy to the various regions, and empowering regional governors at the expense of the central government. </p></div>

              <p>There definitely has to be a political solution to this whole
              tug of war. The problem is that the entity that is suppose to be
              the main power broker, has a stake in all of this, thereby ruling
              out any neutral intervention that will broker any sort of
              compromise between the two factions. I have very little knowledge
              about the area, but I gather that the conflict is drawn across
              geographical and class lines. A solution to this might be embarking
              upon a policy of decentralization and giving greater autonomy to
              the various regions, and empowering regional governors at the
              expense of the central government. </p>
