              <p>for people like you who lazed around in the army, I
              sympathize with you. Looking at a bigger picture, I am sad
              that we actually need to keep ppl like you in the army.
              You wasted your time, the SAF wasted the resources feeding and
              clothing you.  </p>
              <p>Singapore came a long way in the development of its
              armed forces. They used to take almost 1 and a half years
              to train a support arm officer, such as combat engineer, when
              doctrine were being developed, equipment were lacking.
              They used to build bailey bridge, with a company, then the
              MGB, with a platoon, and now it is laguan with 3 or 4 men. They
              used to need strong guy, then poly engineer, now can play computer
              game ok liao.</p>
              <p>the combined armed and specialist doctrine made certain
              training redundant, and time is saved.</p>
              <p>Time is still needed for men to form units after training to
              carry out exercises to test the operational readiness. It took a
              while to test if our combined armed doctrine works.</p>
              <p>With reducing manpower, we have done well in maintaining the
              strength of our SAF with technology upgrade and doctrinal
              changes. I think our armed forces planners will continue to
              improve.</p>
              <p>We can reduce the total force readiness to just a few
              people, just buy a nuclear bomb.</p>
              <p>Nobody wants to be in the army, they know that, and army also
              knows that there are many zho bo, jia liao bi in the army.
              What did you contribute to the SAF in  the 2
              years? you can be proud that you passed your
              IPPT.</p>
              <p>Never see you in military nuts? you carried arms in the
              army?</p>

              <p>There are many factors involved to decide if we need 1 or 2 yrs
              for SAF. I leave it to the military planner. I made the best use of
              my time.</p>

              <p>You missed my point totally. I'm not against NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, let me talk at your point. Allow me to point where your logic is very flawed:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>at the time when you were doing ns,
              you could made $180k? very good for an 18 yr old, with A level.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>You have to take into account that without NS, I would have graduated earlier. I would not have stayed with an A level cert for that 2 yrs, but instead, been halfway through uni.</p>
              <p>It would have been an extra 2 years in the job market with a uni cert. It is these 2 years that I'm talking about. Think about it</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And FYI, I graduated in 2008, and in the midst of the recent "crisis" and retrenchments, I can still easily find a job and further increase my income via different means. Do not use your "insert adjective" friends to compare with me.</p>

              <p>I don't have the numbers but i am not sure if SAF can maintain 40 - 45K active personnel with 1 yr service turnaround.</p>
              <p>But i do think that maybe....Mindef can considered those able boys to complete their University before enlisting. I think it is a do-able consideration. After all not all boys will choose University if given the choice some might decide to take 2 years off.</p>
              <p>Also i think Mindef can considered reduce reservist to 35 yrs instead of 40 yrs.</p>

              <p>for people like you who lazed around in the army, I sympathize with you. Looking at a bigger picture, I am sad that we actually need to keep ppl like you in the army. You wasted your time, the SAF wasted the resources feeding and clothing you.  </p>
              <p>Singapore came a long way in the development of its armed forces. They used to take almost 1 and a half years to train a support arm officer, such as combat engineer, when doctrine were being developed, equipment were lacking. They used to build bailey bridge, with a company, then the MGB, with a platoon, and now it is laguan with 3 or 4 men. They used to need strong guy, then poly engineer, now can play computer game ok liao.</p>
              <p>the combined armed and specialist doctrine made certain training redundant, and time is saved.</p>
              <p>Time is still needed for men to form units after training to carry out exercises to test the operational readiness. It took a while to test if our combined armed doctrine works.</p>
              <p>With reducing manpower, we have done well in maintaining the strength of our SAF with technology upgrade and doctrinal changes. I think our armed forces planners will continue to improve.</p>
              <p>We can reduce the total force readiness to just a few people, just buy a nuclear bomb.</p>
              <p>Nobody wants to be in the army, they know that, and army also knows that there are many zho bo, jia liao bi in the army. What did you contribute to the SAF in  the 2 years? you can be proud that you passed your IPPT.</p>
              <p>Never see you in military nuts? you carried arms in the army?</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So what have YOU contributed to the army?</p>
              <p>BMT = 3 months</p>
              <p>OCT = 9 months or Specialist = 6 months or normal soldier = 3 months.</p>
              <p>After that, it's all about unit exercises and lots of lazing around doing nothing. If you do not acknowledge this fact that NS wastes a lot of time being VERY unproductive (even now in reservist, one can see a lot of time being wasted), there's nothing much else to say about you. (Even the resident dog in my camp was real unproductive)</p>
              <p>It only shows that you know next to nothing about the modernization of the army, that gone are the days where 1.5 years is required to train a soldier.</p>
              <p>And myself? I was a platoon commander. AT least I contributed to the army in a combat way, and at least my men under me were well taken of.</p>
