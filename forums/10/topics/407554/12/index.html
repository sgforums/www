              <p>This 9K thing... not everybody who has served NS is going to get it.</p>
              <p>Those who ROD already have to suck thumb, because apparently it does not apply to them. So their NS is too late to be "appreciated".</p>
              <p>For me I ORD liao, so I only get 6k cos I missed first tranche... sorry suck thumb, my time in NS, including the times in my combat vocation when I was nearly shot my a misfired round from one of my men... can't be "apperciated"... ah wells. Not that that's too much of an issue cos we can't really touch most of the money anyway, and by the time we finally do who knows what inflation would have done to it? </p>
              <p>This is not trying to be unhappy with anything they do, but quite simply that if this is how you show "appreciation", a little package with so many strings attached that eventually leaves out a large portion of those who have gone through NS anyway... its becoming less and less of an "appreciation" and more and more of an insult. Is this how we honour the people who have done their duty to keep Singapore safe? </p>
              <p>I am just saying. Now that the details are out, I don't know who thought up of this policy or managed the sales pitch, but it's going to cost them some support on the ground as opposed to actually building it. </p>
