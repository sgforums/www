              <p>They give you $9000, you fear they would take back $18000. But think about it, they are already taking from you $20,000 (if you are paying that much taxes of any kind), now they give you back $9000, take it as a bonus.</p>
              <p>Be happy when you are given money, just don't sell yourself for it, no reason you should fear this or that. </p>

              <p>Thank-you PM for giving the big bonus to NSmen. As a person who is fast approaching 50, I don't need the S9k as urgently as finding a good stable job. I did not mention salary because I can accept the same lower salary as FT, and put in equally long hours as FT for the employers. But, does PM you know the ground situation is that local employers are shunting many middle age people who are equally qualified as any new FTs, and maybe have more real-life experiences than many new FTs. This is the bleak condition of job that post 40-years old singaporeans are facing that no amount of money can compensate.<br></p>

              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) has given details of 
              the National Service Recognition Award (NSRA) announced by Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the National Day Rally.
              <br> <br> The award is to recognise Singapore citizens who have served national service.
              <br> <br> The NSRA is a monetary award of between S$9,000 and S$10,500 for each Singaporean NSman, with commanders getting more. 
              <br> <br> It will benefit full time and operationally-ready NSmen in service from 
              August 29, the day it was announced by Prime Minister Lee, and will not 
              be retroactive.
              <br> <br> The money will be disbursed equally at three significant milestones 
              during the serviceman's full-time training and his Operationally-Ready 
              National Service (ORNS).
              <br> <br> Eligible NSmen will receive S$3,000 at each of the milestones, and commanders will get S$500 more each time.
              <br> <br> Commanders are those holding third sergeant rank and above in the Singapore Armed Forces, or sergeant and above in the HomeTeam.
              <br> <br> Minister of State for Defence, Associate Professor Koo Tsai Kee, said: 
              "They do more... - usually for each in-camp training they come in one or
               two days earlier if not more to do the planning and they probably stay 
              one or two days later - so they get more.
              <br> <br> "We do not want to monetise the contributions of Nsmen, it is the value 
              we place on it. And it is only for Singapore citizens - the signal that 
              the Prime Minister and government (are sending) that Singaporeans come 
              first and Singaporeans are always important. 
              <br> <br> "This recognition award is to recognise the contributions of Singapore 
              citizens doing national service full-time and the in-camp training 
              cycle. I think S$9,000 is very significant, but the significance goes 
              beyond the S$9,000. 
              <br> <br> "It is the value the government and the Prime Minister place on the 
              contributions of Singapore citizens. Many Singaporeans think it is the 
              duty to do national service and this S$9,000 comes as a pleasant 
              surprise and great bonus. 
              <br> <br> "The first S$3,000 is very useful for an NSman finishing NS and enroute 
              to education. They can pay for their tuition fees for at least one year 
              for most courses in NUS, NTU, SMU. The second and third tranche can go 
              into the CPF to pay for housing and other requirements specified by the 
              CPF."
              <br> <br> The first milestone is when the serviceman completes his full-time 
              national service. The money will be paid out at the 20th month of 
              service. It will be deposited into the Post-Secondary Education Account 
              (PSEA) to help with further studies.
              <br> <br> The second tranche will be paid after the completion of three high-key 
              in-camp training, or five in-camp training stints, whichever is earlier.
               And the last payment will be when the full Operationally-Ready National
               Service training cycle is completed.
              <br> <br> The second and third milestone awards will be paid in the servicemen's 
              CPF accounts and distributed into the Ordinary, Special and Medisave 
              accounts according to the prevailing CPF contribution rates. The 
              servicemen can use the amount for their housing, healthcare and 
              retirement needs.
              <br> <br> As for those who have already completed their entire national service 
              cycle, Prof Koo said: "Government policy has never been retroactive. The
               first significant milestone is on the 29th of August when the Prime 
              Minister made the statement. 
              <br> <br> "Many generations who have served NS, like many of us... recognise that 
              we have already benefited from previous policies and this policy is for 
              NSmen going forward."
              <br> <br> The disbursement of the National Service Recognition Award will start from February next year.
