              <p>no disagreement there are some issues which should be addressed, like the target population. And even some of the issues brought up, like making the difference between citizens and foreigners, or even the big money to be put into the MRT, are they enough, or in time?</p>
              <p>but I won't quarrel when offered 9K, it is substantial amount to me, even if it is in my cpf.  don't need to mix everything together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">, ä¸�æ‹¿ç™½ä¸�æ‹¿ã€‚</p>

              <p>Singapore direction:</p>
              <p>Foreign invasion - Need them to be around so as to keep the bus and MRT overcrowded and the casino rolling in with cash. Since you are not making enough babies, you are to be blamed.</p>
              <p>Overcrowding - Live with it or you can live in Johor or Batam.Without overcrowding, do you want the system and companies to go bankrupt due to low population ?</p>
              <p>High cost of living - The cost of living will be high so that more profits and bonus will be given to the company directors, which, in term is the yardstick for some one salary. Why would any one fix it if they are the party enjoying all the perks ? Do you want your condo and HDB prices to fall flat ?</p>
              <p>Social cohesion - There are party organised for you to bond. If you do not want to join, then dun blame any one.</p>
              <p>Joblessness - There are free program for you to enrol in. If you are spending your time complaining and not upgrading yourself, you are complacent and deserved to be replaced by foreigners who are cheaper, better and faster.</p>
              <p>Scholarship - If your son and daughter are smart, they will also qualified for free scholarship that are offered to the foreign talent. So, ask your kids to study higher.</p>
              <p>Not enough hospital - Stay away from your lazy lifestyle and exercise and you will never be warded.</p>
              <p>Flooding - It is already announced that it cannot be fixed so you either moved out of your low lying area or moved out of singapore.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the future of the lion city is all in YOUR hands.</p>

              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: Upbeat and reassuring - that's what many MPs and
              grassroots leaders had to say about Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's
              National Day Rally speech on Sunday evening.
              <br> <br> And while some cheered a new measure to help couples buy a public flat, others felt that it did not go far enough.
              <br> <br> MPs said Mr Lee's two-hour address gave plenty of food for thought when he spoke about the Singapore Spirit.
              <br> <br>Dr Amy Khor, MP for Hong Kah GRC and Mayor of South West District,
              said: "For some time, we have been talking about Singapore identity and
              so on, and we haven't really got a handle on what this is all about. I
              think the Singapore Spirit aptly identifies what it is we have in us to
              be able to progress forward.
              <br> <br>"Singaporeans may be concerned about competition and crowding out
              by foreigners. He has also highlighted that this is not about
              competition from within, but competition from without. And really, we
              do not need to fear competition because we have the mettle and the
              wherewithal to transcend these challenges, as we have shown."
              <br> <br> Mr Lee's point that the integration of new citizens will take time was echoed by grassroots leaders.
              <br> <br>Mr Roy Cheng, Vice Chairman of Citizens Consultative Committee at
              Bishan-Toa Payoh North, said: "We don't understand those from other
              countries who have different characteristics and lifestyles. But
              through long-term relationships and activities, slowly we can talk to
              each other and understand each other."
              <br> <br> The announcement of a $9,000 award for National Servicemen was also welcomed by many.
              <br> <br>Mr Michael Palmer, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, said: "You can use
              it towards housing, you can use it towards education. That's going to
              come in useful because that will benefit their children, their families
              as well."
              <br> <br>Others took heart in changes announced to help students who do not
              fare so well in their studies, in particular, allowing Normal Academic
              students to go to polytechnics without taking the O-levels, if they do
              well for their N-level exams.
              <br> <br>Mrs Josephine Teo, GPC Chair for Education and MP for Bishan-Toa
              Payoh GRC, said: "It's to really let these students who are in Normal
              Academic stream know that the system is there to support them, and it's
              not meant to put them behind permanently. So it's a real morale
              booster."
              <br> <br> But some MPs felt that more could have been done to help the "sandwiched" middle-class buy a HDB flat.
              <br> <br>Mdm Halimah Yacob, MP for Jurong GRC, said: "It will not completely
              allay their concerns and their fears, because there are some who do not
              want to purchase a DBSS flat because it is more expensive than other
              types of HDB flats. But at least it acknowledges their problem."
              <br> <br>The rally speech may have been concluded, but for many, work has
              only just begun. Over the next few weeks, MPs and grassroots leaders
              will be fanning out to their various constituencies to seek feedback
              from their residents. And the ministries will also be filling in the
              details for the new policies sketched out in Mr Lee's speech.

              <p>Not saying 9K in CPF isn't a good thing, but apparently our dear PM might be trying to get a lot more mileage out of it then its actually worth. Kinda put a spin on it that almost had me there.</p>
              <p>Is this a sufficient "apperciation" for our NS duties? Given all these strings are attached to the actual amount and it can only mainly be used in a way that mostly goes straight back to their coffers especially if new NSmen use it to try to get a house?</p>
              <p>My feeling is "no", it strikes me almost as self-serving. It's a bit like getting a present for somebody so that you can use it as well. </p>
              <p>Nice move, not that I am not appreciative, but they really should be working more of finding a long term solution towards creating a sustainable balance between Singaporeans and Foreigners. These little things are pretty but they are not going to win them support from the ground if they are not addressing the key issue at its root. </p>

              <p>Actually nope. You might want to take a look in the mirror first.</p>
              <p>I am going to assume you actually bother to discuss things rationally and actually think facts are important.</p>
              <p>One of the main reasons for Singapore's abysmal birth rate is the fact that women in general are far less likely to marry at the ages they used to. In our parents time getting married at 19-21 was common, nowadays it's considered too young. Starting a family is very far from the minds of most women in their early twenties now.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately you can't really fight biology, after 25, the average fertility of a woman starts to decline rapidly. At 30 the risk of birth defects start to rise and the number of child bearing years are also limited. This means that women in general, are having children when they are biologically less fertile, as well as having less child bearing years to actually have more children.</p>
              <p>Add that up with the high cost of living, and changing mindsets... you get the picture. A lot of the reason for the low birth rate is more due to the fact that women's mindsets have changed, and it might not be all for the better.</p>
              <p>Back then being a good mother and raising a family was considered a woman's honour. Nowadays if a woman chooses that she is decried by feminists as "weak" or "subservient", and that she ought to be focused on her career instead. </p>
              <p>Additionally, is it a sentiment that in general Singaporean women do not have much respect for local guys? A sense of entitlement? Who knows?</p>
              <p>Tough. </p>

              <p>Back then being a good mother and raising a family was
                  considered a woman's honour. Nowadays if a woman chooses that she
                  is decried by feminists as "weak" or "subservient", and that she
                  ought to be focused on her career instead. </p>

              <p>There also appears to be a strong feminist agenda in the PAP state media, you can see it in print and TV dramas.</p>
              <p>That is why it's so sickening when the entire mainstream media is monopolised, you have no other media to turn to. All same propaganda. All same agenda.</p>
              <p>Then you have people like parn easily influenced by this type of propaganda to believe that all men like to whore around.</p>

              <p>Actually the more I think about it now, it does not seem as cool as it's cranked out to be. </p>
              <p>Add that to the fact I live in an opposition ward, and have been jerked around quite alot on the whole upgrading issue and having the MM say on national TV something to the effect "oh see lor, you dun vote for us now you are at back of queue... in the meantime keep paying taxes".</p>

              <p>that is why the opposition fall flat. The first issued to tackle isn't national service....40K - 45K active service isn't alot especially you considered the number include support personnel. a 2 yr rotation probably just address the minimum including ample training and exposure.</p>
              <p>If you are going to have your sons serve national service please give them enough training so that they can fend for themselves and not be like those police in "Manila".</p>
              <p>So if you are rooted for opposition...there are plenty of issued to address...!!!</p>
