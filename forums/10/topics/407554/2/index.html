              <p>NATIONAL Servicemen stand to get $9,000 each in a move 
              to show that citizens come first amidst resentment towards foreigners 
              who do not have to serve NS.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday night announced a 'National Service Recognition Award' at the National Day Rally.</p>
              <p>The $9,000 for NSmen who are citizens only - and more for 
              commanders - will go into their CPF and Post-Secondary Education 
              Accounts in tranches.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said this is a recognition for the contributions and 
              sacrifices of NSmen who give up two years full-time, and then return for
               reservist while trying to build a career and build a family.</p>
              <p>Permanent Residents who have done their NS will get the payout only when they become citizens.</p>
              <p>At any one time, there are 55,000 active servicemen - about 20,000 regulars and more than 30,000 full-time national servicemen.</p>
              <p>There are about 300,000 operationally-ready National Servicemen. <br><br>Source: <br><br><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_572451.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_572451.html</a></p>
