              <p>True. Let's say it is spread over 10 years to be given out, it will still reach $19k over 20 years.</p>
              <p>Anyway, even if it's $29k, most likely it's not going to elevate my life in any way in 30 yrs time.</p>

              <p>As for the 9k to NSmen, i think it is very unfair to all other citizens who had in a way or the other contributed to the country, for example, the Nsmen's wives, the parents, especially the mother who borned them, the registered girlfrens.

              <p>Firstly, you joined red cross ECA in school because of your interest in it, isn't it? Or were you forced to join at gunpoint? You can also choose to quit the ECA anytime u like isn't it? For singaporean men, we don't have much of an option when it comes to serving the nation. 2 1/2 years of our youth wasted and 10++ years of annual gathering with SAF is no laughing matter. We were forced to join and we can't quit anytime we like.</p>
              <p>Secondly, as for the boys fake fainting to get your attention, NPNT.</p>

              <p><br>That is for the babies, not for me, and bear in mind, it is our male population that is having the troubles of producing, maybe due to some weakness somewhere, not a problem in conceiving for us. It needs two to made a baby, but if one is weak, god bless Singapore.</p>
