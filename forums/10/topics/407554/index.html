When Singapore prospers, you will benefit from many government programmes: better designed HDB estates, higher quality schools and hospitals, more MRT lines and new places for recreation. But each one of us has to make the effort</span>."<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Yes, Mr Prime Mini$ter, every average Singaporean like Ali, Ah Seng, Arul and Alex will have </span></strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to make the effort</span></strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> to pay more for hospital services and crazy HDB flats that make a mockery of the word 'subsidy'. They also have to pay for more expensive taxi, MRT and bus rides! The truth is when Singapore prospers, elites and those in PAP prosper. The men in the street . . . they suffer. The ever-increasing cost of living for the common people has far exceeded the pay they received!</span></strong><br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">I hope all Singaporeans will work together to put up a good show, and make the games memorable for all our visitors.</span>"<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Yes, Mr Prime Mini$ter, another wayang not unlike the 4,000,000 smiles that was badly needed for the hot shots from IMF in 2006. Thank God, unlike 2006, we do not need cages for YOG!</span></strong><br><br>
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px;">"<span style="font-style: italic;">I understand Singaporeans' concerns about taking in so many foreign workers and immigrants. Some of us wonder: Will it change the ethos of our society? Will it mean more competition for us at work, or for our children in schools? Will the new arrivals strike roots here? Can they adjust to us, and we to them. These are valid concerns which we must address. We will control the inflow, to ensure that it is not too fast, and not too large. We will only bring in people who can contribute to Singapore, and work harder to integrate them into our society. And we will make clear that citizens come first. After all, we are doing this for the sake of Singaporeans.</span>"</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, Mr Prime Mini$ter, you have been in your ivory tower far too long that you do not know what's happening on the ground. Recently, you mentioned that you'll be bringing in another 100,00 guest workers this year. Apart from helping employers lower the cost of labour and helping agents scalp these guest workers, I do not see how bringing another 100,000 foreign workers can make average Sinkapoorean like Ali, Ah Seng, Arul or Alex's life better.<br></span></strong></p>
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My real bros like Ali, Ah Seng, Arul and Alex have to wake up earlier to ensure a standing space in the MRT to get to work. They have to be 'cheaperest, betterest and fasterest' in whatever they do to survive. With your high falutin' decision to bring in the magic 100,000 this year, my bros have become more vulnerable and replaceable by these guest workers. No, Mr Prime Mini$ter, us 'small-minded' and 'lesser mortals' think that you are bringing in your so-called FT just to boost the GDP to justify more obscene salary and bonuses for your bros and sis in white and your goodself!<br><br>With your devil-may-care song and dance of our fantastic Y-Y GDP growth of 17.9% (what a magic figure compared to other countries), I suggest that you be careful in not busting the bubble that your more junior civil servants are expecting. With your feel-good-look-good figures, they are expecting a big fat bonus this year end. And they are currently splurging like crazy even before they got the bonuses. Well, with your track record, I'm sure you are still pretty good at 'fixing and buying'. Not to worry, with General Election round the corner, I'm sure all civil servants, regardless of rank, will receive generous bonuses.</span></strong><br><br>Mr Prime Minister, on this National Day of 2010, I wish you 'Enough'.<br>
              <ul>
              <li>Enough of the crazy policies that maim the common people (namely, 'subsidised' HDB flat that costs an arm and a leg for 30 years; increased bus and MRT fares; can-die-but-cannot-be sick hospital fees; forcing the poor to pay utilities fees in advance with cashcard, etc)</li>
              <li>Enough of insensitive-high-from-the-ivory-tower remarks from your cabinet members and White MPs. It is just not nice to hear from your father that we are 'complacent champion grumblers who needs spurs on our hind'. Nor is it nice to be called 'lesser mortals' living the 'Singapore Gripe droning like vuvuzelas"<br></li>
              <li>Enough of silly remarks like 'Once in 50 years'; 'Act of God' and 'Do not expect flood free Singapore'. Sorry, if you demand to be paid the best, you jolly well work your ass off to justify your more-expensive-than-Obama salary<br></li>
              <li>And from the bottom of my broken heart, Enough of the pain of health challenges that's been inflicted upon you and your familee members.</li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>Having survived heart attack, ventricular fibrillation, hernia, shingles and ran over by a car, I know the agony and ecstasy of dealing with health challenges.<br><br>Having been there and done that, I wish you enough to know that that not every mother's son is as lucky as you are. Not every father's daughter is as fortunate as your wife or your sister.<br><br>My dream is for Singapore to have a Prime Mini$ter who is carefull. A PM who does not <span style="font-style: italic;">chui kong lumpar song</span> (talk-cock-sing-song) but sincerely has the heart to really care for the less endowed and not insult the intelligence of those he rules over.<br><br>Happy National Day but please do not hog the limelight with all white when celebration is on at the Padang. If only your lapdog media show some footage of opposition members celebrating at NDP, your credibility will have rise a few notches :) Instead of fixing them all the time, try giving them a break. Give Singaporeans a break! It'll do good for your reputation!<br><br>While I'm at it, can you please do your bit to save the life of Yong Vui Kong? With you and your dad's connection, I'm sure you can do some in the Cabinet to get the President to pardon Yong. Please let him do time instead of sending him to the Jolly Hangman. I know it's tough but can tell lawyer colleague Sham not to make it more difficult for the boy who's young enough to be your son.<br><br>Thank you in advance.<br><br>Note: Speech in <span style="font-style: italic;">italics</span> extracted from asiaone.com [<a style="color: #bb3300;" href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20100808-231103.html">Link</a>]<br><br>feedmetothefish</p>

When Singapore prospers, you will benefit from many government programmes: better designed HDB estates, higher quality schools and hospitals, more MRT lines and new places for recreation. But each one of us has to make the effort</span>."<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Yes, Mr Prime Mini$ter, every average Singaporean like Ali, Ah Seng, Arul and Alex will have </span></strong><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to make the effort</span></strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> to pay more for hospital services and crazy HDB flats that make a mockery of the word 'subsidy'. They also have to pay for more expensive taxi, MRT and bus rides! The truth is when Singapore prospers, elites and those in PAP prosper. The men in the street . . . they suffer. The ever-increasing cost of living for the common people has far exceeded the pay they received!</span></strong><br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">I hope all Singaporeans will work together to put up a good show, and make the games memorable for all our visitors.</span>"<br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Yes, Mr Prime Mini$ter, another wayang not unlike the 4,000,000 smiles that was badly needed for the hot shots from IMF in 2006. Thank God, unlike 2006, we do not need cages for YOG!</span></strong><br><br></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em;">"<span style="font-style: italic;">I understand Singaporeans' concerns about taking in so many foreign workers and immigrants. Some of us wonder: Will it change the ethos of our society? Will it mean more competition for us at work, or for our children in schools? Will the new arrivals strike roots here? Can they adjust to us, and we to them. These are valid concerns which we must address. We will control the inflow, to ensure that it is not too fast, and not too large. We will only bring in people who can contribute to Singapore, and work harder to integrate them into our society. And we will make clear that citizens come first. After all, we are doing this for the sake of Singaporeans.</span>"</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 0.75em;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, Mr Prime Mini$ter, you have been in your ivory tower far too long that you do not know what's happening on the ground. Recently, you mentioned that you'll be bringing in another 100,00 guest workers this year. Apart from helping employers lower the cost of labour and helping agents scalp these guest workers, I do not see how bringing another 100,000 foreign workers can make average Sinkapoorean like Ali, Ah Seng, Arul or Alex's life better.<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My real bros like Ali, Ah Seng, Arul and Alex have to wake up earlier to ensure a standing space in the MRT to get to work. They have to be 'cheaperest, betterest and fasterest' in whatever they do to survive. With your high falutin' decision to bring in the magic 100,000 this year, my bros have become more vulnerable and replaceable by these guest workers. No, Mr Prime Mini$ter, us 'small-minded' and 'lesser mortals' think that you are bringing in your so-called FT just to boost the GDP to justify more obscene salary and bonuses for your bros and sis in white and your goodself!<br><br>With your devil-may-care song and dance of our fantastic Y-Y GDP growth of 17.9% (what a magic figure compared to other countries), I suggest that you be careful in not busting the bubble that your more junior civil servants are expecting. With your feel-good-look-good figures, they are expecting a big fat bonus this year end. And they are currently splurging like crazy even before they got the bonuses. Well, with your track record, I'm sure you are still pretty good at 'fixing and buying'. Not to worry, with General Election round the corner, I'm sure all civil servants, regardless of rank, will receive generous bonuses.</span></strong><br><br>Mr Prime Minister, on this National Day of 2010, I wish you 'Enough'.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Enough of the crazy policies that maim the common people (namely, 'subsidised' HDB flat that costs an arm and a leg for 30 years; increased bus and MRT fares; can-die-but-cannot-be sick hospital fees; forcing the poor to pay utilities fees in advance with cashcard, etc)</li>
              <li>Enough of insensitive-high-from-the-ivory-tower remarks from your cabinet members and White MPs. It is just not nice to hear from your father that we are 'complacent champion grumblers who needs spurs on our hind'. Nor is it nice to be called 'lesser mortals' living the 'Singapore Gripe droning like vuvuzelas"<br></li>
              <li>Enough of silly remarks like 'Once in 50 years'; 'Act of God' and 'Do not expect flood free Singapore'. Sorry, if you demand to be paid the best, you jolly well work your ass off to justify your more-expensive-than-Obama salary<br></li>
              <li>And from the bottom of my broken heart, Enough of the pain of health challenges that's been inflicted upon you and your familee members.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Having survived heart attack, ventricular fibrillation, hernia, shingles and ran over by a car, I know the agony and ecstasy of dealing with health challenges.<br><br>Having been there and done that, I wish you enough to know that that not every mother's son is as lucky as you are. Not every father's daughter is as fortunate as your wife or your sister.<br><br>My dream is for Singapore to have a Prime Mini$ter who is carefull. A PM who does not <span style="font-style: italic;">chui kong lumpar song</span> (talk-cock-sing-song) but sincerely has the heart to really care for the less endowed and not insult the intelligence of those he rules over.<br><br>Happy National Day but please do not hog the limelight with all white when celebration is on at the Padang. If only your lapdog media show some footage of opposition members celebrating at NDP, your credibility will have rise a few notches :) Instead of fixing them all the time, try giving them a break. Give Singaporeans a break! It'll do good for your reputation!<br><br>While I'm at it, can you please do your bit to save the life of Yong Vui Kong? With you and your dad's connection, I'm sure you can do some in the Cabinet to get the President to pardon Yong. Please let him do time instead of sending him to the Jolly Hangman. I know it's tough but can tell lawyer colleague Sham not to make it more difficult for the boy who's young enough to be your son.<br><br>Thank you in advance.<br><br>Note: Speech in <span style="font-style: italic;">italics</span> extracted from asiaone.com [<a style="color: #bb3300;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20100808-231103.html">Link</a>]<br><br>feedmetothefish</p>

              <p>PM Lee Hsien Long will discuss the 
                      approaches to these issues, as well as 'how the policies can be improved
                       and refined in order to secure Singapore's future'. -- ST PHOTO: 
                      DESMOND LIM<br><br>SOME of the year's most debated political issues will get an airing on Sunday's National Day Rally.</p>
              <p>A statement from the Prime Minister's Office on Saturday 
                      said there would be four main themes on the agenda: the economy, the 
                      education system, the immigration policy and the Singapore spirit.</p>
              <p>It added that PM Lee Hsien Long will discuss the approaches 
                      to these issues, as well as 'how the policies can be improved and 
                      refined in order to secure Singapore's future'.</p>
              <p>Marine Parade GRC MP Lim Biow Chuan, who is the deputy 
                      chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee on education, told 
                      The Straits Times that he was surprised to see that education cropped up
                       in this year's speech.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, he was heartened that the topic would now be 
                      discussed at the highest level. 'Education is an important aspect in 
                      every one's lives, and is key in how Singapore develops in the future,' 
                      he said.</p>
              <p>While the dispute over the weightage of mother tongue 
                      languages in the Primary School Leaving Examination has been the hottest
                       education policy topic this year, Mr Lim said he was hoping for PM Lee 
                      to take a broad look at the whole education system.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_572306.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_572306.html</a></p>
