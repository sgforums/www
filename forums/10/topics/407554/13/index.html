              <p>Elections most likely not this year, cause PM has to wait for policy (eg HDB) changes to take effect, which is 3-6 months, before he announce to Singaporeans that he has managed to control the price of your HDB flat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will also notice that MRTs are getting less crowded because they have increased the train frequency. All this done in the preparation for GE. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You could ask yourselves this, they could have increased the MRT frequency for the past few years. Why have they not done so? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Because last time, not enough staff to handle MRT, as election loom ahead, I think MPs and senior  rank civil servants also joined in to run the MRT system, you maybe surprise to see MPs handling MRT, most would have a cap on..to them, it worthwhile the effort, few months of suffering, end up 4 years of wealthy income, why not??</p>
              <p>Today they increased the freq to meet the General Election objective,</p>
              <p>after the General Election, they will also increase, but this time will be General Electricity</p>

              <p>Doesn't help the articles on the mainstream media that sometimes seemingly insult the intelligence of their readers. Case in point a recent article in the New Paper about how this reporter tried to avoid the services of all foreigners for three days, naturally she had problems and hence concluded at the end of the article "hey it's hard with em', but it'll be worse if Singapore didn't have them."</p>
              <p>Which is completely missing the point. The point is not that we have foreigners, of course we have a need for them. The point is current policies are importing them under conditions that are unfair to local citizens, and this inequity is not being addressed sufficiently. I don't see them writing any serious articles on that. What they have been accusing locals of is being xenophobic.</p>

              <p>A
              majority of Yahoo! Answers users disagree that the monetary incentives
              laid out by the government would “cheapen” the national duty of serving
              <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+national+service&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">National Service (NS)</a>.</p>
              <p>That sums up the sentiments of most respondents who responded to a question posted by Yahoo! Answers, “<a href="http://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnoRILdL1lFQut_eEYsuC3D44gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20100831193531AAxJG2T">Should NS contribution be rewarded with money?</a>“</p>
              <p>In his <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+day+rally&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">National Day Rally</a> speech, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lee+hsien+loong&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">PM Lee Hsien Loong</a> announced that NSmen will receive monetary rewards to recognise their contributions to the country.</p>
              <p>According to the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+ministry+of+defence&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ministry Of Defence</a>,
              NSmen will receive up to $3,500 after the completion of each of the
              three cycles. There are a total of three significant stages in NS: 
              Operationally Ready Date (ORD), Reservist training and Post-Reservist.
              This means Singaporean NSmen are eligible to receive up to $10,500 in
              monetary incentives.</p>
              <p>Most of the respondents applauded the move and see it as a positive step to recognise the efforts of NSmen.</p>
              <p>Yahoo! Answers user <em>Emmanuel </em>said, “Yes, rewarding NS
              contribution with money is most welcomed. This is one thing our
              government has the ability to provide to its citizens. With the high
              cost of living in Singapore, this can be a big help to the servicemen.”</p>
              <p>Another user, <em>Notgatherox</em>, said, “NS men can use the money to pay for university when they leave NS.”</p>
              <p>“Getting money for NS recognises NS men as valuable, and since they
              have devoted their years to NS, they should get something in return,”
              he added.</p>
              <p>“Everyone knows that money cannot buy time. However, I applaud the
              government for giving out this incentive. It gives a sense of
              appreciation for the men who have served the country”, said <em>Wandi</em>.</p>
              <p>One user, <em>Mats </em>said, “This should be seen as a very
              positive and good step and motivate all NSmen as they are getting an
              additional incentive in addition to the opportunity to serve the
              motherland.”</p>
              <p>Then, there are those who argued that those who have completed their NS should not be forgotten.</p>
              <p>Said <em>Derek</em>, “We hope the government can still remember the first generation of NSmen who set the base for SAF in the 60′s And 70′s.”</p>
              <p><em>Jack K</em> agreed, “If it is a form of recognition then it
              should apply to all who have served and that includes those who have
              already served and completed their reservist cycle.”</p>
              <p>“It is not fair to the older group whom served their best and gave
              the best to the nation and was not even remembered or recognised,” said
              another user, <em>Anthony Korea</em>.</p>
              <p>However, there were some who felt that the incentives would “cheapen” their services and as NS is a national duty.</p>
              <p>Among them, <em>Kee Hock </em>said, “Being Singaporean is about
              loyalty and love for the country; it’s a true-blue qualitative and
              emotional bond. Money will just cheapen it.”</p>
              <p><em>BB L</em> commented,”It’s our duty to serve our nation, to protect our family and friends. Monetary reward is secondary.”</p>
              <p>“It’s a duty to serve Singapore. The early generation of national servicemen served with pride without such reward,” said <em>Alison Chan</em>.</p>

              <p>Under the rule, all the reporters have to end up writing fairy tales and listening to Gold 90 FM.</p>

              <p>Unless the readers are blind, the sentiments and truth are there for every one to see.</p>
              <p>I would suggest that the event to be scrapped and released as a statement or video so that the money used for event can be donated to more charity organisations.</p>

              <p>In his <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+day+rally&amp;amp;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;cs=bz">National Day Rally</a> speech, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lee+hsien+loong&amp;amp;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;cs=bz">PM Lee Hsien Loong</a> announced that NSmen will receive monetary rewards to recognise their contributions to the country.</p>
              <p>According to the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+ministry+of+defence&amp;amp;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;cs=bz">Ministry Of Defence</a>, NSmen will receive up to $3,500 after the completion of each of the three cycles. There are a total of three significant stages in NS:  Operationally Ready Date (ORD), Reservist training and Post-Reservist. This means Singaporean NSmen are eligible to receive up to $10,500 in monetary incentives.</p>
              <p>Most of the respondents applauded the move and see it as a positive step to recognise the efforts of NSmen.</p>
              <p>Yahoo! Answers user <em>Emmanuel</em> said, “Yes, rewarding NS contribution with money is most welcomed. This is one thing our government has the ability to provide to its citizens. With the high cost of living in Singapore, this can be a big help to the servicemen.”</p>
              <p>Another user, <em>Notgatherox</em>, said, “NS men can use the money to pay for university when they leave NS.”</p>
              <p>“Getting money for NS recognises NS men as valuable, and since they have devoted their years to NS, they should get something in return,” he added.</p>
              <p>“Everyone knows that money cannot buy time. However, I applaud the government for giving out this incentive. It gives a sense of appreciation for the men who have served the country”, said <em>Wandi</em>.</p>
              <p>One user, <em>Mats</em> said, “This should be seen as a very positive and good step and motivate all NSmen as they are getting an additional incentive in addition to the opportunity to serve the motherland.”</p>
              <p>Then, there are those who argued that those who have completed their NS should not be forgotten.</p>
              <p>Said <em>Derek</em>, “We hope the government can still remember the first generation of NSmen who set the base for SAF in the 60′s And 70′s.”</p>
              <p><em>Jack K</em> agreed, “If it is a form of recognition then it should apply to all who have served and that includes those who have already served and completed their reservist cycle.”</p>
              <p>“It is not fair to the older group whom served their best and gave the best to the nation and was not even remembered or recognised,” said another user, <em>Anthony Korea</em>.</p>
              <p>However, there were some who felt that the incentives would “cheapen” their services and as NS is a national duty.</p>
              <p>Among them, <em>Kee Hock</em> said, “Being Singaporean is about loyalty and love for the country; it’s a true-blue qualitative and emotional bond. Money will just cheapen it.”</p>
              <p><em>BB L</em> commented,”It’s our duty to serve our nation, to protect our family and friends. Monetary reward is secondary.”</p>
              <p>“It’s a duty to serve Singapore. The early generation of national servicemen served with pride without such reward,” said <em>Alison Chan</em>.</p>
