              <p>The reason Prof Koo gave, for not paying the 9k to those who have already completed their NS cycles is: "Govt policy is never retroactive."</p>
              <p>I think that's a load of bull :) Many of the older generation got GST credits of additional $100 for having served NS in their life.</p>
              <p>And since the PM knew that it would not be retroactive, he shouldn't have mentioned during the NDR that he has incentive for NSmen. What is this? Win the battle but lose the war haha.</p>

              <p>Thank-you PM for giving the big bonus to NSmen. As a person who is fast approaching 50, I don't need the S9k as urgently as finding a good stable job. I did not mention salary because I can accept the same lower salary as FT, and put in equally long hours as FT for the employers. But, does PM you know the ground situation is that local employers are shunting many middle age people who are equally qualified as any new FTs, and maybe have more real-life experiences than many new FTs. This is the bleak condition of job that post 40-years old singaporeans are facing that no amount of money can compensate.</p>

              <p>I thought you were very clear about different issues.</p>
              <p>I agree with the predicament of those who in the 40s and the 50s when foreigners such as expats and FT who took over their jobs, for whatever reasons.</p>
              <p>I agree that full time housewife should be given some allowance if they give up their job to look after babies or old folks. I agree that the government doesn't seem to be aware, or are not addressing the issues sufficiently.</p>
              <p>How does mindef help those who were injured during ns is an ongoing issue that should be addressed. I am surprised if there is nothing already in place.</p>
              <p>How do all these issues become connected to the money given in recognition of ns men?</p>

              <p>Many Yahoo! Answers users feel PM 
              Lee’s National Day Rally addressed all their key concerns but some felt 
              more had to be done to study the long-term impact of foreign immigrants 
              into the country.</p>
              <p>That sums up the views of over 130 Answers users who  responded to a question on Yahoo! Answers, <a href="http://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100828094010AAFS4mz&amp;cp=1">“What are your thoughts on this year’s National Day Rally?”</a></p>
              <p>In his National Day Rally speech on Sunday, PM Lee Hsien Loong 
              addressed four key issues — the economy, immigration, education and the 
              Singaporean spirit. He also announced that the government would slow 
              down the intake of immigrants to 80,000 instead of 100,000 this year.</p>
              <p>And although some respondents welcomed the government’s announcement,
               others remain concerned over the policy’s long-term impact.</p>
              <p>User <em>Cocoon</em>, said that “Suddenly I feel like a foreigner in 
              my own country. Too many of them in too short a time. Maybe it is time 
              that they should stop taking in new immigrants.”</p>
              <p> Answers user<em>, Lawrence</em> said more had to be done to educate 
              immigrants on the local culture and to assimilate them into Singapore’s 
              multi-racial community.</p>
              <p>“What I am afraid is the loss of our cultural identity with too many 
              foreigners coming into our country without the proper cultural 
              education,” he said.</p>
              <p>“What many Singaporeans are facing is cultural displacement as 
              foreigners insists on speaking their own language and forming 
              sub-cultures within our borders. Just wondering who is assimilating who 
              and what?… Thankfully, I am bilingual but what about those people who 
              don’t speak Chinese like our Malay and Indian brothers and sisters?”, he
               added.</p>
              <p>Other also felt PM Lee failed to address marginalised groups such as the less fortunate and handicapped.</p>
              <p>“The less fortunate still don’t get better attention and to share the glory of Singapore’s success,” said user <em>valiant</em>.</p>
              <p>“Unemployed Singaporeans and their future not mentioned. To upgrade 
              and land a job, or retire, etc. Job creation for this group of people 
              never mentioned. This is helpful for those who are currently unemployed 
              or those who will be unemployed when they are over 40,” said <em>CPFer</em>.</p>
              <p>However, there were also those who felt the speech addressed the key concerns and fears Singaporeans grapple with daily.</p>
              <p><em>True Repentance</em> called it <em>“</em>one of the best National
               Day Rally speeches in years”. He applauded PM Lee for highlighting ”the
               Singapore Spirit that was dreamt of and driven by our forefathers”.</p>
              <p>Another user, <em>ME</em>, said his fears were addressed.</p>
              <p>“Many of my negative thoughts turned positive after (listening to) Prime Minister, Mr Lee Hsien Long’s speech,” he said.</p>
              <p>“I used to question: ‘Is the influx of foreign workers and immigrants
               really necessary?’, ‘Will Singaporean have lesser rights in future?’, 
              ‘Will the over-crowded train problem be solved?’ etc. There is some 
              clarity now and I guess we will be able to see the light at the end of 
              the tunnel,” he added.</p>
              <p>Another user, <em>Bibik,</em> said,<em> ”</em>It (the speech) was 
              well-delivered… he sounded very sincere in his plans to help further 
              develop and improve Singapore, especially in overseeing and addressing 
              the concerns of his fellow Singaporeans<em>.</em> I am particularly 
              touched when he spoke about making plans to ensure that where education 
              is concerned, those not academically inclined would have a chance to 
              succeed.”</p>
              <p><em>Mjbhagwa</em> agreed, saying, “I really appreciate the thoughts 
              and the plan he put forward on MRT expansion as well as mitigation steps
               on rising property costs, especially HDB housing.”</p>
              <p>Another user <em>williamwl</em>, who says he is a Permanent Resident, also said Singapore citizens should be more appreciative of what they have.</p>
              <p>“No government is ever ideal, just like there is never an ideal employer in every work place,” he said.</p>
              <p>“However, if there’s more pro than cons, and everyone has a safe roof
               over their head, safety in the society, a job with decent income to 
              bring up the family, that’s good enough… I am just another immigrant , 
              like those mentioned by your PM in his speech… but an appreciative one. 
              What about you?”</p>
