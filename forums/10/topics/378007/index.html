              <p class="Title_Big_News" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-right: 6px;" dir="ltr"><strong><strong> <strong><span style="color: gray; font-size: x-small;"> TEHRAN -- International Atomic Energy
              Agency Director General Mohamed ElBaradei has called Israel’s nuclear
              arsenal the most serious threat in the region. </span></strong><span style="color: #336699;"><br> </span> </strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">At
              a joint press conference with Atomic Energy Organization of Iran
              Director Ali-Akbar Salehi in Tehran on Sunday, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ElBaradei said that
              Israel has not granted IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear facilities
              for thirty years. </span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Israel is the only player in the Middle East that possesses nuclear weapons. </span><br><br>The Zionist regime first began developing a nuclear reactor in the southern desert town of Dimona in the 1950s.
              <br><br>It is unclear if and when it developed its first nuclear weapon
              and how many of them it has since obtained, but foreign intelligence
              estimates have commonly put the number at up to 200.
              <br><br>ElBaradei insisted that the international community and the
              IAEA would take the measures necessary to promote world peace and
              guarantee international security.
              <br><br>He said he came to Iran to discuss technical cooperation and issues about power plant equipment.
              <br><br>“Iran’s nuclear issue can be resolved through dialogue and
              diplomacy, and I have never seen such determination to resolve this
              issue,” he told reporters.
              <br><br>Iran, the 5+1 group, and the IAEA have held constructive
              negotiations, and U.S. President Barack Obama and Iranian President
              Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have both expressed optimism about the talks.
              <br><br>Negotiators from Iran and the 5+1 group (France, the United
              States, Russia, China, Britain, and Germany) gathered in Geneva on
              October 1 to discuss Iran’s updated package of proposals.
              <br><br>ElBaradei also announced that IAEA inspectors will visit Iran’s new nuclear fuel enrichment facility on October 25.
              <br><br>“It is important for us to send our inspectors to do a
              comprehensive verification of that facility, to assure ourselves that
              it is a facility that is built for peaceful purposes,” he said. “We
              agreed that our inspectors would come here on the 25th of October to do
              the inspection and to go to Qom, and I hope and I trust that Iran will
              be as transparent with our inspectors team as possible.”
              <br><br>Iran has mastered nuclear technology but there are a few remaining questions about the country’s intentions, he added.
              <br><br>Iran has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle and related technology
              and possesses a research reactor, but the main issue is the need to
              address the concerns of the international community, he noted.
              <br><br>ElBaradei called on Tehran to observe the terms of the
              additional protocol to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to address
              the world’s concerns.
              <br><br>He went on to say that there is no evidence of diversion in
              Iran’s nuclear activities and the IAEA cannot act based on allegations
              made by certain countries.
              <br><br>“As I have said many times and I continue to say today, the
              agency has no complete proof that there is an ongoing weapons program
              in Iran,” ElBaradei stated.
              <br><br>Commenting on Iran’s request for 20 percent enriched nuclear
              fuel for the Tehran research reactor, he said Salehi is scheduled to
              travel to Vienna on October 19 to discuss the issue with officials from
              the U.S., Russia, and France.
              <br><br>Certain countries have said they are ready to provide Iran
              with the 20 percent enriched nuclear fuel, which is a sign of their
              good will, he added. </span></strong></strong></p>
