            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, APG-66 or not. Hawks in Dogfights will be chewed to bits.  Sidewinders can only fire 30 degrees off boresight, Hawks will still have to try bringing their nose on speedier targets.  Making such hard turns reduces airspeed, and airspeed is crucial in aircombat.  It doesnt have the power to regain its airspeed, hence its a dead duck.<br><br>If the Hawkeyes aren't a factor, then I would try running a small flight of Hawks low, radar off and emcon.  Might be able to pull off a hit and run with the hawks.</div>

As for problems with the E-2s I have read something which agreed with what YourFather has said: that the E-2s lower UHF frequency hampers its ability over land, although in the current regional threat environment jamming is less of a worry. I do think that why the E-2s have not been upgraded significantly(face it: the so-called local upgrade is cosmetic) and why we haven't purchased more is that we are definitely looking at more advanced AEW systems. This is however secondary, and I don't really believe that the powers that be have placed too high a priority on this for the moment...<br><br>BTW, sending your AEW platform with an inbound strike package is akin to suicide. The AEW platform is supposed to stay inside friendly airspace to help extend you control of your own airspace and give your guys extra sets of eyes when they in enemy territory. Maybe you've got it mixed up with EW and SEAD assets which are the ones accompanying the strike package, of which the E-2 is not...</div>

Sending E-2 together with the strike package is indeed sucidal.<br><br>What I was trying to say that E-2C APG-125 radar has a range of 250 KM (maybe more). However, RSAF will be looking at sending aircraft for deep penetration strikes. This will involve aircraft going beyond the 250 radius. The E-2C will have to direct friendly aircraft to provide air cover. This may involve flying over enemies territory. Assuming that the E-2C are protected by air superiority fighters/interceptors, they will still have to move with sufficient speed to keep up with the tempo of the warfare. Secondly, I believe the AWACS type aircraft do fly in a "zip-zap" pattern.  I am not suggeting that the AEW aircrafts take unnecessary risk and expose themselves to harms way. I am suggesting that to assist providing early warning coverage for the strike packages where the targets are deep in the enemy's land, the AEW might have to fly over enemy's land.<br><br>I am observing that both Japan and Israel are phasing out their E2C in favor of jet-based AWACS and Phalcon platforms. The RAAF also did not consider the Hercs-cum-AEW bid seriously too. Wedgetail was the favourite, followed by the Airbus/Raytheon/IAI bid.<br><br>Just my 2 cents<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, having more AEW platforms would really help.  I mean, we can afford to release more crew and platform for joint-exercises.  That would give us valuable experience.</div>

Why haven't they consider buying either the HARM or ALARM?<br><br></div>
