            <div class='col-md body'>(posted to Feedback Unit in reply to Mansonm, on 31.3.2006)<br><br>So I take it you now understand that I have posted my views based on facts and substance.<br><br>I have no disagreement with your view that our leaders have done well up to 1970s. Our leaders must not rest on their laurel of past success. They obviously have allowed some of the past policy assumptions to dominate for far too long. As a result, there exist many problems in recent years as posted.<br><br>Our leaders are still too reluctant to accept that their past policies have caused problems. High cost of living with utilities and basic housing now taking away a big chunk of average earning of ordinary workers. Wages have dropped terribly compared with earlier years. Asset values have fallen by 30% on average. So it is wrong to pretend these are not the problems.<br><br>One major problem is we are now lacking heavy-weight ministers of the calibre of Dr. Goh Keng Swee and Hon Sui Seng who could accomplish economic restructuring as promised in the 1970s. Our recent ministers do not understand motivation, and relationship between high costs, economic vibrancy, self-relience and entrepreneurship which are more crucial than creating surpluses.<br><br>There are too many idea men and very little action men among the ministers in charge of the cconomy.<br><br>So far despite many economic restructuring exercises, we are losing out to other Asian tigers who are surging ahead in technology applications from electronics to IT and telecommunication.<br><br>We should not keep pretending that all is well when our domestic sector of the economy is very weak and hardly growing despite our GLC-dominated GDP recovering recently after the prolongerd recessions long after other Asian tigers have recovered.<br><br>So I am not that wrong in saying that our post-1970 ministers have failed in resructuring the economy and that is the principal reason our economy had fumbled so hadly in the recent recessions in recent years.<br><br>We need a heavy-weight minister who can change the past policy aimed only or mainly at attracting foreign investments. They must have the passions and determination to strategically upgrade our own domesitc sector to value-adding technology-driven model.<br><br>Even India, Thailand where ministers are not paid half of what our ministers are paid and without the constant habit of boasting their ministers' leadership and talents are doing better than our ministers of late.<br><br>Government should not cover up such problems and shortcomings. They can rebut or debunk my views about such failures if they want to. I don't think the economic recovery in 2004/5 mean anything unless they have fundamentally addressed the whole of education, and practical knowledge application at all levels.<br><br>They should serve the people with humbleness, due diligence and not boastfulness, assumptions or look-good justifications.<br><br>Ministers should now set up an economic master plan which is modelled after the Korean or Taiwanese, Finland or Switzerland to encourage all to apply the latest technology and knowledge instead of all the empty slogans about creativity, talents, foreign investments and their own abilities.<br><br></div>

To get into their model, things will needed to remodel, and culture needed to change, etc. The current employment system for foreigners also needed to review strictly.
