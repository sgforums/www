            <div class='col-md body'>One-man-one-vote parliamentary democracy is not perfect from the short-term perspective especially in countries previously mismanaged or run down under dictatorship, corruption which try to turn to democracy for cure.<br><br>Although parliamentary democracy is imperfect it offers greater options with alternatives provided by mass participation from a diversity of talents existing in such a system. It offers more options beside the options to choose the best talents to run the country. It can be relied upon to solve wide range of problems not possible in dictatorship or autocracy faced in nation building.<br><br>There can be no apple-to-apple comparison and it would be wrong to say that democracy fails because it fails in Indonesia or Phillippines or Thailand as what Singapore autocrat wants its citizens to believe in order to practise autocratic control.<br><br>Indonesia or Thailand cannot succeed as well as many other democracies in Scandinavian countries because of other deeper history problems due to other causes. So Indonesia will remain a corrupt or inefficient country no matter what kind of system is in control due to past problems. Over time Indonesia will do better under democracy. Without democracy many such countries will have gone from bad to worse.<br><br>In a parliamentary democracy there will arise over time social and cultural institutions to nurture the value system for the society where people become more matured and less selfish to work for their own personal gains or own personal advancement or power.<br><br>Leadership in such countries will be moulded by the people as the people through their social and cultural evolution will by popular demand throw up the best candidates to serve. Everyone is such a matured diverse democracy will reserve leadership for people who have the right qualities to serve them. They will be openly recognised by all to be the de-facto leader.<br><br>People's role in society will be to nurture conditions for respect of higher social and cultural values and people who are selfish or self-serving will be rejected by such a system.<br><br>When we reach such a social evolution, people will not work for themselves but will be identified from public service or social interactions by peers who will nominate them for leadership without any special motives or hidden agendas.<br><br>Party affliliations will be a matter of form and people will not be siding any power or party or any faction for selfish reasons but because everyone is matured and can understand his role he is playing given a strong tradition of accountability and transparency in every aspect of government.</div>

He must ride on the goodness of democracy to tap on its power of creativity and entrepreneurship through mass participation to get those wealth.<br><br>But democracy is such a good brand name so he will use its name to get what he wants. By using the name or outward form of democracy he can get people to believe him and deal with him.<br><br>Democracy is a good system as it provides alternatives and respects choice and freedoms of contract and rule of laws for the common people to do well and thrive but monarch does not like all these jazz. There will be headache with too many opinions and accountability and whatnots.<br><br>Monarchy goes by edit personal authority and devine power from heaven called leadership or elitism or talents which will make people afraid and obey nowadays. So a modern monarch is different from the ancient monarch as modern monarch is smarter and knows how to get wealth by using the good names of democracy and elites and talents for his own purpose but will forbid anyone to speak and call them liar as he wishes.<br><br>A modern monarch wants to give a good democratic appearance at the so called election or GRC times and will give out something to get the citizens to vote for show. He has no problem in getting votes because he has used his monarchy edit to forbid voting by GRC but nevertheless has to use democracy to attract investments from far and wide and citizens will have to be made to believe and slog for whatever is left of the so-called democracy which exists only in name sake.<br><br>Monarchy benefits only certain loyal subjects called elites who over time will evolve into positions bestowed by the monarch for loyalty. Monarch wants to have use of them to control the rest of the serfdom as he needs them to hold on to power and grab wealth.<br><br>But monarchy without modern-days economic profits cannot bring enough to the kingdom as there will not be rich middle classes and highly successful people with talents to slog and pay all the COEs or market HDB prices for the monarchy.<br><br>So by hook or by crook, monarchy must not say he is a monarch but must say he is a democrat and add that democracy is too liberal and needs to be modified for good order sake.</div>

Only against Elitist education system<br>(Yes, Countries like Finland have a more egalitarian system where oppourtunities abound for its people regardless of early childhood performance. Streaming starts very late, and much help is given to the weaker students, not lip service help in Singapore like "teaching at a slower pace" using streaming but genuine help. Somehow i think that as long as the Elitist LKY is around, we will never have a system where resources and benefits are more evenly distributed.<br><br>If they can put these right, i would vote for no 2<br><br>If not i hope long run it will be no 5 (No PAP to represent Singapore)</div></blockquote>Let me give another side of the coin.<br><br>1) Singapore is running quite a different system from many countries. We are living in a paternalistic democracy society, where we have our government to think what is "good" for us. Of course there might be pros and cons for the people. Not many of us wanted to be controlled as compared in the early 1970s and 1980s where our former PM, LKY was running our country.<br><br>The second reason where I read from the book by Mr. Alan Chong where he write about our 2nd PM, GCT, where he said the reason why Singapore needs a paternalistic system is because our people is the only resources and investment we have. We need to retain the talents and expand globally. Our human resource might be the only asset we have; otherwise it might the demise of Singapore.<br><br>2) No doubt our ministers are getting one of the highest paid salaries in the world. Maybe it will useful if the government can give a explicit explanation on this.<br><br>3) In many developed nations, people can be jobless and survived with governmentÂ’s financial aid. That means many of them can be free-lanced artists or pursue their own interest. Therefore, the emphasis of education is much lesser compare to our country. However, in Singapore, we are paper driven society, which has constrained parents to be Â“competitiveÂ” to their children. Education system is a base that develops our limited talents and be competitive in the future.<br><br>Maybe a lot of forumers may not agree with my views, but my stand is neither for nor against the PAP. But I believe our common goal will be the contribution to the success of Singapore future.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to see that day coming soon when autocracy will hand over to free market economy thriving on creativity and entrepreneurship of people operating under wheeling and dealing in all spheres.<br><br>Only a wheeling and dealing free market thriving all all kinds of ideas without all the kiasu policies and controls will we prosper our better educated work force now struggling with high costs and other restraints in every sphere.<br><br>Only by unleashing our people's potential into one championing free market wheeling and dealing will the educated work force be able to succeed in working together to push for a bigger economy and greater success.<br><br>For the wheeling and dealing economy to be brought about, we need very large entrepreneurship of the Sands type to set the pace.<br><br>So it would be good to see Sands becoming a major privateer which will take over some companies like the GLCs and throw up the whole government-control economy back to the private sector to grow bigger pies.<br><br>GLCs do not increase the total economic pies or enliven or stimulate the private sector wheeling and dealing. They can at the most succeed in creating bigger grouping to look good. Look at what happened to MediaCorp and Mediawork, SIA and PSA and HDB. Up a certain point, they would just become bureaucratic and started to fumble. If these are in private hands they would be multiplying many folds.<br><br>Is that day likely to be soon?
