Too free and libreal, and things will easy go wrong ... look at Enron and United Airways, dun tell me, it is isolated cases ... </div></blockquote>Sadly, many of the fears instilled in citizens were uncalled for and unwarranted e.g. the constant harping on the dangers of our falling into chaos and lawlessness if we are to follow liberal democracy of USA, Thailand, Indonesia or Phillippines.<br><br>Why avoid making comparison with Scandivian democracies like Finland, Switzerland which are closer to our historical perspective? Why not try to catch up with more advanced and successful democracies practising creative and innovative wheeling and dealing of private sector economy through practical broad-based education and free-market economic policies.<br><br>If we had followed better models of democracies instead of always brainwashing citizens of the dangers or presumed dangers of liberal democracy of USA, who knows we might be able to maintain our citizens' standard of living and not caused it to drop to the third world wages and caused such prolonged asset disasters from which we are still suffering.<br><br>So it is quite wrong to believe in the propagandas that there will be chaos or scandals like the Enron to justify the continuation of existing autocratic policies on high costs and pro-foreign employment policies and using of GLCs to increase cost burdens.<br><br>Citizens have grown more educated and less likely to be frightened by propaganda as seen by the votes in Potong Pasir and AMK. Citizens want to go forward to try free market economy which of course need not necessarily mean we will have more scandals like Enron or Worldcom.<br><br>Our NKF shows our lack of good corporate governance in the whole system. Free market economy will have some scandals but they will be brought under strong control by larger forces of private sectors whose boards and stakeholders will have quicker response to check on wrong corporate policies. With GLCs we cannot check on their wrongs as seen in NKF.<br><br>So the existing autocracy does not mean it has more success in corporate governance as well as painted by propagandas.<br><br>We have still a long way to go in terms of order and good corporate governance. So free market economy will come in to free up unnecessary high costs due to double charges on lands and triple charges on vehicles and all such controlled prices will be better solved by early return of the present GLC economy to the private sector fully to allow it to thrive once more.<br><br>If we don't do this fast, we are going to experience worse implosion of the GLC economies as seen in the last two recessions when GLCs were totally quiet and unable to help grow the economy.<br><br>GLCs don't grow the economic pies but only merge the existing smaller players to look good and in control allowing them to monopolise and charge higher fees which run down the smaller players and citizens.</div>

We are living in a paternalistic democracy society, where we have our government to think what is "good" for us. Of course there might be pros and cons for the people. Not many of us wanted to be controlled as compared in the early 1970s and 1980s where our former PM, LKY was running our country.<br><br>The second reason where I read from the book by Mr. Alan Chong where he write about our 2nd PM, GCT, where he said the reason why Singapore needs a paternalistic system is because our people is the only resources and investment we have. We need to retain the talents and expand globally. Our human resource might be the only asset we have; otherwise it might the demise of Singapore.<br><br>2) No doubt our ministers are getting one of the highest paid salaries in the world. Maybe it will useful if the government can give a explicit explanation on this.<br><br>3) In many developed nations, people can be jobless and survived with governmentÂ’s financial aid. That means many of them can be free-lanced artists or pursue their own interest. Therefore, the emphasis of education is much lesser compare to our country. However, in Singapore, we are paper driven society, which has constrained parents to be Â“competitiveÂ” to their children. Education system is a base that develops our limited talents and be competitive in the future.<br><br>Maybe a lot of forumers may not agree with my views, but my stand is neither for nor against the PAP. But I believe our common goal will be the contribution to the success of Singapore future.<br><br></div></blockquote>babymac,<br><br>1) I agree we are running a paternalistic democracy. But I disagree with Alan Chong's thesis. The human-resources argument is a very flimsy support for a paternalistic system. I agree human resources are essential to our survival, but more democracy will not necessarily reduce the quality of of human resource; in fact, it might improve it, because we have more new input on ways to solve structural rigidity, and a multitude of perspectives is what we need, not just the single perspective coming from the elite-trained PAP MPs who think in one direction.<br><br>2) They gave the human-resources argument i.e. if we didn't pay our ministers high salaries, they would all go corrupt. A very poor argument indeed: what happened to the Party's value of integrity; they are saying that without high salaries, there is no integrity in the government?  How utterly ridiculous. Apparently, this is where pragmatism has superceded the importance of morals. ANother example, of course, is the (Marina Bay) I(C)R..<br><br>3) I can't tell your stand here.

Our people want freedom and democracy and I believe that the government understands too much supervision and autocracy will not gain the peopleÂ’s heart, given that our level technology and maturity needs have increased over the years. On the other hand, if too much autonomy is released radically, it might not bring postive outcome but drastic change that affect the holistic solidarity of our society.

I've got the feeling that the govt has lost track of the ground long ago (since 1986, at least). Do we have more freedom? Not from the legal point of view. Terrible laws like the Defamation Act and Sedition Act still exists, not to mention the Societies Act. Jehovah's Witnesses will certainly deny that they have more freedom. Bar-top dancing and bungee-jumping are not the kind of liberalization we are looking for when we talk about "freedom". They are the PAP's diversion from other aspects of their control which they have not relinquished yet. And besides, having those two things - as well as the I(C)R and the Esplanade - were meant to bolster our tourism scene, not benefit local Singaporeans, except maybe EXTREMELY indirectly.<br><br>2) That's the human-resources argument. In fact, it is telling us that the ministers will lose all their values the moment they don't get a good salary. And why should we compare their salaries with those of CEOs i.e. compare apples with pears? Compare them with salaries of other political leaders in the world. Ministers should be committed regardless of their salaries. Otherwise we might as well rip the PAP Constitution and the PSC Manifesto to shreds and replace both documents with the single statement "We believe that money is the most valuable asset".<br><br>3) Why is our society so paper-driven?

Do our students have any ability to push forward any change that would really be beneficial for them? Or will they rather have hands tied, because the school admin and merely step in and expel them or discipline them or bar their access to school facilities i.e. suspension/expulsion/detention.
