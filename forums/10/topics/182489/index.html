            <div class='col-md body'>Extract from NMP Steve Chia's Budget Speech Debate 2006:<br><br>18.             Table 6.2 of the Budget Highlights shows that Â“other taxes, other fees and charges, and othersÂ” account for S$4.36 billion in FY2004, S$3.87 billion in FY2005, and estimated S$3.97 billion for FY2006 respectively. These revenue receipts are higher than total GST collections of S$3.47 S$3.6 and S$3.75 billion respectively for each of the following years. Yet, they are all lumped together as Â“othersÂ” Â– together with stamp duties, foreign worker levies etc.<br>19.             Can the government be more specific about the etc etc? These are not small peanut amount of money that the government collects. The total revenue from these Â“othersÂ” is bigger than the revenue collected from the 5% GST, and I think it is important for these others to be more clearly and transparently reflected.<br>20.             From the appendix 7.1 again, we understand that the government expects to collect S$870 million from stamp duties, S$160 million in water conservation tax, and S$1 billion from Â“other taxesÂ”, although it is not reflected what this Â‘other taxesÂ’ is about Â– that it can amount to a billion dollars. Is the S$111 million collected from the Radio and TV licences reflected in this $1 billion too?<br>21.             The point I am driving is this Sir: That the government should scrap (or at least drastically reduce) the water conservation tax, the radio and TV licenses, and the Domestic Foreign worker levy. They can afford to, and they should.<br>22.             Water is an essential constituent for life. Without it, we all die. Thus the message to conserve is important. But to impose a Â‘water conservation taxÂ’ from the first drop of water coming out from the tap is wrong. People should not be taxed for at least the first 15 cubic meter of water needed for daily necessities and living. Any taxes imposed on the excess water used above that amount will be reasonable. Not below it.<br>23.             This is especially so since the technology to produce desalinated water is here, and water is no longer a limited resource, constantly threatened to be cut off by our Malaysian neighbors. With this new secured source of unlimted water supply from the sea, residents should be charged fair market rate from the provision of such water, and not be imposed such out-dated unfair taxes. I hope the Ministry of Environment and water resources will expedite their reviews and remove it soon.<br>24.             As for TV and Radio license fees, it is not fair for residents to do national service, and subsidize our national objective of promoting local content developers. That economic objective should be funded by the government. The government can afford to subsidize more than the current S$5 million given for this fledging industry. License fee holders should not be asked to fund this government objective. This is an out-dated tax and should be reviewed and abolished soon. Only England, Ireland and some other commonwealth states continue to impose this license fees. Other developed nations like America no longer impose such fees to subsidize national broadcasters. I hope MICA will act on this soon.<br>25.             The Government should also reduce the foreign domestic worker levy, so that the minimum pay of these migrant workers can be raised. It is incredible that the government earns more from its levies than the domestic worker herself.  This is cruel, and profits excessively from the undue hardship of migrant workers. With better pay, Singaporeans can recruit more experience maids to look after their families Â– and not the fresh young maids coming here with adjustment problems, and no experience of working in a high-rise flat. The experienced ones are going Hong Kong and other countries leaving Singapore with new inexperienced workers. Looking at total government receipts, the government can well afford to be kinder.<span style="color: red;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: darkblue;"></span><span style="color: darkblue;"></span></div>

This is cruel, and profits excessively from the undue hardship of migrant workers.</span> With better pay, Singaporeans can recruit more experience maids to look after their families Â– and not the fresh young maids coming here with adjustment problems, and no experience of working in a high-rise flat. The experienced ones are going Hong Kong and other countries leaving Singapore with new inexperienced workers.

If the foreign workers are not statisfied with their pay, they can choose not to work in Singapore. It's a willing-buyer and willing-seller issue.<br><br>A domestic helper in Hong Kong earns a minimum wage of HK$3670 under their manpower laws (excluding the US$51 levy and other requirements on the employer). That's about S$860. Even if the government waive the full levy, they'll still earn than those in Singapore. I'm sure the opposition has done research on this but why does he still suggest this then? Lack of proper research or on purpose to gain support from local <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and foreigners</span>?<br><br>Why would our government want to reduce the levy, give the money to domestic workers and contribute to a foreign economy?<br><br>There are tons of poor people in Asia. In China, a typical worker in poorer province earns no more than US$87 a month.<br><br>The government should reduce it's levy.

            <div class='col-md body'>What about the non-domestic conservation tax?  For businesses that need to use a lot of water, it is not easy for the agency to decide when the usage is excessive. However, the blanket application of the conservation tax of 30% on all units of water used, say in a coffee shop that need a lot of water to wash the dirty dishes, could indirectly influence the price of a drink.</div>
