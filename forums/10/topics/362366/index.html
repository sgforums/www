              <p>Alex Jones is kind of crazy. He makes lots of things up to sell his films, too, so it's a good idea to check out his statements against facts from other sources.</p>
              <p>Part of the reason Singapore has the organized society is because of the strict policing, but it's also because of culture and it might be nice to have less interference from the police into our daily lives.</p>

              <p>Singapore is not a police state, but of course, the police belongs to the state, I gather that, since Singapore is a peaceful country, the police got less job to do, most probably they would walks around and see gals, or catch gals in geyland, some even set up legal pros business to increase their income. Always remember that police are connected to crook, both play their game and sometime both share it. Of course i am stating those high ranks and full time policemen, for those doing NS, they are there just passing time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And please remember, police are also human, bound to corruption, sex and molesting etc etc...the only different is police can cover up their crime, citizen will be expose fully and taken as an example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To what i see in my neighbourhood police office, I think police should cut staff, trim and be lean, if ICA needs staff, some from CIA or Anti vice etc etc can be transfer over, they dun have to employ more peoples, however, our police depts seem to work thru individualism, CIA is CIA, ISA and ISA, TP is TP etc etc, each pushing each other to take responsibilities, that is very sad, Mr. Wong Kan Seng should make police interchangeable so that all depts and sections can be more flexible and better interconnected, it will also curb corruption and abuse of power, therefore the managing of the police that belong to the state is critical.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is of no use writing reports after reports just for show, police should be practical men doing practical tasks, rather than just sitting behind a desk writing reports, they should make an effort to visit the place or areas where the crimes occur as reported. But it seem that our police force are also Kiasee and Kiasu type.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore in the end, I conclude that our police force is there for show only, with their presence, at least the crooks stay away, but to fire a piston correctly, i think they are still far far away.</p>

              <p>I have lived in and outside of singapore  6mths to 1 years occasionaly and can fairly say, Singapore police personnels attitude is really fair. They are corruption free and unbiased. On political situations they may react differently, i am not aware of that. But, far from comparing to other countries, they are good. Though, i had a bitter incident few years back in pulau ubin, but, those are stray and exceptions. I don't want to judge the whole force with exceptions. That incident was, when we visited the island and returning to the jetty to aboard boat back to changi, few police men came and one of them asked our identity, when i showed my id and my friends Visitpass, he immediately told us, ok, you are visitor, i need to inquire u, so come to the booth. I was really shocked, because that was the first time, even with the proper documents, they are calling for an inquiry without any reason. Then i made my point for what reason my friend as to be for an inquiry and he suddenly backed up and his fellow colleagues interfered and sent us. There were several cacausians also on that same place and he enquired only us and it makes my friend embarrased and he still points out whenever we met in India.</p>
