              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Singapore is not a police state, but of course, the police
              belongs to the state, I gather that, since Singapore is a peaceful
              country, the police got less job to do, most probably they would
              walks around and see gals, or catch gals in geyland, some even set
              up legal pros business to increase their income. Always remember
              that police are connected to crook, both play their game and
              sometime both share it. Of course i am stating those high ranks and
              full time policemen, for those doing NS, they are there just
              passing time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And please remember, police are also human, bound to corruption,
              sex and molesting etc etc...the only different is police can
              cover up their crime, citizen will be expose fully and taken
              as an example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To what i see in my neighbourhood police office, I think police
              should cut staff, trim and be lean, if ICA needs staff, some from
              CIA or Anti vice etc etc can be transfer over, they dun have to
              employ more peoples, however, our police depts seem to work thru
              individualism, CIA is CIA, ISA and ISA, TP is TP etc etc, each
              pushing each other to take responsibilities, that is very sad, Mr.
              Wong Kan Seng should make police interchangeable so that all depts
              and sections can be more flexible and better interconnected, it
              will also curb corruption and abuse of power, therefore the
              managing of the police that belong to the state is critical.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is of no use writing reports after reports just for show,
              police should be practical men doing practical tasks, rather than
              just sitting behind a desk writing reports, they should make an
              effort to visit the place or areas where the crimes occur as
              reported. But it seem that our police force are also Kiasee and
              Kiasu type.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore in the end, I conclude that our police force is there
              for show only, with their presence, at least the crooks stay away,
              but to fire a piston correctly, i think they are still far far
              away.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>On the surface of course all the same, all are police, the last time when someone scratched my car in a car park said to have camera, i reported to the neighbourhood police, then they write report and ask me to report to Traffic Police to view the camera, and when i visited the TP, they said the camera need town council to authorise, and asked me to go back, then they send a letter to ask me to go CID for an investigation about a foreigner culprit that they saw in the camera scratching my car, they even accuse me of having a connection with the culprit, OMG!!!. I become the fall gal, then I ask for the viewing of the picture, they said, i need to get a lawyer. I went back and report to ICA for further investigation. I give up, i told them that if they want to catch the culprit go ahead, dun bother me anymore...and if they want to summon me up, get a police warrant, dun disturb me anymore, i just paid $500 to repair and life goes on...OMG, they are really doing pushing game. U get the picture?? If the neighbour police can do the job, why go up to so many depts and get me involved too??? That is why I said too many eat full do nothing inside.</p>

              <p>I have lived in and outside of singapore  6mths to 1 years occasionaly and can fairly say, Singapore police personnels attitude is really fair. They are corruption free and unbiased. On political situations they may react differently, i am not aware of that. But, far from comparing to other countries, they are good. Though, i had a bitter incident few years back in pulau ubin, but, those are stray and exceptions. I don't want to judge the whole force with exceptions. That incident was, when we visited the island and returning to the jetty to aboard boat back to changi, few police men came and one of them asked our identity, when i showed my id and my friends Visitpass, he immediately told us, ok, you are visitor, i need to inquire u, so come to the booth. I was really shocked, because that was the first time, even with the proper documents, they are calling for an inquiry without any reason. Then i made my point for what reason my friend as to be for an inquiry and he suddenly backed up and his fellow colleagues interfered and sent us. There were several cacausians also on that same place and he enquired only us and it makes my friend embarrased and he still points out whenever we met in India.</p>

              <p>On the surface of course all the same, all are police, the last time when someone scratched my car in a car park said to have camera, i reported to the neighbourhood police, then they write report and ask me to report to Traffic Police to view the camera, and when i visited the TP, they said the camera need town council to authorise, and asked me to go back, then they send a letter to ask me to go CID for an investigation about a foreigner culprit that they saw in the camera scratching my car, they even accuse me of having a connection with the culprit, OMG!!!. I become the fall gal, then I ask for the viewing of the picture, they said, i need to get a lawyer. I went back and report to ICA for further investigation. I give up, i told them that if they want to catch the culprit go ahead, dun bother me anymore...and if they want to summon me up, get a police warrant, dun disturb me anymore, i just paid $500 to repair and life goes on...OMG, they are really doing pushing game. U get the picture?? If the neighbour police can do the job, why go up to so many depts and get me involved too??? That is why I said too many eat full do nothing inside.</p>

              <p>Well this information was covered by PrisonPlanet, but the study itself was undertaken by a private company dealing with privacy issues. You can get the pdf file here- <a href="https://secure.cryptohippie.com/pubs/EPS-2008.pdf">https://secure.cryptohippie.com/pubs/EPS-2008.pdf</a></p>
              <p>As it compared how governments round the world are using improving technologies to monitor almost every aspect of their citizens' lives, Singapore was ranked 7th out of 52 countries just after the US. So yes, Singapore is a police state; an electronic police state as is called these days.</p>
