Based on CSJ's cases, the sitting judges have no choice but to decide the way they did...the facts were clear. I agree that in similar circumstances many foreign leaders would not have sued in some of Jeya's cases. You can call it oversensitivity, but legally the plaintiffs were entitled to remedies.</div>
