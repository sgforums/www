              <p>From what I've read from different people who have converted to Islam,  there are a few main reasons for most conversions:</p>
              <p><br>1. Muslims and Christians agree that God is self-existent.  This means  that He does not derive his existence from anyone. Also they believe  in Jesus, love him, and honor him. In fact, no Muslim can be a Muslim  unless he or she believes in Jesus, on whom be peace.</p>
              <p>The Quran teach that Jesus is prophet or messenger from Allah and not  a God so Quran denies the divinity of Jesus. The Qur'an says that  Jesus was born of a virgin, that he spoke while he was still only a  baby, that he healed the blind and the leper by God's leave, and that  he raised the dead by God's leave.</p>
              <p> <br>2. Islam is a religious lifestyle, not just a quick Sunday morning  church visit and a label. Although some Christians do pray before each meal and spend much time with their Bible, etc.many don't in the West. Islam is something that can't be shunted into a few spare hours. You pray five times a day. Your dress code is affected; even your food choices are explained in the Qur'an. Many converts like it because  they feel actively involved and as if they are truly religious. Some  people also studied Buddhism, flirted with Roman Catholicism or spent  time with Quakers, but ultimately found them lacking.</p>
              <p><br>3. For women, it is a big and welcome change from the "in your face"  sexuality of western culture. Women are not required by the Qur'an to  veil. They are required to dress modestly and it is *recommended* that they cover their hair. However, most do veil and some go farther with  niquab (the face screen) or other traditional clothes. Women dressed  like this consider themselves marked as religious women, not easy  dates. They don't get hit on. No one gawks at their bodies. They are  clearly off limits sexually and many say it is liberating not to have to conform to western standards of sexy dress, makeup and spending so much time and money on appearance. You buy a five-dollar hair cover, put your hair in a ponytail and cover, wear long skirt and a tunic shirt -you're set.</p>
              <p><br>4. Islam is also growing because many people are not satisfied with  Christianity. They feel it is too liberal, too fluid and changes for  the culture. Islam on the other hand is more rigid and does not as a  whole allow much for modern changes and the whims of society. Many  like it because they feel other religions have loose standards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Islam has shown itself to be not only the most widespread religion in the world, but also the most dynamic, attracting converts at a faster rate than at anytime in the last 500 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A person like me who is unfamiliar with Islamic teachings might be surprised to hear that Islam is not a “religion” in the narrow sense  used by secular humanists and does not rely upon blind faith to make  its case, but rather, encourages to use minds, for example, the  Qur'an invites to ponder upon the wonders of creation, and challenges  with intellectual arguments, further study of the Qur'an demonstrates  that sound reasoning and scientific knowledge confirm rather than  contradict authentic revelation and its ability to satisfy the  intellect whilst bringing peace to the soul. Also Islam deals with  every aspect of life, spiritual and physical; its jurisprudence is  based on a creed, instruction on worship, and ordinances regarding  social, economic, and political aspects.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's what I got from Islam-online &amp; Islam way women's board and a  few other of mine. Stats taken by many college groups say that  women convert 4 times more often then men.</p>

              <p>Apr 7 2008 Exclusive by Amy Devine</p>
              <p>A PAEDOPHILE has converted to Islam and changed his name behind bars.</p>
              <p>Paul Falconer, 40, now insists bosses at Peterhead prison call him Mohammed Farooq instead.</p>
              <p>Falconer's case made legal history when his five-year-old victim
              gave evidence by video link to a court 40 miles away to ease her ordeal.</p>
              <p>He was jailed for almost eight years for sexually abusing her and
              another girl. His ex-wife was last night shocked at his identity swap.</p>
              <p>Mum-of-two Melanie White, 41, raged: "Paul should not be allowed to
              go by any other name. People should be warned about this in case he
              tries to hide his past when he gets out."</p>
              <p>He committed attacks on the girl in Prestonpans, East Lothian, in 2004 and a second girl, two years older.</p>
              <p>Now Falconer claims he has found Allah while locked up at the
              Aberdeenshire jail. He faces Mecca to pray five times a day and enjoys
              a specially prepared halal diet.</p>
