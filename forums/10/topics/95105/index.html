If you are not a singaporean, then you will be just staying away and see singaporean staying to fight. Are you a singaporean? why are you so afraid of your identity? Have you the right to vote here? don't ask if they "...see how singaporeans will vote for their sycophantic views (li gong sin mi lan, tia bu leh!)" Singaporean will not vote for those whom they cannot identify with, the result of the Indonesian poll shows!<br>I am offering a different view here!!<br>No lecture given, just a simple question from a simple non political singaporean, "are you one of us, a singaporean?" don expect answer from a poor singaporean like me to answer if economic competitiveness among the SMEs are due to overzealousness....

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AXL246:</div><div class="quote_body">I find all that truly disgusting and horrible!!!<br>What on earth are they trrying to prove here,celebrating a youth wing of a political party in places where sporeans come and wind down from hard day's and hellish work in tough spore...to see them dresing in funky white and partying...my God......I don't disagree when pple say only stupid things like these happens in singapore!!!!!</div></blockquote>What are they trying to do? They are trying to win the hearts and minds of the younger generation who are more vocal. They do that by trying to mingle with young people at zouk creating cult popularity.<br><br>The younger generation I sum it up is ripe for harvest, though not everyone like that but generally there are many:<br><br>(when I refer to you it is referring the younger singaporean)<br><br>You the twenty something school leaver or graduate is someone just recently joined the workforce. Initially you have a lot of high hopes and high aspirations, you find a job but at your work place maybe you report to this lower qualification idiotic boss or snake eating senior who is a lot older than you &amp; obviously earning more but doing a lot less than you, while you are working your butt off doing his job for him. Or maybe he talk like lowclass chao ah beng, so you don't like him and he tries to press you down everytime you try to outpace him. Obviously you are not very happy.<br><br>So like most younger folks you join the musical chairs group and quit your job only to meet another like your ex-senior or boss or someone worse, after bumming around a few years you get tired and disillusioned of your dreams, maybe you see some of your friends getting on better than yourself, you feel the preassure, frustration and emptiness of your own efforts as one recent forumer had posted, put it shortly you are very impatient for success but immature for it. So you start to b itch and complain abt every damn thing like the way some people do when they write into ST forum abt petty issues that they are not happy with.<br><br>Suddenly a new government comes in full of fresh faces and says "do not wait to be invited to tea, instead yourself try to do something for your own country" and announces that they will go around the whole island to ask for feedback, suddenly you feel flattered when a government surveyor cares enough to write down your feedback or a minister/prime minister is asking you the immature school leaver graduate crybaby for an opnion. You feel resurgence of new hope to make up for your lost dreams, You join to ranks of other cry babies in a new vogue to try your utmost to b itch even louder in ST forum and elsewhere hoping someone will hear you &amp; invite you to tea soon.<br><br>My advice to you, get &amp; grab all you can because its your youth that they are after. One day when you turn 30 or 40 and look over the shoulder you will see the same government trying to court the same younger you but has totally ignored the older one.<br></div>
