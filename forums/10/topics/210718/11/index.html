So, if anyone contravenes any laws, these people will have to be taken to task by the Police. And no law is perfect: I'm sure even some Police officers have issues with certain laws that we have. Which brings to me my next point:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">the law is fixed until someone needs to have it bend for themselves.</div></blockquote>So, even if a law is not good, the Police also lan lan have to enforce it, simply because it is their job to do so. The only way we can address our dislikes with any particular law is by raising it up with our MPs, who will then raise up the issue in their Parliamentray Debates or something.<br><br>And we all know how much we citizens are 'Listened' to...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So... for the Police it's really lan lan lah. I'm sure if you talked to them in private, they'd agree too. Albeit before ensuring that nobody's watching them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
