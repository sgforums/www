Nothing disgusts me more than those who say that Christians are going to hell for giving the Pap 66.6% of the vote, or Malays are being watched by Allah for blocking CSJ.

            <div class='col-md body'>First off, I'd like to say that our miraculous economic progress was only possible because of our rigid system.  It is the system of today, the very same one that is used mercilessly against real or perceived threats, for eg - opposition figureheads.<br><br>However, a reality check on part of the govt is long overdue.  The high-handed tactics, it has employed since Singapore's younger days for the sake of security and whatnot have no place in today's world.. and certainly not in a 1st world country.  In 2006 and beyond, the cons of retaining such a system far outweighs the pros.  The world has all the colours of the rainbow.. how would it serve us to stubbornly remain black and white?<br><br>Bear in mind that our govt is on one hand feeding conservatives with wonderful promises of the Singapore Dream.. on the other hand it is forcing our society to open up with things like the Casino and IMF.  It's high time our govt accepts that they are not immune to the same type of "consequences" they so love to talk about.  As Lao Lee so aptly put it, <strong>you cannot have your cake and eat it.</strong><br><br>I say, let CSJ have his say.  If CSJ is just a crazy old bag as the Singapore Media loves to portray him as, what does the PAP have to fear from him?  Why use disproportionate force?  Why bring the hammer down and crush the little man?  It just doesn't quite add up does it?  People are starting to question.  Soon, more people will realise things don't add up and start to find alternate viewpoints.  Then more people will question.

Oh streets in Korea are way more vibrant and colourful than here i tell you..guess the media in s;pore pictured it 2 u otherwise?<br><br>yup, we might all fear for our lifes sometimes walking down that empty street in the midst of the night, but which is more right to fear?

It is the system of today, the very same one that is used mercilessly against real or perceived threats, for eg - opposition figureheads.<br><br>However, a reality check on part of the govt is long overdue.  The high-handed tactics, it has employed since Singapore's younger days for the sake of security and whatnot have no place in today's world.. and certainly not in a 1st world country.  In 2006 and beyond, the cons of retaining such a system far outweighs the pros.  The world has all the colours of the rainbow.. how would it serve us to stubbornly remain black and white?<br><br>Bear in mind that our govt is on one hand feeding conservatives with wonderful promises of the Singapore Dream.. on the other hand it is forcing our society to open up with things like the Casino and IMF.  It's high time our govt accepts that they are not immune to the same type of "consequences" they so love to talk about.  As Lao Lee so aptly put it, [b]you cannot have your cake and eat it.</strong><br><br>I say, let CSJ have his say.  If CSJ is just a crazy old bag as the Singapore Media loves to portray him as, what does the PAP have to fear from him?  Why use disproportionate force?  Why bring the hammer down and crush the little man?  It just doesn't quite add up does it?  People are starting to question.

The more coverage Chee gets because his cause is a nation-wide dissonance in the pond of international politics, the greater his capacity to induce change, because he is not the integrator nor facilitator. Looking at his actions, what he is trying to do, is to get the man in the street to look up and say, hey, if you're harmless, why do they oppress you?<br><br>To induce discussion and thought, and those who follow the scene for the last few years, there is an awakening of political maturity and a willingness to discuss previously unsaid scenarios. It may be miniscule in the world's eyes, but in Singapore, it's already a significant evolution because it instils a greater sense of curiosity and the yearning to find out more about our politics from the educated, younger generation.<br><br>Different times beget different cultures, and that is the only thing that is constant.</div>
