Imagine if he had done it during the Food Asia Expo.. would it have made such an impact and a difference?? Did all of us really think that he would have lasted an hour in the open rather than 36 hour standoff he is staging if he had done it in another time and situation? All of us Singaporeans are so used to the rosy pictures that the media and tv paints bout our country that we fail to see the other side of reality... This has all passed down from one generation to another generation like an added gene that it is forbidden to speak out our minds even though it may or may not be right against our gah men. Any attempt to do so is accused of being disrupting the social peace and harmony of our society...social peace and harmony of the elite circle they mean? This constitutes a violation of a very simple and basic principle of what makes us who we are - Humans. CSJ is resorting to whatever means to get noticed and it is only right because this maybe he's LAST CHANCE TO BE HEARD b4 he get put away for a while. Then wat is going to happen next? I bet we'll see a next line of Chees anytime in the near future.. you can restrain us now, but maybe not our future generations. Open up now and be rationale or our gah men will have nobody to blame except themselves.</div>
