There is a difference in saying "Freedom is the most important thing to me" and "Freefom is the most important thing to every person" By saying the latter without asking every single person, you are imposing the idea of freedom on everyperson that you did not ask. Are you forcing people to be free? Freedom can also be interpretated differently by different people. The common notion of Freedom is used in the liberal sense which is freedom from interference.

FREE like any creature warm blooded or otherwise. FREE as we are born naturally FREE. Free as in "Born Free".<br><br>Freedom needs not to be 'forced' onto any person or peoples. Freedom comes with our life/lives.<br><br>And FREEDOM, depending on which country, society, and or community you were born in, is to some extent and by conditions, controlled and or regulated for reasons personal, governmental or otherwise political. But FREEDOM cannot be lived in FEAR as is the case with FEER.<br><br>In FEAR, there is NO FREEDOM. If there is FREEDOM, there is and should not be, any FEAR.<br></div>

Sg PAP is like some father, as long as i give you money, a roof over your head, shut the F---k up!! where is the ci mu who listen??<br><br>Now the SgFather realises the big problem ahead, and he needs the children to not to rely on him, start their own business, take care of the own medicals, but still expect the children not to have minds and ideas of their own???<br><br>what do you suggest we see in Taiwan?? i just came back from there, from what i saw i asked myself, 1. the president they elected became corrupt so now they can go on the streets to tell the president he should come down? can singaporean do that if we were in a similar situation in the future?? 2. my business meetings there were not in anywhere affected during these few days in Taipei, in fact, two of my associates went there after dinner with me with da pao for their wives there, alll businesses were as usual, is singapore society that matured??<br>the only thing I feared then was when they allowed another 200,000 green t-shirts to protest against the close to 1 million red t-shirts in the same city. But fortunately, nothing happened. If this were to happen in singapore, we would probably had M113, with live ammo, separating the two parties, if the parties were allowed to be there at all.<br><br>In a way, the sgPAP probably believes singaporeans were like the PRC chinese, like somebody here talked about the riots, the strikes, so the way they handle the people here is also like the PRC government, is it not?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">       </div></blockquote>U r rights! all these Gods are still using outdated tactic 2 scare ppls like business will be affected and properties damaged etc if there is protest in Spore.<br><br>Come on ! We hve 200,000 s'preans n their family members stayed in overseas, we r not like our parents who may not travelling as frequent as us to know the world!!! Pls wake up yr dog's ideal, we hve cable TV ind internet at home 2 follow all the news in overseas 24/7.<br><br>In summary,we r not a democracy country but a country same rank as north korea n PRC.</div>

Public protests are rare in Singapore.<br><br>Police had prevented them from marching to Parliament and the convention center where the IMF and World Bank were holding meetings. On Tuesday, the small group twice started to march in the direction of Parliament House, but were blocked by a row of police officers.<br><br>"The world now knows the extent of the repression in Singapore, and hopefully this will translate into pressure on the Singapore government to reform the system," said protest leader Chee Soon Juan, head of the opposition Singapore Democratic Party. "Our movement, our campaign for democracy, will grow and gain momentum and strength."<br><br>Singapore says its political system has democratic features, including elections, but that it does not seek a freewheeling, Western-style democracy that could foment tension and even chaos. Authorities tightly restrict speech and assembly, saying such controls provide the stability that has helped turn Singapore into a global economic powerhouse.<br><br>As host of the IMF-World Bank meetings, Singapore has sought to showcase itself to thousands of international visitors as a model of clean and efficient governance with a prosperous, open economy.<br><br>Chee's protest drew less local and international attention than Singapore's decision last week to bar two dozen foreign activists from entering the country to attend the meetings even though they were accredited. Singapore later reversed the decision after criticism from the IMF and the World Bank.<br><br>The end of Chee's protest coincided with a speech by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the IMF and World Bank meetings. Lee said carefully managed globalization can improve the lives of the world's population, and that good governance and effective multilateral institutions were vital to its welfare.<br></div>

It's shameful that our own police do not reject such blatant attempts to use the blue uniform as a strongarm to discourage the general public from getting the <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-651.htm" rel="nofollow">views of people who do not agree with the Ruling Party</a>.<br><br>Do the police take down the IC and names of people who speak to Ruling Party MPs during their walkabouts? Is it a crime to seek different opinions or points of view?<br><br>It seems that abuse of police power by the ruling party aside, they are content to tighten their stranglehold over how the people SHOULD think, against FREEDOM OF THOUGHT. Anything that does not conform to what they believe is right will simply be quashed as quickly as can be found.<br><br>It will take true guts and a collective group from within the system itself to stop the rot.</div>
