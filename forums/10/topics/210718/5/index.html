            <div class='col-md body'>Ultimately, it is about what majority of Singaporeans want. I'm certain someone as academic as Dr Chee will comprehen this fact - that there can be no change without the support of the people. There is no moral basis to question the motives of Dr Chee, but his entics certainly do not rub off well with most Singaporeans as the recent elections have shown. He can cry havoc! but the dogs of war would never heed his call. He can cry foul! but people will continue to ridicule him. He can nail his thesis to the doors of parliment, but the system will just remain the same. For a simple reason - Dr Chee has failed to allign his policies and strategies to the mindset of Singaporeans.<br><br>Singaporeans treasure stability; they strive for economic success; they yearn for worldly goods. In spite of what was described in the last election as the coming of a new generation of Singaporeans, people are still uncertain as to the viability of the opposition in parliment. They possess concern that they will lose all that they treasure if the status quo is altered. People opposed to such a notion will point out that the ruling party is less than perfect, some would even go on to describe the situation as 'a can of worms waiting to be opened'. Thus, it is essential that there be an opposition voice in parliment to serve as a check on the government. However, upon this notion serves one huge flawed assumption - that their notion  will supercede or serve as a concern to Singaporeans far and above the main concern of Singaporeans - stability- which in fact opposes the notion of change. This is a time where we bring in the million dollar question - how can the opposition remain viable? The answer to this question is infinitely simple - Ensure stability.<br><br>This is where we bring ourselves back to the ensueing scene we witnessed at Hong Lim Park and we ask ourselves - is this the recipe for stability? Sure, you can quote someone from a first world western society and he'll tell you (he did tell) that this is repression at it's worsts. However, that is the view of a person from a first world western state. However, if you ask a Singaporean the very same question, he'll feel sorry for Dr Chee at best, recongnises the brutal use of police power, but recognises that he prefers his nice cosy condominum and his new 80,000 dollar sedan ahead of uncertainty and chaos. Dr Chee has to realize that this is not Ukraine or Georgia, states once ruled by uncompromising totalitarian regimes where people live under third world standards. Where any certain challenge to the reigns of power will certanly bring widespread support. This is Singapore.<br><br>Forumites love to use the term 'a first world economy, but a third world government'. The statement bares a distinct paradox, but it is the very same paradox that puts us apart from any other third world regimes and one that keeps the status quo in tact. So to the answer to the million dollar question - change in Singapore comes with stability, change comes with time and serving all sides. However, that is just my idealistic self speaking or am I just adverse to change?</div>
