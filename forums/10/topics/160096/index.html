            <div class='col-md body'>Becase of our past academic education and economic policies and the emphasis on attracting MNCs and foreign investments, we have produced many problems and have lost out in the real world of economic competitions.<br><br>We are now seeing many educated unemployed who cannot find jobs despite their higher education. These people are not trained enough to get new ideas or projects started to lead in starting new business.<br><br>In addition, our local businesses have been neglected and yet our leaders are seen giving more and more excuses why we cannot do well because of lack of resources or higher wages of the workers which are of course pure bull. They are also postponing solutions when they are only asking workers to retrain and our businesses to go overseas.<br><br>It is time to change such academic or generalist assumptions that by getting more people to be educated or attracting foreign investments, we will create jobs.<br><br>EDB must set new directions and do things in totally different ways to support businesses and creating new technology start-ups. Getting more and more scholars is not enough. Talking and talking about generalities like leadership, talents and doing a bit here and a bit there will only make them look good to the citizens without creating jobs.<br><br>Real leadership in this age is equal to ability to create new viable businesses and new jobs. New telecommunication systems, drugs, robotics, energy, transportation, mobile handphones and softwares for all sorts of purposes. There will be certain new products and services that need new injections of finance, finding of proising entrepreneurs and practioners to start new production capabilities. These are practical things that must be done as part of government in order to lead to new technology start-ups.<br><br>EDB should not keep talking about their glories or past success or just about attempts to attract investments alone but be proactive in grooming new generations of knowledge applicators and get them to identify new areas of technology to go in and build on them to sustain employments.<br><br>Look at our SMEs very few of them are thinking of going into value-add new technologies as mentioned. They are just doing the same thing while other Asian Tigers are flying high in new areas of technology.<br><br>Be proactive and humble to recognise shortcomings and quickly make new moves to go for putting passionate people to start up new areas of growth. If they want new jobs and higher standards of living then this is their challenge. Do not give excuses or keep talking about difficulties in this or that. Just do it !!! Find more action-oriented people like Dr. Goh Keng Swee to do it.</div>
