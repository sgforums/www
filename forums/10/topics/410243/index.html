              <p><strong>Agence France-Presse</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE, Sept 5, 2010 (AFP) – It’s tough being an opposition party member in Singapore, but history undergraduate Bernard Chen of the Workers’ Party is unfazed as he meets voters, organises events and attends internal meetings.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old is part of a new generation of activists fighting the formidable People’s Action Party (PAP), which has ruled Singapore for 51 years and currently holds all but two of the 84 seats in parliament.</p>
              <p>All political parties in Singapore are reporting increased youth involvement as the country prepares for its next general elections, which are only due by February 2012 but are widely expected to be held much earlier.</p>
              <p>New voter-friendly measures announced by the government, such as caps on immigration following complaints from citizens about a spike in recent years, have further fuelled expectations of an early vote.</p>
              <p>“The PAP started off as being a minority in government too, so it’s all about participating in the process and hoping to win the support of the people,” Chen told AFP.</p>
              <p>One of his pet causes is lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 to enable more members of the Facebook and Twitter generation to take part in politics and — in his thinking — support the opposition.</p>
              <p>Despite getting into occasional trouble with media censors and police, young Singaporeans have indeed become more critical of the PAP on social networking sites, blogs and websites like theonlinecitizen.com and temasekreview.com.</p>
              <p>Opposition parties are also ramping up their web presence.</p>
              <p>“This interest in opposition politics will in a way require the PAP to raise its game,” said Eugene Tan, a law professor at the Singapore Management University specialising in local politics.</p>
              <p>He said the ruling party had far more resources than its rivals but believed the PAP was taking notice of young people’s involvement with other parties.</p>
              <p>“I think overall a more competitive political scene should be beneficial to Singapore,” he added.</p>
              <p>The PAP was founded in 1954 by a 31-year-old English-educated lawyer named Lee Kuan Yew, who went on to become the country’s first leader, serving from 1959 until 1990. His son Lee Hsien Loong has been prime minister since 2004.</p>
              <p>Despite the PAP’s record of rapid economic progress which has turned Singapore into one of the world’s richest societies, critics of the PAP say the city-state has lagged behind when it comes to democratic freedoms.</p>
              <p>Opposition parties are reporting a rise in youth membership, with the Reform Party founded by the late democracy icon J.B. Jeyaretnam claiming 40 percent of its members are now aged 30 years and below.</p>
              <p>The Workers’ Party Youth Wing membership has increased 50 percent from four years ago, and the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) has likewise reported a healthy increase in younger members.</p>
              <p>All the parties refused to reveal exact membership numbers, but media reports say the PAP increased its youth membership by more than 1,000 last year alone.</p>
              <p>Young opposition activists are championing causes ranging from implementing a minimum wage to protecting minority and disabled persons’ rights.</p>
              <p>Wong U-Wen, who is partially deaf, joined the youth branch of the Singapore Democratic Party last year as he wanted to bring the plight of handicapped Singaporeans to public attention.</p>
              <p>“When I first came to SDP office, they were surprised to see that I am deaf. They are starting to open their eyes and learn more from me because they never had someone who is deaf or a person with disabilities,” the unemployed 38-year-old said.</p>
              <p>He cited employment discrimination and a general lack of deaf-friendly services such as captions on television and movie programmes as well as certified sign-language interpreters.</p>
              <p>Jermyn Wee, 27, the webmaster of the Reform Party website, felt young members have a bigger voice in opposition parties.</p>
              <p>“We have regular meetings with our secretary general, Kenneth Jeyaretnam, should he need to bring up a concern,” the information and communication technology executive said.</p>

              <p>Its nice to hear that opposition are getting youth in, hopefully, we can see some changes, but most importantly, they must be willing to sacrifice themselve, able to withstand insult, critics, pressure and defamation lawsuits in near future.</p>
              <p>Just give them a million, and they will jump ship to PAP</p>

              <p>More funding to help elderly get infocomm savvy<br>Posted: 19 September 2010 1309 hrs <br> <br>SINGAPORE : The government will pump in S$4.2 million into the Silver Infocomm Initiative to help senior citizens embrace a digital lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Lui Tuck Yew said this amount is up from the previous funding of S$2.5 million.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui said the increased support will help raise awareness of the benefits of infocomm and encourage its usage among senior citizens.</p>
              <p>A key programme of this initiative is the Silver Infocomm Day.</p>
              <p>This year, Silver Infocomm Day has attracted over 5,200 registrations, which is almost double that of last year.</p>
              <p>The event allows seniors to attend infocomm thematic workshops, where they get to experience practical functions of infocomm.</p>
              <p>To complement this, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) has also introduced courses and training incentives to facilitate IT learning.</p>
              <p>Currently, there are eight Silver Infocomm Junctions that provide senior citizens with customised IT training at affordable rates.</p>
              <p>Two new Silver Infocomm Junctions will be added to the current eight facilities to serve seniors at Buona Vista and Canberra from October and November this year.</p>
              <p>Three more such facilities will also be set up by 2013 to meet the growing demand for customised infocomm training.</p>
              <p>As for those who need more encouragement to go for these IT courses, IDA has launched a training incentive programme that rewards seniors who complete 30 hours of IT training with an additional $100 discount when they purchase a PC Bundle under the Silver Gen PC Specials.</p>
              <p>IDA is also enhancing senior citizens' access to infocomm resources through the Silver Infocomm Hotspots (SIHs).</p>
              <p>These Hotspots located at community clubs and wellness centres, provide seniors with free access to computers and Internet services.</p>
              <p>And Mr Lui said IDA plans to set up a total of 100 Silver Infocomm Hotspots islandwide by March 2013.</p>
              <p>Already, 31 Hotspots are operational in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui added that the government is also introducing Intergenerational IT Bootcamps where grandparents attend infocomm workshops together with their grandchildren.</p>
              <p>Such bootcamps achieve the twin objectives of enhancing infocomm literacy among senior citizens, while strengthening inter-generational bonding.</p>

After all, govt can said about pumping millions here and there, but still many old folks wandering around and not get informed, but providing spectacles, you can really see the sponsorship working in nos and statement.</p>

              <p>Facebook opens office in Singapore  <br>  <br>Tue, Sep 21, 2010<br>AFP  <br>      <br>ASIA is the fastest-growing region for new subscribers to social networking site Facebook despite restrictions on access in China, a senior company executive said Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the opening of Facebook's first Asian sales office in Singapore, vice-president Blake Chandlee said its growth in the region was outpacing the rest of the world.</p>
              <p>Facebook currently claims more than 500 million registered users worldwide, with 54 per cent said to be logging on to the site daily.</p>
              <p> Chandlee, the commercial director for regions outside North America and western Europe, declined to give regional or country user breakdowns except for Singapore, which has nearly three million users out of a population of five million.</p>
              <p>"At the regional level, if you look at the big four, what we call, theatres, you've got North America, you've got EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) you've got Asia, you've got Latin America," Chandlee said.</p>
              <p>"Asia is definitely the fastest-growing amongst those big theatres... Asia's got some of the fastest-growing countries in it, certainly," said Chandlee, who described Facebook's growth in India as "tremendous".</p>
              <p>China restricted access to the site in July 2009 amid deadly ethnic unrest in the restive far-western region of Xinjiang, but users have found ways of breaching the censorship wall.</p>
              <p>Facebook set up an Asian sales office in Singapore to help regional brands in executing their marketing campaigns on the platform, Chandlee said.</p>
              <p>"The Asian market's a very, very big market for us." he said. "It's an enormous opportunity for us."</p>
              <p>"Singapore has been a great market. We nearly have three million people in Singapore alone, which means having a huge percentage of the total population on Facebook," he stated.</p>
              <p>"We see that across the region really, we're pretty excited about it," he said.</p>
              <p>Founded in 2004 and based in Palo Alto, California, Facebook does not publish financial results but research firm eMarketer said last month it should rake in more than US$1 billion (S$1.33 billion) in advertising revenue this year.</p>
