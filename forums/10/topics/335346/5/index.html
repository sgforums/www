              <p class="first">SINGAPORE: The uproar began slightly over a month ago when SP Services announced that electricity tariffs would increase 21.5 per cent in the last quarter of this year.</p>
              <p>Consumers, already burdened by record inflation, saw red and pointed to profits of S$1.086 billion that SP’s parent company, Singapore Power, made last year.</p>
              <p>How would the poor cope, and why couldn’t Singapore Power use some of its profits to absorb the cost, many asked in newspaper and Internet forums.</p>
              <p>But the company remained largely silent, leaving market regulator, the Energy Market Authority (EMA), to respond to news coverage and readers’ letters.</p>
              <p>On Friday, Singapore Power broke the silence and launched a spirited defence against public anger.</p>
              <p>"We have nothing to hide," said group chief executive officer Mr Quek Poh Huat in a media briefing helmed by top management.</p>
              <p>The key message was this: Blaming SP Services for high tariffs is akin to shooting the messenger.</p>
              <p>"If I’m the lorry driver (delivering) goods to your house, and you ask me how come the (price for) a bag of rice has doubled, I can’t explain to you," said chief financial officer Yap Chee Keong.</p>
              <p>SP Services does not generate electricity; it transports power from the generation companies (gencos) to end—users, selling to households without any price mark—up.</p>
              <p>The transmission charge, together with the fee for billing and reading of meters, makes up 17 per cent of the tariff.</p>
              <p>Over the last six years, Singapore Power has reduced transmission charges by 24 per cent through higher efficiency.</p>
              <p>The remaining 83 per cent of the tariff — or 25.13 cents out of the current 30.45 cents per kilowatt hour — is paid to gencos.</p>
              <p>EMA sets the formula for tariffs, which Non—Constituency Member of Parliament Sylvia Lim asked to be revealed in Parliament last month.</p>
              <p>Singapore Power’s profit from the regulated electricity market here was S$423 million last year, representing a 6 per cent return on total assets (ROTA) — a "reasonable" rate compared to other countries.</p>
              <p>In Australia’s Victoria state, for example, the ROTA is 9.6 per cent. The rest of its profit was from sale of investments and its Australian operations.</p>
              <p>In the briefing, Singapore Power also tackled other thorny questions: How far in advance can consumers know of next quarter’s electricity prices? Why can’t investments in infrastructure be postponed? Why not ask the government for funding?</p>
              <p>Tariffs for Jan to Mar 2009 will be based on October’s average forward fuel prices, said SP Services deputy managing director Jeanne Cheng.</p>
              <p>The gencos will convert the average forward price to Singapore dollars and use it to set the tariff’s fuel component.</p>
              <p>"By the end of November, we would submit to EMA for approval the tariffs for (next) quarter.</p>
              <p>EMA would require time for checks, but I believe EMA is trying to work to shorten this period to have an earlier announcement," she said.</p>
              <p>SP Services had announced this current quarter’s tariffs two days before they kicked in, but notice of up to a month is possible, said Mr Quek.</p>
              <p>When contacted, EMA said: "We are working with SP Services to shorten the turnaround time, but ultimately, due process is needed to compute, check and confirm the figures."</p>
              <p>Singapore Power will invest S$5.1 billion in infrastructure over the next five years, with funds coming from operational cashflows and external borrowings.</p>
              <p>It has borrowed S$9 billion from the international markets this year for further investment, said Mr Yap.</p>
              <p>It would be unfair to ask the government for funding because that would mean taking from taxpayers, he said.</p>
              <p>"We can take the easy way out, but S$10 billion from the Budget would mean S$10 billion less for the rest."</p>
              <p>Mr Yap added: "Energy has a direct correlation with gross national product. If you believe Singapore will grow, then you need to plan forward. It’s like the airport — you have to build it before planes will come."</p>
              <p>Singapore’s major industries like the banking and pharmaceutical sectors also require high quality power grids with minimal voltage fluctuations, and "just to maintain the same standard, you have to invest", said Singapore Power’s chief operating officer Ong Boon Hwee.</p>

              November 1</strong></span></cite></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The uproar began slightly over a month ago
              when SP Services announced that electricity tariffs would increase
              21.5 per cent in the last quarter of this year.</p>
              <p>Consumers, already burdened by record inflation, saw red and
              pointed to profits of S$1.086 billion that SP’s parent company,
              Singapore Power, made last year.</p>
              <p>How would the poor cope, and why couldn’t Singapore Power use
              some of its profits to absorb the cost, many asked in newspaper and
              Internet forums.</p>
              <p>But the company remained largely silent, leaving market
              regulator, the Energy Market Authority (EMA), to respond to news
              coverage and readers’ letters.</p>
              <p>On Friday, Singapore Power broke the silence and launched a
              spirited defence against public anger.</p>
              <p>"We have nothing to hide," said group chief executive officer Mr
              Quek Poh Huat in a media briefing helmed by top management.</p>
              <p>The key message was this: Blaming SP Services for high tariffs
              is akin to shooting the messenger.</p>
              <p>"If I’m the lorry driver (delivering) goods to your house, and
              you ask me how come the (price for) a bag of rice has doubled, I
              can’t explain to you," said chief financial officer Yap Chee
              Keong.</p>
              <p>SP Services does not generate electricity; it transports power
              from the generation companies (gencos) to end—users, selling to

              transmission charges by 24 per cent through higher efficiency.</p>
              <p>The remaining 83 per cent of the tariff — or 25.13 cents out of

              postponed? Why not ask the government for funding?</p>
              <p>Tariffs for Jan to Mar 2009 will be based on October’s average
              forward fuel prices, said SP Services deputy managing director
              Jeanne Cheng.</p>
              <p>The gencos will convert the average forward price to Singapore
              dollars and use it to set the tariff’s fuel component.</p>
              <p>"By the end of November, we would submit to EMA for approval the
              tariffs for (next) quarter.</p>
              <p>EMA would require time for checks, but I believe EMA is trying

              <p>When contacted, EMA said: "We are working with SP Services to
              shorten the turnaround time, but ultimately, due process is needed
              to compute, check and confirm the figures."</p>
              <p>Singapore Power will invest S$5.1 billion in infrastructure over
              the next five years, with funds coming from operational cashflows

              <p>There they go again, trying to obfuscate! EMA seems to operate like PTO. The gencos or suppliers will ask for higher and higher prices and EMA/PTO hiding behind some secretive formula will approve and approve.</p>

              <div class="story_text">I REFER to last Saturday's reply by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, 'Electricity prices: Why HK is cheaper'.
              <p>The tiered system I envisage for electricity is not one where the baseline tier is already set to recoup full cost, with a tax artificially imposed on excess consumption, as is the case for water. I mentioned the tiered charge for water to illustrate that differential charging is not new here.</p>
              <p>The Hong Kong tiered charging system is a good reference point to crunch the numbers here to reduce bills for moderate household consumption. In Hong Kong, there are six progressive tiers of rates from the first 150 units, charged at baseline rate to the final tier of 1,001 units and above at baseline, plus 12 cents.</p>
              <p>Here, the uniform rate for household consumption is 30.45 cents. The average electricity consumption per household varies but overall, it is about 300 units monthly.</p>
              <p>Even if the provider needs to recoup the same total revenue, this can be achieved where the baseline consumption rate is significantly below 30.45 cents per unit while consumption in the subsequent tiers is charged at progressively higher rates. If one pegs the unit rates correctly, households consuming moderate quantities of electricity will be better off.</p>
              <p>It should not increase prices for average households whose consumption does not exceed the baseline or lower tiers which should be below cost or at cost. Contrary to what the ministry stated, there would be an incentive to consume less so as not to cross to the higher tiers.</p>
              <p>Such a system will return the benefits of saving electricity to the consumer through the cross subsidies, due to the differentiation in electricity charges.</p>
              <p>A tiered tariff can assure everyone, regardless of household type, of affordable baseline consumption. The well-off are less likely to moderate their consumption and hence will pay for additional electricity at the higher rates.</p>
              <p>Electricity is a modern necessity. We should get the pricing structure correct to prevent electricity becoming a heavy burden to households.</p>
              <p>Finally, we should explore a mechanism to cushion the spikes in electricity tariff, which inflict sudden anxiety and impact on the cost of living. One possibility is what is done for public transport by way of a fuel equalisation fund, which public transport operators maintain to cushion the impact of volatile fuel prices so as not to pass them on to commuters.</p>
