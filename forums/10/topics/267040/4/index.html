            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by asdfzhao:</div><div class="quote_body">@ Blueray:<br>u remind me of lionnoisy. really. but you at least care to write paragraphs of comments. kudos to u. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>firstly: who are you to judge if the news are real or distored? Are you involved in whatever was reported? Even if you had witnessed it, is it the entire picture? don't pass sweeping statements next time, they are weak arguments.<br><br>secondly: If you are a singaporean then maybe you will think that the human rights in China is ok. But actually, Singaporeans do not have a lot of human rights.<br><br>thirdly: would you kindly not stray away from the topic with your America-is-bad messages? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Thank you</div></blockquote>If you have witnessed the event, your comments on the news will have more credibility than many who have never been to the place, even if you have not witnessed the entire picture, nor having full understanding of the situation. We shouldn't be thinking that only the ST is speaking for the Singapore government, but the western media, especially those from USA are 100% neutral and fully trustworthy. No? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>American government uses all kinds of excuses to justify their actions overseas, a fake story about WMD was used in the UN, broadcasted to the whole world, to justify its military action against Iraq, but the ultimate objective was to secure oil supplies. Human rights is another excuse. There is no doubt that human rights problem exist in China, if there is still human rights problem in the US, let alone Singapore. American importers can ban imports of goods manufactured by children citing violation of human rights, but citing human rights problem for embargo of arms to China but announce record sales of arms to Saudi is indeed a mockery to human rights. The american never seems to remember that they trained OSAMA Bin LADEN, a Saudi. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In the 60s, we heard of copies from Japan; in the 70s, we could buy fake Nike shoes from Korea, nothing from China, until it opened up in the 80s, and foreign investment went in to capitalise on its cheap labour force. So fake products are not new. The hungry businessmen are still looking for even cheaper costs, they moved from Indonesia, vietnam and then China, all in the name of higher returns to investment and globalization. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>If you were forced to cut costs to survive, what do you do? you continue to cut cost, replacing with cheaper raw materials. Your american buyers would accept products with grade B raw materials so long if prices are cheap. After all, things these days are not made to last. Then came the limit, there are only that many replacements you can use. you either close shop like the Nike suppliers in Indonesia with 12000 workers on the streets, or ..... Like training OSAMA, the americans trained the PRC manufacturers, only to find themselves receiving the unwanted end of the deal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>PRC Chinese have no access to the distribution chain of the genuine products in the US, no PRC manufacturers shipped directly to wholesalers, no PRC traders can sell directly to the Nike boutique in the US. So how do fake products landed in the US consumers??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ever seen the angmoh carrying bags and bags of cheap bargains from Xiu Shiu Jie in Beijing or Xiang Yang Market in Shanghai? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  No demands, no supplies.<br><br>Fake products are sold at a fraction of the original prices, and must be produced in large quantities. These two factors combined suits the China local market. It should be noted that the main victims of fake products are the PRC consumers. While we leave the PRC government to handle such unethical business practice that harm their own people, would we stop supporting the rich and greedy MNC from the west from exploiting the cheap labours around the region, including China? what can we do to Microsoft who pay programmers in RUPEE to write the program and sell it back in India in US$?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>China, the factory of the world, turned into a land of fakes, certainly not due to communism, so how? better human rights practice would not stop, kpkb definitely won't help. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Not much choice we have on local media, but I always find LianheZhaobao publishes more balance reports and the forum critics are more neutral than those on the ST.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HmmmÂ….I am not sure you can draw Robin Hood as conclusion as clearly in this case.<br><br>It has business decision, foreign market set its own standard after all those in business choose to sell product to the US.  i am sure Japan would ban beef import if mad cow are found in US farm beef.<br><br>But hereÂ’s some background for apparel industries for reference if folks are not familar.<br><br>Distribution chain and culture in the apparel industries has evolved over the years, other than Price/quality of products; all main stream apparel buyers will go thru certain certification before approving vendors.  To approve its factory under UN Human Right compliance. Such as child labor, minimum wage, water, decent work hour. Before they get orders, these compliances are monitor by UN NGO they visited factories and interviewed workers, review factory policy guideline, bla bla bla etc. Buyer review certification processsed and approved as vendors.  Than Asia buying Agent dispersed orders to approved factories. (bare in mind they are the ones that take a cut of the money) and leave peanuts for factories. Since the pressure on cost is always downward shift so you have factories find themselve having to move to LDC for manufacturing.<br><br>Thus factories must be able to compete in quality and operate under economies of scale, and fullfilment these are of course easy said than done in a complex supply chain.<br><br>The apparel market in the US has changed over the years, there are traditional buyers and also new buyers most of them are run by Chinese national resided in the US while having factory in china. (Apparel are very much vertically integrated.)  Clothing companies can sell generic product. The US market is a huge consumer market. The question if they are so good at sewing and making the goods look alike why even need to copy!  They can manufacture their own and create their own brand!!! A lot of consumer products are not patent, developing a better product and product differentiation there is really the basis for competition.<br><br>What changes I believe it has reached a proportion level into the main stream public consumption.  It changes way business growth and developed. In the past you probably can tell the different but these days you canÂ’t. Its one thing to make a fake and you know you are buying a fake rather than u think u r buying a real items but it is a fake<br><br>there are other implication of course such as research and development, wasting resources on preventing copies other than doing research that improved product. Why even spend money on research when you can just walk over and copy.<br><br>As said Â“leave the PRC government to handle such unethical business practice that harm their own peopleÂ”  But i think education is still needed.<br><br></div>
