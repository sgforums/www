But later on when the police raided the place, the owner said the only added the cardboard with the suggestion of the reporter, they really had no ideas. And the reporter was interrogated and he said he wanted to be famous, and he did get famous and also arrested.</div>

They are not friends nor enemies, but it'd be great if they can be friends. I don't think China is showing any hostility towards america and it is willing to cooperate with America on many fields but I don't know why some or many americans on the net always show some type of aggression towards China. It is the western media that hyped up China's threat, China's superpower, China's century. Chinese media never said such things. So I would like to say this so that the american people can understand that it is their government and their media that brought up these things, not the Chinese media.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not at all surprised there are fake stuff in China. This kind of problem is prevalent in almost every developing country. In Russia and India the situation is much worse. Prepare to be shocked by what I am about to show:<br><br>Tens of thousands in Russia died from drinking fake alcohol every year. Russia has more people dying from consuming fake alcohol than any other country on earth. Read here:<br><br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5111762.stm<br>http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/B868217.htm<br>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20061030/ai_n16811045<br><br>In India too counterfeiting has become a serious problem. Take the case of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), cosmetics, drugs, and industrial products in India. The statistics are staggering. Nearly 40 percent sales on automobile spare parts are in counterfeits. Nearly 30 percent of the FMCG market and 20 percent of the tobacco market is counterfeit. Alarmingly, 15-40 percent of medicines sold are fake.

In order to support such a huge population China naturally produces more goods and stuff than any other country.

By fabricating lies like that, western media is only destroying their own credibilty.<br><br>On one hand the western world(especially Uncle Sam) never stops talking about human rights abuses in China. (I have already proven that a lot of  western accusations against china's human rights abuses are nothing but lies) but yet on the other hand western countries(especially Uncle Sam) are ignoring the real massive human rights abuses happening in other countries.<br>Let me give an example:<br><br>Here are some links about saudi arabia's human rights abuses:<br><br>http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/apr2000/saud-a26.shtml<br>http://www.hrw.org/wr2k1/mideast/saudi.html<br>http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGMDE230572000<br><br>Human rights violation in saudi arabia is very bad for such a small country but yet Uncle Sam is ignoring what is going on there and is even supporting the brutal regime there. Read here:<br><br>http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/032800-01.htm<br><br>Why? Bcos Saudi Arabia serves US oil interests well and as a result US media is more than willing to turn a blind eye to the massive humans rights abuses over there. Hell... the US is even supplying weapons and arms to Saudi Arabia. Read here:<br><br>http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/18457.html<br><br>Not long ago EU nations were debating whether or not to lift the arms embargo imposed on China. Uncle Sam once again intervened saying that China should not be allowed to import weapons from Europe. Reason given by Uncle Sam is that China's human rights record is poor.<br>Here comes the question:<br><br>If Uncle Sam feels that countries with poor human rights record should not be allowed to buy weapons, then why is Uncle Sam itself more than willing to sell weapons to countries like Saudi Arabia? Can anyone pls answer my question?<br><br>Time and time again Uncle Sam is making a mockery of human rights.

Are you involved in whatever was reported? Even if you had witnessed it, is it the entire picture? don't pass sweeping statements next time, they are weak arguments.<br><br>secondly: If you are a singaporean then maybe you will think that the human rights in China is ok.

What does American Foreign Policy got to do with Fake Goods. Of all the reporting of Fake medication and Fake Goods help the rest of the world to stay Alert.<br><br>Last week there was a Program by ABC showing china Shipping fake Drug including Tamiflu tablet into US, they can shipped 200 pills a day. And when you open the packaging look exactly like the real manufacture. It has no real active ingredients in the Pill. If you got Bird Flu that is all you need a Fake pill that does nothing.<br><br>They set up office in the US to buy up real medication and shipped it back for R&amp;D to manufacture Fake packaging. The PRC travel to Las Vegas for trade show they buy up real garment sample. shipped it back to China to manufacture fake goods.<br><br>These are determine folks who's purposes are to make money. They do not care about safety, hygenic, creativity, business practices.<br><br>Recently there was reported that 27 billion worth of fake goods, Nike, Lacoste,  caught in NY. 27 people got caught. mostly PRC origin. They go to the extend of tranship it to Mexico than move it back to the US. The extend of network is impressive. I would not be surprise some of these goods tranship thru SG. Declared under FTA agreement.<br><br>Last year there was a warehouse where 17 containers were caught in a single warehouse in Los Angeles all branded stuff. Each pcs price over US$100 I am sure.<br><br>All the Singaporean tourist spend money to travel to US factory outlet thinking they are buying branded goods but infact it is Branded Fake goods. The cost of these fake range from US$5.00 a pcs to US$8.00 they spend US$90 a pcs. who is the sucker.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   Let me put it this way Nobody like to be cheated.<br><br></div>
