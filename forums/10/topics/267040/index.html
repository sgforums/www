They were very determine to bring in these goods as they have all kind of network.<br><br>Few months back there was a Thread comparing India and China who will be  economically better. Although it may seemed that PRC is economically stronger.  There was no talking about the notion of money craz in PRC, vs innovation in PRC.<br><br>With a population so huge that cut across the Planet, I hope they still have individual that believe in creating n innovating and  benefit mankind or else it is such a waste of resources for planet Earth to keep producing Fake, consumed resources, and kill off the seed of innovation to benefit mankind.<br><br></div>
