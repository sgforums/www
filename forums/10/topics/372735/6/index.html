              <p>In yr daily life, you will make a mistake, either big or small, however, i do agree that those given higher responsibility and authority to deal with sensitive work such as surgical, finance investment, high rise building working etc etc...should make less mistake, but not just that because their mistake is to be make, but the consquences of their mistake is big.</p>

              <p>I mean come on,if LHL wife is a damn pretty woman,i dont mind he show off his wife pic in the newspaper n proclaim how capable she was(although we all know LHL n LKY must be the mastermind who hide behind the scene n "Financially n politically support" her).</p>
              <p>But look at Ho CChing pic,she looks like a "Gorzilla" which run out of zoo n dont know somehow dash n sit onto Temasek Holding director's chair,then the next thing u know,"She" become the 5th most powerful "Women" in the world.Alamak!!!!</p>

              <p>While this is true in human aspect about learning from mistake. But Please do not forget your Govt claim that they hired Talented individual and therefore deserved Million Dollar Salary. In Return Singaporean agreed but be demand that claim stay True ...............<strong>MAKE NO MISTAKE</strong>.</p>
              <p>We are not talking about the effect of financial behavior we are talking about the "decision"</p>
              <p>Nobody pointed a Gun for Temesak to buy some of these investments when the news were turning South. So please do not bring up TEXT book response.</p>
