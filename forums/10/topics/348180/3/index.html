              <p>On the movie theme, i feel this movie is inspired by post modernistic ideals of the 2000s.it has been specifically presented in a way which will appeal to both young an old viewers.</p>

              <p>hmm, according to wikipedia, the same director  of the  movie has remade it into Bollywood 2 years later with different cast</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayak:_The_Real_Hero">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayak:_The_Real_Hero </a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw please go ask again.maybe they dont know well enough ( as with all sales staff). i had one with english subtitles and the distributor or licensing company is this:</p>
              <p><a href="http://eshop.ayngaran.com/ww/product_info.php?products_id=250&amp;osCsid=bed830bae9af0687d913feef6c790151">http://eshop.ayngaran.com/ww/product_info.php?products_id=250&amp;osCsid=bed830bae9af0687d913feef6c790151 </a></p>
              <p>also btw it seems mine is an original dvd, there are those bootlegs or different distributors around. dont get it. try to get those original and will have subs</p>
              <p>Or yr best bet will be a divx torrent , that is if u can find. google it i found some links with eng subs.</p>

              <p>maybe people bought the last remaining ones.  i had seen it lying around  in those bargain bin years later. Yes i think the ones with the "Ayngharan" logo is the original Dvd, and they have the highest quality picture and sound mastered from the reel film itself.Most of the times, they have eng subs.</p>
              <p>Ayngharan is the international premier distributor of Tamil and Bollywood movies</p>
              <p>U go to search harder at the other shops in serangoon  or try online</p>
              <p>I dontknow , i watched the original tamil movie in Yishun 10 cinema back in 1999. I also watched the hindi version of it later. But to me the hindi version lacks some impact( maybe becaos i watching from subtitles) and the original baddie/villain is not there. To others if they had not watched the tamil one, it could be of no difference.</p>
              <p>Bollywood version:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeJr1ak1eU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Idef3e7662g</a></p>
              <p>Can also get the Hindi one if u think the youtube is good. It is the same story, same scene. But the fight scenes are slightly different ( more hollywoodish)</p>
              <p>U can also try a similar show Sivaji the boss (2007 released), same director, same production team. Its a rehash of Mudhalvan with a different story. Its available in Blue Ray and its a 4k digital movie. Try the shop beside the little India arcade. they have only 1 disc. Grab it before someone does and being the first south indian film on blue ray, i wouldn't be surprised if its already gone now.</p>
