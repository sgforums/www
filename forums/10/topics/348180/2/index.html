              <p>IMo, the baddie of this movie is the star of show, the way he talks and act is well known in tamil cinema. One of the finest tamil cinema villains who is a veteran in the industry for 25 years, He has acted in many roles mainly as a villain. He passed away last year due to illness. Raghuvaran's Last on screen appearance was in Sivaji The Boss in 2007 in a minor role. Another favoirite baddie bites the dust.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Raghuvaran : Passed Away</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.cinefundas.com/images/news/19-03-08/Raghuvaran.gif" alt="" width="150" height="196"></p>
              <p>Raghuvaran, the versatile villanous actor of celluloid screen breathed his last this morning(19/3/2008)Â  due to a cardiac arrest. The actor was married to actress Rohini, but the marriage failed and they went through a messy divorce.<br><br>The most understated menacing villian was admitted to Mehtha Hospital for treatment a few days ago. The reason for the death has been disclosed as weakness caused by excessive alcohol consumption. It is learnt that he had been under intensive medical care for the past few weeks and diedÂ  at a private hospital after battling personal demons and a few other debilitating physical problems.<br><br>The quintessential psychopathic baddie of Tamil cinema, the man who earned villainy on screen and good name, had been unwell for the last few years and had taken a sabbatical from active films for some time.<br><br>Sivapathigaram released some time last year, marked his comeback. After that he was a regular figure acting in big films including Rajnikanth’s Sivaji. His last release was however Sila Nerangalil and Bheema(which had been made some time back).<br><br>Born on Dec 11 1948, The actor’s distinct style and voice proved to be his biggest asset that he added quirkiness to every role he played, a charm that was appealing and repulsive at the same time. From leading man to villain to character roles, Raghuvaran had done it all. He played some memorable characters, which include the uptight, egoistic son in Samsarum Oru Minsarum, the caring and dedicated father of a mentally-challenged child in Anjali, the suspicious husband in Puriyatha Pudhir, an evil don in Shiva (Telugu), a sincere family man in Mugavari, a physically-challenged killer in PoovizhiVaasalile, a reformed smuggler in Amarkalam, the big baddie in Baasha, the conniving Chief Minister in Mudhalvan, a loving father in Love Today, a struggling alcoholic in Oru Manidhanin Kadhai, the jealous elder brother in Uyirile Kalandhadhu, the serious-faced brotherâ€“in-law in Run, the godfather figure in Bheemaa and of course, the special appearance as the doctor who saves Rajinikanthâ€™s life in the 2007 blockbuster Sivaji.<br><br>He had many interesting films lined up. His soon to be released film is Yaaradi Nee Mohini. He was currently working in Kanthaswamy, Ellam Avan Seyal and Indra Vizha.<br><br>The lonely man, who brewd depth, intensity, elegance, understatement and style to Tamil acting, is unthinkable to see his grace on the screen again. He will be terribly missed.<br><br>‘Cinefundas, grieves the demise of this talented actor. May his soul rest in peace’.</p>

              <p>its not high tech in production but not low tech too because the technology like special cameras ect which were only used in Hollywood were much more expensive in India at the time.</p>
              <p>The Shakkalakka Baby song in this movie used a cinematography technique known as "motion blurring". Much of the movie revolves around a Tv station ect. So the style of the cinematography is ad sense.</p>

              <p>We, indians do not really believe in big budget special effects, we just want to watch an entertaining show like Mudhalvan, with a good story, music and actors.</p>
              <p>Are u saying our movies are low tech, Not really, ( Sivaji the Boss in 2007) , which was from the same director had a 4K HD resolution, the 1st in Asia. and plus our movies already had DTS and Dolby digital sound back in the 90s and after 2000s, digital cinematography took over</p>
              <p>In terms of equiment tech we are not behind Hollywood,</p>

              <p>time changes, dancing changes too and so the music does. It longer the 1980s. Stop picking on some lousy movies critisizing. There is always good and lousy  movies. Thare always good and lousy directors.</p>
              <p>our good movies are watched all around the world. The largest movie industry in the world is in India.</p>
              <p>Fat ladies?. yes some are. In the past . But Indian ladies have won Miss world and Miss universe 7 times in a row. U dont call them fat, do u?</p>

              <p>And shankar's movies have a nice blend of everything.Shankar Movies , most of them are political fiction, As most of his movies are But  Mudhalvan is the only movies of his which has a full blown political satire in a real life context.</p>
              <p>He has directed 2 romantic comedies jeans (1998) which did resonably well , the 2nd movie of the then famous Aishwarya Rai and "Boys" in 2003 which a a mega flop at the box office. HE went back to the drawing board and released ANNIYan in 2005, which was a box office hit.</p>

              <p>i have bought the DVd in Mustafa after asking the staff around. comes with eng subs. indeed its a very good show. Throughly enjoyed it way ahead of its time of 1990s.there are other good  scenes in the movie as well, much more which ties in with the rest of the show. Picture and sound is much better on DVD than the youtube. Contains DTS 5.1 track</p>
              <p>Here: excellent arnold like fight scene:</p>

              <p>Picture quality and presentation is more of  quick edit style of the 2000s. Overall entertaining. 8/10 rating.</p>
              <p>Some coarse languange and violence.</p>

Rahman for the Tamil film Mudhalvan<br>This tamil film was one of the most successful movies in that year<br><br>The video clip of the original techno punk song in 1999 "Shakkalakka Baby" from Mudhalvan can be found on YouTube. Performed by the former Miss Universe Sushmita Sen with original score by A.R. Rahman :<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh7VbWlG9io">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh7VbWlG9io</a><br><br>Kelly Poon's version:<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fgs0KqADyI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fgs0KqADyI</a></p>

              <p>So far the new copied one is inferior to the original. It lacks the technical expertise and sound wizardry which made the original tamil song stand out<br><br>the song is a hit Indian song that is now in 3 major languages<br>wif the addition of this new copied version.<br>i would like to see the original composer A.R. Rahman name to be credited for it.<br>So far hasent credited it too ARR and that would<br>amount to plagarism<br><br>I 1st heard the song in a shop in singapore and was shocked! I<br>enquired abt it and den told the shop kepper abt ARR and the original<br>SHAKALAKA BABY. She was shocked. such people stealing his intellectual work and not crediting it to him.<br><br>The song has been playin on the singapore chinese radio station<br>yes99.3fm and her fans have been raving abt the song without knowing that its not original<br><br>The info is taken form the following local websites:<br>Thanks to some forumnites there who brought this issue to light.<br><br><a href="http://www.panjiali.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3037&amp;page=2">http://www.panjiali.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3037&amp;page=2</a><br><br><a href="http://forum.mediacorp.com.sg/board/showthread.php?s=9e42e58d9dd528e4b057d69053e43fba&amp;threadid=30567&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=17">http://forum.mediacorp.com.sg/board/showthread.php?s=9e42e58d9dd528e4b057d69053e43fba&amp;threadid=30567&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=17<br><br></a><a href="http://www.thelocalking.com/singapore/leisure--entertainment/kelly-poons-new-hit-shakalaka-baby.html">http://www.thelocalking.com/singapore/leisure--entertainment/kelly-poons-new-hit-shakalaka-baby.html</a></p>

              <p>Hi, I would like to bring to your attention that the new Kelly poon song Shakalaka Baby was originally composed in 1999 by Indian film composer A.R. Rahman for the Tamil film Mudhalvan <br>This tamil film was one of the most successful movies in that year <br><br>The video clip of the original techno pop song in 1999 "Shakalakka Baby" from Mudhalvan can be found on YouTube. Performed by the former Miss Universe Sushmita Sen with original score by A.R. Rahman :<br><img src="http://i10.tinypic.com/5y9eetz.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="300"></p>
              <p>So far the remakes are often considered inferior to the by fans of the original song. They are seen as lacking the technical expertise and sound wizardry which made the original tamil song a hit.<br><br>The ad-style visuals picturised by K.V. Anand used in the Tamil song is a special cinematographic technique known as "Motion Blur" or some kind of equivalent . This technique appeared in the cinema world in the late 1990s and has not been often used except in some sci fi tv shows and movies like Gone in 60 Seconds<br><br>The song sequence is supervised by the director Shankar of Sivaji the Boss, the first 4k Digital asian movie currently running in cinemas now. Years later Shankar himself had said this was the best song sequence he ever filmed back in '99<br><br><br>In 1999, the original tamil song Shakalaka Baby was an instant hit and topped the Bollywood Top 10 charts in India and countries with Indian populations. <br><br>It was then in 2003 that A.R. Rahman changed the original composition and recorded the english version of Shakalaka Baby for Andrew Loyd Webber's Bombay Dreams and again it was a massive hit! <br><br>5 Years later, in 2007, Kelly Poon comes up with a new album with a track titled Shakalaka Baby which has the exact same tune as A.R. Rahman¯s Shakalaka Baby for Bombay Dreams in 2002.<br><br>Shakalakka Baby is the last song of the Rahman "pop wave" in <br>the 1990s in India . There was this period in the 1990s which Rahman's majority of songs were pop or techno based. This period lasted from 1993-1999, Other composers other than Rahman were making the same kind of songs as well. <br>some facts abt rahman <br><br>1) richest highest music composer in India today, a muli millionaire <br>2) Uses state of the art sound in his songs and his songs use an uncompressed sound format in which u can hear all of the original noise in the sound spectrum <br>3) he has made songs in the early 90s which were years down the road . <br>4) his music is of contrast nature with "highs" and really "lows" in a given music <br>5) AR Rahman's studio is the most advanced in Asia today</p>
