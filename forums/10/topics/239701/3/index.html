Cos it seems that for Singapore's case, National Service naturally refers to Service to the Defence side of SG. hmm.. from your reply it seems that I have said something wrong. To be honest, I don't know what I have said wrong. I'm just questioning on why it seems National Service here means to serve the Defence portion of it. If that's the case, I feel that the term "National Service" is not very appropriate since there really aren't that many choices to serve the Nation, meaningfully of course..<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by asdfzhao:</div><div class="quote_body">so i dont see the problem with females learning first aid. they dun need the caring heart or whatever, they just need the knowledge to give an injurt person some medical help. after all, appling 1st aid b4 the ambulance arrives might just save the person... that said, guys gotta learn first aid too...</div></blockquote>I totally agree with that. Learning first aid is nothing bad at all. Not sure why people would disagree on that, unless they find that learning first aid is a waste of time.</div>

Oh wait ....it's because of qualified and certified training ! Even some combat medics have the 3 year nursing education and registration as registered nurses like those underwater naval combat medics!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> So a better way to put it is to train girls from non nursing backgrounds as combat medics and first aid officers. </span> <strong> That will be adequate for what you are suggesting </strong>. Like St John's first aid officers.  <strong> Just train them as first aid officers  or assistants to doctors/nurses but don't call them nurses. </strong><br><br>Combat medics and first aid officers don't need to know much - they just need to know how to give frontline on the spot first aid treatment and CPR , give morphine when someone gets injured badly etc . The SAF medicos and nurses can run the show from behind.<br><br>If any person who treats a wound and can call themselves a nurse - then what is the bloody use of a registration system and a 3 year nursing education for ? We might as well take any one who just knows abit about wound management off the street and call them a nurse.  It's like calling anyone wearing a stethoscope around their neck , a doctor.<br></div>

You can't have the combat medics, doctors  or nurses who fear blood and gore because they are your primary center of treatment aka your repair center. Would you like to be the guy who is badly injured when the someone who could treat you just fainted from looking at your wounds?<br><br>Combat medics are not nurses - they are first aid officers .  The most they will know is abit more than first aid i.e.  how to insert an IV canula , perform CPR , stop a wound bleeding, inject morphine if the soldier is in pain (i.e. leg shot /disembowelment)  , how to set a broken leg on the ground  but they won't know WHY certain things are done that way . It's advanced first aid at most , not nursing.<br><br>That is why you have SAF nursing officers and Combat Medic Specialists from the SAF medical corp . They are the trained registered nurses NOT normal combat medics who have no health or nursing background.  A registered nurse has to know HOW and has to know WHY .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Combat medics are most expendable in the line of fire - they know only advanced first aid and with a bit of experience and luck - they can give advanced treatment properly.<br>Usually the ones with the least qualifications and skills required are sent out frontline.<br><br>Combat Medic Specialists (frontline mostly health professionals with actual qualifications) - they supervise the combat medics and they have to risk the line of fire to supervise but I doubt that will happen.<br><br>Army nursing officers are less expendable - they know advanced first aid and they know how to anticipate things as they are happening especially when the combat medics are bringing in the wounded they treated. i.e. which organ the bullet hits , triaging, infection control  etc . They also usually assist the army surgeons in operating theatres.<br><br>Army medical officers are the least expendable - they know the most.<br><br>So that is why combat medics go into the secondline together with the frontline troops, not SAF nursing officers or Medical Officers - they stay at the back with those mobile medical treatment units.</div>

Other countries would simply not think twice about playing punk with us and messing around with water treaties more then they are doing now.<br><br>That said, a certain northern country has made a lot of talk about cutting water supplies, but I think on a certain level they know that turning off the tap is not such a easy thing to do... it would be a lot easier if we didn't carry a credible military 'stick'.<br><br>And yeah, NS also serves as a good wake up call to many of us on the realities of life.
