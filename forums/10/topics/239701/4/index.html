Any way about it, the development of the SAF has played a role in keeping some of the more radical talk about taking Singapore back by force (which is still worryingly happening admist some of their politicans) just that... talk.<br><br>Things also become more complicated once you throw race-politics into the mix, of which both countries hold rather differing views. We must also take the stability of our neighbours into account... what if one day a radical regime takes over and decides that the Singaporean problem needs to be solved at whatever the cost?<br><br>It would be too late then to build up a credible defence. The way we are, we don't really have the space to make big mistakes... Iran could tank a lot of damage from Iraq before bringing the war on a more even footing despite their technological disadvantage... Kuwait was a different story- they relied on the goodwill of other nations and got invaded for their troubles.<br><br>So nah, we're no Isreal surrounded by countries wanting to slit our throats... but I think entirely untrue to say that our region is exactly stable to begin with. Relying on international goodwill and hoping to survive on economic power alone isn't a sound survival tatic... at the end of the day when it really gets to the worst things, power still flows from the barrel of a gun.</div>

Perceived gender equality? To teach the females "discipline" and "teamwork"?</div></blockquote>Given you actually did an project on it... do you actually have the facts, figures and numbers to indicate that it indeed will be too high a cost to pay?<br><br>Until then, I find it difficult to believe your statement by the sheer words of them alone. It seems to me in fact that what we must account for are two years (assuming no call back) of productivity lost in the workforce. But I must question if this can really be tanked... I see no reason why not. It's not as if we're talking 10 years here.<br><br>And why do you percieve defense spending a burdern? Without a credible defence there would really be no Singapore to begin with so I think that point is moot at best, and circular at worst.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Secondly, if we all did NS, who'd care for the young/old/sick in the event of a war?</strong></blockquote>You seem to think of NS soley as picking up a weapon, and going to fight the enemy. But I must submit that this NS for females would not involve military defence, but rather be in the civil sectors in crisis.<br><br>Caring for the young/old/sick during war would be their NS duty, and the thing they train for. It beats having a civillian around with absolutely no crisis-skills that can be useful in time of war, and at worst a liability. When a bomb drops we will get less confused and frightened people and more people with a purpose, a skill, and organization on how to reduce the damage.<br><br>Leave the fighting to the guys I say, but train our ladies to know how to keep the home ground in working order as well.<br><br><blockquote><strong>What would it all achieve, other than equality for the guys? And in return, you'd get the financial drain of the lost productivity of these females, plus alot of resentment to boot.[quote]</strong><br><br>This is not about equality for the guys... if that was the case we would prehaps demand that the ladies do all the same dangerous and physically demanding tasks just for the sake of being "equal".<br><br>But on the extreme side, the current inbalance is in that our ladies are mostly clueless on what to do during a crisis... which would only hurt everybody in times of crisis. Also, you are forgetting the character building and other benefits that NS will provide. That said, guys may complain a lot about NS (which is really part and parcel of life), but when it push comes to shove they know what to do in times of danger. I'm not sure what can be said for our ladies now.<br><br>As for the productivity loss and drain, you've yet to produce the figures, but I wonder if it's more imaginary then real. I seriously doubt Singapore would be lost because our ladies had to give up two or so years.<br><br>And resentment? I think it goes a long way towards reducing resentment then increasing it. The higher starting pay for males can be scrapped, guys can finally shut most of their rational compliants about the unfairness of NS finally and what have you not.<br><br>[quote]<strong>Nursing for all females is a ludicrous idea.

In the same vein one can argue for a lot of things in the name of productivity.<br><br>On the other hand, the other benefits of female NS can go a long way as well.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I admit conscription is truly the burden of citizenship for the males, and I sympathise.

It sure has no lack of bad moments but all in all I learnt a lot in there.<br><br>In many ways it was an extra two years of education, a school in which to learn many life skills that are not taught in school.<br><br>I submit that female National Service is indeed a possible idea, not for the sake of equality... but for the advantages it provides to the female character and nation building and security in whole.</div>

All the more reason to train the women to handle these tasks.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cherry_garcia:</div><div class="quote_body">Nursing for all females is a ludicrous idea. The threadstarter probably had no idea what the job involves, and what kind of constitution one must have to do it. </div></blockquote>Have you not considered the 'constitution' needed for guys to learn to kill enemies on the battlefield? Not every guy is born for the army. What about the 120kg guy who has to shed his extra kilos to run up a jacob's ladder? What about his constitution? Every citizen has to put up with the sacrifice and it aint a sacrifice if it does not hurt you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cherry_garcia:</div><div class="quote_body">I admit conscription is truly the burden of citizenship for the males, and I sympathise. Fortunately for me, sharing out the burden with the females is just not an economically viable option <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>Nope, it is economically viable, as it has been proven in Israel. It just requires some planning and lots of political will. Singapore women are getting far too soft, no doubt the result of too many foreign maids. A spell in national service will be good for them.</div>
