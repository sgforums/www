              <p>2)   To contribute investment and employment (business based)</p>

              <p>Hi Suzy Wang,  I have been censured here but I still want to answer whenever I can because I sincerely believe that electorates must not be manipulated by parties for their benefit.  Politics should be for voters to manipulate the parties.  Moderators here already know my weakness and impose obstacles to my posting by it skills.</p>
              <p>We all are very clear - PRs are not citizens.  Most of them are here only because they could not get better deal in their countries.  But why should this matter to us citizens as long as they are here to contribute skills and/or money?  We are extracting help from them and so if they leave when they feel enough so be it - they gain something from helping us and we gain something from them when they are with us - win win.  As long as we do not loogie it is perfectly ok.  I know you probably think these PRs might be managers or professionals and above and so if they are gone these jobs would be filled by sporeans.  Fat hope, the top 0.5% are not that stupid ok?  We have 10k cos in this island because they are given royalty treatment if not spore has no mkt to offer, not low cost centre and sporeans are normal people - no special geniuses.  There will always be grads who cannot make the grade of senior positions because we are normal people like other races.</p>

              to answer whenever I can because I sincerely believe that
              electorates must not be manipulated by parties for their
              benefit.  Politics should be for voters to manipulate the
              parties.  Moderators here already know my weakness and impose
              obstacles to my posting by it skills.</p>
              <p>We all are very clear - PRs are not citizens.  Most of them
              are here only because they could not get better deal in their
              countries.  But why should this matter to us citizens as long
              as they are here to contribute skills and/or money?  We are
              extracting help from them and so if they leave when they feel
              enough so be it - they gain something from helping us and we gain
              something from them when they are with us - win win.  As long
              as we do not loogie it is perfectly ok.  I know you probably
              think these PRs might be managers or professionals and above and so
              if they are gone these jobs would be filled by sporeans.  Fat
              hope, the top 0.5% are not that stupid ok?  We have 10k cos in
              this island because they are given royalty treatment if not spore
              has no mkt to offer, not low cost centre and sporeans are normal
              people - no special geniuses.  There will always be grads who
              cannot make the grade of senior positions because we are normal
              people like other races.</p>
