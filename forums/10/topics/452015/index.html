              <p>i don't really see the ''ageing problem''as a problem.</p>
              <p>Singapore IS a small peice of land.We already have too many people as it is.Accepting people for the sake of sustaining population growth is  counter productive.You can't improve the economy without having the space to do so.</p>
              <p>Sure,there will be more elderly in sg for a period of time,but its not the end of the world. its just a natural process.Kind of wierd that something as something as basic as this will be simply ignored.</p>

              <p>People growing old and die is not a problem but the problem starts when the old not dying. <br>Root of the problem is either growing old and/or not dying.</p>
              <p>Currently, the old and not dying are from the generation where they where encouraged to have less children and penalized when they have more than 2. That generation prospered and contributed to what Singapore is today. They deserved to either grow old with dignity and/or die with dignity.</p>
              <p>Its becoming a common sight to see old folks working as janitors, cleaners, wandering tissue paper sellers. Its arguable that they have dignity, but would anyone treat them as people WITH dignity? A lot of times they became convenient target for negative examples. An elderly karang kuni has more dignity.</p>
              <p>Its sad when there's someone living alone dies in their flat. And its much sadder when the discovery of the truth was initiated by a complain of annoyance. Perhaps they chose such demise, not wanting to pollute the water source or causing trauma by leaving a bloody mess. There should be more options open to them to make better decisions.</p>
              <p>Singapore boasts of the volume and the growth of their sovereign funds. Probably cash rich as well as indicated by the defense of dipping into the reserve funds. Singapore had succeeded in projecting itself as a land of prosperity and growth, globally. It still is according the GDP readings and will strive to continue so. To do so will require manpower, creative and inventive minds to chart into the global economy. Just as every resource Singapore requires when unavailable locally, Singapore imports as required. </p>
              <p>Being living entities, Singapore treats the new immigrants with care. Adopting those that are ready to sink their roots here and proved to be productive as new citizens. They will grow old and probably die like the aging population now.</p>
              <p>By the time this generation of new citizens and locals grows old, their size would be at least three times[citations needed] the current aging population, depending on the effectiveness of the birth control policies. The problem of aging will still be growing old and/or not die. The only difference is the current generation will probably not have the priveledge to grow old and die with dignity than the current aging generation should deserve. </p>

              <p>Really so difficult for you guys to see the problem of a shrinking population?  Just look at Japan, economy has been shrinking since the eighties and its stock mkt from 39000 to 8970 now.  Luckily many japanese cos are great international cos serving the world.  Luckily, their cos try to provide as much jobs without much govt effort to their residents as possible with little discrimination against elderly workers.  And when they start up an overseas subsidiary, they will send their employees abroad to control its operations, trying to provide employment to japanese.  However, spore cos are small and do not offer great products and services to the world and they do not send many sporeans over even if they have overseas subsdiaries because of cost.  In the late 70s, only 1 in 20 are grads but now 1 in every 4 are grads.  One very significant outcome would be rising unemployed grads like some countries where high grad unemployment exist.</p>
              <p>As for the stop at 2 and later asking citizens to have more children, there is nothing wrong - because when one is poor have less children and when more affluent have more children.  What is the problem is when human beings tasted the better lives of less children would find it having more children very burdensome.</p>
              <p>There are no really that many robotic factories - when even an island has not enough people - how to attract foreign investment in spore?</p>

              <p>Proper English please? I would want to understand your position better. See <a href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/themes/economy/biz/feisummary.pdf">http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/themes/economy/biz/feisummary.pdf</a> for better understanding on foreign investment in Singapore. What is your country FDI against its population? Is there a correlation between FDI and population?</p>

              <p>The issue of the care for the elderly is not so much of due to not having enough children,rather than the existing children not looking after them.Its possible for the only child to at least show love to the parent.This is more of  SG moral issue rather than a techincal population issue.</p>
              <p>Japan has the LAND to support a larger population.For Japan,its not so much about  the economy, its about the survival of the Japanese race.</p>
              <p>Singapore as of right now,has TOO MANY people on a SMALL piece of land.Land is not just about factories.Houses,rooads and schools are just some other examples of how land is important.Thnik about recources and the prices of stuff around you as well.</p>

              <p>Japan has achieved much higher technical know how and economic dev than spore and yet since eighties it has been unable to get out of the mess.  Japan will have to cut welfare benefits and raise tax because it has debts of 200% of its GDP, so do not have to envy Japan too much.</p>
              <p>I do not think that the cost of 1/3 aliens is people do not feel as one in spore because those former sgporeans that migrated are living with much more aliens to them and yet they identify with their new countries as one.</p>
              <p>China and India are having great economic powers because of their historical high birth rates, if not they should be the first to be developed nations long ago.  They have great economic power because they have fast rising middle incomers beyond critical masses in a no of their cities.  The rising middle incomers are because of FDIs in those cities.</p>
              <p>Certainly greying and shrinking popn is an economic problem beside having other problems like fiscal burdens.  Do you think US, Canada and Aust are compassionate in welcoming investor/skilled aliens?</p>
              <p>We should ask how EDB bring in those FDIs.  But roughly, large market/consumers is an attraction or close to market.  I have no time to list the other 7 factors but certainly popn in cities is closely correlated to FDIs(not country popn).</p>

              <p>I believe you misunderstood me here.

                                      and received FDI.<br> The increase in population is to cater for the needs required by
                                      developments brought by the increase in investments from projected
                                      high returns.<span style="color: #ff0000;">Your quote on Yangon density appears not reasonable.  When I visited Yangon in the 90s, there was hardly any multi-storey bldgs and Yangon only recently opens up.  How can Yangon achieve a density of more than 6800 per sq km?  What is important is the large no of middle incomers earning sizeable income that investors are interested.  So pure large popn is not the important factor.<br></span></p>
