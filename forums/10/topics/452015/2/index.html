              <p>No country accepts immigrants to do charity work or to encumber themselves with extra burden.  The main reason for accepting immigrants is their contributions to the country, viz:</p>
              <p>1)   To contribute money and skills to the society(skills based)</p>
              <p>2)   To contribute investment and employment (business based)</p>
              <p>3)   To top up the taxes to help to pay for the welfare benefits</p>
              <p>4)   To makeup for the shrinking pool of taxpayers due to aging fall in fertility</p>
              <p>5)   to add up the skills pool to attract more FDIs.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Boss, the reasons given are all the reasons why US,Canada, Aust, NZ and spore(or any country) wants immigrants - not just spore.  Is spore's cost of operation here cheaper than those favourites like China and hk? No.  Has spore got big market for their products/services - only one city but proximity to mkt - so so.  Spore skills superior?  so so  Then what the hell these FDIs are here?(I am not counting those here to get consumption like casinos, restaurants, pubs or retail outlets etc)  They are here because they have a free control of their capital flow, human resource and distribution under stable environment.  They are not idiots , coming to give us goodies you know. </p></div>

              <p>Usually politicians would say that for develloped economies the growth rate should  be only up to 3% and they would be very pleased.  This they would portray as analogous to maturity.  Actually, for most of the developed economies in the world now, if they could get the leaders and at least 2/3 of the people to be with  one heart to progress there are still more progress to be made.  Singapore has achieved a lot in the past 5 decades because the leaders and  2/3 of the people are one in working together to achieve progress.  So spore's progress has picked and now it is struggling to maintain its position only.  If we become more divisive like them 48/52, spore's status will guarantee to be far lower ie the external economy will dwindle and not maintain.</p>
              <p>Why?  In corporate world a company can keep growing if the leaders can maintain common mission among most of their employees over centuries like GE thru selection of new employees and dismissing hardcore dissents to attain large majority in unity of mission.  Politically, no countries could do this over long periods of time.because they do not have this option available to them.</p>

                                      to sometimes 11 pm,everyday!ferrying mostly FTs around!and get
                                      scoldings fr them!<span style="color: #ff0000;">I can empathise with your long hours.  But you cannot appreciate that you are still better than a junior empoyee.  A junior employee cannot simply work OT to earn more money - they need mgrs/supervisors to approve whereas as business owners you have the freedom to work less hours or take off or work long hours when you need more money.  However, as a business owner it is normal to be scolded by customers.  Are u exagerating it is only FTs are scolding you unless you are picking up on FTs.  And also please also do not lump all the aliens as FTs as some might be alien visitors.  Is Qien Yi Fong considered a FT?  If you do not like to be taxi driving all the time you can always try to work your way up.  I have met thos maxicab owners very customer friendly and they are very happy with their time and earnings networking with sp local talents and real fts to get them to call for their services.  Another way is to work hard and save and move up to more profitable businesses with more capital.  There is great virtue in hard work and move up like our forefathers.  Good Luck!<br></span></span></p>

              <p>at this rate we will be killed at one per day<span style="color: #ff0000;">Please lah do you really mean what you say?  I leave it to your conscience.  Yesterday, at Subiaco market, Perth, I saw one young white man sat by the road with a card board saying something like this'Hello! I am homeless and hungry.  If you have coins please spare some.  Thank you.'  He was reading a novel.  15 steps away, a young white girl displayed a cardboard that says something like this' I am hungry and homeless.  Please spare me some coins.  Thank you'.  She was eating some wraps.  When I was at one of the mkt stall, the owner (a vietnamese lady) was asking a late 30s white man(luckily very small built like her) to empty all the goods in his bag in front of crowded customers.  He said he wanted to pay by credit card as he does not have money with him.  The lady told him to just leave the goods behind and if he wants to patronise the stall next time bring cash.  So if I were to label that wah Subiaco is only a small town within Perth, it has 2 beggars and a thief within that location and said Perth or Australia is full of beggars and thieves - fair to Australia?  And especially Australia is supposed to be a good welfare country.  I do not this to be fair as sometimes things just sway sway happen in succession.<br></span></p>

              <p>The govt is sadly not countering the aging problem w the root of the problem, but instead take the shortcut way by importing immigrants.  The foreigners who take up the citizenship will ultimately face the same situation as the native Singaporeans and eventually produce less or no baby.  By 2030, our population will be faced w worse aging <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  ">situation.  </span></p>

              <p>At the rate what our govt is doing, we only have two situations:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) the FTs come here, use our govt's money to study (ie scholarship, pocket money etc) and go home after some years, saying to the SG,"Thank you, Sg govt.  But gratitude is not love."</p>
              <p>2) FTs accept the citizenships which are given to them so easily.  They become citizens.  And they are faced with the difficulties that Singaporeans today are facing: expensive housing, competitive education system, job and future insecurity.  They will either leave Singapore and let our govt call them quitters, or they stay here and not have children, for the very same reasons why Singaporeans are not having children. </p>
              <p>So in the end, we are all back to square one.  The only difference is, the Govt are still drawing high pay despite their wrong strategies, cuz the Singaporeans are still paying taxes that go to their pay.  Singaporeans who stay here will continue be the one facing the music of any bad policy.</p>
              <p>I hope they wake up and start doing the right thing.  Otherwise, they will end up either importing enough ingrates to overthrow them, or get overthrown by the native Singaporeans as GE2016 is not really that far from now.</p>
              <p>In the end, we are still faced with the aging population situation.</p>
