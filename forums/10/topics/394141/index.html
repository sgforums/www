              <p>I notice that several times already, Theonlinecitizen would publish some articles and then the MSM would follow.</p>
              <p>Is this pure coincidence?</p>
              <p>Case in point:</p>
              <p>1. article on Foreign worker plight.</p>
              <p>2. article on Illegal tiger parts trade.</p>
              <p>3. there could be more. you may know what these are.</p>
              <p>Have you noticed?</p>
              <p>Nowadays, they have an article saying people are Not Apathetic.</p>
              <p>Opposition like RP members have described that Apathy is still a problem. Why is TOC saying that singaporeans are not Apathetic?</p>
              <p>Less are apathetic but it does not mean generally the population is not apathetic. This is a big difference.</p>
              <p> Here is a video documented by a youtuber to prove that some residents in some parts of singapore are truely Apathetic in a certain way at least : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZfenD0vyjc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZfenD0vyjc</a></p>
              <p>Since late last year till now, at least more than 4 months in a row already, many mynah birds have been congregating on a stretch of  certain HDB carpark trees. They generally flock to the trees creating huge noise more than sufficient to wake up most residents at following times: 4-6am, 5-6pm, 11pm-midnight.</p>
              <p>The documentor does not want to call the authorities to see how long the residents will endure all the bird shit and noise. He has proven residents in this part of singapore BOCHAP even if their sleep is affected daily!.</p>
              <p>This is just 1 example.</p>

              <p>there is something wrong with TS.</p>
              <p>The birds are part of nature. Even I hate bird shit on my car, crows  giving a morning call, it does not meant that I am going to kill them. 
                  
                  You have just tell me that the birds are disturbing the residents, they should call the authorities to come and chop off the tress or kill all the birds. For heaven sake, while humans are destroying nature, tearing up forest to build their homes, I think they should still leave some room for the small animals to dwell in.</p>
              <p>In case, you are unsure: 1) foreign workers are filling up the space that Singaporean dont want to do. 2) who care about tiger parts, I only know that they are caged big cats found in the zoo 3) The African natives see tigers as horrible monster that will eat them and to be killed on sight.</p>

              <p>Why put words into my mouth to say about killing birds? I did not talk about killing birds. Its only you who said it. There are ways to curb this. As I mentioned, authorities can be called. The authorities were not called  to prove a point about apathy. Can you understand?</p>

              <p>[end quote] </p>
              <p>Again, you are jumping to conclusion. Who says i don't understand some jobs singaporeans do not want? There are also some jobs that singaporeans want but due to foreign worker competition the pay become too low for them to accept. Why work when it does not make financial sense? If salaries are higher or cost of living lower, more of these jobs would be taken up by singaporeans.</p>

              <p>I am not only talking about the coincidence of the way TOC and MSM articles are published. Its not about tiger parts per se. You do not see the point.</p>
