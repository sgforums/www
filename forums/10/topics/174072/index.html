            <div class='col-md body'>As a small business owner who intends to support the employment of NSmen and Singaporeans, I am often forced to consider Permanent Resident passholders as they do not have to do reservist training.<br><br>Many NSmen have to attend three weeks of in-camp training yearly and this is very disruptive to a small business.<br><br>A business employs a person for his contribution to the company and while it does not have to pay the NSmen salary (it still has to contribute to the CPF), the company loses its potential income for the period of training.<br><br>Many companies will typically pay NSmen higher than PRs, but because of the 'disincentive', it is no longer viable. Larger companies can probably absorb the 'losses' but for how long and how many NSmen do they employ? Has it become more attractive to employ PRs or workers other than NSmen?<br><br>NSmen are essential for the security of our country but has the system put a penalty on our NSmen and turn them into a liability, especially to small companies?<br><br>Have the SAF studied various methods to compress the training and reduce the training period to reduce to the minimum the disruption to businesses?<br><br>Have the military men gone overboard with their plans for training to increase their importance without taking into consideration the economics involved?<br><br>In the first place, can these military men empathise with the business world when they have not operated a business in their lifetime?<br><br>Our employee with the 427th SAR recently went for a two-day stint that involved rehearsals for a parade to welcome the new commanding officer. Essential? You decide?<br><br>Sylvester Lim Teck Hee<br><br>haiz...just your luck for being born as a sg male.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i am sure most SMEs are aware of such things. So, its common to employ PRs instead of local guys..<br>But the point is, its once a year thing. If the company decides to give up some1 who is very capable just because of the 2-3weeks stint, wouldnt it be worse for its own company functioning?<br><br>I do acknowledge the fact that it is pretty disruptive, not just to employer, but to the employee as well.<br>But like the propaganda, you have to protect your country..if not, if it falls, who still cares about the company survival? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

A lot.<br>But I took it and the only time I defered was when I got married.<br><br>In case you are not aware, SAF do give a lot of leeway to small business owners when it comes to disruptions for NS. NS has also been reduced from 13 to 10 years, with low key years among them, ie, 1 week or no training.<br><br>BTW, most ICTs are less than 3 weeks. Only exercises like Atec is three weeks and three weeks only applies to key personnel within the unit. The main body does only 2 weeks.<br><br>This writer is obviously trying to spin here by taking the extreme and pretending it to be the norm. Can't BS with a true blue singaporean here boy.
