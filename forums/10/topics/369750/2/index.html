              <p>It is right that SMRT imposes the no eating and drinking rule.</p>
              <p>The logic is to ensure that the trains are clean and safe.</p>
              <p>The issue is that what will make the trains dirty and unsafe.</p>
              <p>The eating of food and drinking will lead to debris and liquids and smell lingering in the trains and make them dirty, unpleasant and unsafe.</p>
              <p>Hence, all these activities should not be allowed and the passengers be fined.</p>
              <p>The issue is a sweet in one's mouth. How will this dirty and make the train unsafe ?</p>
              <p>There are passengers who leave the newspapers and tissue papers behind after use and passengers who cut their nails in the trains, These activities dirty the trains.</p>
              <p>There are passengers who played the music loudly in the trains and these activities make the journey unpleasant to other passengers.</p>
              <p>PS : Mancha, it is a real case that a passenger is fined for this reason.</p>

              <p>There is a rule against eating, and there is a rule against littering, amont others. If the girl put the sweet in the mouth and drops the wrapper on to the floor, she would have breached two rules. Put the sweet in the mouth only, one breach.</p>

              <p>SMRT don't really do anything wrong by implementing this policy but they have definetly overdone it. Though I am wondering is this just for show for awhile to scare passengers than later no more liao.</p>
              <p>To me eating sweets is still consider eating but than there is the question of what did they do to make passengers feel uncomfortable or dirty the environment? There is really no need to fine such people as long as they don't throw sweets wrapper on the floor. The whole thing is very simple, nothing was done to the train or affect other commuter other than the eater gets to enjoy the sweets. What's wrong with them, jealous that they got sweets to enjoy?</p>
              <p>Than there is drinking water, what if the person who in need of water is a child, you expect them to sit for the whole 1 hour journey bearing their thirst? Also if it is a toddler/baby it probably can cry for the whole journey and probably end up in the hospital due to dehydration, can their parents sue SMRT for this? For me, I will just daringly drink no matter what, I did not wet the floor and my plain water does not attract pests, neither does it affect the commuters. Seriously there is no need to look out for them if you don't feel guilty about it cause to me drinking plain water is purely all right and it is recommended to drink lots of it especially when the environment is very dry.</p>
              <p>So probably SMRT is doing this to scare people for a month (pity those unlucky people) or they trying their recoup their loses from the fine LTA gave them.</p>

              <p>Think of it this way. What if for some reason the train jerks real hard to a sudden stop, and your bottle of water spills. Are you going to clean up the mess even if it's just plain water? Now imagine 20 commuters in the same compartment drinking their plain water. Who is going to clean up the mess?</p>

              <p>I understand that  you are a beautiful, healthy and young lady and you have probably not experienced any serious illness except flu and fever. Doctors always advise patients to take the medication as soon as possible when patients begin to feel the symptoms. Symptoms and illnesses cannot be timed and planned.</p>
              <p>The logic of only healthy individuals can make use of public transport system is flawed.</p>
              <p>Indeed, SMRT has already made many efforts to help the infirm, handicap, wheelchaired and elderly individuals in making it safe and user friendly to them by building ramps and lifts.</p>
              <p>SMRT's management philosophy is definitely socially responsible but in this particularly case, an SMRT employee has probably being over zealous in performing his or her duty and overdone it.</p>
              <p>PS : Angel, since you like to assume the identity of being the SMRT spokeswoman, may I pose you the question that how will a sweet in one's mouth dirty the train or make it unsafe ? It is obvious. The answer is it will not dirty or make the train unsafe. The train will be dirtied only when the passenger throws the wrapper on the floor.</p>
              <p>If she does not dirty the train or make it unsafe, how can this passenger be fined ?</p>

              <p>Sorry for my teasing part, and how on earth do you understand so much about me. Have you met me somewhere??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advices to those who are sick, take a cab or cover your mouth with a face mask, take your medication and drink before boarding and after disembark. So simple rules, why cannot follow??? You will indian and foreigner chewing betel leaves in MRT, you want PRC munching peanuts in MRT, you want oldies sucking coffee or tea from those plastic bags. Please, just do whatever you like to eat or drink out of our MRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You take a sweet, keep the wrapper in your bag, nex the indian take a prata and stuff into his mouth, leave the packet in the seat, next one PRC gal take a mint and leave the plastic wrapper flying on the floor, next, one child take a sip of his milkshake and drip it over the floor, next, one malay man coughed and took a cough sweet but slowly leave his wrapper behind on the seat...etc etc..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may be good, but not others, MRT is not targeting you only, if only u take MRT, no problem, but MRT is a MASS...refer to mass communication and rules. I suggest you go take Mass Communication courses, one of the top course around. Maybe you will understand better.</p>

              <p>to those who think that SMRT is overboard in the "no eating/drinking rule"</p>
              <p>i agree with angel7030 explaination on why it should be enforced, and i also like to state the reason why from  some pple i know who work there under techical areas.</p>
              <p>1)GTM ticketing machine..1 case happen of it happen for the machine to malfuction is cause some smart alex squeeze tissue and sweet wappers in 1 of the coin slots.</p>
              <p>2)if this "no eating/no drinking " rule was not enforced some pple wold squeeze sweets wappers in basically any hole or slot they find on the train, if the sweet still contain some of the contents in it and melt thru, it might damage something or part of the train equipment too...guess who's paying for repairs and maintaince for it?..yup rite..SMRT</p>
              <p>3)i myself have seen spitted sweets around some areas or near the tracks in some stations before this rule was enforced..maybe i'll refesh all of you a little bit of history..back abt 1 year ago..an LRT track faced frequent disruptions due to a teenager who threw a bag of glue onto the LRT tracks from a nearby HDB flat. this was reported in the newspaper..so if the same can happen to LRT..it can also happen to MRT..and the superglue culprit can be replaced by sweets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in short..there is a cycle going on here..irresponsiable public eats, dirtys and damages SMRT equipment, replacement parts get more expensive, fares start to rise,public grumble,public pay more, service may improve or start to improve till another irresponsonable public starts the whole cycle again</p>
              <p>for now..the irresponsiable public is getting more and more..and it's made more worse by other ingnorant foriegn workers too.</p>

              <p><br>So have you ask yourself why is SMRT implementing such rules??</p>
              <p>the answer is because of STOMP!!!</p>
              <p>Singaporeans keep on stomping.. eat on train, drink on train, never give up seats blah blah blah... the more you stomp about these issues, then more rules are set then the more inconvenience will be brought to the other passengers.</p>
              <p>therefore think before you STOMP!!... dont every little bit of thing you STOMP. Later you stomp, authorities never do anything... kanna say and suan... authorities do something also kanna say never plan properly, rule not feasible etc.</p>
              <p>Kanina singaporeans just like to create trouble for themselves and others. Open your heart and accept things... dont need to STOMP each and every thing you buay song..</p>

              <p><br>No, actually, no eating and drinking policies is already enforced but just that the authority never really look into it as they believed that we are gracious enuf to heel the notices as most of us are laws abidding people, typically speaking, we know that littering is not allowed. But to certain extend, because we have foreigners influx into our society, we begin to see a less gracious side of Singapore, for them, they come from countries when spitting, throwing and eating is a norm. Therefore the authority needs to enforce further what had been enforced to get back on track.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, not only we have a cleaner environment, we trained these foreigners to suit into our society and perhap they can bring back these good habits back to their lands.</p>
