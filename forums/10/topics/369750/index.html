              <p>Not long ago, LTA has implemented that all taxis passengers regardless of their health conditions must alight at the designated taxis stands in the CBD areas and this causes a furore before LTA eventually allows taxis passengers to alight at the side road. It is a case of no proper planning and feasibility studies done before a policy is implemented.</p>
              <p>Now, SMRT has implemented the no drinking and eating rule inside the trains. SMRT has fined a passenger who has taken a sweet to supplement her low sugar level as doctors have advised these patients to take a sweet otherwise these patient will faint. The irony is that the passenger is not fine because the passenger is throwing the wrapper on the floor but the passenger is fined because the passenger has a sweet in the mouth.</p>
              <p>It is going to be another case of no proper planning and feasibility studies done before a policy is implemented.</p>

              I was about to start a thread about this, just nice...
              
              In regards to the no eating or drinking in trains and buses, I think some boundaries have to be set.
              
              I was drinking water from my water bottle in a train(NEL) home, and I was rudely interrupted by the train attendant in the train to ask me to stop drinking. What the fuck? It's just plain water, not some coke, pepsi, etc... I find it very absurd. What if my journey starts from Pasir Ris and ends at Woodlands? I have to tahan the thirst until I reach the station, exit the station and then start sipping water from my water bottle? Fucking ridiculous!
              
              Regarding the passenger with low sugar level, what if she really faints in the train? Is SMRT gonna take the responsibility? Is SMRT gonna pay the medical/hospital bills for the passenger? I don't think so... They will be like: "You are just suay that you cannot tahan throughout the entire journey, so it's none of our business."
              
              SMRT, please use some brains(If you guys have any) to plan out how the policy is gonna be both be beneficial and safe for the Singapore community.

              The no eating / drinking rules have been there for quite a number of years. Nobody in the past blatantly violates the rules except occasional sips of water to relieve their thirst or popping a sweet to for whatever reasons. Now, there are a small number of people eating burgers, ice-cream, fruits etc inside the MRT. Because of these minorities, everyone has to suffer. Even those who take occasional sips of water to relieve their thirst or pop a sweet for whatever reasons are also fined.

                  So.. what? I am suppose to check my surroundings for any "police officers" aka train attendants before I commit my "crime" of drinking water from my water bottle?<br><br>
                  
                  Yes, I understand that are some people who are seriously inconsiderate to consume their foods, e.g. burgers, noodles, rice, worse of all-- fried food(where the aroma can spread as fast as a tsunami). THESE people deserves to get fine-- no... double fine an a warning. They do it again, a higher fine and another warning. After the 2nd warning, jail.
                  Just imagine you are feeling hungry all over, and then suddenly this person opens his packet of french fries and the smell linger all around the bus/train, making you even more hungrier.<br><br>
                  
                  In regards to sweets, I think it should also be fine to consume while onboard. Sometimes eating sweets will keep you awake throughout the journey. It's not as if the smell from the sweet is so strong like an opened Ambi Pur air freshener container. Talking about being awake in public transports, posters and the song sung by gurmit singh in MRT stations, "Don't pretend to sleep, blah blah blah"... Telling us not to hog seats by "pretending" to sleep... 
                  I think that song is fucked up. It really bring shame to Singaporeans, can you imagine Singapore government is teaching us, baby-step, on how to behave on public transports? Putting up posters was good enough, I don't know why they wanna do another brainless MV regarding social(transport) etiquette?<br><br>
                  
                  And that song really pricks my ears.

              <p>I understand that  you are a beautiful, healthy and young lady and you have probably not experienced any serious illness except flu and fever. Doctors always advise patients to take the medication as soon as possible when patients begin to feel the symptoms. Symptoms and illnesses cannot be timed and planned.</p>
              <p>The logic of only healthy individuals can make use of public transport system is flawed.</p>
              <p>Indeed, SMRT has already made many efforts to help the infirm, handicap, wheelchaired and elderly individuals in making it safe and user friendly to them by building ramps and lifts.</p>
              <p>SMRT's management philosophy is definitely socially responsible but in this particularly case, an SMRT employee has probably being over zealous in performing his or her duty and overdone it.</p>
              <p>PS : Angel, since you like to assume the identity of being the SMRT spokeswoman, may I pose you the question that how will a sweet in one's mouth dirty the train or make it unsafe ? It is obvious. The answer is it will not dirty or make the train unsafe. The train will be dirtied only when the passenger throws the wrapper on the floor.</p>
              <p>If she does not dirty the train or make it unsafe, how can this passenger be fined ?</p>
