            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt that this school looks posh, with air-conditioned classrooms and security guards marching around. The school fees are just as posh too.(School feels are like 500 times more then government school)<br><br>Students who register in the school are either clueless foreigners or overaged reject local students. (sadly I am one of them). I am attending a pre-u course which is equivilent to the local JC 2 year course.<br><br>Teachers are totally disconnected with the MOE since they claim that the MOE discriminate them. They try to teach according to the syllabus which they downloaded from the moe website at <a href="http://www.moe.edu.sg" rel="nofollow">www.moe.edu.sg</a>  .They are so useless at preparing the Pre U students for their A levels. I can safely say that like the students, they are reject teachers. No teacher in the school bothers to prepare booklets of notes unlike the local JCs, they expect you to learn with the little points they make in class and the pathetic worksheets they handout.<br><br>The tutorials range from 2 to 25 students per class. This should encourage the teacher to give individual attention to the students but they dont. The class consist of "fast" and "slow" students, they dont bother about the "slow" ones, expecting them to catch up by themselves.<br><br>They dont offer many sports and uses the canteen as a gym, an assembly hall, a badminton court and what have you not. Making the students who are having lunch fearful of flying shuttle cocks ending in their meals.<br><br>Sigh! If only I can get a refund. I'd rather "SOW TOH KAH" then study here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You seem to have a problem with the local education system...<br><br>First, it was your private school fiasco, now, its your friend's JC debacle.<br><br>Well, first of all, private schools charge really ridiculous fees cos MOE doesn't subsidise them. Its no big secret<br><br>Their poor standards are pretty well known too if u had just bothered to do your homework before signing up and paying the fees! Blame yourself for getting duped...<br><br>It IS still possible to find your own materials and study for A levels u know... Its called a "Library"... and nearly every neighbourhood has one... Learn to use it... there are many relevant stuff you could use.<br><br>SURE its hard work! But which one of us went through the "A"s studying ONLY lecture notes???<br><br>Did you honestly think that u would get fantastic grades if u mugged lecture notes and wrote the same thing as thousands of other people?<br><br>you don't need a good teacher... u need a nanny to spoon feed you crap to regurgitate for exams. Hers's news for you...  IT DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL!<br><br>And what on earth makes u think that JCs give "personalised" attention to slower students? It really depends on the teacher... Most would leave you to drown unless you took the initiative to ask them yourself.<br><br>And how on earth is a tutorial supposed to progress if the teacher follows the pace of the slowest student? THINK man!<br><br>By the way, I SO sympathise that St. Francis doesn't have a track, a gym, a spa and a swimming pool... I do hope that their air-conditioned classrooms have desks and chairs...<br><br>Stop complaining and spend your time getting some constructive work done instead. Everybody's a goddamn victim!<br><br>------------------<br>I never saw a wild thing<br>sorry for itself.<br>A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough<br>without ever having felt sorry for itself.<br><br>D.

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to be fron a JC, im re-taking my A levels. I was comparing the difference. I do have my own resources to study for my A levels that is why I realised that the rest of my schoolmates are being left out and am speaking for them. I also hope that people will not be fooled by the promising advertisements made by the school as it is a whole bunch of crap. In their asvertisements, they like to emphasise on how each student is able to receive individual attention and how stress free their studying enviroment is.<br><br>My previous article is just a precaution to people who are having intensions to enrol in the school.</div>
