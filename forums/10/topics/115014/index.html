            <div class='col-md body'>Why is it that during the Tsunami fundraising period, people tend to focus on only monetary service? What about being there physically to help pack the foodstuff, etc, or volunteer services at the tsunami hit areas by doctors, nurses, with the government sharing or footing the cost of transport?<br><br>It seems to me we have a "money fixes it" belief. If someone needs help, all we know is "ok, where can I donate if I want to?"<br><br>Look at the fundraising tv shows. They're forever trying to raise money. Have they ever attempted to increase awareness about volunteerism?<br><br>The power of the media should not be unestimated. I think the government has not done enough in this aspect definitely. Volunteering our services (like taking just one day to volunteer for everyone) is not going to stagnate our economy. Our government should stop being so disgustingly pragmatic.<br><br>I believe that more should be done to increase awareness for volunteerism so that Singaporeans can do volunteer work on a more regular basis, and for some, for the first time. It would be nice to share some warmth with others, rather than wanting it all for ourselves.<br><br>The most important first step is to remove the widely permeating misconception that the only way to help is through $$; meaning the tv network should tone down their fundraising activity by not continuously harping on about their "target amount".<br><br>It is much more meaningful to do volunteer work occasionally than to spend all of one's weekends thronging in malls aimlessly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The problem with charity - Sumiko Tan</strong><br><br>To give is divine but what if the intention behind the giving is less than charitable?<br><br>I'VE always been wary of the word 'charity'.<br><br>For one, I pray I never have to be in a position where I have to beg for anyone's charity.<br><br>This, I suppose, is a result of growing up in a society that eschews handouts and emphasises self-made success.<br><br>Another reason is that the word 'charity' smacks of condescension - to me, at least.<br><br>It conjures up the image of a rich personage standing in his gilded balcony bestowing his largesse on a quivering, grateful mass of the unwashed below.<br><br>I am, of course, being uncharitable (and dramatic), putting it like this.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. I've no doubt that the milk of human kindness runs deep in the human species, and it is what has nourished us and kept us going as a race.<br><br>What I mean is that the word 'charity', for all its noble origins and intentions, has taken on a I'm-better-than-thou association.<br><br>Words like 'compassion', 'mercy' and 'kindness' depict better the values that 'charity' stands for.<br><br>But I'm quibbling over semantics.<br><br>This column is about how recent events have proven that the world is not short on charity/compassion/mercy/kindness, call it what you will.<br><br>Witness the outpouring of help, both monetary and in kind, for victims of the tsunami.<br><br>Still, I wonder, what is charity, really?<br><br>To give is, of course, divine. But what if the intention behind the giving is a bit more fuzzy? Does the act of charity still stand up to scrutiny, then?<br><br>For example, a person who goes out of his way to help a stranger is undoubtedly charitable and should be praised.<br><br>But what if this same person turns a blind eye to the needs of his immediate family and neighbours? (And I do know people like that.) Would he still be considered charitable?<br><br>If you are willing to take a week's leave from work to fly off to Banda Aceh to help the victims of the tsunami, that is truly laudable and I applaud you.<br><br>But how many would take leave to offer their services to, say, the Ren Ci Hospital in Jalan Tan Tock Seng? Or the leprosy home in Lorong Buangkok? Or is that sort of altruistic work less rewarding?<br><br>I don't mean to question or devalue the goodness of well-intentioned volunteers. I'm sure the majority offered their services with a pure and compassionate heart. And charity is charity, whether you do it at home or in Trincomalee.<br><br>Besides, I who have been sitting on my butt these few weeks and who have done nothing significant to help, should be the last person to criticise anyone.<br><br>But the cynic in me does wonder: Could there be slivers of selfishness buried in this great outpouring of help?<br><br>How much of it has to do with the 'glamour' of the tsunami tragedy and wanting to be in the thick of 'action'? With wanting to acquire the bragging rights and war wounds of having been involved in modern history's worst natural disaster?<br><br>Some of you would tell me to get real: Nobody's perfect. What's wrong with little specks of personal selfishness if actions result in overall good, if help is indeed rendered and lives improved?<br><br>I don't know.<br><br>Then there is the question of quantifying charity.<br><br>Is a person who donates $50 less charitable than one who gives $500? Or should one's charity quotient be pegged to a percentage of his income?<br><br>Is Bill Gates, who donated US$3 million to tsunami relief, less charitable than Michael Schumacher, who gave US$10 million? Correspondingly, is Schumacher a 'better' person? And Gates more 'stingy'? Then again, if you announce your charitable deed - presumably to show how generous you are - is that embracing the true spirit of altruism?<br><br>If you donate clothes and shoes you no longer have use for, is that charity? Or is the true test giving away something you treasure?<br><br>Then there is 'conditional' charity.<br><br>Spend $10 and $1 will go to charity, say some shops. Charity? Or cashing in on the situation?<br><br>THE problem with charity is fatigue.<br><br>As the German playwright Bertolt Brecht once wrote: 'A man who sees another man on the street corner with only a stump for an arm will be so shocked the first time, he'll give him sixpence.<br><br>'But the second time it'll only be a threepenny bit. And if he sees him a third time, he'll cold-bloodedly have him handed over to the police.'<br><br>The demands of charity today are non-stop and overwhelming.<br><br>You get pleas in the mail. Letters are addressed personally to you in pretty cursive font, imploring you to write a cheque to improve the life of a disfigured child whose story is related in the most heart-rending way possible.<br><br>You get appeals in the newspaper asking you to sponsor the meals of disadvantaged students.<br><br>You get donation tins thrust in your face as you walk down Orchard Road. You get people asking you to buy tissue paper. You get fund-raising shows on TV urging you to phone in a donation.<br><br>To be a 'successful' charity today, it's all about branding and marketing.<br><br>It's all about creating a three-hour show or a three-page pamphlet cleverly packaged to tug, not only at the heartstrings, but also purse strings.<br><br>Society is becoming so desensitised to suffering that charities have to trot out more and more dramatic images of suffering - real and manufactured.<br><br>TV charity shows are an example, juxtaposing sad images of sick people with beautiful actresses sweating with fear as they attempt dangerous stunts.<br><br>It also explains why the tsunami got such an overwhelming response. The images of extreme suffering, packaged and shown non-stop on global TV, moved people to action.<br><br>The true test of how compassionate one really is will be six months down the road, when Banda Aceh no longer merits a headline.<br><br>Will there still be hundreds of volunteers queueing up to help rebuild the lives there?<br><br>Call me cynical, but I fear not.<br><br>And that, I think, will be another tragedy.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Six Tips of Volunteering<br><br>Consider the skills you have to offer.<br><br>If you enjoy outdoor work, have a knack for teaching, or just enjoy interacting with people, you may want to look for volunteer work which would incorporate these aspects of your personality. Many positions require a volunteer who has previous familiarity with certain equipment, such as computers, or who possesses certain skills, such as ability in athletics or communications. For one of these positions you might decide to do something comparable to what you do on the job during your work day, or something which you already enjoy as a hobby. This sort of position allows you to jump right into the work without having to take training to prepare for the assignment.<br><br>Would you like to learn something new?<br><br>Perhaps you would like to move into areas which will provide you with novelty or change. Then seek a volunteer opportunity involving training in an unfamiliar skill. Many nonprofits seek out people who are willing to learn, especially if the needs they serve are specialized or unique. Many nonprofits have a demonstrated need, but few volunteers skilled in what it takes to fill that need. Realize beforehand, however, that such work might require much more of an effort or a time commitment for training before the actual volunteer assignment begins. Make sure you are willing to commit to the necessary responsibilities.<br><br><strong>Nonprofits may have questions, too.<br><br>While most nonprofits are eager to find volunteer help, they have to be careful when accepting the services you offer. If you contact an organization with an offer to donate your time, you may be asked to come in for an interview, fill out a volunteer application, describe your qualifications and your backgroundÂ—just as you would at an interview for a paying job. It is in the organizationÂ’s interest to make certain you have the skills they need, that you are truly committed to doing the work, and that your interests match those of the nonprofit. Furthermore, in volunteer work involving children or other at-risk populations, there are legal ramifications for the organization to consider. </strong><br><br>Research the causes or issues important to you.<br><br>Look for a group which deals with issues about which you feel strongly. You might already be giving money to one of these organizations, and that might be a good place to begin your volunteer experience. If you canÂ’t find such an organization, hereÂ’s a challenging and intriguing thought: why not start one yourself? You can rally your neighbors to clean up that vacant lot on the corner, patrol the neighborhood, paint an elderly neighborÂ’s house, take turns keeping an eye on the ailing person down the street, or form a group to advocate for a remedy to that dangerous intersection in your neighborhood. There is no end to the creative avenues for volunteering, just as there is no end to the need for volunteers.<br><br>Consider volunteering as a family.<br><br>Think about looking for a volunteer opportunity which would be suitable for parents and children to do together, or for husband and wife to take on as a team. When a family volunteers to work together at a nonprofit organization, the experience can bring them closer together, teach young children the value of giving their time and effort, introduce everyone in the family to skills and experiences never before encountered, and give the entire family a shared experience as a wonderful family memory.<br><br><strong><br>DonÂ’t over-commit your schedule.<br><br>Make sure the volunteer hours you want to give fit into your hectic life, so that you donÂ’t frustrate your family, exhaust yourself, shortchange the organization youÂ’re trying to help or neglect your day job. Do you want a long-term assignment or something temporary? If you are unsure about your availability, or want to see how the work suits you before making an extensive commitment, see if the organization will start you out on a limited number of hours until you get the feel of things. Better to start out slowly than to commit yourself to a schedule you canÂ’tÂ—or donÂ’t want toÂ— fulfill. </strong><br></div>

What about being there physically to help pack the foodstuff, etc, or volunteer services at the tsunami hit areas by doctors, nurses, with the government sharing or footing the cost of transport?<br></div></blockquote>Sometimes, money still needed to transport stuff and pay for bulk refuse removal when people donate useless stuff.<br>Also money is more "flexible". Clothes are clothes, can use for wearing. Cannot use for buying boxes, tape, or transport to disaster stricken areas.<br><br>Also, we live in a fast paced society lah... Rush from one place to another, people also trying to keep up with the pace. Who wanna get left behind? No choice but to keep up.<br><br>If this disaster did not involve so many westerners, would it have been so publicized? Would people be rushing to their rescue? Would this thread have been started?<br><br>Also, anybody noticed the sudden increase in people going round for donations the past month? Not just related to the tsunami but from almost every organisation? I'm not saying they're not legitmate, but even they are cashing in on the public's willingness to give money at a time like this. How you expect to convince people to be volunteers in such organisations?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">The true test of how compassionate one really is will be six months down the road, when Banda Aceh no longer merits a headline.<br><br>Will there still be hundreds of volunteers queueing up to help rebuild the lives there?<br></div></blockquote>Btw, I believe the Singapore International Foundation is sending youths over to Banda Aceh in June. So, don't get so worked up ok? There's still hope for change. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
