            <div class='col-md body'>Is there proof that RSAF has done so? So far Malaysia has not released concrete proof that they have detected or intercepted any RSAF aircraft intruding into Malaysian airspace. If they really had detected RSAF planes in their airspace, I doubt they would sit on the news. It could be just a political ploy to say that RSAF planes has intruded into Malaysian airspace.</div>

We have always said 2 things everytime alegations of intrusions come out:<br><br>1) Deny knowledge of any intrusions<br>2) Ask for proof. Dates, times, aircraft involved.<br><br>Fact: Malaysia has made lots of allegations. However all too often thats all there is: allegations. No concrete proof, no radar tapes showing intruding aircraft's radar tracks, no photographs, nothing. Just viilagers claiming this and that and Utusan Malaysia happily repaeating their word as gospel without checking facts.<br><br>Like I've mentioned before on other threads, I can only remember 2 occasions where there were concrete proof supplied. One was when Malaysia asked RSAF to check if there was a deviation from an RSAF jet's flightpath across M'sia. We checked and found that yes, 3 F-5s deviated from their approved flightpath due to bad weather causing temporary disorientation among the pilots. RSAF apologised. Note that this case was not an intrusion. The RSAF jets weer allowed into M'sia, but strayed from their flightplan inadvertently<br><br>Second time there was the typical press agitation among certain sectiosn of the M'sian press, loud clamour about instrusions blah blah blah, lots of names called, accusations, hysterics etc etc. Only problem was that the Star did a bit of digging(says a lot about the M'sian press when investigative reporting is done by a tabloid IMO) and found that the "RSAF intruders" were a group of USAF planes leaving Singapore on their way back to their bases in NE Asia. Of course, despite accusing their neighbours without proof, calling us nasty names among many other things, once the press was busted by one of its own, there was a strange lack of apologies, even acknowledgement from the accusers. So much for Malaysian neighbourliness huh?<br><br>I'll end with a funny ancedote, posted by me before. during one of the bouts of accusations, it was widely reported in the M'sian press that villagers saw aircraft flying in Malaysian airspace, and knew they were from Singapore "because the RMAF didn't operate the type of aircraft they saw".<br><br>Now in case you're too thick to see how thats funny, I'd happily point it out for you. I didn't know your average M'sian villager is such an expert plane spotter, to be able to discern with such accuracy different aircraft types, even nationality, and while I'm at it, does that mean that a military plane, as long as its not Malaysian, means its Singaporean? Whos stupid here? The villagers, or the press who believe them?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>You don't need to shoot down one plane for proof. The best way is to actually install a radar to cover southern Malaysia, so that all "instrusions" can be logged, instead of relying on uneducated villagers to be the RMAF's eyes and ears in the south *snigger*</div>
