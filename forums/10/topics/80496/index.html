            <div class='col-md body'>We need to reflect on the meaning of marriage.<br><br>The purpose of a civil marriage is to facilitate two adults coming together to form a household. It involves the recognition of a relationship in the eyes of the law and allows the sharing of property and the disbursement of such property when death or divorce occurs. Traditionally, marriage is understood as occurring between a male and female.<br><br>There is really no rational reason why same sex marriages should be ruled out, apart from homophobia that has its roots in religious thinking. Since a civil ceremony is, or should be, devoid of religious considerations, same sex marriages should therefore be allowed in Singapore.<br><br>Before this can happen however, prejudice against homosexual relationships need to be eradicated.</div>

I have friends whom are homosexual and i feel that they are equally normal jsut that they lead a different lifestyle.<br>Some are born homosexual while some are nuture to be one because they are hurt in a hetersexual relationship and thus become inclined towards the same sex. although environment does affect males and females to some degree, the marked difference between them are caused by their inherited biology.<br><br>The fact that we are Asians and thus many has deemed homosexual as against nature. but sometime homosexual individuals aint has a choice for example a child rape.<br><br>Although many western states has allowed homosexual marraige, some of them still shun away. Here in Singapore due to our culture, homosexual is perversion by many hetersexual.However as the society become more modernized, and individuals becoming more educated and chaning mindset, more homosexual are moer willing to admit and display their relationship.<br><br>I personally think that I wont object to it as long as homosexual does not cause social problems to the public.</div>
