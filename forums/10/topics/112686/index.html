            <div class='col-md body'>You see, intelligent and dangerous people are usually unpredictable because they do not want to leave trails.  In most situations, people try hard to study others and hope to find a cue to predict what they will do next. This allows them to have control of the subject and situations and to formulate a possible response. If a person is 'reckless', we tend to dismiss him or her as 'irrelevant' and will stay away from them but most importantly convince others to do the same. We do this because we live in a world filled with fear and whether that person is a perceived or real danger to others is not important.<br><br>As for the plebians, we are just too self-serving kiasu &amp; kiasee and have become controllableand exploitable. Just drop a few hundred dollars of incentives (afterall, just return you some of your own sweat money), plant some nice landscaping to the pigeon holes and all will become 'yes man'.<br><br>However, the growing concern is that the rich poor gap is widening and this is a global phenomena. As the disgrunted and educated numbers (intelligentia) rise, more weaknesses and dissension of the current system will mount and these little incentives will not pacify for long as we are further encouraged to be practical. In addition, the simple explanation that  meritocracy is present and sustaining our development will not work as new forces come into play. It will be even more difficult to measure the concept or degree in itself, much so convince others. So, the rich will always be powerful, and the poor will reamin that way, at least for some time. The rest will just be going nowhere, unless you have the connections. But this problem is not unique in 1 or some countries and for centuries it has been that way. Life is unfair, perhaps. However, there is this thing called evolution. older generations will always tell you that about every 1/2 century or so, there will usually be some wars, destructions, revolutions and plagues. Rightly or wrongly, conscious or unconcious, these are felt by some as renewal cycles or God's wrath to restore balance to the current state of affairs.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body">Chee is reckless, he does things with passion that is sometimes, sadly unregulated.But at least he's standing on the wall.We need more people to stand on the wall.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just yesterday, I had a heated debate with one of my friends on the opposition.<br><br>He argued that there was no need for an opposition because the PAP administration has taken great care of the country, and we should not rock the boat by introducing elements which will conflict with the PAP. He proposed that it would reduce the level of debate in the Parliament into a debacle of "chair throwing".<br><br>I disagree. The opposition, being a non-governing force in the Parliament, plays a crucial role in arresting any wayward influence on the executive branch. They scrutinise the administration's policies, and question them on any discreprency, thereby clarifying the implementation in question, or enables the abolishment of poor policies - that is, if people do listen to the opposition. There is absolutely no need for an opposition laden Parliament to descend into the chaos found in the Taiwanese Yuan.<br><br>As of now, the opposition remains an ostracised force, portrayed poorly and badly suppressed. They are supposedly anti-establishment and are willing to break a system just to get into Paliament. Hogwash. The plants of opposition have been crushed for a few decades now. A severly culled local media, a legacy of lawsuits on well-known opposition leaders (not to mention crackdowns in the 1950s) have all but killed the opposition. Given the toxic environment, there is no way that a prim and proper opposition force can grow to serve as the desired checking force to the PAP's power, just like how life cannot start under a deadly environment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The impression the people have of the other parties here is that of scorn and poverty in ideas and funds.We have been conditioned into thinking that they oppose for nothing more than opposing, hence the title given to them "Opposition" which reduces whatever talents or ideas they have within their individual party ranks into something of a scorned entity, disharmonious and a thorn in the peace of Singapore.<br><br>Social conditioning is the main paralysing force in the lack of politcal debate, as the populace is now either cowed by the lawsuits suffered by politicians of other parties, or they have become meek and apathetic due to a all-powerful force that controls them, materialsim and economic survival.The state once commented that apathy amongst the youth is rising, and they hope that youths and the citizenry will be more proactive.However, they want to delineate the boundaries of being proactive and engaging people.And that is one of the most sickening and shameful things of our nation.The ability to be pragmatic to the extent that we have turned into serpents.</div>

Its so Absurd its not even funny anymore. Singapore is illustrative of the problems with the First past the post electoral system.<br><br>The Constitution becomes a joke where the government has close to 100% of the seats in parliament.
