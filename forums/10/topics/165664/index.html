            <div class='col-md body'>AN INVITATION TO FORUMERS WITH PASSION AND SOME ABILITIES TO JOIN THE NON-ALIGHED NEW POLITICAL MOVEMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVES AS STATED IN THE 3RD POST:-<br><br>Dear Forumers,<br><br>Do you believe you have the potential of becoming a good leader to serve the people with honour and integrity? How effective is intuitive or judgmental leadeship, or individual's insight or foresight. Are concepts and assumptions good enough or only good-looking presentation. These questions are answered below:-<br><br>Presumably leaders possess some uniques abilities or attributes to set direction and unite people with collective actions or sacrifices to strive for maximum progress for everyone.<br><br>This is a message to those who believe they have some abilities to serve the people and be effective leaders.<br><br>If you do possess the passion, and some abilities to motivate people in applying knowledge application and work with teamwork, diligence or sacrifice for the country, you may contact me for discussions how to join and form the movement to serve people better including standing for election as independents for the good of the country.<br><br>Despite all the practical difficulties and problems, leaders are expected to set good example of themselves acting honorably and carrying out their words, promises and policies. Here are some criteria for your consideration before you contact me. It does not matter the criteria might be too high it is more important that you have the passion and some of the abilities as over time many qualities can be developed with process management which is trainable and attainable as will be explained.<br><br>Leaders should have the ability to translate words and intentions into mananageable or practicable work processes to enable subject or workers to reach for results with hands-on efficiency, competitiveness, or excellence.<br><br>(1) Translate goals and objectives into implementation processes to empower all workers to maximize their knowledge applications, to create competitiveness, technology start-ups and jobs.<br><br>(2) Collective leadership and good corporate governance to avoid self-centred narrow top-down conceptual management that stifle mass participation in knowledge application, implementation of ideas and growth.<br><br>In whatever actions he takes to mobilize his people or followers, to achieve goals and objectives, he should act with reliability, or sense of justice, empathy with the poor or concern with social and economic wellbeing of all ?<br><br>He should be honourable, possess the highest integrity and not engage in artful arguments or fallacies or rhetorics resulting in breaking of promises and setbacks to their followers.<br><br>He should understand that people have needs and desires to succeed in their respective fields and would soon unleash their skills and apply their talents meaningfully if leadership is more proactive with implementation for common good.<br><br>He should practise broad-based practical education for his people which will lead to widespread application of technology and knowledge.<br><br>In the fast-paced technological age of internet, people need processes and facilitation to empower them to apply their inherent skills and knowledge to be creative, entrepreneurial and proactive, and seize opportunities at practical applications of knowledge by all in every field.<br><br>Leader must avoid too much controls and regulations, or taxing and recovering of costs to the full market values thereby causing hardship.<br><br>Today's leadership should possess the clear practical ability to motivate people to become true partners of business or enterprise so that the masses could be totally involved in decision making and working towards results together as a team.<br><br>In this way they can then leverage the many resources at work and mobilise the people to realize technologicial start-ups and value-add economic competitiveness which currently could only be talked about.<br><br>No matter how brilliant, the concept of a few talents at the top of organization is too narrow the leadership approach. In the new political movement as posted, it is the ultimate intention of the movement to provide a common platform to forge consensus among participants to serve the people better.<br><br>Today's leaders should be collective open and consultative possessing the total functional abililites and total scope and radar range to cover the whole spheres of social culture and economic exchanges and leveling up of competitiveness. The primary objective of the movement is to forge national consensus to avoid leading the country with self-interests and controls which are not consonent with the majoirity's vibrancy and growth.<br><br>Process management can be set for overall tasks to be performed collectively with coordination and application of knowledge at all level to attain results to attain the movement's objectives.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>UNDERSTANDING OF HOW AUTHORITARIANISM IS BEING CARRIED OUT IN A TOTAL PLAN<br><br>The New Political Movement will be non-aligned as it is not anti-government. It is only intended to moderate the ill-effects or fallacies of the current authoritarianism for progress. It is especially critical to observe and understand how authorianism is being practised such as the following:<br><br>(1) Agents assigned to depoliticise views in forumers<br><br>(2) Certain agent is to focused on certain views on opponents - some assigned to handle views of CSJ, and other threats,<br><br>(3) Certain views like "Controlled Press means faster decisions" systematically rolled out to brainwash population. (Iteration is the art of brainwash)<br><br>(4) Identify critics and debunk their views in forums systematically,<br><br>(5) Meritocracy - systematically to promote elites, make some minor adjustments but essentially this will control political views.<br><br>(6) Foreign talents - systematically executed for replacements of brain drains<br><br>(7) Doing little acts to help win voters - only at election time, it does not cost much.<br><br>(Cool Leadership - best topic is to brainwash population on past 40 years of achievements, bring back confucianism, emphasise family values<br><br>(9) Depolitisation, cooption and machination - continues, it does not matter some disagreements do happen, the objective is to win votes,<br><br>(10) Remaking of Singapore, economic retructuring, solving the high costs anti-business problems and 20 major policy problems or implementing a strategic master plan to upgrade to value-adding technologies - put on hold, as there is nobody around like Goh Keng Swee to strategize and execute with total commitments ...does not matter..stability is more important</div>
