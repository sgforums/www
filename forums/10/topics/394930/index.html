              <p>CPF Scheme under scrutiny</p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>SINGAPORE : Should the CPF Investment Scheme be stopped so that members will not risk losing their retirement nest egg?</p>
              <p>Yes, thinks a resident who claimed that he had lost some $350,000 in his CPF account after investing in shares under CPFIS.</p>
              <p>The Lengkong Tiga resident, who identified himself as Mr Goh, said during the ministerial dialogue on Sunday that he only got back $35,000 eventually but did not say if these were the gains from the investments or the amount he could withdraw from his Ordinary Account (OA) on top of the Minimum Sum.</p>
              <p>He also did not say how he lost the sum and whether the investments spanned a few years.</p>
              <p>MediaCorp understands that members can only invest up to 35 per cent of their money in their OA in shares.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh said he had suggested to the CPF Board to stop allowing members to invest in shares but staff had replied that it was his personal choice to make the investments.</p>
              <p>Second Minister for Finance Lim Hwee Hua said she agreed with the CPF Board’s stance, adding that there had been "a lot of demand" for the Government to allow members to invest their CPF money before the CPFIS was introduced.</p>
              <p>She quipped: "I’ll convey your feedback to the CPF Board but I’m not quite sure the rest will agree that we should stop the scheme."</p>
              <p>The latest performance numbers of funds under the CPFIS released earlier this month pointed to a solid year.</p>
              <p>According to Lipper, the funds tracking company under the CPF Board’s guidelines, the average return of CPFIS—included funds, unit trusts and investment—linked insurance products (ILPs) rose 38.62 per cent last year compared with the same period a year ago. — TODAY</p>

              <p>Can one utillise $350,000 from one's CPF account - when there is a clear line drawn that require sufficient sums for the minimum sums for retirement, medisave, medishield, and all the other schemes to peel away our CPF monies ?</p>
              <p>Obviously, this fictitious Mr Goh must have more then $1,000,000 in his CPF that allow him to have used $350,000 from his CPF.</p>
              <p>Can one be bitching about one's losses of $350,000 from the CPF - when this Mr Goh will probably be having larger amounts in cash savings, or other fixed deposits, or even in other asset forms ?</p>
              <p>This is clearly a PAP ploy to justify their own intention to limit the present access that we can have to our CPF - as they have been doing in various step-by-step stages over the last 10 years.</p>
              <p>It is the usual PAP way - of dropping the first hint of what is to come, then comes to debate, and finally the implementation despite whatever comes up from the very public debates.</p>
              <p>The decision is already made, all the ensuing acts are just what it is - ACTS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More funds in the CPF will mean more funds available to GIC and Temasek that will allow them to generate cash - to fill up the big hole that they have created with the publicly declared losses of US$100 Billion during 2008 to 2009.</p>
