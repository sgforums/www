To many, thats their only source of income, since the govt<br>refuse to help them.<br><br>But with our govt being so money minded, decided to go into the lucurative recycling business, they set up campaigns to the young children and ordinary sinkaporeans, by placing colour recycling bins and having a smiley green frog as an icon. sinkaporeans, on the context of thinking recycling is good, would just throw their unwanted stuff into the bins<br><br>Please stop giving or throwing away your unwanted thrash, give it to the can collecting uncle, although they just earn 1cent per can, its better than throw to those bloody NEA recycling bins that sell these recycled material for a higher price.<br><br>I would rather give my newpaper or used cans to a beggar or karang guni, at least he could sell it for 1cent rather than give the govt that would continue to expliot us in the pretext of "recycling".<br><br>With our greedy govt even setting up newstands like BUZZ to compete with traditional newspaper stands and setting NTUC fairprice to compete with HDB grocery stores, it will not be long if our govt starts restricting beggar collectors and soon issueing license, fines and jailterms to monopolize the recycling trade.<br><br>My plea is, please recycle ur old stuff to a beggar/collecter rather than throw it into those coloured recycling bins for free. At least u are helping them.<br><br>In short,<br><br>1. u give to a beggar/collector = so he/she would in turn sell to a recycling center. at least theres some source of income for beggars/collectors.<br><br>2. u drop into a recycling bin = the govt got it for free, recycle and resell for profit. beggars/collectors get nothing.<br><br>3. u throw to rubbish bin = wastage.<br><br>I think NEA is soon gonna outlaw these recycling practices soon, and make them the one and only player.

It is only right that people join hands with the government in dealing with national issues. Call it a vote of confidence, whatever.....<br><br>Yes, there are poor people in Singapore. Families surviving on just one meal a day. These poverty striken citizens are hidden away in some housing estates. They are not allowed to beg so we hardly see them.<br><br>Check out all the old folks' homes, RCs and ask residents in Bukit Ho Swee and Marsiling which blocks of flats are the poor housed in.<br><br>In almost all countries, industrialized or not, the poor are obvious in the streets. Here in Singapore, they are 'hidden' away.... so sad...</div>

You are not the first few to state the worth of the messages you had painted above. and I bet there are eyes looking at them too.
