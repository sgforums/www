Worst of all, they are unaware of such assistance programs. I guess the outcome of this topic is for us to, brainstorm, generate and devise feasible plans to help these folks; then I will submit these solutions to MCYS.<br><br>To start the ball rolling, I will suggest a few solutions:<br><br>1)Deploying dialect speaking social workers to bus interchanges to approach these elder folks to inform them of such public assistance plans<br><br>Already in practice, social service department most staff can speak more than one dialect, also Malay speaking, Tamil speaking, even come across a PA beneficiary Shanghai speaking.<br><br>2)Regularly deploy  Recycling firm contractors to buy up the cans collected by these elder folks by paying them at a higher premium<br><br>do not know what kind of arrangement Sembcorp waste with all or most of the town council.?<br><br>3)Tie-up with Local CDC, where the old folks could redeem say every 1kg of used drink cans for some Meal vouchers<br><br>most of the old Senior needy has provision shop @ their one room HDB flat. they weekly receive dry ration from various VWO's.<br><br>4)Rope in educational institutions, where say a cluster of 3-4 elder folks are granted exclusive access to the used drink cans in each school, considering the fact that daily consumption of canned drinks in school canteens are high daily.<br><br>school can drink not many la.<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: red;"></span><strong></strong><span style="color: red;"></span></div>
