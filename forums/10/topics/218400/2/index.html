But it seems to me that if one wants to make a dent in the majority of Singaporeans who are politically numb and who vote for the "safest" choice and regard ideas like "freedom" as jibber jabber and non-bread and butter... going about it by trumping such ideas in extreme ways might not work as well at all... for the Singaporean (at least 66.6 of those who voted), have already indicated that they find most idealistic freedoms just that... ideas.<br><br>Of course somehow the whole notion that in order to make a proper choice you have to be in the position to be free to fairly make that choice in the first place seems to passed over the heads of many, but in part I suspect that is to a healthy culture of doublethink that has been encouraged. And of course, the large sucess in convincing people that freedom is not a "bread and butter" issue.<br><br>To work on that one needs to start by convincing them why freedom is worth giving up some measure of security and order for to begin with, not by stating the obvious that these that things we are having less then we ought to be responsible for... for it was something most know <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> accept to some degree.
