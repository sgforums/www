            <div class='col-md body'>actually, i used to think he is a joker, trying to be funny with the govt. But, come to think of it, is he really that stupid to do that?<br>He was a lecturer, earning comfortably, easily earning 5 digits, driving his own car, why would he want to do such stupid thing, becoming an opposition, resulting him to be a bankrupt now?<br><br>what u see on the media, newspapers often wrote and read negative things about him, simply becos, the media is controlled by the govt. And the govt used the media to blacken most oppositions, except some mild oppositions like Chaim See Tong.<br><br>if you are free, do that a look at this 26mins video, there is a video interview on him and his views which i think may make u change his opinion on him:-<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_DRoUOcupo" rel="nofollow">www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_DRoUOcupo</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>some may feel that CSJ has had unique ideas...but most of his concerns are about freedom, namely, freedom of speech, press, political freedom, etc etc. all he talks about (mostly, anyway) is how we are being repressed, oppressed, bla bla.<br><br>what about the more important issues such as how to deal with the ageing population? increased competition from neighbouring states? rising income gap?<br><br>a good opposition should have concerns over the overall well-being of the citizen. yes, we need a lot more freedom. but what's the use of freedom when it can't help the poor? i wonder what else he can do other than shouting on the streets for more freedom.<br><br>and once again, the methods he use to gain attention is really unbecoming of a person with a 'Dr' in front of his name. simply put, he's rude. I just took a look at the website of his party and goes...oh my, I can't believe these people are <span style="font-style: italic;">our</span> opposition...<br><br>and lastly...I'm certainly not a MIW. I'm just slightly for another opposition party. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
