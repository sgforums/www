            <div class='col-md body'>Last time when road tax, COE and import taxes were high, it was meant to discourage people to buy car... then they say our road can afford to take in more car and they reduce a little bit of taxess ( though still high ) ..  so more people buy car ..  how can they say they collected less when more are buying ...  then say congestion so raise ERP ...  this is to prevent more cars on certain stcrecth of the road ...   so the car owner don't want to pay the charges go to other road ...  then there congested. start ERP there ... and the cycle go on ...  so I am confused ... if want to control traffic, shouldn't they had not allow so many cars on the road ... if allow so many car, they shouldn't tell people to give up and take public transport right ...   ?  so this is why we pay them millions to make our live difficult ???

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans have been given a very bad deal. For so many years now ministers have been making empty promises that if people pay higher excise duty it will reduce road congestion.<br><br>So for many years ministers have been piling on all kinds of taxes direct, indirect justified and unjustified in the name of solving the road congestion problems.<br><br>So the middle class is a dying breed now. In name people who earn $3,000.00 pm are middle class but in fact after being milked dry by such double and triple quizzical taxes not intended or aimed at solving real problems they have mostly become paupers.<br><br>By paying more monies i.e. increasing vehicle excise duty, imposing COE and now ERP, the road congestions today are still left unsolved. No wonder the residents in the Sin Min estate who met the minister Raymond Lim in talk shop were so upset with road congestions saying that they do not mind to pay for ERP but for goodness sake after paying more and more ERP at least they expect the problems will be solved or relieved.<br><br>Now it looks like the minister could just issue a press statement and say that there is no solution but only some holistic solutions the original promises to solve the problems with COE and ERP could just be pushed away. It is equal to denial of the current big congestions found on our roads despite all the taxes and payments.<br><br>So as all can see for themselves, the worse problem as always is not problems. It is the mentality of our entrenched ministers who seem to be able only to come up with nice excuses and get away from earnest promises made in parliament without solving problems by explaining them away.<br><br>There is a common saying - if someone wants to deny a problem any reason is good enough.<br><br>How nice is it to collect millions and yet the problems remain unsolved. Civil servants in LTA and Transport ministry have just announced that they are going to get higher bonuses and 17% pay rise on 1.1.2008 for solving road congestion problems by way of explaining the problems away.<br><br>It can only happen in the little red dot.</div>
