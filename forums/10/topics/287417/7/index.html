            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously sometimes what is the point of whining here and nothing can be done to the system...<br><br>i totally disagree on the idea of building more ERP gantries that will help to lessen the road congestion problem. Why would the ministry want to continue the system while we can see the number of cars on the road are rising in a astonishing rate and therefore we should be controlling the quantity of cars and not the ERP gantries numbers.<br><br>But Singapore is a very small island and building more roads will used up more land and this in turn will cause anoher problem,which is housing problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The number of cars on the road is determined by the number of COEs released. Whether Singaporeans got more money to own more cars a not does not matter if the number of COEs released is limited. LTA decides the amount through COEs by considering too the amount of road space that we have. Since 1997, there are much more available roads, so being able to increase the number of cars without increasing congestion is something feasible.<br><br>Furthermore, it was only a few years ago that LTA that had declared that the number of cars in Singapore has been decreasing, and thus they had decided to increase the number of COEs for bidding. Hence, the increase in the number of cars.<br><br>Reading in between the lines, it can be said that ERP is just one of the possible factors that help Singaporeans own more cars. Why? It reduces road usage and diverts traffic away from congestion-prone areas, making it probable for LTA to increase the number of cars without fear that it will lead to higher congestion.<br><br>Hence, on 2nd thoughts, "ERP helps more S'poreans to own cars" is rather true. The key word here is <span style="color: red;">own</span>, not use.</div>

We don't see any examples of good ministers resigning because of lack of pays. Neither do we see ministers who have resigned and joined the private sector as being able to make many good millions or successfully turning around companies to prove that the ministers were indeed such great talents as assumed.<br><br>So prove us the people wrong on this rebuttal alone. It is only a hype or hypothesis which up to now has not been proven.<br><br>After many years of so-called meritocracy, another pure hypothesis and assumption, all that this policy has achieved is to produce a nation of highly educated unemployed. Many highly educated people are turning to taxi-driving or consultancy without being worth the while to receive the college education.<br><br>This policy has actually been cleverly used as a political tool to control the people because by the hype of such a policy people could not object to their leaders getting their way with autocracy serving finally to ride on such a policy to get what it wants and to serve its own narrow-minded hypocrisy and self-serving agendas.<br><br>If meritocracy is to be effective it should have resulted in majority of ordinary citizens benefiting with higher standards of living and not struggling and yet unable to retire all their life.<br><br>The government should stop all the hypes and give up its one-sided monopoly of raising taxes and charging and instead begin to serve the citizens.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Higher ERP charges kick in but traffic still heavy on some roads</strong><br><br>Several changes were made to the Electronic Road Pricing system today.<br><br>Along the CTE, ERP charges went up and along the Bukit Timah expressway a new gantry is in place<br><br>However, the introduction of new gantries did not seem to ease this morning's massive traffic jam along the BKE.<br><br>It usually takes Madam Chuang an hour to drive from her home in Johore Bahru to her office in Singapore but today's congestion added a whole hour to her total travelling time.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"It took me almost 2 hours. That's because there was a heavy traffic jam along Woodlands Causeway, as well as BKE. Probably this is due to a lot of drivers like me who try to leave home a bit later so that we can avoid paying ERP".</span><br><br>Another driver, Madam Sutini was stuck in the same congestion.<br><br>The jam, she said, was terrible.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"Normally I travel from Jurong to Thompson and I leave home normally at 8.45, and I reach my office the latest by 9.15. Today I left at the same time, I reached at 9.45".</span><br><br>That is why some motorists feel that the ERP gantry at the BKE has not fulfilled its purpose - to ease traffic flow.<br><br>It has done nothing to clear the expressway of vehicles, says irate taxi driver, Mr Anba.<br><br>"Traffic - you can't clear. Especially that hour. All peak hours. People want to go to work, they rush. Once they have the ERP, only the price is going up, but the problem is not solved. The traffic jams are still there".<br><br>Motorists who purposely set out late to avoid paying ERP charges could be one of the causes of this jam but Mediacorp Radio's Traffic Watch says the massive bottleneck was more likely to be caused by three separate road accidents that occured within metres of one another.<br><br>One of the accidents took place on the BKE, near the satellite station at around 7.45 am.<br><br>A few minutes later, a vehicle pile-up occured on the PIE near the Stevens Road exit just down the road.<br><br>Traffic Watch says the congestion was cleared shortly after 9am.<br><br>While traffic was heavy along the BKE, the situation at Central Expressway was very different.<br><br>Unlike previous peak hours, driving on the CTE between 8.30 to 9 was a breeze this morning.<br><br>This could be due to the 50 cents increase in ERP charges.<br><br>Mr Chong, a taxi driver was very pleased with this development but he does not think this change will be permanent.<br><br>"I think they will come back. They still need the convenience travelling on the CTE".<br><br>A reminder to motorists travelling from the city towards Ang Mo Kio this evening:<br><br>A new gantry along the north-bound CTE just before the PIE exit will be operational today.<br><br>Evening ERP hours on the CTE are from 5.30pm to 10.30pm.<br><br>Also starting today are evening ERP charges on the east-bound ECP from 6pm to 8pm on weekdays.<br><br>but.......
