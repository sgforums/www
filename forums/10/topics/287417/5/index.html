            <div class='col-md body'>ERP is supposed to regulate the flow of traffic but ultimately many Singaporeans feel that it has failed its objectives. Many also complain about the cost of ERP. Is it time to realise why ERP is costing drivers money ? If drivers feel that it is expensive then don't drive into those areas or don't drive at all. Why drive in, say that it doesn't work and complain that its expensive ?</div>
