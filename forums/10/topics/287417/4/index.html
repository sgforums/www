            <div class='col-md body'>long long time ago.... when SGP 1st came out with COE is to control the acrs on the road.... minimising the 1 family many cars problem....<br><br>Now .... COE was reduced so that ppl can own cars which is inline with SGP advancement to the first world country...(at the expense for SGPreans)<br>they wana see 7 in  10 SGPreans own cars....<br><br>Alrite now ERP.... erp/restricted zone was implemented to control traffic conditions on E'ways and town area.... well i agree for town area ERp but i dun agree to the timing/days.... E'ways control traffic....for ERP will prevent ppl from using.... thats their claims.... So imagine every driver in SGP ban E'ways....??? and travel elsewhere.... they will set up elsewhere... u can run but u cannot hide.... in future it will be juz outside ur carpark...<br><br>They set ERP on eg. PIE ... drivers will avoid and PIE becomes ok smooth... drivers will try to use AYE,KJE,BKE to do detour.... then they realise "sales" running away then they will set in elsewhere.... bcoz they believe if the massess dun come to you, you muz go to the massess....<br><br>Anyway juz stop whining.......... U chose ur Government...... U made ur choice.... so live wif it.....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, let's see... According to Minister Lim's rationale, it's cheaper for us to own cars. Cheaper car prices and blah blah blah. But it's getting more expensive to maintain it. Higher and more ERP charges and etc. So what are we to do, buy a car and let it sit in the carpark? And every now and then, start to warm up the car and admire it? And when time's up pay road tax?<br>So perhaps the minister ought to tell us if he really said a boo-boo or he really meant what he said. If so, he ought to tell us who among us will buy a car only to have it sit in the carpark.<br><br>Or maybe he was playing mindgames with us?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now how is he going to come out of this corner?</div>

Since when hasn't ERP been declared as a resounding success? Has any minister ever said that ERP does not work? Has any statistic ever shown that speeds on expressways have remained the same?<br><br>Dr. Fatimah could have done better by asking incisive and precise questions with regards to various road conditions on the various expressways at various timings of the ERP operations.</div>
