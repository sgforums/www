              <p>I smell that election is coming soon.</p>
              <p>Reason is....</p>
              <p>1) Heard and confirm by me that Geylang was really very very quiet for the past few weeks.Quiet until i was shock when i went there for a look.Heard from some uncle at the kopi shop that the police and Anti-Vice are raiding almost every day!</p>
              <p>2)Also heard from the news that street lamps are installed along Geylang Lorong 14 and 16 as an measure to prevent illegal gambling or prostitution.It was one of the areas that many residents had complained about, said
              Dr Lee Boon Yang, Member of Parliament for Jalan Besar GRC, at the
              light-up ceremony on Wednesday night.(Smell any rats?)Ya.. i smell something already.Why did the PAP took so many years then to install the lamp now.To wayang that they are now doing something so that the people will be grateful to them and give them more vote?Another smell of election day coming soon...</p>
              <p>3) The capture of Mas Salamat will ease the unforgiven mistake for his escape.</p>
              <p>4)July is the 'Government Hong Bao' month again.People will be sweeten by the $$$ given by the PAP and so... if not now then when?</p>
              <p>5)Lastly, looks like economic will be getting worst for a few more years to come.If i am the PAP, i will go for a election now then to wait for a few more years because the unknown factor is there and what if Singapore economic not picking up and going downhill, and worst people will start to blame PAP and will i loose more vote?</p>
              <p>These will be the factors that election is coming soon and i guess it will most likely be between July and Sept.What you guys think?</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I heard that they conducted the raids so regularly because in the earlier raids, 5 or 6 of the PRC women they caught were HIV positive.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If true, it is more of a "health related" exercise than an election coming exercise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I have a friend that stays in Geylang and yes, it is very quiet nowadays but quiet is relative.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I heard that they conducted the raids so regularly because in the earlier raids, 5 or 6 of the PRC women they caught were HIV positive.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If true, it is more of a "health related" exercise than an election coming exercise.</span></p>

              <p>In other countries, during economic crisis, they change the government.</p>

              <p>In
              autocratic states, where political movements are suppressed, the ruling
              regime will still rule despise economic hardship of the people.</p>

              <p><br>PAP sure wins one lah, they just want to know how the ground react and what is the percentage of voters during crisis, and since during these downtime, people got nothing much to do, might as well hv an election party to go along just to perk up the spirit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if there is any increase of voters about 66%, PAP may prolong the crisis, it also shows and reaffirm that they are the Kings of Singapore.</p>
