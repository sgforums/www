            <div class='col-md body'>Observations of numerous officers have brought several key points to my attention:<br><br>1. An officer demands 100% fitness of himself b4 he demands that of his men.<br><br>2. A good officer is decisive and not impulsive.<br><br>3. In the field, he navigates with confidence and fights a "battle" by committing to practice the basics instead of the spectacular.(which often fails miserably)<br><br>4. Men respect him becoz he makes little mistakes, understands the men and is wholely reliable.<br><br>5. Most IMPORTANTLY: a steady officer toks less and thinks more, prefering to let his actions speak for themselves.<br><br>enuff said<br>5.</div>

However, if he wants to pass on his instructions and yet does not have a good rapport with his men, things still cannot be done. Good judgement is only one aspect of an officer's capability. Good HR skills is another. No officer can run away from any of tehm.
