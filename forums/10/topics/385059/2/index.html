              <div id="post_message_3231743"><strong>
              <div><strong>By Hedy Khoo<br></strong></div>
              <div><strong>Mon, Dec 14, 2009<br>The New Paper </strong><strong></strong></div>
              </strong></div>
              <div><strong><strong>
              <div>A TISSUE sample report showed the cysts in his lung were not cancerous. But it wasn't relief or elation that this patient felt.<br><br>What should have been good news left Mr Muhammad Jafri, 53, confused instead.<br><br>This was because a small part of his left lung had already been surgically removed before the detailed results of the test was available.<br><br>He is now wondering if the surgery was for nothing. Was it a mistake?<br><br>He had been referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon at the National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) after a CT scan on his pancreas in May 2007.<br><br>This had revealed cysts in his lungs.<br><br>He agreed to have a tissue sample removed for investigation (biopsy). He now claims he had not given his consent for any other procedures or for the surgeon to remove any part of his lung.<br><br>A spokesman for NHCS, however, said: "The cardiothoracic surgeon had in fact met the patient prior to the procedure and explained the nature of the biopsy, and specifically informed the patient that if there is a positive finding of lung cancer, there would be a need to remove part of the lung."<br><br>Mr Jafri claimed he understood that nothing else would be done until "the full histology (study of the structure of tissue) results... were obtained, which usually takes two weeks."<br><br>He is now claiming he did not give consent to the removal of part of his lung.<br><br>The biopsy was done under general anaesthesia on 18 Jun 2007 at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).<br><br>The next day, Mr Jafri said the surgeon informed him that during the surgery, the cysts were found to be cancerous. The surgeon had then removed the affected upper left lung.<br><br><strong>Shocked but grateful</strong><br><br>"I was shocked to hear I had cancer, but felt grateful to the doctor for saving my life," he said.<br><br>However, a few days later, the final report from the biopsy showed that the cysts were not malignant.<br><br>He learnt that during the surgery for the biopsy, a tissue sample was also sent for a procedure called frozen section.<br><br>This can give a provisional diagnosis during the surgery itself to determine if cancer is present. Based on this provisional diagnosis, surgeons will decide on the next course of action.<br><br>Mr Jafri's tissue sample sent for frozen section had been reported to be cancerous.<br><br>Based on this, his surgeon had decided to remove the affected part of his lung.<br><br>The NHCS spokesman explained that there are valid and important reasons a surgeon may need to perform surgery in the same anaesthetic setting based on frozen section results rather than wait for the formal histology report from the biopsy.<br><br>"Very often and especially in cancer cases, deferring surgery to be done on a subsequent occasion can jeopardise sterility, and subsequent surgery may also become more technically difficult at the site of where previous surgery was performed," said the spokesman.<br><br>"There are conditions where the cells are highly reactive and can closely mimic cancer cells and the true nature of the diagnosis may only be clarified with the availability of formal histology results.<br><br>"Hence, this case is not a case of an actual error in diagnosis, but rather it demonstrates that there are inherent limitations with certain investigations."<br><br>The spokesman added that when the surgeon believes a cancerous tumour has been found, it may become important to conduct immediate surgical excision to minimise the risk of cancer cells from the biopsy site spreading to other areas.<br><br>The NHCS spokesman said that Mr Jafri retains about 75 per cent of normal lung function after the operation.<br><br>"This should not affect most normal daily activities to any significant extent."<br><br><strong>Followed rules</strong><br><br>In a joint reply, NHCS and SGH explained that the biopsy and frozen section had been done in accordance with well-established practice.<br><br>A spokesman for NHCS and SGH said the published accuracy rates for intra-operative frozen sections range between 85 per cent and 98 per cent.<br><br>"Despite the inherent risk of false positive or false negative diagnosis associated with frozen section, they are nevertheless an important diagnostic tool in that they provide the surgeon with an 'on table' diagnosis in cases where a decision on surgical intervention may have to be made within the same surgical setting," she added.<br><br>"When the formal histology report eventually established that there was no malignancy in the lung lesion, the finding was readily made known to the patient on the very day itself."<br><br>The spokesman said Mr Jafri should not require medication all his life but he does have many pre-existing medical conditions unrelated to the removal of a part of his lung.<br><br>The recovery period varies but would range from one to three months.<br><br>She added that he will have to continue regular check-ups to monitor the growth of the pancreatic tumour as well as his other medical complaints.<br><br>Mr Jafri is now claiming that even if he had cancer, he would have sought alternatives to surgery.<br><br>He said he spent almost a month recuperating in the hospital and gets breathless easily now. He had previously undergone five operations on his spinal cord.<br><br>Mr Jafri said he had only enough money to hire a lawyer to write to the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) to complain about the matter.<br><br>The SMC declined to comment on the case. But according to its written reply, dated 5 Nov, to Mr Jafri's lawyer, the Complaints Committee decided that no formal inquiry was necessary.<br><br>It said there was no evidence of professional misconduct by the doctor in charge of reporting the pathological specimens, but noted that the doctor could have taken greater care to report the degree of certainty in his diagnosis.<br><br>What was done is the accepted treatment for early stage lung cancer, and the surgeon had acted upon the diagnosis provided by the pathologist, it added.<br><br>It also noted that the surgeon could have taken greater care in the way he explained and took consent for the procedure.<br><br>Both doctors were issued letters of advice from the committee reminding them to be more prudent in future.<br><br>Mr Jafri is not satisfied with the response and has lodged an appeal with the Ministry of Health. He is waiting for a reply.<br><br>Mr Jafri said: "I lost my job as a lab technician in April this year. After the operation, I am always having to take medical leave."<br><br><strong>Doc: It is the standard form of treatment</strong><br><br>WHEN lung cancer is suspected, a biopsy and a frozen section in view of a lobectomy (removal of a part of the lung) is a standard form of treatment, said a cardiothoracic surgeon in private practice with 20 years of experience.<br><br>Should the frozen section indicate that cancer is present, the surgeon will usually do the lobectomy.<br><br>The surgeon, who declined to be named, said the procedures and course of action to be taken during the operation are usually explained to the patient to seek his prior consent as he will be under general anaesthesia during the surgery.<br><br>"Most patients will agree to have a frozen section with the view of proceeding to a lobectomy," said the cardiothoracic surgeon.<br><br>He said there are patients who choose not to have any lobectomy performed based on the frozen section diagnosis, but this is rare. They prefer to wait for the full histology report.<br><br>Lawyer Adrian Wee, from Characterist LLC, said it is necessary to ask if a pathologist and surgeon had acted in accordance with the standard line of treatment.<br><br>If so, negligence is unlikely.<br><br><br></div>

              <p><strong>FT arrogance</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Saw this arrogant remark from a FT in Singapore in reply to the forum article in ST<br><br><br></strong><span style="color: red;">Colin Tan should stop whining like all the other Singaporeans. Grow up. There are competition everywhere in this globalised world. If a Singaporean student cannot compete in Singapore's tertiary system, he/she is not likely to compete in the ivy league universities elsewhere, unless you send him to a 3rd or 4th grade institution overseas. Please stop complaining about foreign talents. If it is not for us, Singapore would have remained in the backwaters<br><br>Eunice Sumita Sekaran</span><br><br><strong>Letter in ST forum</strong></p>
              <p> REFER to yesterday's reports, 'PM signals a slower intake of immigrants' and 'A tip to students: Be driven about causes'.<br><br>I am a student at the National University of Singapore. I agree with what Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that bringing in foreigners will help 'raise our standards and create a stimulating environment'.<br>Related link:<br>» How concerns of English- and Chinese-educated differ<br><br>I enjoy working with people from various cultures, having been exposed to them since Secondary 3, which is when the Ministry of Education brings in scholars from China and Asean.<br><br>However, at university level, there are sometimes too many foreign students competing for Singaporeans' space to grow.<br><br>For instance, in a mathematics lecture I attended, almost three-quarters of the class comprised foreigners. During in- lecture quizzes, it was obvious that the foreigners were better than the Singaporeans, and so 'stimulated' the learning environment.<br><br>However, it has come to a point where the competition has become stifling and stressful. This is because, in most cases, the foreign students have already learnt lower-level maths and science in their home country. Hence, Singaporeans are at a disadvantage in studying the same subject together with them.<br><br>Besides, universities here should give higher priority in offering places to Singaporean students from polytechnics and junior colleges. It is like giving your own children priority in education instead of those of a stranger.<br><br>Why should we give priority to foreign students at the expense of Singaporeans? I feel sorry for Singaporeans who have no university place because of this.<br><br>Singaporeans should be given more opportunities to learn and grow. Otherwise, many of those who cannot secure a place in a university here will go elsewhere.<br><br>Colin Tan</p>

              Well I definitely won't vote for the PAP! If I get this rare opportunity to vote, my vote definitely goes to the Opposition.
              
              And why's that? Am I not afraid that the PAP will not upgrade my lifts etc? Am I so 'air-headed' that I can only think of high ideals?
              
              Not so. Fear not. I am a pragmatic person. 
              
              So let's try to see things from a pragmatic perspective. Assuming the PAP have not lost too much money in lousy investments, and that the lack of transparency has not embolden the town councils to the point that they will recklessly pour millions into defective bank products, and that they actually have enough money left to placate the citizens by upgrading lifts in all neighbourhoods, there's still an angle many are not seeing.
              
              Even if everything the PAP supporters hope for come to pass and they get the lifts which stop at every floor, how on earth are they going to enjoy that when FOREIGNERS ARE FLOODING OUR ISLAND TAKING AWAY OUR JOBS! 
              
              Perhaps these PAP supporters think that when they are jobless and forced to stay at home, they shall have great fun playing with their new lifts (which stop at every floor)?
              
              So I will think about my bread and butter issues first. Vote against the PAP and hope that the loss of votes will force them to reconsider their liberal PR/New Citizens policies.

              <p>During the recent Budget Debate,Mr Wee Siew Kim(MP For Ang Mo Kio GRC),comments on the need for government officers to be more forgiving and to go out of their way to be more understanding and sympathetic in the current tough times.<br><br>“It is time to bring more heart to policies and manuals.Our Civil Servants are known to be smart,tackling issues in a logical fashion..But it is often said that in any campaign,you need to win the hearts and minds of individuals if you want to succeed.”<br><br><br>AMK GRC Singaporeans are so lucky!A PAP MP that says the right things close to Elections!All of you should feel loved! <img class="inlineimg" title="Big Grin" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com/img/forums/styles/hwz/smilies/biggrin.gif;pve55dbb92b154d7ad" border="0" alt=""><br><br>Such a refreshing change from just 3 years ago!Remember the following incident?<br><br>“I should think not. Dear derek is <strong>one of many wretched, undermotivated, overassuming leeches in our country, and in this world, one of those who would prefer to be unemployed and wax lyrical about how his myriad talents are being abandoned for the foreigner’s, instead of earning a decent, stable living as a sales assistant.</strong><br>It’s not even about being a road sweeper. These ****bags don’t want anything without “manager” and a name card. <br><strong>Please, get out of my elite uncaring face.”</strong><br>- Wee Shu Min, daughter of ELITE PAP MP Wee Siew Kim on her blog, 19 October 2006<br><br>And what did her father, PAP MP Wee Siew Kim say?<br><br>“The language was stronger than what most people could take. But she wrote in a private blog and I feel that her privacy has been violated. After all, they were the rantings of an 18-year-old among friends.<br>I think if you cut through the insensitivity of the language, <strong>her basic point is reasonable</strong>, that is, that a well-educated university graduate who works for a multinational company should not be bemoaning about the Government and get on with the challenges in life.<br>I will not gag her, since she’s 18 and should be able to stand by what she says. The new media of the Internet is such that if you don’t like what she has said, you have the right of rebuttal.<br>- Ang Mo Kio GRC ELITE MP Wee Siew Kim, The Straits Times, 24 October 2006<br><br>Such lovely by-products of our “Meritocracy” System!<br><br>“Meritocracy” --- <a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=2153027"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #333366;">http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=2153027</span></span></a><br><br>What do you do? <img class="inlineimg" title="Smilie" src="http://www.hardwarezone.com/img/forums/styles/hwz/smilies/smile.gif;pvbacf3e80f36d109b" border="0" alt=""></p>

              <p>ps.  Here are my reasons for not voting PAP :</p>
              <p>An elected Government should serve the people.. not the othe way round.</p>
              <p>No problem with the Old PAP..</p>
              <p>Goh Keng Swee, Toh Chin Chye, Hon Sui Sen, Ong Pang Boon, S Rajaratnam, E W Barker, Othman Wok et al.. </p>
              <p>were all Honourable Men who served the people / nation selflessly and are still respected and revered by many Singaporeans today.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew could have been a great one... but unfortunately he overstayed his time... and destroyed his own legacy and that of his Party.</p>
              <p>The New PAP are nameless souls who serve nobody but themselves and their one-and-only Master... LKY.</p>
              <p>To change the PAP Government is not going to be an easy task..</p>
              <p>but Change We Must for the sake of Singapore... and our future.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The title says it all.<br><br>Ypapies and peons need to understand that voting in more opposition is for their own good and everyones else.<br><br>With a sizeable bulk of opposition seats in parliment means debates on policies will not only be robust, but most important issues and unfreindly policies are checked and challenged and not passed off silently.<br><br>Issues like CPF mimimum sum, HDB upgrading, HDB Flat prices, Town Council sinking funds, Reserves, GIC, Temasek Holdings... etc.<br><br>Surely, those who think that there is no need for opposition presence need to look into the mirror and ask themselves this question. How is a governing body to keep it's muscles without some painful workout. Examples of MPs snoozing off in parlimentary is a sure sign that the muscles that hold this country together have slacked.<br><br>When there's a discussion on CPF issues, you'll get to see half attendance in parliment. Excuses, are busy with work and being only part-time MPs. <br><br>But when there's a debate on Ministerial Salary and how much their wages to be raised, you get a complete full house attendance.<br><br>There's nothing to proud of here.<br><br>You can continue to harp on GDP all you want. Here's the ugly deal with continuous singing of this stupid GDP notion.<br><br>GDP is gross domestic product (<strong>GDP</strong>) or gross domestic income (GDI) is a basic measure of a country's overall economic performance. What it fails to highlight is, income distribution and how much wealth from GDP flows into the pockets of the common man in the streets.<br><br>The main bulk of the goodies that come with GDP goes into pockets of MNCs in Singapore. Thanks to the foreign policy, big corporations from other countries set up their strong hold in Singapore and take up the profits from the GDP. I hope this makes it easier to understand, in laymans terms.<br><br>See ..education helps but also a good heart will heal. And also putting your faith in GDP rather than the wellbeing of your Singaporeans means your moral compass needs tuning.<br><br>YPAP pawns and peons, with their IVY league degrees and MBAs have all the tools in the world to make real progress and change in our country. But you seldom see them use their tools (esp. economic tools) to uplift communities or concentrate on the lower income groups. Citing REACH and SPRING ...is just not enough.<br><br><strong>So get this. Voting in more opposition is not about bringing down a country ...it's about increasing the moral fibre of the ruling party.</strong> <br></p></div>

              <p>Voting just to personally  'spite'  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">potential</span> adminstrators of the country?</p>
              <p> Then what? Let the country go into limbo and citizens bewildered on a 'mystical' change? Change to what?</p>
              <p> Isnt it better to critically analyze what EACH political party, ruling or opposition, can offer, their track record of credibilities, capabilities and not just hot air, to serve our society?</p>
              <p>Seems like democracy and the purpose of voting here in Singapore is doomed if everyone thinks like the TS. When...When will such people ever grow up?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>
