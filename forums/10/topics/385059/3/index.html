              <p><strong>Singaporeans First - Is that so?</strong></p>
              <p>PM Lee says "Singapore" will make greater efforts at fostering integration<br><br>Wednesday, September 16<br><br>SINGAPORE: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke at length on Tuesday evening, to some 1,500 <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">students</span></strong> at the Nanyang Technological University on Singapore’s immigration policy and also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gave the assurance that the interest of citizens will always come first.</span><br><br>Mr Lee explained that it was important for the issue to be discussed with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">students</span> because it concerned their future and eventually would be taken forward by their generation.<br><br><em><strong><br>this govt takes its elderly for granted. It's the working adults who are facing this immigration and taking it and tolerating foreigners. How easy it is to sell to a younger audience.....</strong><br></em><br><br>He said that the country will make greater efforts at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fostering integration of new arrivals</span> and that the National Integration Council will announce its initiatives soon.<br><br>"This is not a one problem you can solve one off, just answer an exam paper and settled. But it is a continuing issue with no final solution, where you have to manage it, decide, adjust your policy from time to time and as circumstances changed, adapt it in order to keep on going forward. And it’s a problem where what we do doesn’t just depend on the government or the government’s decisions but on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how open our society is</span> and how well <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singaporeans</strong></span> adjust to and integrate new arrivals. And that depends on you, as your enter the workforce, work, settle your families and become the next generation of Singaporeans, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what kind of Singapore you want</span>," said Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br><strong><em><br>Firstly, did you as PM ask Singaporeans (not students) what they wanted?<br><br>Secondly, since you equated "openess" to our society, is it not fair to say that the govt need to have initiatives to foster integration precisely because Singaporeans are not opening our arms to foreigners at a pace that suits the govt in the first place. What does it say that our opinions are not sought but instead is constantly being shaped by "initiatives" that suit the govt's agenda.</em></strong><br><br>He said that while Singaporeans understand the need for immigrants and foreign workers, they still have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some concerns</span> given the large inflow in the last few years.<br><br><strong><em>Some concerns certainly require a "National Integration Council"</em></strong><br><br>When the Singapore economy was booming the country admitted many foreigners — more than 100,000 per year in recent years. Mr Lee, however, said the country will not continue to admit people at this pace as the nation cannot expect to continue booming as in the last few years.<br><br>So over the long term while Singapore needs to continue bringing in immigrants, it will be mindful of how quickly its society can absorb and integrate new arrivals.<br><br>"In the midst of all these discussions about Singaporeans and non—Singaporeans, I should emphasise one point— that in Singapore, the interests of citizens have to always come first. Not a short term interest but a long term interest. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is to safeguard the long term interest of Singaporeans</span>, we must have a sustained, calibrated inflow of immigrants. We will make this differentiation sharper over time to reflect the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. But we cannot make it so onerous for PRs and non—residents that nobody wants to come," Mr Lee said.<br><em><strong><br>Is it not the long term interest of the privilege few who are insulated from the rest of the population - who travels in crowded MRTs, competes with low cost workers, struggles to afford their HDB homes, served by service staff who can't understand them - that is really the concern?</strong></em><br><br>Furthermore, he mentioned that Singapore’s critical constraint isn’t with physical space but with its people — that with more good people, the country can generate new and creative ideas to expand the space and create more opportunities.<br><strong><em><br>This country doesn't care for all its citizens - only those who are valued to its economic strategy. It treats its citizens like numbers. </em></strong><br><br>At the start of his speech, Mr Lee also had a word on the Singapore economy for his audience.<br><br>He said the third quarter economic forecast didn’t look bad.<br><br>But he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cautioned</span> that the nation must be psychologically prepared for a slow pickup and even surprises like a W—shaped recovery.<br><strong><em><br>Since when has this country with billions in its reserves not been constantly reminded of how threatened it is</em></strong></p>

Why would he announce something critical as 'cooling off' day in Trinidad &amp; tobago ...6,000 miles away?<br><br>Too afraid to announce it on home ground? I'm just guessing. <br><br>I'm just more kind with my comments. <br><br>Most people I speak to, first idea that comes into their mind about cooling off day is.. PAP is burning up from ground heat. <br><br>But ofcos taking opposition members to court, home ground is the best bet. Too many tea sessions with judges.<br><br>Maybe we need to educate our dear PM on being politcally energized. He should learn to taken on oppositions on policy debates ...live on tv. <br><br>Hope to see more lively debates on policies in the coming GE.<br><br>Hmmm PAP want to loose more votes? Pick on another Oppostion candidate over meager issues and avoid policy debates.<br><br>Example ..application not filled out properly - flash it in the headlines. <br>Maybe opposition say 'PAP corrupt' and threaten to sue - flash it in headline<br>or say "Oppostion is Liar" - flash it in headlines <br><br>Maybe we can see 33% go up to 45% or more...</p></div>

              <p>Why is voting preference private and confidential leh ?</p>
              <p>You so scared they retaliate meh ? If you scared..then you must start to wonder.. what kind of petty gahmen you have that you need to fear so much ?</p>
              <p>You want this kind of  gahmen for how long ?</p>
              <p>Lets face it lah. With the way election is being drawn, and the arrogance many PAP minsters exhibited these past few years... we all know that PAP will win the majority again this coming election lah.</p>
              <p>So ah....PAP won't die with one less win.</p>
              <p>Things won't get any better with one more PAP win.</p>
              <p>So vote opposition lor.</p>

It's not even a grant, it's just a maket value subsidy.<br><br><strong>MIW:</strong> We have no control over property markets.<br><br><strong>We:</strong> But aren't you HDB who supplies and build these flats, surely you can cap the pricing of flats.<br><br><strong>MIW</strong>: We lost 2 billion. But we can't let you know why.<br><br><strong>We:</strong> HDB lost 2 billion? Huh...So? So what?<br><br><strong>MIW:</strong> So flats are affordable.<br><br><strong>We:</strong> What? Where's the connection with 2 billion defecit and expensive flats.<br><br><strong>MIW:</strong> Joint the dots yourself. Flats are affordable.<br><br><strong>We:</strong> No, they are not. They are expensive.<br><br><strong>MIW:</strong> You want to live in slums?<br><br><strong>We:</strong> No ofcos.<br><br><strong>MIW:</strong> Then flats are affordable.<br><br><strong>We:</strong> Seriously. Please stop telling us it's affordable when it's CLEARLY NOT.<br><br><strong>MIW:</strong> So you want no frills housing? I can give you a shell.<br><br><strong>We:</strong> Are behaving like a profit making entity? We seem to be bargaining over price.<br><br><strong>MIW:</strong> No. We are HDB. We supply affordable flats with quality.<br><br><strong>We:</strong> But you are a public entity. You belong to the government so why aren't you doing anything about the prices?<br><br><strong>MIW:</strong> Rrrrr. You have a problem?
