              <p>More Singapore graduates being laid off</p>
              <p><span class="time">December 16, 2009</span></p>
              <p>Though the recession is over and the economy appears to be picking up, Singapore university graduates still find themselves at the losing end in an employer’s job market flooded with cheap and readily available foreigners.</p>
              <p>According to revised figures from the Manpower Ministry, more of them are without jobs and taking longer to land a job. The number of unemployed graduates increase from 1,600 to 4700. Of those who are employed, a significant portion are on contract jobs.</p>
              <p>Graduates also form more than one third of workers who are either retrenched or unemployed. The re-empolyment rates for graduates remains the lowest at 44.4 per cent.</p>
              <p>PAP MP Josephine Teo seemed to attribute the blame to graduates during an interview with the state media when she said that “part of the reason is that they often tend to seek jobs that pay close to what they used to earn.”</p>
              <p>The same report revealed that more residents are taking more six months to get a job. Known technically as the long-term unemployed, their numbers have ballooned from 9,600 last year to 18,400 this year.</p>
              <p>For some strange reasons, MOM prefers to lump citizens and PRs together in the same category as “residents”. The exact figures for the unemployment rates among Singapore citizens remain a mystery.</p>
              <p>The starting pay for graduates has remained more or less the same for the last few years while cost of living has increased, especially that of public housing.</p>
              <p>Burdened with a hefty study loan, graduates are encountering difficulties supporting themselves and families with their meager salaries let alone start a family of their own which may account for the declining birth rates among locals.</p>
              <p>Instead of doing more to help them, the ruling party chose to open the flood gates to allow the influx of mid-level and semi-skilled professionals into Singapore to compete with local graduates directly for jobs.</p>
              <p>There are no independent trade unions in Singapore to represent the interests of Singapore workers. The largest trade union is NTUC, a quasi-government organization which is headed by a PAP minister.</p>
              <p>Neither is there a free media for workers to air their grievance. The Singapore media is tightly controlled by the ruling party via the Singapore Press Holdings, headed by a former PAP minister.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They very pissed off!</p>

              <h1>Singaporeans need to overcome negative traits</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p>Wednesday, 29 April 2009</p>
              <p><span lang="EN-SG">Tan Kin Lian / Columnist</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-SG">I received an e-mail from a young person aged 27. I extract a few paragraphs from his e-mail below:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><em><span lang="EN-SG">Hi Mr Tan,</span></em></span><em><span lang="EN-SG"><br>….<span>  </span><span>It pains me to see how incompetent the current government is. It’s no joke: whenever you seek help or answers, you are pushed into a chain of merry go rounds whereby each recipient declares that someone else is responsible.</span><br>…. <span>Look at the recent current affairs. Which agency or leader have ever declared “yes, it’s our mistake. we will do whatever we can to learn and not repeat them” ?</span><br>…. <span>Every single one starts by declaring “it’s not my fault. Everyone else is to blame” and then finds a scapegoat. If not, then they say, “Everyone went in with their eyes open”.</span><br><span>…<span>  </span>For me, I am waiting for a new dawn in Singapore Government. Failing which, I’m setting my sights on New Zealand. I heard the grass there is not only greener, but a lot less hectic.”<br></span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG">Singaporean traits</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">I have personally observed the following traits among Singaporeans over the past many years:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">a)<span>         </span>Unwilling to take personal responsibility. “It’s not my responsibility”. They are always ready to pass the buck to somebody else. Before taking any task, they want to have their responsibility clearly defined.<br>b)<span>         </span>Unwilling to admit a mistake. There is a fear of making a mistake and paying a heavy price for it, such as losing their job. They learn how to handle it – by passing the blame to somebody else!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG">How did it happen?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">How did Singaporeans get these two traits? I believe that it is due to our education system. They strive to be the top in the class, so that they can qualify for a scholarship. To be top, they must have 100% marks. They cannot make any mistake. If they admit to a mistake, they will lose marks. So, they learn how to avoid admitting a mistake, by pushing the blame to somebody else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">The top scholars never make any mistake. Later, they become the head of our civil service, political leadership and business establishments. The colleagues who work for them learn from their leadership style and behaviour.<span>  </span>After a few years, this becomes part of the Singapore culture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG">Bad Policy Decisions</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Many major decisions in Singapore are made by a small group of people who discuss the issues in secret (fearing a leak of information).<span>  </span>To make matters worse, it is quite widely believed in Singapore that many key decisions are really taken by a few top people, or maybe by one person. The people involved in the detailed planning try to second-guess the views of the top people, and will formulate proposals and plans that are acceptable to the top people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">This approach has led to many bad policy decisions being taken.<span>  </span>These bad decisions continue a long time, because of the fear of admitting a mistake. Some examples are our public transport and education systems.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Our public transport system has now become quite expensive and does not provide the standard of comfort and convenience that is possible. Our education system produces students with good marks, but lacks the moral values and practical common sense (i.e. street-smart).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG">Educate Values</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">To make a change, we have to strengthen the education on values. I like to share the four key values that are important to me:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">a)<span>         </span>Honesty</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">b)<span>         </span>Fairness</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">c)<span>         </span>Public interest</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">d)<span>         </span>Courage</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Honesty. We have to be honest as part of our character. This goes beyond business dealings. We have to be honest in expressing our views and beliefs. We cannot just follow the views of people in power because it is “safe” to do so. If we make a mistake, it is honest to admit it, rather than to push the blame to somebody else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Fairness. We have to be fair to other people. We cannot take advantage of their ignorance (and profit at their expense) or weakness (and exploit them). We have to give them a fair deal. It will lead to more harmonious relationships and a better society. We cannot cheat others and say that “they should open their eyes” or that “it is a free market”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Public Interest.<span>  </span>We should be prepared to work for the public interest – provided that our basic requirements have been met.<span>  </span>We should look for leaders who are prepared to put the interest of the general public above their personal interests. They can make an important contribution to improve the lives of the people. This will be better than monetary rewards.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">Courage. We need people who are wise to know right from wrong and have the courage to take action to put things right. Many Singaporeans are fearful of the consequences of taking a different view from the people in power. They dare not speak up, for fear of jeopardising their current status. They only speak anonymously or in the coffee shops. This has to be changed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG">Innovation</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">We want to build an innovative society in Singapore. Innovation requires the willingness to try many different approaches, to make mistakes and learn from them, to take input from as many people as possible.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">The input comes not only from theory but from practical experience. We have to talk to the ordinary people who face the practical issues everyday.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN-SG">Change for the better</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-SG">I hope that we can change the negative traits in the Singapore character and have people who are able to know what is right (from wrong) and are willing to stand up for what is right. This will produce a more robust people and society.</span></p>

              <h1>PMETs and degree holders among hardest hit by weak labour market</h1>
              <div class="date">
              <p>Wednesday, 16 December 2009, 12:01 am | 933 views</p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Leong Sze Hian</strong></p>
              <p><em>Despite a slight increase in GDP in the third quarter of this year, Singapore’s labour market, as well as the earnings and productivity of resident workers have not recovered.</em></p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://i639.photobucket.com/albums/uu116/awareonline/Economy/1137933_recession.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225">A report released yesterday by the Ministry of Manpower reveals a surprising trend – it seems that PMETs and degree holders were among the hardest hit by the poor job market in the period from September 2008 to the same time this year, even more so than residents with secondary education.</p>
              <p>Both degree holders and secondary-school educated residents – which include Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) — registered above-average increases in unemployment rate with the former increasing by 1.67 times while the later by 1.58 times, said the Labour Market Third Quarter 2009 Report.</p>
              <p>Mature residents aged 40 and over also posted larger increase in unemployment rate over the year than those in their 30s or younger. Mature residents made up about half (49% or 41,000) of the resident job seekers in September this year, up from 2008 (45% or 25,300). In fact, the number of mature resident job seekers had increased by 15,700, or 62 percent, compared to a year ago.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the older or more educated you are, the harder it was to get a job.</p>
              <p><strong>SPUR ineffective for PMETs?</strong></p>
              <p>The share of Professionals, Managers, Executives, and Technicians (PMETs) among workers made redundant rose from 43% in Q2 09 to 51% in the third quarter, overtaking production &amp; related workers (34%) and clerical, sales &amp; service workers (15%) as the leading occupational group among redundant workers.</p>
              <p>What this may suggest is that the call to re-train and upgrade skills and education by the government, spearheaded by the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR) initiative, might not have worked very well from the perspective of those who upgrade to become PMETs, since their redundancy rate is now the highest.</p>
              <p>Slightly over one in three of the residents made redundant were in their 30s (34%) or degree holders (36%), disproportionately higher than their representation in the workforce (26% and 27% respectively).</p>
              <p>This is in spite of the data in the report that “PMETs made up the largest share of vacancies (15,400 or 44%) in September this year, followed by production &amp; transport operators, cleaners &amp; labourers (9,900 or 29%) and clerical, sales &amp; service workers (9,500 or 27%).”</p>
              <p>So, although job vacancies available were the highest for PMETs, they had the highest redundancy rate and the largest increase in the unemployment rate.</p>
              <p>The re-employment rate — those who were re-employed within six months of retrenchment — was quite low (37.3%) for those above 50 years old but even worse at 44.4% for degree holders.</p>
              <p>While it was indicated in the report that Singapore’s real GDP grew by 0.6% in September this year from a year ago, following three consecutive quarters of contraction. At first glance, the growth might be seen as a sign that the economy might be showing the green shoots of recovery, but a deeper analysis reveals otherwise.</p>
              <p><strong>Overall labour market weak</strong></p>
              <p>Looking at the overall labour market, a rise in unemployment of 0.4% among residents June to September this year was registered. In the report, the rise is attributed to residents who had deferred their job search and pursued improvement courses amid the difficult job market.</p>
              <p>The seasonally adjusted overall (which includes foreigners) unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.4% in September this year from 3.3% a quarter ago. The resident labour force rate – consisting of Singaporeans and PRs —  increased to 5.0% in September this year. This followed the decline from 4.8% in March to 4.6% in June.</p>
              <p>However, the question of how the resident unemployment rate could increase from June to September remains unanswered. Workers undergoing training, or are not actively seeking jobs for more than six months, are left out of the unemployment statistics.</p>
              <p>So, are we saying that these residents have now decided to start searching for jobs again because the job market is no longer perceived as difficult? Are lesser residents are pursuing courses?</p>
              <p>Perhaps these factors could have led to the worsening of the unemployment rate, but there is no way to know for sure.</p>
              <p>The report mentioned that “nevertheless, the unemployment rates were still below the peak (overall: 4.8%;resident: 6.2%) experienced in September 2003 due to the SARS outbreak.” However, this is akin to saying that it’s getting worse, but it’s not as bad as the worst ever! Some consolation for Singaporeans who are unemployed!</p>
              <p>In fact, the seasonally adjusted figure for unemployed residents was 100,300 in September, higher than the 91,500 in June this year, which is around the time the recession began.</p>
              <p><strong>Earnings and income down while living expenses go up</strong></p>
              <p>Despite the good news in GDP growth, labour productivity fell over the year by 0.7% from the third quarter of last year, and nominal earnings – which do not take inflation into account — decreased over the year by 3.0% over the same period of time. After adjusting for negative inflation however, the decline in real earnings was 2.6%, deeper than the contraction in the preceding quarter</p>
              <p>While earnings have continued to fall, HDB property taxes, HDB new flat prices, school bus fees, and other expenses have gone up.</p>
              <p>In fact, real earnings have fallen for six consecutive quarters by a cumulative 17.9%, reversing almost all the gains in earnings for the last three years or so, in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
              <p>While the educated and the older workers seem to be the hardest hit by the recession, the unemployment rate for cleaners, labourers and related workers was still the highest across all sectors in June 2009 at 8.3 percent, said the MOM’s Workforce 2009 report released earlier this year.</p>
              <p>The above figures fly in the face of the argument that since Singaporeans do not want such jobs, foreign workers are needed to fill up the vacancies. If this is indeed the case, then why is it that the unemployment rate was the highest for this category?</p>
              <p>What this may mean is that when residents who worked as cleaners and labourers lost their jobs and started looking for similar ones, they failed because younger foreign workers have generally replaced them in the food-courts and the airport toilets.</p>
              <p>It seems that living conditions for the worst-off in Singapore have not improved significantly.</p>
              <p>According to my calculations using data from the Department of Statistics’ Household Expenditure Survey Report (HES) released on 2 December 2009, the bottom 20% of households’ income declined by 0.3% in nominal terms from 1998 to 2008, and the 21st to 40th quintile households’ income increased by only 0.9% in real terms —accounting for inflation.</p>
              <p>Marrying the latest MOM Labour Market report which has data until September this year, with the HES which has data until 2008, we can surmise that about 40% of households may hardly have had any real increase in income over the last 10 years or so.</p>

They live and breathe the meritocractic system. And that is their weakness.<br><br>They cannot fall out of line. Once they do, all they credibility along with their politcal banner goes down the drain.<br><br>And so you find very often, they do their best to side step and avoid downer points. Very few simple subjects like TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY and CREDITBILITY are like cryptonites to them. And everyone knows of a great list of this NATO incidents.<br><br>You see, people like me, who do not carry any politcal banner, do not suffer the above consequence, becuase I AM THE ELECTORATE and the ruling party id beholden to me.<br><br>I have the power to put them in and take them out.<br><br>And the ruling party's job is to entice, pyscho and scare you once a while to just so you make that ignorant mistake of keeping them in power. Just like what happen in GE 2006.<br><br>Scare you with lift upgrading. Publicly challenge James Gomez and threathen to sue over a piece of application, and front page news for a week some more. Plus avoiding to address national polices that effect Singaporeans.<br><br>These are the hallmarks of a ruling party begging to show signs of decline.<br><br>This time PAP must learn to swallow the bitter OPPOSITION pill. A bitter pill is good for the body and mind.  <br><br>See, i'm going to say <strong>VOTE MORE OPPOSITION</strong>... What can they do? Ban me?<br><br>Judegment day is on polling day. Can cooling off day would be a great time to source for more online alternative news.<br><br>What can they do? Nothing ... ....I tell them go home suck cock ok?<br><br></p>

              <p>Up to you, if you want vote opposition, no body is going to stop you, I am going malaysia for a short holiday, dun even bother to void for anyone, even if vote, just draw a <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> face and let them go and count the spoil votes, you may not know, sometime spoil votes are the main issue in an election, eg between 1250 voted PAP and 1249 voted opposition, leaving only my spoil vote hanging in the middle, they will count and count thru the nite, and i will be laughing all the way to my Holiday!</p>
