I won't trust them to run a war, or even do anything effective. How many of them are even military historians who do analysis on past battles and attempt to come up with doctrine on how to avoid past mistakes?

While they were surprised by the capabilities of Hezbollah, the Israelis still ultimately inflicted tremendous damage on Hezbollah and set them back quite far. Following the conflict, Hezbollah lacked the strength to do major mischief.<br><br>Unless you want to believe the Hezbollah tally of "oh only a couple dead on our side", the conflict was actually a military defeat for Hezbollah, but a decisive propangada and media victory as the Israelis were on the media defensive from the start and allowed them to spin the rather incredious pitch that they were inflicting massive losses on the IDF while the IDF were hitting everything but them. What actually happened on the ground was that they were getting pummeled, but the IDF was ultimately restrained by their own inability to decide what to do in the conflict.</div>

The article did include the fact that this American soldier conceding the fact that our army is the best in SEA. Why didn't u put it in? Is it because u see no relevancy in this topic or discussion, or u just felt there's no point in putting it?</div></blockquote>Yes, I've been one-sided for the sake of argument. Anyway, with S'pore's military budget vis-a-vis the other 9 SEAsian countries, it must be a GIVEN that it has the best army. So, what's the point of pointing something that we should not be surprised of? As a Sporean, I note that the SAF gets the lion's share of our annual budget. As such, I want to know that I'm getting the best deal for my money as a taxpayer. Yes, we may have the best army in SEAsia, but it's the flaws that I'm concerned with because I want the best bang for my S'pore buck.</div>

While they were surprised by the capabilities of Hezbollah, the Israelis still ultimately inflicted tremendous damage on Hezbollah and set them back quite far. Following the conflict, Hezbollah lacked the strength to do major mischief.<br><br>Unless you want to believe the Hezbollah tally of "oh only a couple dead on our side", the conflict was actually a military defeat for Hezbollah, but a decisive propangada and media victory as the Israelis were on the media defensive from the start and allowed them to spin the rather incredious pitch that they were inflicting massive losses on the IDF while the IDF were hitting everything but them. What actually happened on the ground was that they were getting pummeled, but the IDF was ultimately restrained by their own inability to decide what to do in the conflict.</div></blockquote>The IDF underperformed in the war, and quite a few of their Merkava tanks were knocked out or disabled, and even a frigate got hit (it had its electronic countermeasures switched off for some damn reason) and had to be towed back. If by anything, the IDF did not achieve any of their objectives, short of bombing the hell out of South Lebanon.<br><br>The damage was inflicted from the air, on the ground, they got ambushed, pushed back, and what not. It was in some of the western papers, not sure if ST bothered to publish any of it. Even if the Israelis went to Beirut, what would it have served? Politically, you would have every Arab country against them. As it is, the Hezbollah were able to hide their weapons, and struck the Israelis pretty badly. I remember there was some article in the NYT that said that only one unit performed well, whereas the other units did not, and they were the reservist units by the way.<br><br>The Israelis aren't what they were decades ago. More reliant on high tech weapons, and short on proper training. Couple that with an intelligence failure of significant magnitude, you have a war where the IDF achieved none of its objectives.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is highly possible.  but it is also undenied fact that i believe with all the excerise we held together with US military personnel our military leader probably demonstrate  some level of unrealistics planning and decision regards to expectation. So this is an awkward position that mindef need to address.<br><br>Also if we look at the current environment MY and the chinese are sending troops to lebanon, the experience they gain on the ground are effectively beyond training.  It is not unrealistics to assume that defending singapore maybe against a battle hardened fighting force.</div>
