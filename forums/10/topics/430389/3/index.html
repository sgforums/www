Enough is enough and let PM Lee and the remaining ministers do the running of Sg for the next 5 years.  If the remaining members of the ruling party are capable as we are told again and again in the mass media then I am sure people would want to retain the party to run the govt.

              <p>And dont tell me that the election result is voted by Singaporeans.Coz when i met ppl around me,most ppl vote for opposition,but the result is vice versa.Although this is strictly my personal view,but i think the election result was forged.This is why many ppl want a re election in Potong Pasir.</p>
              <p>Since the Burma government can forged their own election result,why cant our almighty PAP government do the same thing?But of coz,this is strictly my own personal view on the election.</p>

              <p>Dun think they will stoop so low to rig the votes or else georgie will still be earning his millions and not hogging the limelight since he is leaving.</p>
              <p>Strange that ST giving so much coverage for losers.</p>
              <p>Maybe they should ask him to write a book so that he can start his book tours selling it to his croonies overseas.</p>

              <p>Another thing i want to talk about Mr Goh is that he is also a person who hardly tolerate of critics.He might laugh at LHL unable to accept critics.But in the case of LHL,i understand becoz he has grown up from a "Greenhouse" environment,protected by his father.</p>
              <p>But Goh is different,he has been working all the way up to what he is now.But he also not much better than LHL.During his reign,yes,we can criticise.But if we say what he dont like to hear or talk too much,he will pleaded LKY to jack up the cost of living.</p>
              <p>Talk some more,GST 3%,talk some more,5%,again?7%.Complain again,bring in more foreigners,this kind of management is so called "more open society" or "Asian Democracy?I LOL!!!!</p>
