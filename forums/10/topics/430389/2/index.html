              <p>With both not in the pap cabinet,wll it make any differences to pm lee?</p>
              <p>All the while mm lee is taking a back sit, and it has been pm lee and his cabinet running the show.</p>
              <p>With the hot resentment from the public, I think it is the choice they are making to sacrificed both ministers and need more young mps to speak up and to implement any policies that is on level with the young people in spore.</p>

              <p>Singapore thank MM Lee and SM Goh from the bottom of our hearts for taking care fo us all these years.</p>
              <p>I am sure the young cabinet will from time to time continue to consult these 2 wise old men.</p>
              <p>In fact MM Lee can serve as adviser to China while SM Goh can act as consultant to ASEAN esp Thailand on political stability</p>

              <p>It is not their policies,but rather their attitude. There is no
              such thing as a right or wrong policy. There is only a policy you
              are agreeable with or not agreeable with.</p>
              <p>Over the years they getting more and more like they pwned
              the people of Singapore, and they are convinced of
              that. They believed they are unstoppable. They arbitarily
              increased their renumerations, they arbitarily increase the draw
              down age for CPF payout. Those are not wrong  or right, but
              they way they carry it out is one hell of pwned game. The Grand Old
              Man mantra is Just Think It Througn Then Go Ahead And Do It.
              Hell, You've Got The Power</p>
              <p>Your house here is not your home. What takes priority?
              Development. What development? Look at all the malls, are they all
              not similar? Look at all the cross junctions at HDB estates, they
              all look alike. Can you remember road names like Bukit Batok
              St 21, Tampines  St 11, Jurong West St 41? Seems the British
              who built roads here in those days has better regard for locals
              than the present PAP government in this aspect, and sense of humour
              too, like Jalan Ayam Bogel. I have never been to Kaypoh Road, but I
              know where it is as I saw it once (only once) while
              passing in a bus along River Valey Road. Huge grand old trees were
              cut down near Bedok Reservoir Flyover to make way for the slip road
              to the PIE, when there are already access road to the PIE near by.
              Your House is never your Home, as Enbloc Sales, SER always looms
              over your head.</p>
              <p>Just today, the front page of Weekend TODAY Quote MM Lee as
              saying "Workers must share in growth." He has forgotten the PEOPLE,
              he is talking about better homes, better schoold, better hospitals,
              better playing fields, a healthier environment for families and for
              children to grow up. FOR WORKERS? Yes, that is good, but see
              he don't see the PEOPLE in people anymore, because
              he sees Citizens as workers. We are like battery chickens
              to him, well looked after, well housed, good medical care, clean
              environment, properly educated, periodically the facilities are
              upgraded and improved regardless of the chickens discomfort, as it
              is for their good, and for increasing productivity.</p>
              <p>During the restructuring upheaval, the PM told us some of the
              old jobs no longer exist, the old way of working is gone, we must
              adapt, upgrade, retrain. We cannot stick to the old ways. That was
              about two decades ago. Seems he did not tell his father.</p>
              <p>Its is not the policies, its time as Low Thia Khiang put
              it, to separate Party from the Government. The reason for this
              is the PAP is increasingly blurring the line between the property
              of the People of Singapore and the property of the
              PAP. </p>

              <p>attitude drives the type of policies they churn out. </p>
              <p>see the FT policy.  singaporeans who are left behind are of no concern to them.  GDP growth is everything to them.</p>
              <p>see housing policy.  they see the  "asset enhancement" in monetary terms.  they don't see the person struggling to repay mortgage for 20-30 years</p>
              <p>see casinos in singapore.  social impact and moral decay are of minimal concern to them.  GDP growth and jobs? (to mostly foreigners) are more important</p>

              <p>From MM's record I believe he doesn't feel remorse for anything.
                                              Not for the people he jailed, remarks he has made.</p>
              <p>I believe he was cajoled / pleaded with to go by party and
                                              family, due to the damage he has done. And nobody wants to side

              <p>Maybe PM Lee wants to move in the direction of a normal country
                                              before he dies, so that he can die as merely a distinguished MP. He
                                              doesn't want any statues, public holidays for mourning etc. Plus he is fed up of repairing the damage done by his mouth.</p>
              <p>He is not useful anymore. Nobody wants him to provide rash and unconsultative judgment in crises, or even speak internationally and offend other countries.</p>

The SDP has, in our <a style="color: #8b7f65; text-decoration: underline; " href="http://www.yoursdp.org/files/GE2011/SDP-shadow-budget-2011.pdf">Shadow Budget 2011</a>, called for the posts created in the Prime Minister's Office to be abolished as they serve no useful purpose except to drain the national budget. <br><br>We call on the Prime Minister to make these removals permanent as well as to go one step further to also abolish the positions of the Ministers-without-portfolio. The Government has never adequately explained to the people what these ministerial posts are for and why they are needed for the efficient running of the country.  <br><br>The removal of these position will free up to $15 million in salaries paid to these ministers that could be put to better use such as increasing assistance for needy families in Singapore.  <br><br>If the motivation is for the younger generation to take over the leadership of politics in Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew should completely retire from the political scene. The clean break would truly signal a new beginning for politics in Singapore and for democracy to start its belated development. </span></p>
