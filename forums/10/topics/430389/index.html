              <p>The leaving of MM and SM is not really that matters.</p>
              <p>They have to understand who or what are SGporeans or the younger generations against.In my opinion, it is the policies that we are really against of. We need them to listen and understand our concern.It does not  really matter whether SM and MM is off gone because they can be working behind the scene or reappear in future for all we know. I do not want them to leave now, not for all they have done.It would be laudable if they can own up their mistakes and things that they have  overlooked and work things out .It is time for them to clear the shit and mess.</p>
              <p>Leaving the PM alone with his 'younger' team does not change everything overnight. Yes, we are sick of their faces but they have to clear up their mess.I believe that SGporean still hold their graciousness which explains our patience with the Government all this while.It is time for the Government to take the responses from the recent GE election constructively. We do not need change but amendments.We are grateful for what they have done in the past but they have unfortunately failed to maintain that credibility of theirs. They used to be the People's people but they have manifested into selfish people.</p>
              <p>Policies are being written to look nice in textbooks and admirable to the world but does it really serve its purpose?Yes, we are almost developed country and we are working very hard towards it.To be a global city. No matter high is our desire, we have to look after those who are not so ready to go forward, those who are restricted by circumstances. We do need to slow down for them.It doesnt mean we will lose out.</p>
              <p>Singapore maybe a global city but it have to be a home FIRST.The home that we have been building for, the home that we have fought for and the home that we are defending with out hearts and souls. If we cannnot find home here,where else?</p>
              <p>It is not wrong to be THE one but the Government have to think of the people.It is something that PAP used to do and they kind of forgot that.</p>

              <p>It is not their policies,but rather their attitude. There is no such thing as a right or wrong policy. There is only a policy you are agreeable with or not agreeable with.</p>
              <p>Over the years they getting more and more like they pwned the people of Singapore, and they are convinced of that. They believed they are unstoppable. They arbitarily increased their renumerations, they arbitarily increase the draw down age for CPF payout. Those are not wrong  or right, but they way they carry it out is one hell of pwned game. The Grand Old Man mantra is Just Think It Througn Then Go Ahead And Do It. Hell, You've Got The Power</p>
              <p>Your house here is not your home. What takes priority? Development. What development? Look at all the malls, are they all not similar? Look at all the cross junctions at HDB estates, they all look alike. Can you remember road names like Bukit Batok St 21, Tampines  St 11, Jurong West St 41? Seems the British who built roads here in those days has better regard for locals than the present PAP government in this aspect, and sense of humour too, like Jalan Ayam Bogel. I have never been to Kaypoh Road, but I know where it is as I saw it once (only once) while passing in a bus along River Valey Road. Huge grand old trees were cut down near Bedok Reservoir Flyover to make way for the slip road to the PIE, when there are already access road to the PIE near by. Your House is never your Home, as Enbloc Sales, SER always looms over your head.</p>
              <p>Just today, the front page of Weekend TODAY Quote MM Lee as saying "Workers must share in growth." He has forgotten the PEOPLE, he is talking about better homes, better schoold, better hospitals, better playing fields, a healthier environment for families and for children to grow up. FOR WORKERS? Yes, that is good, but see he don't see the PEOPLE in people anymore, because he sees Citizens as workers. We are like battery chickens to him, well looked after, well housed, good medical care, clean environment, properly educated, periodically the facilities are upgraded and improved regardless of the chickens discomfort, as it is for their good, and for increasing productivity.</p>
              <p>During the restructuring upheaval, the PM told us some of the old jobs no longer exist, the old way of working is gone, we must adapt, upgrade, retrain. We cannot stick to the old ways. That was about two decades ago. Seems he did not tell his father.</p>
              <p>Its is not the policies, its time as Low Thia Khiang put it, to separate Party from the Government. The reason for this is the PAP is increasingly blurring the line between the property of the People of Singapore and the property of the PAP. </p>
