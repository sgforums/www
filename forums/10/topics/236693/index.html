This calc is no more complicated then that for the progress pkg/ income taxes and far more equitable.<br>Âƒ{ A similar formula can be used for rental/ Â¡Â¥non-owner occupiedÂ¡Â¦ properties.<br><br>15) UN World Summit for Social Development and beyond: achieving social development for all in a globalizing world (Geneva, 26-30 June 2000)  SG gov: Â¡Â§Economic development is undoubtedly necessary to ensure social stability. The thrust of our social development policy is to deploy resources to pre-empt social problems and actively shape the development of our society instead of dealing with them downstream.Â¡Â¨-  http://www.un.org/socialsummit/speeches/286sin.htm<br><br>16) SG gov has no excuse not to do a good job implementing my suggestion:<br>i) They promise a first class living environment as reason to raise GST,  http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2007/gst.html#Q1  that being the case then there is urgent need for equitable land use/ distribution in SG.<br>ii) They have enough manpower to check ALL commercial weighing scales in SG: between 04 till current and announce its completion: http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/257636/1/.html<br>iii) SG is an info comm. Hub, no reason why it cannot set an example in govt administration for other countries to follow in the accurate assessment on property taxes: http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg<br>iv) No one ever said tt building a first class living environment would be Â¡Â¥administratively simpleÂ¡Â¦ http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060403/5/singapore201170.html , any how, PAP ministers are already being paid more then adequately to deliver (Â¡Â¥befitting of their abilitiesÂ¡Â¦)Â¡K <a href="http://uselesstree.typepad.com/useless_tree/2006/05/pap_ministers_v.html" rel="nofollow">http://uselesstree.typepad.com/useless_tree/2006/05/pap_ministers_v.html </a>, PAP pension= pension of up to 80% of their last drawn salary +$800,000. http://groups.google.com.sg/group/soc.culture.singapore/msg/7422c425516debe8?dmode=source&amp;hl=en<br>v) SG gov under PAP: Â¡Â§integrity, service, excellenceÂ¡Â¨: http://www.gov.sg/<br>vi) Progressive subsidies, regressive taxes: whatÂ¡Â¦s the point?: <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/257428/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/257428/1/.html </a><br><br>17) Conclusion: Where there is demand in a country for a scare resource: the govt is responsible for equality in its distribution. Taxes and usage charges are a common way of controlling land use resources tt the SG govt has failed to implement correctly. More so is the current urgency for such implementation now that the govt intends to raise taxes for govt expenditure. Implementing regressive taxes (GST) cannot be the only solution until and unless progressive taxes (ie on land use in said case) are correctly implemented. The current govt proposal is probably negligent in this instance.<br>i) What will the result be? :<br>Âƒ{ For the speech on 15.2.07:  http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2007/index.html<br>Âƒ{ Citizen commentary (maybe): http://www.singaporeangle.com/<br><br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> References:<br>Âƒ{ Singapore is a sick country: Â¡K has the fifth highest incidence of kidney failure in the world with about 20.1% Singaporeans suffering from hypertension and 8.2% from diabetes.
