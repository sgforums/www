            <div class='col-md body'>1970s saw drastic cost increases due to all kinds of taxes supposedly levied to control traffic congestions. These cost increases were road tax, parking fee, car park surcharge, ($60 per parking lot per month)  vehicle registration tax (170% of C &amp; F) etc.<br><br>When COE was introduced in mid 1980s, it was supposed to be the final pricing mechanism to control road usage but by then road taxes, car park surcharges, vehicle taxes and petrol duties were already drastically increased. The minister announced that after this all earlier ad hoc taxes would be reduced progressively over a period of time.<br><br>With COE bidding going up to as high as S$100,000, isn't is only logical that the prior tax increases such as vehicle taxes and petrol taxes should be withdrawn or reduced correspondingly to avoid double charging? Has the minister kept the promise not to double-charge now that full ERP is finally implemented?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have raised a good point. Shd send it to ST forum. If by any chance it gets publish in the newspaper there will be wider discussion on it.
