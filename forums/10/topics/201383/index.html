            <div class='col-md body'>News<br>Ex-cabby apologises for punching MP in the face<br>228 words<br>23 July 2006<br>Straits TimesEnglish<br>(c) 2006 Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br><br>A FORMER cabby who punched Yio Chu Kang MP Seng Han Thong in the face during a Meet-the-People session has apologised for his actions. Mr Koo Tong Huat, 74, wrote an apology in Chinese, expressing his regret for acting in a rash manner. He also asked for Mr Seng's forgiveness, reported Lianhe Wanbao yesterday.<br><br>Mr Koo produced the note during an interview with the Chinese newspaper, which later informed the MP about it. Mr Seng, who is in Shanghai on a business trip, accepted the apology and dismissed it as a small matter. The incident took place last Thursday at a PAP Community Foundation kindergarten in Ang Mo Kio. Mr Koo had gone to see the MP about his revoked taxi licence.<br><br>He had earlier sought the MP's help to get ComfortDelGro, which owns Comfort taxis, to reinstate his licence. But he lost his temper before Mr Seng could take out a letter to show him that he had acted on his appeal. Mr Koo reportedly lost his taxi licence four years ago after a passenger complained about his rude behaviour. He had apparently quarrelled with her over a basket of wet seafood she had put into his cab. Mr Koo was released on police bail last Friday. The police are investigating the matter.</div>

I grew up in a poor family and we could get by with much less. My father brought home $500 a month (1980 figures) and we had three siblings:<br><br>Breakfast: last night's left-overs<br>Lunch and dinner: Go to wholesale market and get vegetables that are already turning yellow. They used to give us a huge basketful for very little. Stew as mixed vegetables or make curry. We get meat once a week.<br>Daily transport: Walked to school and then took bus when secondary school was further away. Since when has student bus fare gone up to 1.50 per trip? And btw, school is only from Monday to Friday, you must not multiply by 30 per month. Occasional ECA, although we hardly participated in anything...use the time to study instead.<br><br>School fees: never had to pay. Scholarships and busaries paid for all fees and provided pocket money in addition. Some of them like the Pre-U MOE scholarship comes with remission of school fees.<br>Text books and stationary: Never had to buy books. Second hand from seniors,neighbours and siblings... As for some books that were not available, borrow from library and zapped the whole lot <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Collected ten-year series and past exam papers from seniors (In fact, made money when I worked out the answers and sold them as model answers to classmates for 20cents a copy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br>Stationary: used to work part-time delivering papers and later as student correspondent for the now-defunct Nanyang Siang Pau...the uncles and aunties there let me take the office pens and pencils...I took home two a week <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>School uniform: never had to buy them....second hand from seniors who have left the school...bit big but ok. Passed on to siblings.<br>Miscellaneous expenses: never joined school outings so no need to pay. Other expenses covered by scholarships and bursaries. Didn't have to pay for A level exam fees 'cos principal paid for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you  come from a poor family, you can make do and get by with much less. Since I took my first bursary/scholarship in Pri 2, hardly had to spend a cent of my parent's money for school and I am nowhere near President scholarship material. Children can get by with less...it makes them stronger..<br><br></div>

There are some who earn just enough to get by, they simply do not have any leftovers to save. Then there are others who can save, and also invest wisely to make the money grow. Over 20 -30 years, the first group would still be at the edge, the slightest push, and they may have to go hungry. The second group can afford to retire early and enjoy their golden years.</div>

They become more spoilt is one thing but also because things get more expensive, in my time eat one tua bao $0.60, now cost $1.20 or more. And no parent want their children to starve mah, if they want to eat, of course you have to give more.<br><br>Bottomline, salary &lt; $2000 difficult to start a family.</div>
