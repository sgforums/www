Radio). For any miltitary to operate, there need to be communication in between the forces. It can provide critical info if intercepted. E.g. Troops movement.<br><br>USA not stopping Osaman is not relevant to this dicussion on ELINT. That incident is a failure to act on intelligence gathered.<br><br>To fight a war, you don't decide you want to, and invade overnight. Troops have to be prepared, and deployed. This applies to the tanks, artillery, AA guns etc. Ships prepared and put out to sea. It's a major coordination, and alot of movement of forces. Not you happy happy, say whack then whack. All these increased activity will be hard to hide, and will be noticed by various ELINT assets.<br><br>Before any conflicts breaks out, tensions will be tightened. SAF do not wait until last minute then call up our reserves one, that one I can assure you. So caught napping? Nah!<br><br>You will be surprised how fast an airfield can be repaired. Also it's impossible for them to bomb every road. Worst case is setup a makeshift one. So don't worry, our planes will be able to land somehow.<br><br>Don't worry. SG won't be caught napping. Can't say alot of stuff, but I assure you Singaporeans is a Kiasu lot. Let's just say if anybody trys anything funny, there will be hell to play.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the tactics of UAV is to use it as a cruise missile.....it can put in a light warhead or.......jus crash it into enemy structure .Singapore i believe will also adopt this tactic as they rather waste millions to save hundred of lives.........being frank singapore have replace the pioneers UAV (the malat scouts)with the seacher MK II UAVs .......for the pioneers....i believe they were ethier keep as reserves or.....convert to cruisemissiles......same goes to the firefly and the LALEE in the future.</div>

It can throw chaffs. Furthermore, Singapore license built Igla, and I'm sure DSO and RSAF have already included the seeker IR scan band into the Apache's threat library. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>BTW, the BlackHawks were downed by RPGs, not exactly Igla you know. It doesn't take much to down a BlackHawk, but it will take a lot more to down an Apache, of course, and Apache caught by an RPG on its rotors or engine bay will do sufficient damage to bring it down too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
