            <div class='col-md body'>ON second thought i think the RMN needs 1 at least to patrol the malaysia peninsula from the MY mainland to the borneo region the carrier can also allow RMN to convert the carrier into supply ship anytime during an excerise in the south china sea which is an international water an be very useful of course provided RMN can pay for the cost of the maintenance during each trip/excrises<br><br>Singapore should also consider an light heli carrier in the future provided the problem of manpower doesnt effect its operation<br>since has a lot of oversea attrachment...detachment and so on the carrier can also be use as describe above.<br><br>Well now i think singapore should aim at making RSN combatant fleet more mature in sense by acquiring larger ship such as the frigates increase the size of sub fleet which they are planning to in the near future.Carrier can be consider later part when RSN prove that its combatant ships are ocean worthy and can deploy effective and efficiency.Right now its covertte suits more 2 sea deployment<br><br></div>

I would re-word to say that no regional countries so far can deploy a decent enough carriers to be good enuff for our surrounding waters. Carriers are suitable in the South China Sea, see how many battles (carrier vs carrier) were fought between the US Navy and the Japanese during world war 2.<br><br>China might be the only country with sufficient capability to do so.

Look at the Falkland wars. The sea harriers and Land-based harrier operated from the Invisible class carrier effective repelled all Argies' land-based Skyhawks and Mirages.  The future (VTOL/STOL) versions of JSFs would also be a very potent jets and they would be able to defeat land-based aircraft.

            <div class='col-md body'>I apologise if my word gave u a wrong impression about the carrier which i m talking about.The carrier which i m describing is HELI carrier we can used as a offshore hospital,transport military vehicles ,ground troops support using heli carrier based attack heli like Cobra.<br><br>Anyway nowadays,aircraft carrier are quite vulnerable to advanced supersonic anti-ship cruise missiles which can be in fited with nuke warhead,the american use their aircraft carrier to pressurise nations<br>and power projection.In a war with countries that are armed with such a missiles they will transfer planes to nearby country which make clearance for US to use their bases.These days is not like the vietnam war where u can have carriers offshore.<br><br>china is undergoing the process of acquiring aircraft carrier this is one indication that CGHINESE govt wanting to project its might oversea like the US.The current chinese destroyer fleet is still much too weak to be able to protect the carrier,they dont have ample sophisticated destroyer to distribute to all 3 chinese navy fleet<br>many of their ships are too outdated except SOV and onemore i cant really recall.Their nuclear submarines are quite problematic<br>,they have in the end acquire russian SSK.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I see no practical reason why Malaysia would want to buy an aircraft carrier.  A carrier is very unenconomical.  Thailand's carrier only has six Harriers and six Seahawks aboard, which are not really  effective on its own.  At the same time, a carrier presents a VERY big target.  Note that each US carrier has its own battle group, which consists of destroyers, subs and other ships to defend the carrier and operate with it.  Eg, the battle group of USS Harry S. Truman consists of :<br>USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75)<br>USS San Jacinto (CG 56)<br>USS Oscar Austin (DDG 79)<br>USS Mitscher (DDG 57)<br>USS Donald Cook (DDG 75)<br>USS Briscoe (DD 977)<br>USS Deyo (DD 989)<br>USS Hawes (FFG 53)<br>USS Pittsburg (SSN 720)<br>USNS Kanawha (T AO 196)<br>USNS Mount Baker (T AE 34)<br><br>I wonder what Malaysia will defend their ship with.  True, Malaysia's potential carrier will be a much smaller one, but it still cannot operate alone or it will be very easily destroyed.  To defend the carrier would mean having to dedicate at least one of its subs and a few surface ships to defend it.  This would only serve to tie up its forces.  Also, in the event Malaysia buys an aircraft carrier, where on earth is it gonna dock at.  Singapore will also surely not sit by and do nothing.<br><br>Also, look at Malaysia's coast line.  It is a consists of both a peninsular and part of Borneo, that is ALOT of coast to defend.  Singapore also shares very close military ties with Brunei.  It is possible that Brunei will come tot he aid of SIngapore and vice versa if either is attacked by Malaysia.  it is highly unlikely that Malaysia will be able to continue war on two fronts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>found this on one of my net search... any comments???<br><br>U.S. Builds an Asian Tiger Cub in Singapore<br><br>Strategic Forecasting, July 19, 2001<br>Summary<br><br>Singapore, better known for its electronics industry and financial services than its defense posture, is steadily modernizing its armed forces with the help of the United States to secure expanding economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region. As part of Washington's efforts to contain China through new military allies, Singapore will transition from a small, inert power to one of the principal military players in the Asia Pacific.<br><br>Analysis<br><br>Singapore, a city-state of 3.2 million people that likes to think of itself as the Switzerland of Asia, has outlined plans to acquire dozens of new attack helicopters, fighter aircraft, warships and other long-range land, sea and air capabilities. These new tools will help round out a steady military buildup begun in the mid-1990s to help Singapore actively ensure regional stability.<br><br>Singapore is the Asian region's third-largest financial center, after Japan and Hong Kong. It has carved itself out a small but lucrative niche in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, producing 8 percent of the world market in 1999. Singapore is also known for its stable political environment and strong legal system. Moreover, unlike Switzerland, it has the vast opportunities of an emerging Asia on its doorstep.<br><br>But the modernizing of Singapore's armed forces is transforming it into a key link in the security chain that the United States is building around China. Within the decade, Singapore will evolve from a relatively neutral participant to a major regional player -- a development reminiscent of its days as a British military fortress during World War II. Washington will not look solely to Singapore to keep Beijing in military isolation, but the tiny nation will once again play a vital role in regional security affairs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Like Israel, Singapore lacks strategic depth and is outnumbered by potentially hostile neighbors. Its defense strategy, therefore, is two-fold: Build an offensive-minded security force that can strike at potential enemies before they harm Singapore, and seek the support and protection of the United States.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Singapore, which spends $4 billion per year on defense, is well positioned to acquire the weapons and technologies it needs. The arsenal it is building will allow it to destroy enemies on the ground, pre-emptively seize strategic territory, prevent rising piracy and intervene quickly and effectively in Indonesia, Malaysia and other likely trouble spots in the contested South China Sea. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>On July 10, Singapore announced that it is seeking bids for up to two dozen cutting-edge fighter jets, at an estimated value of $2 billion, to replace its ageing fleet of A-5 Skyhawks. The deal would be signed in 2004, and Singapore is looking closely at Boeing's F-15 Eagle and Lockheed Martin's F-16 Fighting Falcon, according to Bloomberg.com. The U.S. Department of Defense this month also made Singapore eligible for an additional 12 Boeing-built AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and related components at an estimated cost of $617 million. Singapore currently has eight of the tank-busting choppers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>In April, Singapore commissioned the RSS Persistence and the RSS Endeavor, the last of four amphibious attack vessels being built to replace Singapore's old County-class Landing Ship Tanks and Victory class corvettes. The new amphibious ships, which can displace 6,000 tons and command a range of 5,000 nautical miles, are outfitted with state-of-the-art communications and other automated tools that allow Singapore to operate effectively alongside the United States and other advanced militaries.<br>On land, the first indigenously designed All Terrain Tracked Carrier (ATTC) was delivered to Singapore's army in May. The ATTC "can transport troops and equipment over soft muddy ground and difficult terrain impassable to other vehicles," making it useful in a number of combat support and service missions, Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Tony Tan Keng Yam said March 8.<br><br>In tandem with its weapons purchases, Singapore is unfolding a "total defense" strategy that includes alliances with like-minded nations. So far this year, Singapore has conducted an anti-submarine warfare exercise with India, dispatched soldiers to participate in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in East Timor, sent airmen to Canada for an air warfare exercise and hosted a 16-nation mine-countermeasures exercise -- the largest in its history.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Perhaps most significantly, Singapore this year also allowed a U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Kitty Hawk, to dock for the first time at a new base designed for the large flattops. The navy has increasingly used Singapore as a repair base for its smaller, Pacific-based ships since it was kicked out of its Subic Bay base in the Philippines in the early 1990s. Navy officials have been pressing for permission to build a dry dock in Singapore to repair aircraft carriers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>The Kitty Hawk's March 22 visit to Changi Naval Base is telling. Though Singapore's strategy pays homage first to national survival, it also dovetails with U.S. efforts to contain China. The Kitty Hawk's visit came immediately before an American spy plane was downed in the South China Sea, leading to a standoff between Washington and Beijing. Chinese leaders almost certainly viewed the port visit as heralding yet another U.S. naval "base" in the region, this time with direct access to the South China Sea. But Singapore does indeed appear to be becoming a de facto U.S. base.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Singapore is not Washington's only potential ally in its quest to contain China. Australia already has taken its place in the anti-China security chain; Adelaide earlier this month called on the U.S. Navy to help fix technical problems with its Collins-class submarine development program.<br><br>Japan is also slowly taking on a greater security role at Washington's urging. Navy officials tell STRATFOR that Washington has its sights on other potential allies -- for instance, raising the prospect of a return to Subic Bay and seeking ties to other players, such as Thailand and Indonesia.<br><br>Though small, Singapore will play a sizeable part in the U.S. strategy. Boasting an increasingly modern and highly capable fighting force, working to better integrate its forces with those of the United States, Australia and other regional militaries, and located at one of the world's most strategic chokepoints -- both economically and militarily -- it will emerge later this decade as a front-line outpost in the escalating military confrontation between the United States and China.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think Singapore will not be willing to fight a war with China.  True, it allows the US access to its Naval base and US 7th fleets (or Pacific Command PACOM) logistics office is in Singapore, but war with China will not be beneficial to Singapore in anyway, even if it puts Singapore in the attention of the US.  Singapore operates ports in China in which it has placed a lot of investments.  These will certainly make losses which are very hard to recover and will most likely have to be closed.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't see any reason why Singapore should go to war with China. Firstly both countries interests have not conflicted with each other to an extend of needing to go for war. Secondly, if I am not mistaken, China has offered some concessions to South East Asia since she knows that her development will undermine that of South East Asia and would lead it to conflict...offering concessions on the part of China does not really seem that it wants an all out war with S'pore. Lastly, a depeleted SSA does China no good economically.<br><br>Before anyone flames me for my nick...I just want to say I lost my other account's password and forgot which mail account I used to register it...so for the time being bear with this one...even though it has no reference to your beloved nation.</div>

These will replace the six towed 105mm howitzers in the 21st Artillery Regiment, which has two batteries of towed 155mm FH70s. Malaysia previously ordered 22 of the G5s to raise the new 22nd Artillery Regiment (with 18 guns; the other 4 will go to the artillery and maintenance schools). Malaysia has also ordered a number of Rapier air defense missile systems from Europe and Igla SA-18 shoulder-fired anti-aircraft rockets from Russia.--Stephen V Cole<br><br>Look like MAF is really arming itself or ConWarfare.<br><br>Any comments or any idea if this website is all smuck?<br><br>Rgds</div>

I thought u were more updated than that...<br><br>That was before the malaysians announced their massive arms purchase of new jets, new sams, new mlrs and new tanks a few months ago...<br><br>AND need we also say that this article was published BEFORE 9-11...<br><br>It all has to be viewed in light of the changing geo-political developments... the Americans want the support of "moderate" muslim countries to support their war and china has eclipsed in significance as a security threat cos they're busy in afghanistan and mid-east and their involvement in this region is now limited to chasing abu sayafs around the mindanao, which they are in the process of winding down...<br><br>you don't know where their "vital interests" will blow them next... our dealings with them has always been consistent but they are more than happy now to deal with other people as well... mahathir went to washington after 9-11, got a vip welcome and brought up the subject of more f-18s...<br><br>where they once banned arms sales to indonesia because of east timor, they now want to re-open channels of communications within the military and if congress allows, resume military exercises with them... surely a step towards resuming arms sales to gain the goodwill of moderate muslim leaders and preventing them from falling into the control of radical muslim elements...<br><br>Containment is very much alive now as the post 9-11 era brings back old uncertainties...<br><br>They won't abandon us yet, but they sure as hell aren't favouring us to a great extent where the other players are concerned...<br></div>
