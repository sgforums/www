While hardware aquisition is a key to any modernisation drive, training, doctrinal issues and integration of new platform in a overall concept of operations and logistic planning are crucial to using the hardware. If either one of this is missing or not properly plan and executed, then the hardware aquire will not translate into operation superiority.<br><br>Thus if u really thing that by aquiring the hardware is will ensure that u will gain the upperhand, then it shows that u dun really have much of a indept knowledge in millitary matter besides those technical spec which can be found on the books.</div>

RSAF F-16 crashed due to mid-air collision with another F-16, does that mean that the pilots who were involved in the mid air collision sucks? I don't think any Singaporean would so readily judge them so quickly.<br><br>We don't know about how the plane crashed. Could have been mechnical fault, could have been pilot's error, etc. However, I think it is better that the pilot eject (after failing to recover the plane and making sure the plane is not going to crash on somewhere it could do damage to human lives and property) than to go down with the plane.<br><br>Yes, RMAF had a few crashes here and there, but they are from different types, including the Mig 29. Other AFs have even more crashes and probaly even much higher crash per flight hour. Just look at how many accidents USAF has alone, look at the RAF, Russian AF, Indian AF, etc.<br><br>RSAF has been significantly blessed with incidentless, but nevertheless, this attribute to both the quality of the equipment and pilot skills. However, we cannot also discount that "luck" played a significant part.<br><br></div>

RSAF does have full air to air refuelling capabilities, the KC-135s are not for show, and they are the only dedicated tankers in the region. RMAF has tankers, sure.

Haha, what a joke. </div></blockquote>Since we are on the topic of refueling...a thought just popped into my mind. Am I correct to assume the refueling probes are different on the Su-27?...I do not think they are NATO complient. As such their refueling abilities are limited somewat.<br><br>RMAF tankers?....I believe you are refering to the KC-130, converted from existing C-130. RSAF long possess that ability. But with the KC-135 we are able to refuel all our fleet.<br><br>On the same theory, it would make the russian unfavorable in the fighter selection contest...that's unless we can modify it to accept NATO standard refueling probes?</div>

However, i beg to differ on your last point. It is not a matter whether the fighter can sustain itself on fuel, it is the training with the tankers that matter. Airborne tanking is not an easy task, and if not trained regularly it is arguably the most difficult task to perform while in the air. Sure, RMAF aircraft can sustain itself without the need for aerial refuelling for the most part, however they will thus lack that valuable capability as they lack the necessary training to perform it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The value of tankers in future air wars can never be underestimated. Look at the ops over Afghnistan now. US combat aircraft consistently need 5-7 refuelings PER mission to get to, loiter over and return from their targets. The tankers are vital force multipliers for air forces to become much more effective, and are literally worth their weight in gold.<br><br>IMO the RSAF has repeatedly proved its mettle in AAR ops. Almost every RSAF overseas exercises required tanker support (Pitch Black 2002 being the most recent example where one KC-135R supported 6 F-5s and 5 F-16Ds to Australia's East Coast). I don't know about the RMAF's AAR training on their 2 KC-130s, but as someone has pointed out, its something which requires constant practice to remain proficient at, especially in adverse conditions, having tankers for show is not enough.<br><br>I'm not too sure if Russian probes are compatible with Western baskets, but its not a real big deal to get new probes fitted to Russian jets. IIRC the RMAF's MiGs use a Western probe design, to be compatible with the KC-130s.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i would link Aerial refueling plane as a mothership and the fighter planes act as an interceptor or strike aircraft.During a strike i guess the fighter pliots can fly to its target or patrol the sky at an extended range.this capability allow singapore airforce to project some power overseas at least brunei which depends alot on singapore armed force to defend in case of emergency<br>Todays strait times wrote that malaysia is trading/acquiring F-18F hornet,my point of view is that RSAF might announce the fighter procurement before schedule which is said to be 2004 most prob the next Asian aerospace<br>held in singapore.<br>Most prob the new generation of F-18F could match singapore version of F-16.Technology wise it could be threating but i doubt the malaysia pliots will be able to climb on top of us in flight experience we are more experience<br>thought regular exercise and training with numerous top airforce cadet school Britain - US<br>SIngapore is involved in NATO EX making the only Non-Nato nation to  involve in this exercise.<br>If RMAF wants to be one of the best in the region lot of hardwork is needed and dun constrainting itself too much in the regional exercise<br>Your comment pls!!!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
