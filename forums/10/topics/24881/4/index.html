            <div class='col-md body'>foxtrout8's post is extremely one-sided (i did not say biased). He did not at all mention Singapore's defence with regards to the points he are making. Sure, MLRS is fearsome, but you cannot win a war with it. What you gonna do? Keep rocketing the opposing country? sooner or later the rockets will run out, by that time i think half of Johor will be overrun by Singapore already.</div>

Once again you did not interpret the messages correctly. An MLRS system in itself is a very fearful weapon. What makes it even more fearsome to civilians is that if it sucks, it will not hit its intended (military) target and hit a few civilian blocks instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Napalm? I believe thats a figuarative used by the poster. However I won't be surprised if we do have napalms, it is considered a conventional weapon. In order to really stop the RSAF from taking off, Malaysia would have to strike at every straight road which is more than 2 km long. Does that make sense to them?  Actually we have already stated many relevant points about Singapore's defence. The presence of US forces only serves to bolster our deterrence.<br><br>I am sorry but i cannot agree with your "if singapore is caught napping" scenario. Nobody in their right mind would strike another country "from nothing". Before a war there will always be severe political fallouts between 2 countries, or inherent geopolitical reasons (ie. Isreal).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
