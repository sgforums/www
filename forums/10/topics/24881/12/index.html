However, military readiness is hard to judge at times. By buying more arms, they are able to expand their orbat, theoretically "more ready", but that for the most part, isn't the case as we have discussed earlier. You can never tell when a potential crisis may occur, and how quickly it may escalate.<br><br>Second point - The point is mostly economic, however i do get your point on training people to new fields from a young age. Then again it doesn't factor for much in this discussion.<br><br>Third point - It is generally understood that Malaysia may not physically invade Singapore, however that does not mean their arms purchases mean no threat to us. Any arms purchases in the region has to be taken seriously. Also, we did not counter their arms purchases by buying arms that directly counter their latest aquisitions. Such an act amounts to an arms race. If you would look carefully, you will find that we are the ones that do the "market research" for them. We have more advanced equipment before them, and thus it seems that they are the ones countering our capabilities.<br><br>I don't really understand who the "we" in your post refers to, but I'll talk on it both ways.<br>"We" - the forum. Well, this is a forum afterall, and for the sake of discussion we have to bring up topics as far-ranging, yet relevant as possible.<br>"We" - The general population and the Government. This is even worse, the general population may not have much information as some of us here, and they definitely view every purchase as a threat. For the Government, like I've stated earlier, we cannot afford to be complacent.<br><br>As for your last line, we did not oppose to their training nor try to interrupt their arms purchases, we just kept quiet while they go on blabbering on what they are looking at.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh?  You are 11?  then who are the people you know in M'sia defence industry?  M'sia does not have much of a defence industry, definitely no where near Singapore's defence industry.

You can even not disclose that you are a Malaysian.<br><br>However, when engaging in a forum such as this, you chose to disclose that you are Malaysian and claim to be a part of the Malaysian defence industry.  We believe you since we have no other way of proving otherwise nor of checking up.<br><br>Now, you claim to be revealing the 'truth' when you tell us you are 11, and live in Petaling Jaya.  I therefore have every right to doubt what you have posted.  I therefore applaud you at your decision to avoid further posts in the future where possible as many people will hit back with more arguments and comments for every sentence you post and for all the info you claim true...  note that this has already started with this post of mine...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Exco<br><br>First point. Since you agree that military readiness is hard to judge, it is therefore important to strike a balance on what we can afford, what is "workable" and what is flashy. Is the MAF being extravagent (according to some forum members here) by buying the F18 and selling Palm oil in return ... I think not, but if we have to "counter" the F18 with more advanced stuff as the JSF etc .. it will definately cost us more treasure. I think the damage is done if we are on that kind of arms race footing.<br><br>Second Point. I am mainly interested in the current economic competiton between Malaysia and Singapore, not a real shooting one .. but I have to say, Malaysia has definately managed to beef up human capital better and faster than Singapore now. We rely on Ft to make up for lack of "ability" .. will it apply to our military? When we need foreigners to contribute to our creativity and productivity, we will also (by logic) need the same input into our military .. this is my concern if our SAF has a pool large enough to draw from.<br><br>Third point YES I agree with you on they copying us. .. but, they are being smart about it .. they are not buying the MOST expensive stuff on the block. They are also willing to discuss a barter trade (for palm oil) they are willing to look at alternate suppliers (South Korea and Poland) and they are also insisting on technoloigy transfer and building the thing in Malaysia (subs) So all in all who has a better policy?<br><br>We is the Singaporean people in general. I may be complacent in my knowledge of my military .. but I definately think that some of our well versed military folks have become totally complacent in our economy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kenhor, I see your point. However you must realise that our defence expenditures are entirely within the drawn boundaries, and in no way they have a "significant" impact on our economy. I understand you are worried that the economy may take a hit due to much attention and significance placed on the military. That is understandable, but like I've said above, it doesn't affect or economy by a large margin. The "impact", if any, has been calculated and weighed to see if any offsets are worth the money spent on the military.</div>

Since when do we buy the most expensive stuff? we could have gone for top of the line fighters, ie F15s, or expensive US frigates and destroyers. They are willing to discuss barter trade mainly because they CANNOT afford to pay in hard cash for their purchases, there is a difference. Singapore has also tech transfer as one of its requirements, however the US is not cooperating with Singapore on that issue, thus forcing us to source our armaments from other countries, namely France and more recently, Russia. Singapore Technologies has a division dedicated to building local military armaments. Our rifles, Missile Corvettes, Landing Ship Tank, Armoured Fighting Vehicles, amongst others, are all produced locally. So economically there is a balance. Policy? Malaysia's policy, to me, has always been "talk loud, talk big, never mind if we don't have the money."[/b][/quote]</div>
