            <div class='col-md body'>To exco<br><br>To many, our defence may seem to be within "acceptable" boundaries .. but I disagree .. our defence expenditure per GDP is a higher percentage than any of our neighbours. (I read this somewhere but I can't prove it .. hope that you can search this for me) And since our GDP is still higher than our nearest neighbour, this spending is more than theirs even in $ terms .. I do not think it neccessary as we are the defender. (of course, unless we become the aggressor, then that is a different story)<br><br>Now, we see also the Malaysian government spending on health, education, sports, transportation etc. They have created a middle class that is better off than us (car, house and golf club is no problem for them) In fact, statistics in AWSJ show that 60% of the vehicles sold in ASEAN is in Malaysia. Not to mention that house sales are at all time high, interest rates are low. They are just not improving their military but their whole quality of life. Our government are not keeping up on our other factors of our society as the same level as our military. Hence I feel that the military has been getting too much of our budget pie and hence the rest of the economy will suffer as a result.<br><br>Then we come to the story of procurement. If the enemy really plans to use their equipment, then of course they will be really buying reliable stuff. However, in my expirence in dealing with them, their number one piority is to get kickbacks. Their government may have to cough up 1 billion (500k cash and 500k oil palm) for 2 subs, but lots of the money will be diverted to a contracting company, it will also be used to get jobs. So in other words, their arms purchases are used not only for defence, but also to sell oil palm to new markets and also to create jobs (their new sub base in sitiawan definately employs lots more people than we think)<br><br>So I disagree with you that we are spending the right amount. i think we are overspending and that some of the budget can be diverted to provide better facilities to the poor, aged and needy.<br><br>Of course, if the Malaysians don't make noise when we spend the big bucks in OUR arms purchases, you know that we are dancing to their beat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok comparing singapore and malaysia defence spending i agree ours is so much high in terms of GDP percentage.Our massive military spending doesnt really effect singapore's economic i can say it is well balance economic and defense wise.Having a high defense budget can keep our country strong enough to deter enemy forces or maybe keep potential aggressor at bay knowing this is not some children play.Offensive is the best defense having a mighty force we can not only defence our homeland,we can even push them back into their  house,we could even storm their house if we have to!!<br>U cant compare the amount of cars singapore or malaysia have.<br>different country different road regulation it is not that we cant afford cars it is all that ERP...etc makes singaporean think  twice that is it worthwhile to buy one ??? In malaysia there is definitely much lesser road taxes..etc and car there are cheap compare with singapore.Secondly singapore has one of the world most well linked country we have bus services that link us to almost all part of singapore or to our doorsteps,we have MRT that transport us from one place to another swiftly,in the city we have buses that are free of charge..etc.These system make most of us feel unneccesary to<br>get a car.<br>A well to do defense industries do provide ample jobs for skilled the unemployed.When the defense industries is doing well it means there will be more foreign or local orders for defense equipments take for example RSN frigate which is still in construction not only it generated employment  singapore also gain technology from france DCN.this is what i call one stone kill two bird.See a huge defence budget can also have so many means of advantages<br>IF u are a singaporean u can see for yourself do u think malaysian governement is doing alots for their people comparing to singapore government .Their defense budget is no as high as ours and yet how much did they do for the malaysian no high speed train linking from North to South or anywhere else their people have to drive<br>and when they drive they are also generating money for their government  since car uses patrol fuel......<br>Look at singapore a country with high defense budget virtually all govt school are rebuild with the latest infrastructure computers..<br>new builds are build so student have ample space to study and develop their talents.Our standard of living is higher and we dun need to always fear that food  we eat outside could cause us food poisoning.........all these comes from our GDP.<br>That is y i said singapore defense  economic and socially are well balanced.</div>

Hence I feel that the military has been getting too much of our budget pie and hence the rest of the economy will suffer as a result.</blockquote>vehicle sales are high because it has become cheaper in real terms to own vehicles there while it has become prohibitively expensive to do so here, not necessarily (solely) because the people are getting a lot richer. its both a demand and a supply issue.<br><br>house sales are up because the malaysians are not the only ones buying houses and those buying them are not buying them to live in them. u are looking at real estate speculation, not real demand patterns.<br><br>interest rates are low because they need to stimulate spending to make up for falling investments and external demands. the long run result result of such a policy is inflation... there's never a win win situation in economics...<br><br><blockquote>However, in my expirence in dealing with them, their number one piority is to get kickbacks.

            <div class='col-md body'>Although you have addressed exco in your post, I would also like to voice some of my opinions in the form of a response to your post.<br><br>I agree that our large defence expenditure may seem unjustified to some people.  Its is also larger than that of our neighbours. However, if we just take a look at the defence capability of our nieghbours, they are not very impressive, are they?  Take Indonesia for example, how strong are they militarily?  While one may argue back that it is exactly the fact that our nieghbours are spending less on defence as the argument for Singapore to do the same, I would like to point out another case study: The Philippines.<br><br>The Abu Sayaff rebel group has run rings arond the Filippino miliary for sometime.and the Amerixans even have to step in to help them with this internal threat.<br><br>Many larger countries in the region spend little on defence because they do not have the capablity to do so.  Countries like this include Nam, Cambodia and Laos.<br><br>Malaysia is a different case.  They have spent alot recently on their military if you haven't bothered to read our earlier posts.  They also have a significant military capability.  However, while they are building a significant middle class, have you noted the policy of their government?  It is a very racist policy they have in palce there.  We should also consider the transparency of their government.  While the Singapore government also does not exactly tell its citizens everything, the Singapore government has a proven record for not being corrupted.  Also, would you review the situation and laws in the states in Malaysia ruled by PAS?<br><br>I haven't heard about how well their middle class is doing, but I don't see what is so bad about Singapore currently...<br><br>rushing my homework, well give better ans later if i think of one and i come back here...<br></div>
