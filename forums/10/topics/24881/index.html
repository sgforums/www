The truth is what you have said is absolutely spot on, but the equation does not end there.<br><br>Yes, RMN has ordered 2 of the most advanced conventional subs in the world, but RSN has more subs and they are not necessary that crapy too after the tropicalisation plus combat system updates.<br><br>You can almost think of the capabilities in sub warfare as on par between RSN and RMN. Two of the Challenger subs will equate to 1 Scopene sub.<br><br>However, by the time the Scopene subs are delievered, I'm confident that RSN will have a new sub design on the pipeline if not already building some.<br><br>If you are look at the anti-sub capabilities, RSN is slowly building this as well with the 12 current anti-sub ships, plus 6 more to come when the La Fayettes are delievered. Don't forget the La Fayette will also deploy anti-subs helos with dipping sonars/sona buoys.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if i remember correctly.. the RSN fokker 50 MPA enforcer also carry torpedos... plus harpoons... is it possible that the enforcer could also be modified for anti-sub like the P-3 orion?<br><br>anyway... i sincerely doubt malaysia buy 2 sub (only 2... my god) to challenge singapore... cos.. 2 subs are no good against the singapore army which will be marching up the NS highway of malaysia...<br><br>Secondly.. the RMN sub base is in sabah.... kind of a far to build base for subs aimed at singapore... dont you agreed?<br><br>but then... if the subs are aimed at defending malaysia's sprately claims... i must agreed it is an economical choice in view of the power of the PLAN... but is it a futile effort in view of the strength of the PLAN?<br><br>as we all know.. subs are slow (except for SSNs) against a sudden chinese dash for the sprately islands... i seriously doubt those 2 subs is gonna make the PLAN with its entire fleets and over 60 subs... cringe in fear....most likely... the chinese would laugh their tooth off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It won't be smart to get an aircraft carrier here...<br>1) the straits are too narrow for effective deployment.<br>2) the regional arms balance would be dramatically upset.<br>3) you may have a carrier, but do you have the planes to fight from it?<br>4) if Malaysia pays for its planes by palm oil, i dun see how they can support an aircraft carrier, much less a battle group.<br>5) Malaysia is generally regarded as a muslim country. If they do get a carrier, they would be under fire from the US.<br><br>I would admit that the Malaysian armed forces are in need of a restructuring, but from what i see, they may not have the budget to sustain such a high defence expenditure. The Scorpenes would already have taken up a huge part of the budget.</div>

Not many carriers in the world can carry conventional jets. The Russians after many years of building carriers still found it difficult to build conventional jet carriers. Malaysia with previously no experience in building any forms of carriers (helos or VTOL jump jets) build one that can carry the Hornets? Very impossible.<br><br>Sorry, you are incorrect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>automation can reduce the number of staff needed to man such ships. the singapore version of the lafayette frigate is a good case in point. a full sized frigate would take several hundred men to crew but a "smart" ship can cut that number down by as much as 1/2...<br><br>the problem of course, is that you make yourself vulnerable to electronic warfare if u do not shield your electronics properly...<br><br>nevertheless, i agree that aircraft carriers are a crappy idea in these waters.<br><br>a conventional one is beyond the capabiliities of most countries here and would suck up too much money to be worth the benefits.<br><br>the whole point of carrier is to project power far beyond your shores and jump jets don't do that very well... they'll be shot out of the sky with land-based aircraft.<br><br>thailand bought one for "surveillance and to support search and rescue operations" and its sitting in the dry docks now... thats a very valuable lesson everyone could learn from. they look good but they're expensive and unless u have a genuine need to cover vast expanse of maritime space (like the entire atlantic ocean =P), ultimately useless.</div>
