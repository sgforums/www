Given its IR or Active radar variants, the Mica family provides the most flexible BVR engagement possible. I can't compare it with the Russian missiles becos I am not as well verse in their missiles as the Western counterpart.<br><br></div>

At the most optimal launch parameter, ie. high attitude &gt; 30,000ft launch by a high speed (probably a Mach 1 or higher) aircraft, the most it has ever achieved is 75 km - that is when the missile literally fall out of the sky from no more energy. At best, it can do 50 Km on normal flight parameter, even shorter if the target are constantly changing course.<br><br>Secondly, why use Amraam instead of Sparrow... many reasons, they are:<br>1. Amraam is a lot smaller and lighter.<br><br>2. Amraam has an active radar, at approx. 15 km to the target (maybe even slightly further, the onboard radar kicks in). The mid course guidance is via data link and unlike Semi-active radar missiles like the AIM-7s, the fighter does not need to "paint" the enemy and thus opening itself to counter fire.<br><br>3. The -C version of Amraam has a much higher range than the previous A and B version, and depending on which C version, eg. C5, which has the longest range due to miniturising of radar and electronics component, and enlarging of the fuel and rocket.<br><br>Other thing I want to point out is that Mica has been tested at &gt; 60km by the Taiwanese (actually hit a drone at that range not drop out of the sky), thus the 28 miles figure is incorrect.</div>

The country is meanwhile studying options for the acquisition of an airborne early warning and control(AEW&amp;C) capability.<br><br>Malaysia's fighter competition had been shaping up as a two-way battle between the twin engined Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Sukhoi Su-30MKM. But Malaysian industry rsources say the single -engined Gripen will also be evaluated. Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad visited BAE System's Warton factory during his five-day trip to the UK in late February, say the sources. The UK manufacturer declines to comment.<br><br>The Gripen is gaining momentum n the export market following successes in the Czech Republic, Hungary and South africa.<br><br>Mahathir last week made an official visit to Russia, where he was expected to discuss potential industrialco-operation with Su-30MKM manufacturer Komosomolsk-naAmur Aircraft Production.<br><br>Boeing is also stepping up its campaign to secure Malaysia as the lauch export customer for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, although Kuwait has emerged as potentially the first buyer.<br><br>The Malaysian air force is expected to acquire an initial 16 aircraft and take options o eight, but industry sources suggest a desicion is unlikely to be taken soon due to budget constraint.<br><br>The air force operates eight two-seat F/A-18Ds Hornes and could return these to the US Navy in part-exchange for Super Hornets. It also has RSK MiG-29s.<br><br>Air Force commander Suleiman Mahmud meanwhile has been reported by local media as saying AEW&amp;C aircraft will be bought as part of the fighter purchase.<br><br>According to the local reports,Mahmud has said:"The proposed purchase of [AEW&amp;C] aircraft is a necessity to enhance the capacity of the air force." He did not specify which options were under evaluation, or when they would be purchased.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i thought M'sia always want twin engined aircraft?<br><br>Anyway, I haven't read about his until now.  I'm surprised Malaysian media didn't make big news of this too...<br><br>And yes, though this is news, Malaysian government defence news is, how should I put it... ... not very reliable.  I'll believe the news when Malaysia signs a contract or buys the planes.<br><br>Something interesting.  16 planes + 8 options = 24 planes<br>isn't Singapore also gonna purchase 24 planes thereabouts? (though not Gripen)<br></div>
