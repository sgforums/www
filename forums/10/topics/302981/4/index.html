            <div class='col-md body'>There are a lot of things you can do if you wanted to.<br><br>You can learn more about candidates by visiting their webpages, ask them questions on policies, let them think and answer and you can give feedback. Then you can publicize these sites so your friends can also go there and examine the views and decide if they wish to assist this candidate.<br><br>You don't have to be living in an opposition ward to volunteer your help to your candidate of choice to help them spread their message to the people in that ward.<br><br>Whether or not your ward is a walkover, you can still volunteer to help a candidate campaign if you believe his voice should be heard in parliament.<br><br>The more members from the opposition with like minds the stronger their voice in parliament.<br><br>If you wish the oppositions to field more candidates so you don't have walkovers, write to them to offer them help. It's not just money but also how much manpower they have at their disposal that shapes their decision on how many candidates they can field.<br><br>You can give your preferred candidate a better chance by assisting in the conducting of polls etc to determine what are the real issues facing our citizens so these candidates can address subjects that citizens wish to hear.<br><br>You can help your preferred candidate by researching such topics and giving them the necessary materials to back the veracity of your shared views and help keep your preferred candidate informed and up to date.<br><br>I'm not sure what the rules are for raising campaign funds but I'm sure you can assist there as well.<br><br>I'm sure there are many other ways you can get your preferred candidate exposure to give them a better chance to garner votes.</div>
