              <p>After repeatedly losing billions in bad deals like Micropolis, Shin Corp, Telcomsel, and lately
              UBS, Merryl Lynch, Barclay which are continuing more write-downs
              of asset values close to bankruptcy the citizens have lost confidence
              in our leaders in the quality of their decisions and management of GIC.</p>
              <p>The government has no mandate to invest their monies in such
              loss-making investments.<br> <br> Such investments are not authorized by the people so PM,
              MM, SM, ministers, and respective CEOs and professionals of GIC have to take care of people's monies and not lose any more of their monies.</p>
              <p>Those who fail to heed such trustees' fiduciary duty to exercise prudence and continue with such careless investments will have to
              be personally responsible for causing any further losses.</p>

              1. Finance Minister at fault for not watching GIC/Temasek closely. This one of medium importance coz FM not really the one in charge of operations. <br><br>Solution is to make GIC/Temasek to release quarterly finance reports and have them to explain their stocks and rebut critical views. Better if FM give a personal apology but no need to resign. <br><br>
              
              2. GIC/Temasek CEO at fault for being on auto pilot. As CEOs commanding super salaries, they are the ones responsible as the final check for anything and everything. So they must go. <br><br>
              
              Other ministers probably not at fault. I mean how can health minister chap finance?

              <p>After repeatedly losing billions in bad deals like Micropolis,
              Shin Corp, Telcomsel, and lately UBS, Merryl Lynch, Barclay which
              are continuing more write-downs of asset values close to bankruptcy
              the citizens have lost confidence in our leaders in the quality of
              their decisions and management of GIC.</p>
              <p>The government has no mandate to invest their monies in such
              loss-making investments.<br> <br> Such investments are not authorized by the people so PM, MM, SM,
              ministers, and respective CEOs and professionals of GIC have to
              take care of people's monies and not lose any more of their
              monies.</p>
              <p>Those who fail to heed such trustees' fiduciary duty to exercise
              prudence and continue with such careless investments will have to
              be personally responsible for causing any further losses.</p>

              <p>They cannot even resolve the simple issue between the carbox and the cheat-card.</p>
              <p>No one party is willing to conduct an thorough investigation to clear the matter for the poor soul that are being san-man.</p>
              <p>Is it that difficult to take responsibilty for the matter ?</p>
              <p>If they have no courage to take up responsibility for such a small matter, dun expect any one to be clear over such a big boo boo.</p>
              <p>I expect the final verdict of the card and box issue to be due to the laziness of the drivers to report the matter at 1st time so the cheng hu can react in time to solve the issue.</p>
              <p>So, the drivers are to be blamed for the honest mistake.</p>
