Far as IÂ’m concerned, itÂ’s a STUPID EVIL (moderated)!<br><br>I watched a video of parliament and I saw Hen (Manpower Minister Ng Eng Hen) denigrating a nation by mocking his own and other MP's, violating and belittling the intelligence of Singaporeans, insulting uncles like me for being too dumb to handle our finances, saying, "having a fling here, having a fling there".<br><br>I cannot believe that an overpaid manpower servant that we pay with our taxes thinks so lowly of his fellow citizens! A case of Â“kurang ajarÂ” or, in the hokien dialect which is pretty popular in Parliament now, Â“kiam kahÂ”!<br><br>If I remember well, when I started work as a teenager in 1968, I was told by my boss that 25% of my pay will go to CPF. He will contribute 25%. My boss said, Â“ThatÂ’s law, donÂ’t worry. Government guarantees youÂ’ll get it all back when you retire at 55Â”.<br><br>On reaching my retirement goal/age of 55, I was shocked that they have moved the goalposts many times since I started work at 1968. My money wasnÂ’t my money anymore.<br><br>Yes, there's Special, Medisave &amp; Retirement Account - SMRA - "You can't touch these!" A hip hop/rap song?<br><br>To be fair, I received my yearly CPF statements of the changes, but who reads? I did not.<br><br>Eight years ago I had a heart attack and ventricular fibrillation. I was jobless for seven years. Lately, I was suspected of having other health challenges and in the past months, I had my share of visiting polyclinics and hospital.<br><br>Poor rich! I'm rich enough to have more than $28,000 sitting in my Medisave Account BUT I cannot use it for tests, treatments and medicines in hospitals and polyclinics.<br><br>Yes, my bills from Changi General Hospital and Polyclinics had to be paid in cash from my pocket.<br><br>Oh, they tell me I can only use it if I spend more by visiting the hospital again for an artery ballooning/stent or a by-pass procedure.<br><br>Or maybe another heart attack and ventricular fibrillation caused by the agony and heartache of Â“My Money Sits in CPF but Cannot Use For Staying Alive!Â”; Â“They Use my $$$, Make A Profit, DonÂ’t Pay Back, Then Say I StupidÂ” &amp; Â“Not Enough, Want Some More, Force Annuity On My Children!Â”<br><br>Since nobody wants to employ a sick geezer with a heart condition and other challenges, I am fortunate that a kind soul, having faith, love and trust in me, offered me a sum of money to start a little business last year.<br><br>I registered a sole proprietorship in ACRA to start the little business. Another heartache - I was informed that I could not register because I owed CPF Medisave which I did not pay when I was self-employed previously.<br><br>Unless I pay up, I could not register my little business.<br><br>Imagine, I was broke and I still had to top up my Medisave (already loaded with &gt;$28,000) if I wanted a licence to make myself productive again. Simple: No Top Up, No Licence. This is what I know as Uniquely Singapore First World Standard of Whatever!<br><br>Another irony: After seven years of joblessness (due to my health challenges) without paying tax, I made good enough to pay tax again for year ending 2006. I've done my part as a citizen, I even did NS in the army from 1969 to 1971.<br><br>"Fend for myself"? I have. I pledge myself as part of Â“a united people regardless of race language or religion to build a democratic society based on justice and equality so as to achieve happiness, prosperity &amp; progress for our nationÂ”.<br><br>As a simple heartlander, IÂ’ve done my tiny part. No worries, I may just jump in front of moving MRT before I bother my busy hardworking government with any problem.<br><br>Question: What has the Government done for me? Zilch. . . and please donÂ’t do anything.<br>Whenever you do something for the good of the people, you cause me more pain than gain! Eg: PUB increase, 7% GST, Bus fares increase, etc. Just donÂ’t hurt my family further by forcing my children to pay for annuity which is another scam to leech from innocent citizens!<br><br>On second thought, you may want to upgrade my HDB flat with a Â“Go-And-Die-ChuteÂ” so that sick and old people like me who have outlived our usefulness to the regime can self-destruct by jumping into it.<br><br>Health Minister may like this idea as he wants me to die at home so that I will not be a bother or a burden to his money-making hospitals.<br><br>Based on the video, Mintsters just give us plenty of sarcasm and zero empathy. Just Mr. Hen talking cock!<br><br>Another wayang, another dayÂ’s work to justify obscene million dollar pay! The more they "strengthen the CPF", the worse our lives become.<br><br>... Please, denigrate us no more and stop treating Singaporeans like idiots! Let us live with dignity. Just because we are peace loving citizens does not mean that you can walk all over us.<br><br>Trying your luck too far may just change a push to a shove. Yes, even peaceful monks can turn into citizen activists. They are at it in Myanmar!<br><br>Do whatÂ’s honourable - Simply explain the difference in returns of GIC, Temasek and my hard earned CPF. Come clean with transparency!<br><br>My problems may have been less if the returns in my CPF had been on par or better than MalaysiaÂ’s EPF. Maybe part of the interest that could have been mine has ended up in the purchase of Manchester City Football Club. Am I co-owner now?<br><br>Thanks Kenneth for igniting the fire of a sick and tired Singaporean to write something on this disgraceful state of affairs<br>Sincerely,<br>Feed me to the Fish<br><br><a href="http://freedom-for-man.blogspot.com/2007/09/cpf-lies.html" rel="nofollow">http://freedom-for-man.blogspot.com/2007/09/cpf-lies.html</a></div>

Bush tries to persuade the U.S. Congress that some Social Security payments should go into a personal investment account, the island state of Singapore is grappling with an extreme version of what he has proposed.<br><br>Singapore's national pension program places every penny a worker contributes - 33 percent of total pay - into a personal account. Workers can choose whether to accept a guaranteed deposit rate from the government or chase higher returns in the property or stock markets. Called the Central Provident Fund, Singapore's program has succeeded in increasing home ownership and virtually eliminating the cost to the government of funding retirement by taxing the young.<br><br>But is the fund adequate for retirement? Not according to Leo Lim Tong, who after working 16 years as a hotel cook finds himself at 60 embarking on a career as a security guard at a local shopping center. The returns on the fund, known locally as CPF, he said, are "only a little bit, not enough."<br><br>Nor did it work for Shu Ting Hoe, a career banker who retired at 57 thanks to an early retirement package from his employer. "Depending on CPF alone, it's not enough to retire," Shu said.<br><br>When the governing party took control of a newly independent Singapore in 1965, it rejected the idea of a welfare system that would drain public coffers and adapted the fund system left by the British, expanding it to channel savings toward social goals.<br><br>doesn't purport to have a perfect system," Ng Eng Hen, the manpower minister, said. But he disputed the notion that the CPF provided inadequate returns.<br><br>Workers contribute 20 percent of their salary and their employers the equivalent of 13 percent, all of which goes into three accounts, including one for medical insurance and health care. Once workers reach the retirement age of 62, they can either take their savings as a lump sum or begin drawing it down in installments. If they have saved more than a minimum set by the government, they can begin withdrawing at 55.<br><br>The government pays a guaranteed interest rate on fund deposits that works out to about 3.4 percent. Depositors can also invest their savings in mutual funds, insurance products or, to a limited extent, in individual stocks. Whatever they contribute, as well as any interest or profit earned on their money, is tax-free.<br><br>Mukul Asher, an economics professor at the new Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy here, estimates that as many as 75 percent of fund members end up without enough to retire on and that the fund delivers on average less than 30 percent of the average depositor's last salary. That compares with 70 percent in France and 45 percent in the United States.<br><br>Economists say the government uses the fund as a fiscal tool, periodically changing the contribution rates the way a central bank changes interest rates. In the 1980s, the government pushed contribution rates as high as 50 percent to fight inflation. After the Asian financial crisis in the late '90s, it halved the contribution from employers, to 10 percent, effectively giving the entire country a pay cut.<br><br>Allowing members to withdraw their savings for such government-ordained investments opens another hole in retirement planning, economists say. Asher calculates that 70 percent of all funds deposited end up being withdrawn, often to buy property. In the 1960s, to enable its population to move out of slums, the government began allowing citizens to withdraw CPF savings to buy public housing. Singaporeans today withdraw more to pay for property than they do for retirement, a situation that leaves many asset-rich and cash-poor. Many are loath to sell, economists say, because property values have fallen by roughly a third in the past decade.<br><br>Ng said that most elderly property owners were sitting on profits that could fund their retirements. Cultural pressure to own and pass along a home dissuade many from selling, but "they can live with their children," he said.<br><br>Although caring for the elderly is part of traditional Asian values, critics of the system say relying on the young to care for the elderly amounts to just the kind of generational tax that Singapore's system was supposed to avoid.<br><br>Perhaps the most worrisome feature is the record on Singaporeans investing their own funds. According to Asher, CPF members on average lose 15 percent on their investments. When they pick individual stocks, they lose even more - about one-third.<br><br></div>
