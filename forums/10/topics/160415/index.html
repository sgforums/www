The matter of the sentence cuts is based on prevailing regulations and laws," Awaluddin said.<br><br>He said that according to the regulations, all prisoners who behaved well had the right to a cut in their sentence.<br><br>"This year, (we) will continue to accord the sentence cuts to those prisoners who meet the criteria," he added.<br><br>On August 17 Bashir's 30-month sentence was cut by more than four months to mark Indonesian independence day, triggering anger in Australia.<br><br>A Jakarta prison official has said Bashir may be among thousands of prisoners to receive sentence cuts to mark the main Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr later this week.<br><br>Foreign Minister Hassan Wirayuda earlier this month said the government was reviewing the presidential decree on remissions particularly concerning serious crimes, including terrorism, but he gave no more details or time-frame.<br><br>Under the remissions decree, prisoners who have served between six months and one year are eligible for a one-month sentence cut and those serving more than one year could get two months struck off.<br><br>Bashir on Tuesday condemned the latest Bali attacks, saying that bombings in non-combat zones would only claim innocent victims. - AFP/de</blockquote></div>
