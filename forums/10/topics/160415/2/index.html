If there were no violations, then it is certainly a political decision," he said, noting that sentence cuts are usually only not awarded if prisoners misbehave.<br><br>"If a foreign government can intervene in our legal system, where is our pride?" he said, referring to Australia's objections.<br><br>Bashir was arrested a week after the Bali bombings and first put on trial the following year, but the terrorism charges were thrown out. However he was then found guilty of immigration offences and jailed.<br><br>Police rearrested him in April last year as he left prison after serving the immigration sentence.<br><br>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer raised the sensitive issue of remissions with his Indonesian counterpart Hassan Wirayuda earlier this month during a visit to Bali.<br><br>Wirayuda said afterwards that he had assured Downer no further cuts would be given this year, but Indonesia's justice minister Hamid Awaluddin later said that they would go ahead as normal in line with the country's laws.<br><br>Bromo Setiono, the head of the Kerobokan jail in Bali, told AFP he was waiting for a response from Jakarta to his request that 18 militants imprisoned on the island for minor roles in the 2002 bombings receive remissions.<br><br>Three of the plotters are on death row elsewhere, as are two others jailed for life, who are ineligible for the cuts.<br><br>Under a remissions decree, prisoners who have served six months to one year are eligible for a one-month sentence cut and those serving more than one year could get two months struck off.<br><br>Bashir has condemned the latest Bali attacks of October 1, which claimed 20 lives and those of three suicide bombers, saying that bombings in non-combat zones would only claim innocent victims. - AFP/de </blockquote></div>

He did not divulge the religion of the girls.<br><br>The Kompas daily identified the pair as Siti Nurani -- an apparently Muslim name -- and Ivon, both aged 17.<br><br>It said the boarding house was a few metres from a police post and quoted witnesses as saying that after firing four shots, the assailants fled and were chased by police, with several more shots fired.<br><br>After the beheadings, about 400 police and 600 troops were quickly sent to Poso amid fears that the killings would reignite widespread religious violence that killed more than 1,000 people between 2000 and 2001 in the area.<br><br>A government-brokered truce was put in place in December 2001 but intermittent bombings, shootings and other attacks targeting Christians have continued.
