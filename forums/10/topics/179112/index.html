A person who dress sloppily maybe be a genius.  I feel that society placed too much emphasis on dress.

However, it does exploit ur own image too. see how ugly or how ill-mannered u r with ur dressing styles.<br><br>How a person dresses can be judged by anyone who observes.<br><br>However, it's none of your school's business. But in order to learn to respect, which is a virtue, dun make urself so stand-out n 'act cool' by dressing so Sloppily for ur school.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the public looks at the shirt itself, not how it's being dressed. if u see someone from "Laffles" tuck out their uni, would u think the sch reputation will be gone just like this? i believe how the students behave matters more than how they dress. scolding vuglarities, smoking, rowdy behaviours would reflect more on the poor image of the sch den how the students dressed. how about the sa students? u want them to tighten up their tie and looks like complete nerds or as the way is it now?</div>
