            <div class='col-md body'>like it or not, we gotta admit that sloppy uni dressing is becoming a fashion. tucking out of shirts, baggy pants, short skirts combined with fancy bags, accessories and shoes are how students getting rid of the dull schoolboys schoolgirls look. the way how students dress is how they differentiate from other students. as the "smart and neat" dressing do not appeal to them, they turn to sloppy dressing. well, if it's so, why not? however, if they put up an ah beng ah lian appearance, tt's another matter. firstly, does sloppy dressing really protray a bad image of the student? personally, i dont think so. to me, it's just another way of dressing, nth else. secondly, if students like how they dress, their self-confidence will grow and when self-confidence grows, the students can accomplished many things. u may laugh, but this is true, apply this to urself and see. lastly, sloppy dressing is and does not cause any social problems, so why are u complaining?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Also, what is an image of a good student? SO what if they dress slopply. Does that mean a good result student cannot have other dress sense. This is what is wrong with society i think, all too often people just look on the surface of stuff, ok here is a clean look smart looking person, handsome too and judge the person as good thou he may be a pevert or serial killer. A person who dress sloppily maybe be a genius. I feel that society placed too much emphasis on dress. If there is no such constraints, so much more resources can be saved if we don't need to wear tie or jacket, or leather shoes. Just what we feel comfortable in.</blockquote>Very well said...I think uniforms must be the lamest invention ever. Uniforms does not make us look like students at all...it make us look like nerds. People from the university does not wear uniform, but generally, they look like students and not nerds in every way to me.<br>Uniform serves no purposes. The same school that teaches us that we should not judge other people by their physical appearances or dressing told us that we should try to look smart and presentable to the society so that we have a higher chance of leaving a good impression and have a higher chance of being accepted to whatever organisation we may apply for.<br>And I don't think wearing the school uniform sloppishly reflects badly of the school, because at least sloppish uniform looks nicer that uniform tucked ALL THE WAY IN!!!<br>Don't laugh...my secondary school did make us tuck our uniform all the way in...in a sense all of us looked like retards as a result.<br>Besides...do we really represent the school when we don't even belong to the school at all? It is the school's 'tai ji' if their reputation is tarnish, not ours...student will be staying in that school not for long anyway......</div>

I once asked a group of secondary school students whether uniforms are a good idea or not... and I was really surprised to see some answer Yes.. and one of their reasons was this... that students from low income family could have a standard garment to come to school without worrying that what they wear is not acceptable to their peers, also, when they come to school they shouldnt be thinking about choosing WHAT to wear everyday.<br><br>As for wearing uniforms sloppily and looking better.. honestly I thought that way too.. hurhuhur when I was 18... but having a 10 years additional experience, I am aghasted at how horrible it must have looked then.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... I still dress sloppily... but I think as you come out and work... your tastes change.<br><br>You can look reasonably good when you are dressed sloppily if your attire is MEANT to be casual - jeans, cut off shorts, tshirts. I love t-shirts with shaggy edges and all that. And if I can get away with wearing beach sandals to work, I do that. (actually I just wear a tshirt and 3/4 pants with beach sandals to work hurhurhur)<br><br>But while I think that wearing ur uniform tucked out and all that is more COMFORTABLE (I won't say folding the waist a few times to make your skirt shorter is comfortable. I also won't say that letting your long hair down and feeling damn freakin hot under the collar is comfortable - you PRETEND it is comfortable, but you suffering cos you think it looks better)... to think that it LOOKS BETTER is not true.<br><br>It MAY look good on people who are ALREADY good looking, but then, good looking people look good even in leotards! And for the rest of us, who can't claim to be good looking, heheheheh .... I guess what I have learnt in those years to trust the sheer force of my personality to assert itself, and don't need to try TOO hard in other ways cos hor... ultimately, it's confidence that matters. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I once asked a group of secondary school students whether uniforms are a good idea or not... and I was really surprised to see some answer Yes.. and one of their reasons was this... that students from low income family could have a standard garment to come to school without worrying that what they wear is not acceptable to their peers, also, when they come to school they shouldnt be thinking about choosing WHAT to wear everyday.<br><br>As for wearing uniforms sloppily and looking better.. honestly I thought that way too.. hurhuhur when I was 18... but having a 10 years additional experience, I am aghasted at how horrible it must have looked then. Heng all those who saw me in it also grow up liao <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> so we are all in the same conspiracy.<br></div></blockquote>yea...to add on to that...some people might wear clothes just to attract attention etc...more work for the discipline master/mistress to decide which types of clothes are suitable...maybe in uni they are more matured so they are given the benefit of wearing their own clothes?</div>

Uniform serves no purposes. </div></blockquote>So far, 11yrs (12 if u wana include this yr) of wearing uniform is not a chore. Can u imagine waking up every morning to think "what to wear today?" I think the school doesn't want us to give another excuse for being late.<br><br>Uniform can add on the safety. The Columbine High School massacre highlights a pretty simple thing. A normal outfit of t-shirt and jeans can allow u to store abt 5-6 guns. Outsiders with ill intentions can easily enter the school compound if there was no uniform. Afterall, he looks like everyone else.<br><br>Schools are supposed to keep us safe. We should allow schools to have such a loophole.<br><br>Then u can say, schs can hire guards and etc. But how safe will be? Look at the guards in ur sch and come to a conclusion.<br></div>
