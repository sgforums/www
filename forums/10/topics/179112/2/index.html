            <div class='col-md body'>I think from the way u dress, we can come to a close conclusion of how a person behaves. Eg, untidy hair = lazy. Lazy to go cut hair, occasionally, it's the prices that affects students. And for uniform, hhmm, linked to attitude?<br>I feel that the un-tucking of uniform show that u are full of attitude (negative sense), so parents ultimately don't wnat their child to mix with bad attitude ppl, hence, spoiling the school image.<br><br>Many schs have resolved the problem by redesigning their uniforms. Some examples includes fully tuck out designs or the folding-in design. Hassle free.<br>BUt abt short skirts and baggy pants, i have nth to say ...</div>

And they will shout across the road to ask u to tuck in ur shirt, telling the public abt the sch discipline problems. ...<br><br>Abt ties, a simple idea is to ask the school to adopt clip ties. Then on one would have a excuse abt the weather is too hot. On the flipside, lazy students are produced.<br><br>The uniform, ultimately, does no represent the school. It represents U, cos u are wearing it. If a person sees a student (with untuck shirt or short skirts, etc) from afar. The 1st impression is on the student himself (or herself). SImply , the person may not be able to recognise the uniform from afar. It is only at near distance when the school is probably recognised, and thus spoiling the image of the school. However, the image of the student has already been spoiled b4 that of the school.<br><br>If they say "1st impression counts", y are u spoiling ur own 1st impression ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>According to the Oxford Dictionary, definition number one of the word Â“schoolÂ”, is, simply, Â“a place where children are educatedÂ”.<br><br>A school is simply a place where children are educated, and that it is every schoolÂ’s mission to nurture their students into fine adults with knowledge, intellect, as well as high moral integrity.<br><br>Now, how then does the preservation of the schoolÂ’s image comply with this mission statement? As far as the students are concerned, they go to a school to learn, and not to be forced into comforming to rules on attire. I am questioning the very basis of this argument that poor attire tarnishes the school's reputation. Is there really a need for schools to uphold an image to others?<br><br>By meeting out standards and expectations on uniform, on hair length.. the MOE is constantly trying to improve the education system to nurture the creativity of students. yet they fail to see that creativity is not something that can be taught, and the only way to nurture creativity is to provide the environment for it. if students are not given the basic freedom to exercise creativity in their dressing.. meeting out standards for hair and attire, hair must be combed neatly, channels clear, sideburns shaved, etc.. it is probably going to be hard to see any results.<br><br>And even in taiwan, the govt has already moved away from tradition and abolished rules regarding hair and attire in schools. why cant sg learn from them?<br><br>As an organization a school has and reserves the right to meet out various rules and expectations for their students. and like in all other organizations, all members have no choice but to abide by the rules set in order to remain part of it. However, what I am trying to say here is my personal opinion, that rules should be set with the sole purpose of aiding the schools in achieving their mission of educating and nurturing students, and that no school will become any less or worse and educational institution if the rules on attire and hair are abolished.</div>

But if not, no need. You are not liable for that rule anymore!</div>
