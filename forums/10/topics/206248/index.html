These are the big cities and provinces in China. But in the ASEAN 10, we lead almost in every category, including government, institutions, economic environment and social environment.<br><br>"But when it comes to business environment, we are equal to Malaysia and the point I want to make is that we cannot cut our wages to match Malaysia. Our competitiveness is not in cutting wages.<br><br>"We can move up the manufacturing ladder, but there is an extent that we can do and in the longer term, I still think services will give Singapore the biggest spin-off where our standard of living can be maintained."<br><br>In the ASEAN category, Malaysia and Thailand came in second and third respectively, but it was Vietnam which surprised, by beating Philippines and Indonesia to the 4th place.<br><br>According to the World Bank, which sponsored part of the survey, the gap was starting to narrow.<br><br>Peter Stephens, Singapore Representative, World Bank, said, "...the role of innovation and creativity and entrepreneurship going forward...these are areas that the government focuses heavily on and that there is a lot of discussion on. And for Singapore to continue to lead the pack and be the successful and prosperous economy that it is, these are areas where there is going to need to be increased attention."<br><br>Among Indian states, Maharashtra was ranked 8th in the government and institutions segment. - CNA/ms</div>
