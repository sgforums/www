            <div class='col-md body'>Sunday May 20, 8:17 PM<br>PM Lee launches Singapore Kindness Week<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>SINGAPORE : All the efforts put in to transform Singapore into a vibrant global city will be in vain if there is no social development, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<br>Launching the 10th Singapore Kindness Week on Saturday, Mr Lee also shared findings from a survey on what constitute kind and courteous behaviour.<br><br>The courtesy jingle and the Singa mascot would be familiar to many people.<br><br>And this year, the Singapore Kindness Movement is putting a new spin to an old message by jazzing up the song.<br><br>It has also conducted a survey of 1,000 Singaporeans and expatriates to find out what being kind and courteous mean.<br><br>Speaking at the event, PM Lee said one of three key findings is the simple act of greeting one another.<br><br>And minding your please and thank you's.<br><br>Another is to be considerate, like giving way to others or giving up seats to those who need them more.<br><br>Acts like clearing the table and returning food trays after a meal are also appreciated.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "As we grow and globalise, the values of care, compassion and neighbourliness will become even more important. No society can survive, let alone prosper, if its people are only concerned with pursuing material wealth. Kindness is the thread that runs through our social fabric, making it stronger and more cohesive."<br><br>And although the Kindness Movement has made good progress over the last 10 years, everyone must continue to do their part to work towards a more gracious society.<br><br>PM Lee said: "We can't legislate courtesy and kindness by law. You must smile, otherwise $5 fine. You must laugh, otherwise $10 fine. The government can encourage and promote but the people have to respond and to practise, and so set the right general tenor of behaviour in society."<br><br>More than 100 examples of such kind behaviour were published in the second edition of a book of kindness stories.<br><br>The Prime Minister himself contributed a story as well.<br><br>Mr Lee shared how he and his wife were touched by the thoughtfulness of a satay man in Malacca.<br><br>They had ordered 40 sticks of satay but the experienced hawker only served them 25 sticks, as he knew that would be enough.<br><br>Over 400 kindness-related activities and programmes will be held across the island throughout the week to encourage people to make kindness a habit and put a smile on someone's face. - CNA/ch<br><br>Ha ha ha, kindness also means to be considerate and not greedy.    Is he a good/excellent choice to speak for kindness movement/week?</div>

No society can survive, let alone prosper, if its people are only concerned with pursuing material wealth. Kindness is the thread that runs through our social fabric, making it stronger and more cohesive."<br><br>And although the Kindness Movement has made good progress over the last 10 years, everyone must continue to do their part to work towards a more gracious society.<br><br>PM Lee said: "We can't legislate courtesy and kindness by law. You must smile, otherwise $5 fine. You must laugh, otherwise $10 fine. The government can encourage and promote but the people have to respond and to practise, and so set the right general tenor of behaviour in society."<br><br>More than 100 examples of such kind behaviour were published in the second edition of a book of kindness stories.<br><br>The Prime Minister himself contributed a story as well.<br><br>Mr Lee shared how he and his wife were touched by the thoughtfulness of a satay man in Malacca.<br><br>They had ordered 40 sticks of satay but the experienced hawker only served them 25 sticks, as he knew that would be enough.<br><br>Over 400 kindness-related activities and programmes will be held across the island throughout the week to encourage people to make kindness a habit and put a smile on someone's face. - CNA/ch<br><br>Ha ha ha, kindness also means to be considerate and not greedy.    Is he a good/excellent choice to speak for kindness movement/week? </blockquote>In the entire lot of drivel, there's only one significant portion comprising 8 words. That, in essence, sums up what the whole mouthpiece - and the regime - is about...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
