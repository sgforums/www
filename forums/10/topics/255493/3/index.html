            <div class='col-md body'>Is increasing the cost of medical products an act of kindness?<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s healthcare system - uniquely Singapore? (Part 2)<br>Leong Sze Hian<br>F6.February 2007 - DRUGS LICENSING:<br><br>On the licensing and registration fees for medicinal and cosmetic products, before 1991, there were hardly any fees payable for the registration of medicinal products. When registration began in 1991, the per product licence fee was $66 a year.<br><br>Since a new regulatory agency was created a few years ago, the fees have increased to $80, $100, $120, $360, $750, and up to $77,500 per first year, in 1992, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2006 and 2007 respectively.<br><br>Not counting 2007, this fees increase was at a compound rate of 18 per cent a year, for the last 15 years until 2006.<br><br>This has resulted in pharmaceutical businesses reducing their product lines and is also a deterrent to expanding their product ranges in Singapore. The higher costs are also being passed on to consumers. More Singaporeans are buying from Johor Baru and neighbouring countries.<br><br>For example, the price of Norvasc 5mg tablet box of 30 for heart condition and Lipitor 10mg is $28.70 (RM65) and $55.30 (RM125) in Johor Baru, compared with $75.20 and $96, respectively, in Singapore.<br><br>To put this in perspective, according to the ChannelNewsAsia programme, War on Cancer, on Feb 11, the cost of cancer drugs has gone up 500-fold over the last decade.</div>
