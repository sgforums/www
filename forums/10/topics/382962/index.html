              <h3 class="post-title entry-title">UK Elections versus Singapore GE<br></h3>
              <div class="post-body entry-content">I was listening to BBC sometime last week and was surprised that the
              newscaster announced that the UK election will be held in 2010 (I had
              forgotten if they mentioned any specific date). However with the
              advance of then Internet, I google the UK election 2010 and great
              wealth of related links appeared.<br><br>What makes me feel that the British,<span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span>are more open about the election date as it can be found in their official website of the Electoral Commission.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">UK Electoral Commision</span><br>A look at the "About Us" said a lot about the function of the Electoral Commission:<br><br>"We are <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">an independent body</span> set up by the UK Parliament. Our aim <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">is integrity and public confidence</span> in the democratic process.<br><br>We work to:<br><br>* register political parties<br>* make sure people understand and follow the rules on party and election finance<br>* publish details of where parties and candidates get money from and how they spend it<br>* set the standards for running elections and report on how well this is done<br>* make sure people understand it is important to register to vote, and know how to vote<br>*<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000;"> <span style="color: #000000;">make sure boundary arrangements for local government in England are fair</span></span>"<br>(Source: <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/about-us">http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/about-us</a>)<br><br>UK citizens living abroad can also <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/british_citizens_living_abroad.aspx">vote via Post or Via Proxy</a>! This sort of method of election is seem unthinkable in Singapore :)<br><br>The UK Electoral Commision even publish the latest possible date "Thursday 3 June 2010" in its <a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/faq/elections/what-is-the-last-possible-date-for-a-general-election">website</a>.
              I clicked on the 2 PDF documents in the page, Parliamentary election
              timetables &amp; Election timetables in the United Kingdom, it will
              tell the reader how the election commision come about setting of the
              election and the processes if the PM calls for elections.<br><br>The Election Commision will give -27 Day prior to polling day. The various political Parties in UK have 27 days to prepare.

              It has the responsibility of planning and preparing for, and managing
              the conduct of Presidential and Parliamentary elections and of any
              national referendum in Singapore. The Department has under its purview
              the Registry of Political Donations (RPD). The RPD administers the
              Political Donations Act, the objective of which is to prevent foreign
              interference in the domestic politics of Singapore through funding."<br><br>Fair and Square? I do not think so!<br><br>They
              do not generate an Annual Report compared to that of UK. It will not be
              necessary since its under the PMO's control. Any reports will be the
              PM's eyes only right? I am not sure how the 66.6% look in the report in
              2006, typeface 1?</div>
