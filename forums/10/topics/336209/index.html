              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Dhevarajan Devadas / Guest Writer</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 3px solid black; margin: 13px; float: left;" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/World/bolhl240.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="160"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">On November 4, we all witnessed history being made. The </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">US</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> elected its first ever black president. A nation that once regarded its
              black citizens as slaves has elected an African American to the
              nation’s highest office. I salute Mr Obama for his inclusive and
              positive campaign that has invigorated the normally apathetic youth
              voters to come out in droves to exercise their democratic right to vote.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">His <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2008/11/president-elect-barack-obamas-victory-speech/">victory speech in Grant Park</a>, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Chicago</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">, struck a chord in me with its message of inclusiveness and bipartisanship. I find this severely lacking in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> PAP leaders don’t really bother with campaigning really hard and
              fighting for votes. </span></strong>They appeal to Singaporeans to support them during
              campaigning <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and then spend the next five years talking down to us,
              making important decisions without meaningful consultation (remember
              the casino issue?) and chiding us for expecting the government to help
              when we are in a crisis (minibonds and high notes issue).</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">While
              Obama vows that “to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn -
              I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help,
              and I will be your President too”, former PM Goh Chok Tong openly
              threatened constituencies that voted for the opposition that their HDB
              estates would “become slums”. His exact words were, “Your [housing
              development] through your own choice will be left behind. They become
              slums. That’s my message”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">He
              said this on Nomination Day in 1996. He had the audacity to threaten
              Singaporeans because he was confident that Singaporeans would not
              complain too aggressively against such blatant discrimination and would
              vote for the PAP anyway.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Obama
              also graciously thanked his opponent John McCain for his
              congratulations and promised to work together with him in the future. I
              can only dream that PM Lee can thank his opponents for a worthy and
              challenging campaign. He is highly unlikely to stand in a rally and
              say, “I thank my worthy opponents from [insert political party] and
              promise to work closely with the opposition to ensure the progress and
              prosperity of this nation which we all call home”. PAP leaders are
              never really gracious anyway.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The PAP titled its 2006 election manifesto “Staying Together, Moving Ahead”. But it has failed to live up to this promise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">1. It has denied our gay community the right to equality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">2. It has failed to ensure that the rights of all Singaporeans to freedom of speech, assembly and association are protected.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">3.
              It has failed to keep the population informed by not disclosing
              information such as GIC and Temasek Holdings’ full financial records,
              the breakdown of HDB flat costs and even the financial statements of
              town councils that invest our money.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">4.
              It has denied the rights of Potong Pasir and Hougang residents to
              public housing upgrades available to PAP constituencies, violating
              their right to equality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">5. It has prevented non-PAP politicians from playing a decisive role in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> politics by trying to create and maintain political hegemony. This
              denies Singaporeans our right to take part in public affairs and
              isolates us from the political space and process.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">PAP leaders, especially MM Lee, love to claim that the Western model of democracy is bad for </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> as it is too individualistic and that </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">’s
              model safeguards the welfare of society as a whole ahead of the
              individual. Barack Obama has shattered this lie. He has shown that when
              the situation demands it, Americans can and will elect a president who
              promotes the welfare of society as a whole while at the same time
              protects their fundamental liberties.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Obama is promising to do in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">America</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> what the PAP has consistently failed or refused to do in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">.
              As a Singaporean youth who will be eligible to vote in 4 years time, a
              message of hope, inclusiveness and change appeals to me more than the
              message of political restrictions, blatant discrimination and threats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">I await </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">’s Obama and our moment of change.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Historic. Inspirational. Change.<br><br>These are the words used to describe Mr Barack Obama's election as the 44<sup>th</sup> President of the United States.<br><br>Historic
                              because only a few decades ago, black people were not even allowed to
                              occpupy the front of the bus, let alone the White House.</p>
              <p>The Reverend Jesse Jackson who was at the side of Dr Martin Luther
                              King, Jr when he was slain by a sniper's bullet watched Mr Obama give
                              his victory speech with tears streaming down his cheeks.<br><br>Inspirational
                              because Mr Obama reached across a broad section of American society and
                              appealed for support across the demographics of race, age, gender, and
                              class. He called on the better nature of his fellow citizens to support
                              his message of hope for a better America and a better world.<br><br>But
                              of the three, change is what most signifies this election. It is the
                              one most important thing that Americans wanted in electing their new
                              leader. The faces of anticipation and determination as voters stood in
                              line, many for hours, just to cast their ballot; of awe as they
                              realised the historic nature of the election; and of jubilation as they
                              heard their President-elect invite them to “join in the work of
                              remaking this nation.”<br><strong><br>Elections, true democratic elections, are
                              more than just choosing between politicians. The ability to get
                              involved in the process, to campaign for the party you support, to
                              openly congregate to debate the issues, and finally to see your vote
                              make change is gratification that defies quantification.</strong><br><br><strong>It
                              builds pride in one's country and support for the institutions that
                              provide stability. It bonds a people, it encourages change.</strong><br><br>Can we in Singapore find anything to learn from all this? Listen carefully and we just might:<br><br>“And
                              to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn,” the new leader
                              says, “I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I
                              need your help. And I will be your president, too.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore, our
                              government refuses to build lifts that stop on every floor for the
                              elderly because one of its candidate is not voted in.</strong></span><br><br>Mr Obama
                              points out that the “true strength of our nation comes not from the
                              might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring
                              power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding
                              hope.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore, our leader measures his success by the number of
                              billions he accumulates in the reserves.</strong></span><br><br>The new president
                              exhorts his people to look forward to the future because change “cannot
                              happen if we go back to the way things were.” The true genius of
                              America, he extols, is that "America can change."<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In Singapore, when we
                              talk of change our government never fails to remind us of the Maria
                              Hertogh and Hock Lee bus riots that happened more than half-a-century
                              ago.</strong></span><br><br>America elects a 47-year-old leader who promises: “I will
                              listen to you, especially when we disagree.” <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In Singapore, we prop up
                              an 85-year-old who declares: “We do what is right, never mind what the
                              people think.”</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>In America, people come together to argue, to
                              celebrate, and to change. In Singapore, the police arrest you and the
                              judges imprison you.</strong></span><br><br>While Americans take pride in their vote
                              and protect that right jealously, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>we in Singapore look nervously over
                              our shoulders and wonder whether our votes can be traced.</strong></span><br><br>While Mr Obama lifts up his people: “Yes we can,” our government pounds down: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“No you cannot!”</strong></span><br><br>While
                              Americans tonight all over the world celebrate their nation,
                              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singaporeans cannot wait to leave theirs and our youths profess no
                              loyalty to this island.</strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Fifteen years ago, I wrote a book called <em>Dare To Change</em>.
                              I warned that without change we will pay the price of progress. Fifteen
                              years hence, our government continues to refuse contemplating change.</strong></span><br><br>Change.
                              It's not just a word, it is the key to survival. Americans know it, the
                              world knows it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But Singaporeans are still too frightened to embrace it
                              and fight for it.</strong></span><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>But change is one of those things that will
                              seek us, even if we don't seek it. The difference is that when change
                              comes involuntarily, its consequences don't bring promise.</strong></span></p>
