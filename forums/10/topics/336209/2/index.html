              <p>change is a key to survival only when you need to adapt to a new situation which requires a new set of skills. not any how change like underwear. americans only knew it after 2 terms of bush. and they have someone to actually vote for.</p>
              <p>in singapore, opposition don't have enough respectable or capable candidates to go around. change at most means change for the worse. you give me 2 choices, both incompletent but one with less resources who you want us to choose? a slimeball with money or a clown that keeps going to jail?</p>
              <p>if you really want change why not you try your theory on me?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> you come up with the money and people then vote me in. also change right?  i get mp pay, i do same things as previous mp but reduce most of the fees, straight away win win already better off under me liao. this type of change you want?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>to change, i didn't know we need to spend (b)illions of dollar. just to keep it factual, how many billions did mccain and obama spent? pls enlighten.</p>

              <p>As at August, Barack Obama raised $603,220,081, Hillary Clinton $247,793,590, John McCain $357,773,218 and Mike Huckabee $16,459,632 for their respective campaign.</p>
              <p>Corazon Aquino had hundreds of thousands of people on the streets against the military of Marcos, anybody in Singapore can command that kind of calling? some sports organisers have done that, not politicians!</p>
              <p>Nelson Mandela spent decades in jails, his calling for clear: end of apartheid. Singaporeans are waiting for a calling that can convince us. We don't have to vote for the PAP, but to whom do we vote? may be CSJ or Poh Ah Pak or AndrewYPYap or all three of them should go to jail first. But, Nelson Mandela did not win on sympathy.</p>
              <p>How all of them made the change? observe, reflect, and infer....but there are some rules to note:</p>
              <p>When nobody listen to what you say, the reflection is on you, not the audience.</p>
              <p>When nobody follow where you are leading, then you fail to be the leader.</p>
              <p>Is there free lunch in this world? I hope there is for some poor people, but certainly not for politicians.</p>

              <p><br>Thats a serious problem with SG ... people not caring about politics.... and i partly blame the govt and the economy for that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Govt bcos they have stifled competition to the pt where people dun have a choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Economy bcos the competitiveness of Singapore combined with the paltry wage of the lower income group creates an atmosphere where people care more about $ then western cultures. Those of you that studied degrees should remember Maslows hierachy of neeeds.... politics is placed with less priority cos the basic security of having enuf $ isnt there yet.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans are people who don't dabble in politics. They just want to earn their money and enjoy life. Why bother about other people's lives? When was the last time you went to community event? We are working for ourselves, not anyone else. Who cares about politics if it doesn't concern our daily routine? Ergo, Singaporean's are conservatives that doesn't want things to break their daily rountine.</p>
