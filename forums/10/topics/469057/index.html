The answer to this was a stern no. Too much social welfare, as we all know, leads to laziness, communism, and Satan worship. Or even worse, voting for the Opposition. Besides, <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/hdb-is-not-making-money-out-of-building-homes-says-national-development-minister-khaw-boon-wan-1">HDB loses a billion dollars a year as is</a>.

              <p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Uh, guys? I’m not sure ‘Top Spender’ is an <em>award</em> category.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <h4 class="h-underline" style="font-size: 14px;">HDB’s Losses: Not Surprised. Not Even a Bit.</h4>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">We’re not amazed by the loss, and we’re not moved by it either. See, we remember HDB announced losses before, in April ’08. Back then, HDB claimed a loss of <em>$2 billion</em>. So actually, the deficit is shrinking.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">And anyway, HDB has never hidden its losses. That’s what their <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/HDB%20suffers%20S%242b%20deficit%20(Channel%20NewsAsia)">financial reports</a> claim most of the time.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">(Bet you thought those reports were secret. But no, there they are in the open, where anyone with a web browser and more patience than God can understand them*).</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">But the most important reason we don’t care (and neither should you) are:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em>*They’re vaguer than Matrix Reloaded. On page 53, for example, dividend income is listed as coming from “unquoted subsidiary” and “others.” And the only “breakdowns” happen on the 114th attempt to make sense of the accounting.</em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <ul style="margin: 0px; list-style: none;">
              <li style="margin-left: 15px; list-style-position: inside;">Most of that money isn’t actually “lost”</li>
              <li style="margin-left: 15px; list-style-position: inside;">It’s a terrible counter-argument anyway</li>
              <li style="margin-left: 15px; list-style-position: inside;">HDB is not a company</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <h4 class="h-underline" style="font-size: 14px;">1. Most of that money isn’t actually “lost” </h4>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/SG_AFTP_MoneySmart_NEW/5761835748_159ffac2ef_n.jpg"><img class="editorial" style="background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;" title="HDB with lightning bolts behind it" src="http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/SG_AFTP_MoneySmart_NEW/5761835748_159ffac2ef_n.jpg" alt="HDB with lightning bolts behind it" width="320" height="240"></a>
              <p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A billion was easy. For our next trick, we’ll make your entire flat disappear.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The Singapore government’s land is handled by the SLA (Singapore Land Authority). When HDB needs to build flats, it pays to acquire the land from SLA.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Thing is, HDB has to pay market rates*. That is, they pay the same price a private developer would. But unlike private developers, HDB also has to subsidize the cost of flats. This inevitably leads to a loss: The land is purchased at a much higher price than proceeds from the flats can cover.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">But while HDB takes a loss, the Singapore government as a whole <em>doesn’t</em>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">However much HDB pays for the land, it’s still paying much of that money to <em>another government body</em> (SLA). So HDB’s “losses” are more like a monetary<em> transfer </em>than an expenditure. And if you ask some angry flat buyers, that transfer seems to be from their wallet to the government coffers.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><em>*At least, it’s now <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/hdb-is-not-making-money-out-of-building-homes-says-national-development-minister-khaw-boon-wan-1">claimed</a> that HDB pays market rates for land and construction costs. We don’t know the actual prices. </em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <h4 class="h-underline" style="font-size: 14px;">2. It’s a terrible counter-argument anyway</h4>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/SG_AFTP_MoneySmart_NEW/3058853238_7c110dd67f_n.jpg">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="clear: both; float: none; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 11px; display: block; width: 310px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-11770" style="display: inline; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;" src="http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/d3Y9FcdT9uJzvPd0hLpuUQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTMxMA--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/SG_AFTP_MoneySmart_NEW/3058853238_7c110dd67f_n.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="233"></span></p>
              </a>
              <p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">As long as they meet our dress code, anyone can visit our archives.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">There are two reasons the billion dollar loss is a terrible counter-argument.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">First, it suggests it’s impossible for HDB to ever exclude land costs, or to give many more subsidies. Any more and our economy will be reduced to trading sea-shells for pomfrets or something, because look at how IN THE RED we already are.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">But that isn’t true. As we said in point 1: Most of the money goes back to another government body. The “loss” is nowhere near as serious as it appears. And with an <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/25/singapore-budget-highlights-idUSL1N0BP0JQ20130225">expected $3.9 billion surplus</a>, I doubt the exclusion of land costs is entirely unfeasible.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">After all, the government <em>owns</em> the land. Granted, if SLA doesn’t charge market rates for it, the government won’t make money. But it doesn’t stand to lose much either.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Second, the land cost argument is impossible to verify. HDB doesn’t publicize how much it pays for land, yet those unpublicized costs are part of their argument. Trying to evaluate it is like trying to pass a Maths test typed in Wingdings.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">But if more information comes up, <a style="color: #005790;" href="https://www.facebook.com/moneysmartsg?fref=ts">follow us on Facebook</a> so we can update you.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <h4 class="h-underline" style="font-size: 14px;">3. HDB is not a company </h4>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/SG_AFTP_MoneySmart_NEW/4607149956_6590a07e0d.jpg"><img class="editorial" style="background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat;" title="Hands at an interview table" src="http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/SG_AFTP_MoneySmart_NEW/4607149956_6590a07e0d.jpg" alt="Hands at an interview table" width="320" height="214"></a>
              <p class="wp-caption-text" style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Let me get this right: You worked in housing, and got fired for bringing in *too many* customers?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">HDB isn’t a company, and budgeting’s a different ball game for them.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">HDB at its core is an administrative body. Just like MOE or MOM, it’s priority is not to generate revenue. It’s supposed to take whatever resources it’s assigned, and <em>spend</em> said resources to achieve a task.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The next year or quarter or whenever, HDB’s resources are topped up and they do it again.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">HDB may spend a billion or two, but public housing is a necessary expense. What matters is not that they spent the money (the resources were assigned to be used), but <em>how well</em> the money was spent. <em></em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Remember the <a style="color: #005790;" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/nparks-officer-suspended-for-foldable-bikes-purchase-worth-s-57-200.html">NParks bike saga</a>? The big issue <em>wasn’t</em> that NParks had $57k to spend; the issue was <em>how</em> they spent it (on 26 bicycles). Apply the same principle here.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Could that billion dollars have been better used? Could we have lowered construction costs? Was the EC scheme a bad idea overall? Could we skimp on some aspects to build more units? Those are the questions that matter.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">We shouldn’t be sidetracked by an impressive sounding deficit. If HDB had spent twice that, but spent it well enough that Singaporeans felt secure, there’d be less anger.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 11px; margin-bottom: 0px;">And some transparency to back Minister Khaw’s position wouldn’t hurt.</p>

              A reminder to Singapore young generation of the past...take a look at this.
              
              Teh Cheang Wan
              An illustrious career, killed by greed in squeaky, clean Singapore...
              
              Teh Cheang Wan (1928-1986) was Singapore's former Minister for National Development (1979-1986) who committed suicide, after being investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. In 1976, he had been awarded a Meritorious Service Medal.
              
              2.  Brief biography: Born in China, Teh Cheang Wan began his early education at Lai Teck School and later at Chung Ling High School in Penang. After graduating with an architecture degree from the University of Sydney in Australia in 1956, he began his career as an architect with the Public Works Department (PWD) of New South Wales. Teh then moved to the Housing Commission, also in New South Wales, before joining the Housing Trust in Kuala Lumpur and the Penang City Council.
               
              In August 1959, Teh joined the Singapore Improvement Trust as an architect and was promoted, 2 months later, to Chief Architect of the Building Department of the newly-formed Housing and Development Board (HDB). He then went on to become the HDB's Chief Executive Officer (1970-1979. In 1976, Teh was appointed the Chairman of the Jurong Town Corporation (1976-1979).
              
              In January 1979, Teh Cheang Wan became the Member of Parliament for the Geylang West constituency in Singapore's biggest ever by-election, after the seat was uncontested when nomination closed. He was immediately appointed as 
              the Minister for National Development the next day.
               
              3.  Corruption charges: In November 1986, Teh Cheang Wan was investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) for accepting 2 bribes of US$500,000 each, totalling US$1 million, for:
               1. Allowing a development company to retain part of its land in 1981 (the land had been earmarked for compulsory government acquisition); and
               2. Assisting a developer in the purchase of state land for private development in 1982.
              
              Teh denied receiving the money and offered to pay back SG$800,000, if CPIB stopped pursuing the case. The Cabinet Secretary reported this and informed Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew that Teh had requested to meet him. Lee replied that he could not do so until the investigations were over, as he could become a witness. A week later, on the morning of 15 December 1986, Teh was found dead. He left behind the following letter to the Prime Minister:
              
              â€œ Prime Minister, 
              
              I have been feeling very sad and depressed for the last two weeks. I feel responsible for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident and I feel I should accept full responsibility. As an honourable oriental gentleman, I feel it is only right that I should pay the highest penalty for my mistake.
               
              Yours faithfully, 
              
              Teh Cheang Wan "
              
              On 20 January 1987, the State Coroner returned a verdict of suicide, due to an overdose of amytal barbiturate. As a result of the suicide, the Attorney-General could not proceed with the charges. However, a subsequent investigation was carried out after Opposition Member of Parliament Chiam See Tong alleged that there were unanswered questions in the whole episode. In December 1987, the findings of an Commission of Inquiry were presented to the President of Singapore.

              SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY CORRUPTION CASE
              
              Singapore civil servant facing 455 fraud charges
              
              A Singaporean civil servant appeared in court Thursday on 455 charges of cheating the government totalling more than Sg$600,000 ($460,000), authorities and a media report said.
              
              The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a statement that clerical officer Liew Chee Meng was alleged to have forged documents to approve the purchase of gift vouchers for his personal benefit between 2007 and early this year.
              
              Subsequent investigations led to the seizure of almost Sg$475,000 worth of goods from the accused, the MHA said.
              
              "A civilian clerical officer from the Ministry of Home Affairs... was charged in court today for forgery, cheating, criminal breach of trust and conversion of proceeds of crime," it said.
              
              "The offences relate to acts allegedly committed in the course of his employment with the ministry. The total amount involved is Sg$617,087."
              
              Liew, 35, is alleged to have committed 455 offences, according to the Straits Times website.
              
              The MHA said Liew's actions were uncovered in January after an internal audit following a corruption case involving a senior civil servant with a penchant for Italian supercars.
              
              In that case Koh Seah Wee, formerly a deputy director of information technology at the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) was sentenced last month to 22 years in jail for cheating the government of more than Sg$12 million.
              
              A former colleague of his was sentenced to 15 years.
              
              Large-scale graft cases are rare in Singapore, a thriving financial centre and business hub which enjoys a reputation for being the least corrupt country in Asia.
              
              It pays its civil servants some of the highest government salaries in the world as a deterrent to corruption.

              14-Year Jail Term
              
              In 1995, Choy Hon Tim, a deputy chief executive at the Public Utilities Board was jailed for 14 years after he was convicted of taking S$13.9 million in kickbacks in Singaporeâ€™s largest public sector graft case.
              
              The law ministry, which oversees the land authority, has also ordered disciplinary investigations of two officers whose oversight might have allowed the alleged fraud to occur. The land authority said its finance and procurement processes were in accordance with government guidelines.
              
              Singaporeâ€™s government agencies and ministries are audited externally each year and carry out â€œregularâ€� internal audits, according to the finance ministry.
