            <div class='col-md body'>Here, challenge this....<br><br>================================<br>Chiam, Sitoh in spat over facilities<br><br>Residents upset both are unwilling to repair damaged footpath lights<br><br>By Aaron Low<br>Aug 03, 2006<br>The Straits Times<br><br>NEARLY three months after the General Election, some residents in Potong Pasir are feeling the effects of their votes as the People's Action Party (PAP) man scales back aid to the constituency.<br>The latest facility to suffer are the lights that guide residents along a concrete footpath as they walk home at night from the Potong Pasir MRT station.<br><br>Six of the eight solar-powered lights have been vandalised and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, the PAP candidate who lost in the ward in the May election, has no plans to repair or replace them. The lights had cost $20,000 to install.<br><br>Earlier, he had also stopped other amenities, including the extra Meet-the-People sessions and the $2 abalone porridge.<br><br>Last night, Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong, who won with 55.8 per cent of the votes, made it plain that he too will not fix the lights.<br><br>Their responses have annoyed several residents, including Mr Andrew Leow, who accused them of playing a cat-and-mouse game.<br><br>Said the 37-year-old accounts manager: 'The lights have been broken for a few weeks and at night, people are walking in the dark. Why can't anyone fix them?''<br><br>Another resident, Ms Lee Li-Cheng, 35, had written to The Straits Times Forum page to complain about the danger the situation posed to children and the elderly.<br><br>'I understand that Potong Pasir residents had made a choice and now have to live without upgrading frills, but these lights are a basic amenity, offering security for residents returning home late,' the human resource manager said.<br><br>Mr Chiam told The Straits Times last night that fixing the lights with town council funds would be illegal as the area in question is not under the council's control.<br><br>Mr Sitoh had leased the land from the Singapore Land Authority early last year to set up the lights. The adviser to Potong Pasir grassroots organisations said he would not be fixing the lights as the lease for the land would run out on Oct 31.<br><br>He told The Straits Times yesterday that grassroots organisations were formed to organise events for the community and they do not provide amenities.<br><br>But he and his grassroots leaders made an exception last year and raised funds for the lights.<br><br>Recently, some were vandalised, with one losing its solar panels. It would cost about $5,000 to repair the lights, said Mr Sitoh.<br><br>'But if I am running the town council, I would apply to take over this piece of land and build a brightly lit covered walkway immediately. I will not wait,' he added.<br><br>Mr Chiam, when asked whether he would raise money to repair the lights, retorted: 'This is his baby. He did it to show voters that he is such a caring person.'<br><br>'But now what has happened? It just shows he was doing it for the election, no more, no less.'<br><br>Mr Chiam added that he had put up spotlights at Block 147 facing the poorly lit pathway, to alleviate the situation.<br><br>But residents like technician Tan Yi Da, 23, are not impressed, saying that the lights do not help much at night as they are placed too far away to be of any use.<br><br>When asked if he was not doing all the extras he used to do before the election because he had lost, Mr Sitoh replied that he 'tried very hard to convince the residents' that he wanted to run the town council and make it a 'better place'.<br><br>'But the residents made their decisions and I have to respect them.'<br><br>Like some residents, Mr Leow is disappointed at how things have panned out.<br><br>He said: 'Now that the election dust has settled, both have refused to acknowledge that more needs to be done for the residents of Potong Pasir estate. Instead, we get them playing a cat-and-mouse game.''<br><br>Mr Chiam, who told residents during the campaign that voting for him meant voting for the services of two MPs, laughed off such concerns.<br><br>'When the time comes, it will be two-for-one again. Things are just quiet now,' he said.<br></div>

They also then prioritise developments for their supporters.<br><br>In the absence of viable full government-capable parties in Singapore where by our electoral franchise, we can enable one or disable one party from governing, means that our words and protests are whining - no bite.<br><br>It may be to Singapore's political development advantage to have a shock PAP loss and a coalition government for 4 years. The economy will be shell-shock and decisions paralyzed for a term of parliament, but Singaporeans will get real action from PAP after that when they win, unless the opposition gets very savvy and smart about governing after that period for coalition.<br><br>Unfortunately, we don;t really get to vote when opposition don;t come up with viable policies for governing, DETAILED plans and budget for funding their ideas and programs - so we are stuck with no shadow government, only a shadow of an opposition.
