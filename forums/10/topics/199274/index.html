The government should be at the discretion of the people, not the other way round. Shouldn't it be " you upgrade for us, we'll vote for you" and NOT "we vote for you, you'll upgrade for us"?

I share your empathy for the residents of both estates however, you have got to understand a fundamental basic which sohguanh had grasp 'there is no FAIRNESS in politics'. A similar situation will still happened with whoever is in power.<br><br>The fact remains that there is no denial of upgrading despite being given least priority.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TooFree:</div><div class="quote_body">Those who argued for Potong Pasir and Hougang residents sake are commendable although in my humble opinion you are more likely to be fighting for blind justice. I share your empathy for the residents of both estates however, you have got to understand a fundamental basic which sohguanh had grasp 'there is no FAIRNESS in politics'. A similar situation will still happened with whoever is in power.<br><br>The fact remains that there is no denial of upgrading despite being given least priority. Technically or legally speaking, the incumbent government has the upper hand.<br><br>Things will never take a turn for the better by whining in forum on the political practices. Action speaks louder than words ya. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I am sure the opposition leaders have come up with something to tackle this issue but ... somehow they may lack a 'supporting power' which can only be achieved by those who are too free. (not me, not me) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>You are correct to state that fairness in politics are only for 'idealists'.<br><br>Reward comes only to those who repay the faith of the incumbent Ruling Party, however myopic that may seem to those not in alternative wards.<br><br>However, when you see the older generation who toil the stairwells daily because they have no lift upgrading, one wonders whether graciousness has been forsaken for ruthlessness.<br><br>It is more than likely these core group of senior citizens are the ones who formed the 'minority vote' for the ruling party within alternative-held constitutiencies, particular since upgrades such as those offered would benefit them far more than the younger, hungrier generation of Singaporeans. But, having been given a rude swipe by upstart ministers like Mah Bow Tan whose, unwelcome comments of Potong Pasir and Hougang being placed last in the upgrade queue, what are the odds that they re-evaluate their own vote next time round?<br><br>With Low Thia Khiang meeting his own promises of lift upgrades WITHOUT joint-payment schemes championed by Ruling Party initiatives, why should future voters even consider the Ruling Party as a viable alternative? If anything, the WP under the leadership of Low have proven a formidable adversary to the complacent 'white T-shirt gang'.<br><br>And his success was based on a significantly downsized kitty based merely on meagre town council funding, without access to the larger funds available to Ruling Party wards.<br><br>Given the circumstances of the recent elections, it would be fair to state that the residents of Potong Pasir and Hougang have a maturity level which far exceeds the rest of the contested wards in Singapore. That isn't to say that residents in those wards are typically anti-PAP, but rather, they were able to sift through the offers from both sides and found the upgrade carrot to be a sham policy.<br><br>And they rightly voted otherwise.</div>
