He can talk whatever he wants against Gomez<br><br>Know what? if James try to clarify,he will immediately get sue left right and center with defamatory suits.Why? Cos if you clarify,it is saying that the PAP is lying,that our MM Lee is lying,god damn that they will sue for this.<br><br>They did this to Tang Liang Hong in 1997 cos Mr Tang then choosed to clarify allegations made against him.Now they are using the same tricks.<br><br>Now James is in a lose-lose situation.</div>
