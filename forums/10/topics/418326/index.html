              <p>Recently, I had been discussing about the topic on Singapore rapid 
              growth in term of population. A little background about my relative, he 
              lived in Australia and has been doing it for the past 7 years. We were 
              talking about how Australia has tried to curl the migrants from coming 
              into their country due to the unhappiness of the citizens. He was quite 
              surprise that Singaporeans only make up of around 2/3 of the 
              Singaporeans workforce. and 74% of the total population.<br><br>He sees a
               potential threat within our Singapore, those Singaporeans who grown up 
              in Singapore will eventually be overwhelm by the new citizens who are 
              from China and India. So he was urging his parents that if they were 
              allowing to come and turn into citizens in such a casual way. 
              Eventually, they will be the one controlling the parliament and giving 
              the decisive votes and there is no one to stop the PAP anymore. 
              Eventually, they would make up of huge numbers of the voting populations
               and we might not be able to do anything later.<br><br>I totally agree 
              with Mr Chan Tik Lek that this is the time to give PAP a black eye or 
              else the ruling party will never wake up. I urge all Singapore to think 
              about this, even though I cannot be sure  how many new citizens have 
              been converted to Singaporeans in the past few years. The only records I
               have are the 20,513 in 2008 and 19,928 in 2009. I am not saying that 
              migrants are bad but there should be a even tighter strict laws to turn 
              people from employment pass to PR, PR to citizens.<br><br>I think my 
              fellow young Singaporeans who live here long enough will be able to see 
              the impact in future. Our parents might not be able to see but their 
              children who will be the next generation leaders will sure see the 
              upcoming impact.</p>

              <p>I'm seeing it everyday, the majority of people in my company are foreigners and locals are just a miniority. I don't think it's 2/3 SIngaporean workforce, if it is, most probably, we have to look at what percentage of locals are holding higher positions, I'm not very convinced that most locals are at high or mid level positions, a vast number of locals have migrated over the years, those with higher education standards so I believe we are facing a dearth of local talents.</p>
              <p>Singapore is already in danger and some people I talked to will not vote opposition, because they work in civil services, because they want to buy houses, because they want to obtain PR status for their foreign wives, because they are afraid of being sent to combat units if they are serving NS, because they scared of ISD, because they think opposition will fare alot worse than PAP and worst still many of them are keeping quiet so we are not able to engage them at all.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>

              From my understanding, there is a confusion between migrants and FT. 
              
              Migrants are people who came to Singapore and decide to stay here perm. I think we are quite ok with people who wants to become Singapore citizens. 
              
              But the real threats are the FT, who come here for the sake of working. They holds work permits and PR status. And never intend to migrate to Singapore. And the worse is, the government are encouraging them to come. They came here to destroy the working market, fill their pocket with gold and left home to retire.

              <p>I was in perth for a vacation this May, went to a supermark run by vietnamese, a lot cheaper than woolworth, went to restaurants and were served by chinese and Singaporeans, haha, good service, and later went to a fast food chain and was served by one who spoke with strong oz accent, her service sucks. We should have all the singaporean in australia come back to drive bus and sell laksa, hope we get better service.</p>

              <p>I was in perth for a vacation this May, went to a supermark
              run by vietnamese, a lot cheaper than woolworth, went
              to restaurants and were served by chinese and Singaporeans,
              haha, good service, and later went to a fast food chain and was
              served by one who spoke with strong oz accent, her service
              sucks. We should have all the singaporean in australia come back to
              drive bus and sell laksa, hope we get better service.</p>
              <p>I was in vancouver few years ago, in a subsurb called
              richmond, saw building called aberdeen, charity shows in central
              atrium calling for donation to help victims of sichuan earthquake,
              in cantonese and mandarin, never saw a caucasian for 4 years. I
              never thought I was in canada.</p>

              <p>If they come, then assimilate into our culture. Don't insist on speaking Chinese when we speak English for a start. And then one thing you must also understand is....a lot of aunties and uncles can do the jobs of these foreigners doing basic jobs. They are hired because they don't need CPF contribution and hence much cheaper.</p>

              <p>The main performance indicator for those cabinet ministers are the GDP. All bonuses of civil servants are pegged to that indicator. The more foreigners coming in to work will mean a very robust catalyst for the economy. Domestic consumption is also greatly increased. Obviously a population of 5m will spend much more than a population of 3m, right? And that means more GST and more jobs. Eventually more GDP too. Then again, a lof these jobs, basic level ones for eg....are going to the cheaper chinamen and indians. There are so many jobless uncles and aunties.</p>
              <p>Those idiots who are saying I shd be doing something for them instead of whining here, I say to you go fuck yourself. These are things on a macro level and that little bit we do...yes we do make the difference but that's not going to stop PAP from lowering the floodgates, you dickheads.</p>
