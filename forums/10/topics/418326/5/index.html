              <p>Let's have a good lok at the laws of employing foreigners in other first world countries.</p>
              <p>In Western Europe, the law states that an employee cannot employ a foreign national unless they are unable to find a local able or willing to do that job.</p>
              <p>In the US, there is a quota of 75,000 hH-Visas (i.e. employment visas for foreign skilled workers) a year. </p>
              <p>In Australia and Canada, a point system is used to determine whether you qualify for PR. The point system takes into account your age,language ability, edcational background, work experience etc. Unlike SG, you don't qualify to get a PR just because you're a working professional.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Since LKY retired from the PMs post he has been mouthing a lot about everything. But one thing is highly noticeable. Never once did LKY ever voice his support for the foreign talent policy nor importing foreigner into SG. Was this because he never supported the idea of his successors but did not want to cause a rift in the PAP. Despite his repressive and ruthless ways, we have to give credit to LKY and th old guardfor turning SG from a third world country to a first world nation. Unfortunately, he passed his leadership to a bunch of foreign-loving traitors who gave SG away to the foreigners. (They didn't even bother to sell SG away.)   </p></div>

              <p>I think LKY success is his ability to adapt to changes with a good foresight of what is coming...he might sometime be wrong, but at least he is pro active. Unlike some old peoples who are unable to accept changes and simply ignore its existence.</p>
              <p>At his position, he is still very much holding the main remote control of his cabinets ministers and those bunch of so call leadership who love foreigners more than singaporeans, but as a long term strategy person, he looks far beyong our imagination, what he is doing is to rebuilt a population that make singapore successful just like in the earlier settlement, we also got indians, chinese, bugis, and many other types of peoples coming here to built their families, ...and today we are the beneficiaries of these people hard works. But then, he sees that we are deterioriating, our population growth is getting smaller while facing an aging population, he needs to create singapore to be attractive to others again, and these lead to many foreigners flocking here, mostly thanks to their own countries poor conditions, they look at singapore same as our forefather who came here in the 18th and 19th centuries, just that today, with IT and a knowledge economy, the way foreigner flock in and out will be different from the past, but the concept is the same, to attract foreigners in hoping that in 10 to 50 years time, these foreigners sons and daughters will be truly Singaporean, just like us. </p>

              <p><br>Like it or not, there must be a continuity in our legacy, LKY can alway call it a day and let Singapore rot on it own with less and less decendents and more older peoples, but as a leader of responsibility, he cannot let this to happen, he knows that he will have to go somehow, but the most important is that he go knowing that Singapore will survive the next few generations because of the policy he created now, that is what legacy and responsibility leadership is all about.</p>
              <p>If you built an influence society of highly educated individual, the side effect will be lower birthrates and marriages, that is shown across all the world, Japan is facing such problem, and if they do not address it...sooner or later, it will be a big problem for them.

And because of our multi culture, we are more open to foreigners from around the region and vice versa for foreigners.</p>
              <p>Pain it shall be, we have to accept that no one accept stranger in their house, but if you are going to die and that the house is going to be empty, you better get this stranger in to adapt here and hope that he/she carry on to be the caretaker of this house.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>You may be wondering how a country can take in outstanding and exceptional foreigners. The employment laws applied to foreigners in Western Europe and the US will just do that. Just because there is a quota for H visas in the US (which results in some backlog waiting time) or a law that does not allow foreigners to be hired unless a local cannot be found does not mean there aren't companies that won't hire foreigners in these countries. But for these companies to hire a foreign skilled worker, the company will have to go thru' a lot of hurdles incl.placing an ad in the newspaper to eliminate the locals. This also means that they will have to write the ad in an unusual way and for a company to go thru' all that trouble to hire a foreign skilled worker, that skilled worker will have to be exceptional and outstanding. Unlike SG, above average and mediocre won't do.      </p></div>

              <p>My dear,</p>
              <p>What do you expect LHL to said? we get below grade foreigners?? if you look around, on average, with a 1/4 of foreigners here against 3/4 locals, the crime rates of foreigners is much much more than locals, even on equal par with locals they are still higher due to the quarter ratio.</p>
              <p>The USA and Europe can alway attract top talents, so they can afford to allow Q and stricter entry visa, not any mynmar high school cert or philipinos university can qualify to go in, but our country, unable to attract the top talents, can only take in those left over and below talents, and these people come with a talent that include cheating, lying and village style culture.</p>
              <p>But our govt rationalised it and come out with a system know as "flitering", they allow all kind of goons and crooks to come in, then slowly filter them out and hope to get the best of all this goons and crooks, which is wrong. Unlike the west and USA, they do the filtering and checking before allowing someone in. And our govt, inorder to enhance and market our country to others, allow them to buy houses and make money out of it, ensuring that they get job and a ceiling above their head, end up neglecting the locals but still can said "we promise that Singaporean will alway come first"</p>
