              <p><em>Fact or fiction: Will spaceships really attack Earth in 2012? (Photo: DailyMail)</em></p>
              <p>34 per cent of Americans believe that UFOs exist and they might be right after all.</p>
              <p>Believe it or not, researchers at SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial 
              Intelligence) — an independent non-commercial organisation in the United
               States — released a shocking statement last week that three giant 
              spaceships are heading towards Earth, according to AsiaOne News.</p>
              <p>The largest one of them is reported to be 240 kilometres wide, and the two others are smaller.</p>
              <p>The spaceships were detected by the Alaska-based High Frequency 
              Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) search system, which is designed
               to study the phenomenon of northern lights. The system is also used by 
              the US Air Force for missile detection.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the report claims that the spaceships, which are currently 
              beyond the orbit of Pluto, will reach Earth in  December 2012.</p>
              <p>But get this — that also coincides with the end of Mayan calendar, 
              whose last day is December 21, 2012 (this was the subject of the recent 
              movie, “2012″). These spaceships will only be visible in optical 
              telescopes as soon as they reach Mars’s orbit and the US government has 
              reportedly been informed about the event.</p>
              <p><strong>Why is this probably a hoax?</strong></p>
              <p>I was chatting on Facebook with my fellow classmate Ng Zhan Ming, an 
              ASEAN scholar interested in astronomy, and he dismissed the spaceship 
              reports as wild speculation.</p>
              <p>He gave me valid reasons why this strange phenomenon will not occur.</p>
              <p>Firstly, why would aliens wait until after we have developed nuclear 
              weapons capable of mass destruction? They could have set their invasion 
              schedule to early 20th century and met no resistance from the human 
              race.</p>
              <p>Secondly, many countries all over the world, especially United 
              States’ NASA, have satellites in orbit. Why is it that only one system 
              saw it?</p>
              <p>And we have the Hubble Space Telescope that can zoom in roughly 40 
              times closer than a ground-based telescope to see the furthest of the 
              galaxies. But apparently, it did not detect any spaceships while the 
              HAARP system did.</p>
              <p>In addition, the report claims that UFOs will attack Earth in December 2012, which coincides with the end of the Mayan calendar.</p>
              <p>According to a <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012.html">FAQ article</a> published by NASA in 2009, “Nothing bad will happen to the Earth in 
              2012. Our planet has been getting along just fine for more than 4 
              billion years and credible scientists worldwide know of no threat 
              associated with 2012.”</p>
              <p>Should we believe NASA or SETI (an independent organisation) and the Mayans who created the ancient calendar 10,000 years ago?</p>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, Barack Obama’s administration has been notified about the findings by the SETI researchers.</p>
              <p>However, no official word from the White House or NASA has been 
              released so far. This is not a military secret so there is no point 
              hiding the fact if what the SETI scientists predicted was really true.</p>
