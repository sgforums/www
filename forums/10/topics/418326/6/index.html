              <p>We really have to agree with demon bane and deathmaster.</p>
              <p>(1) Our country just has too many foreigners and they have infiltrated every level of our society and economy. There are foreigners here, the majority of whom will not get a job in Westrern Europe or the US. We're talking about foreigners working in SG as teachers (not just in the independent schools), lecturers, pilots (check out SIA), engineers, architects, IT consultants right up to CEOs (check out OCBC and DBS).</p>
              <p>(2) Despite what that foreign-loving bastard Lee Hsien Loong said, there have been no laws passed to stop the continous inflow of foreigners. The fastest way would be to pass a law that only permits the hiring of foreigners if a local cannot be found for that job - this law can be imposed slowly on one job area at a time, maybe starting with teachers. Instead, those foreign-loving traitors have not changed the law that will give employment passes to any garbage foreigner who can get a job for $2500 a month - that's what taxi drivers earn in a month.</p>
              <p>For the love of SG,  isin't there a right-wing opposition party that will openly talk about stopping the inflow of foreigners and start repatriating foreigners from SG.</p>
              <p>ONE COUNTRY</p>
              <p>ONE PEOPLE</p>

              <p>In the 90's the Hong Kong immigrants came and they left after a few years, selling their HDB flats and making a bundle. The government cronies who are at the helm of GLCs are rich also but did they care about the poor, did they care about the ctiizens? Ministers are dirt rich and powerful, but do they care?</p>
              <p>Human heart is hard to predict, without proper screening of talented and sincere immigrants, it is just like a empty police station with fully loaded guns and a room full of robbers.</p>
              <p>Only time will time, is it the beginning of the end or a start.</p>

              <p>I started a restuarant recently in China, a SINGAPORE restuarant. What surprise me later is that many Singaporean who patronise my restuarant are former colleague, kampong friends and relatives. Mine you, my restuarant is not in Shanghai or Beijing but a remote seaside resort in Shangdong city called Yantai.</p>
              <p>I was surprised by the large no of Singaporean now living in remote China cities. It probably means there are signficantly less Singaporean now living in Singapore compared with those early years. I returned to Singapore for the CNY and took a SQ flight. I again was surprise by how difficult now to book a flight back home. I am furthur surprised that many who took the same flights are PRCs going to Singapore either for holidays or engjoying the home they brough in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The stories are real. It means that  Singaporean no longer is living in Singapore and foreigners are taking over houses. properties that these Singapore are living behind.</p>
              <p>Bye Bye Singapore.</p>
