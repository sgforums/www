            <div class='col-md body'>Just about a week ago, PM LHL gave a talk to his PAP boys and girls about 'servants and masters' - that they have to serve Singaporeans and not be masters over Singaporeans. Unfortunately. the PAP govt under LHL all these years never ever served the interest of Singaporeans. All they ever served were the interest of the foreigners and how they could use these foreigners to maximize their own personal compensation via economic growth.</div>

When the foreign population is about to go beyond the one-third quota, the PAP govt will just give out citizenship and PRs to these foreigners and keep the foreign population to one third - which is still a very unreasonably high percentage of foreigners.</div>

              There are some Singaporeans who are seriously considering voting for the PAP because of the rebates and other freebies the PAP is giving out to Singaporeans this year. Some may think this may be compensation to them for not benefitting from our spectacular economic growth. Well... THINK AGAIN!
              1. This is an election year and you will not be receiving anymore freebies from the PAP until another 4-5 years when the next election is called.
              2. The PAP is trying to buy your vote and they can get away with it since they are the sole authoritarian govt.
              
              Think it over very carefully if you should decide to vote PAP.

            <div class='col-md body'>In reply to Wiser, please note that we started with 'There are some Singaporeans...'. We are mainly adressing (and referring to) Singaporeans who are gullible and foolish to vote PAP just beause of the paltry rebates they are getting. We also wrote this in reply to an article in The Straits Times on 21 April which shows a picture of a smiling family who received one thousand and something dollars (we can't remember the exact figure) in support of the govt. We are addressing Singaporeans like them.</div>

              Some final thoights before the elections:
              Almost every country in the world has restrictions on foreign worker wanting to work in their country. The common restrictions are:
              (1) a foreign national may occupy a job if there are no locals able or willing to do that job.
              (20 A foreign national may be employed if he/she has some specific skill that no local has.

            <div class='col-md body'>
              In the US, they are more liberal by having a quota of 75,000 H Visas (i.e. visas for foreign skilled workers) a year - a drop in the bucket compared to the local skilled workforce.
              It is only fair and right for Singapore to follow the rest of the countries in the world and place restrictions on foreigners wishing to work here.
              Don't let the PAP brainwash you into the idea that SG jobs should be filled by workers on the basis of merit regardless of citizenship.
              Finally, remember that we are a small country and there are not many good job opportunities around - we should reserve whatever we can for our citizens. The rest of the world is doing just that.

              <p><br> But some SG peoples now also do not know if they are singaporeans,
              cos my grandma and Dad use to tell me about last time Singaporean
              like this and like that, they work hard, celebrate hard, enjoy
              togetherness and celebrate each other new years, I do not
              understand what they are talking, but it sure sound like a fairy
              tales, I wish we are now same as last time, but sad to said, tho
              there are still more Sg peoples than foreigner, most Sg peoples had
              lost their identity, they, especially the youngs like us, also
              dunno we are sg or foreigner ourselves</p>

              <p><br>the welcome foreigner policy is right. but the recent howlian speech say they not going to micromanage finetune it so that minimum cheap no experience labors just every month waiting for pay only talents can come in. vote hippos who can do that then its the new beginnings for singapore. no policy can work if you don;t review improve and micromanage on it. they should work from bottom to top and undertsand this fact.</p>
