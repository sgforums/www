              <p>So it's official. SG had an economic growth of 14.5% last year. Does this mean the majority of Singaporeans are better off economically by 14.5%?.Or does this mean the main economic beneficiaries were the foreigners and those foreign-loving traitor Ministers who run this country. The pay these Ministers are getting should be tied to the per capita income of Singaporeans living and working in SG, not the economic growth in SG. Even then, this does not take into account of the Singaporeans forced out of SG because they or their children were unable to compete in jobs or schools in SG - thanks to the extreme competitive system the PAP govt. has set up in SG.</p>
              <p>The job of the govt. is to look after the interests of the majority of Singaporeans. Instead, they are trying to eradicate Singaporeans born on the LHS of the bell curve and replace them with foreigners on the RHS of the bell curve. </p>

              <p>It does not make a difference if singapore born singaporeans are majority or minority if they do not exercise their democratic rights for their country.</p>
              <p>The rulers are a bunch of elites who voted themselves in and so they cannot be removed by the people as the people do not vote them in.</p>
              <p>They cannot be voted out also.</p>
              <p>So, why would they take care of the interest of the people who does not impact their KPI or bonus ?</p>
              <p>Now, they are are using their self-righteous mindset to conclude that they have a good team.</p>
              <p>Good team for who ?</p>
              <p>Lots of promises was made in 2006 and recently but did all of them materialise ?</p>

For the past 10 years, all the ministers in the PAP did  was to serve the interests of the foreigners and bloat up their own personal bank accounts while neglecting the interests of the citizens of Singapore. These foreign-loving traitors in the PAP have literally stripped away our sovereignty and identity to the point we are asking ourselves what are we having a SAF for? Maybe, the PAP govt. will literally need them to roll out the red carpet for more foreigners to come.</div>

              THAT FOREIGN LOVING BASTARD IS AT IT AGAIN!
              Just last week in China, our foreign loving bastard Goh Chok Tong said Singapore is still open selectively for foreigners. Isn't that what his foreign talent policy was mean't to do - to siphon and only take in truly talented foreigners instead of the average foreign garbage we are having in our country today.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As I have said, PAP is recruiting new voters. That is why they are taking more migrants from PRC and India (in hope they take up citizenship) because PAP feel that younger generation of Singaporeans no longer feel "indebted" to PAP for raising the standards of living in the nation. Who do you think the migrant who convert their PR to citizenship vote for? SDP or PAP? Of cuz PAP because if weren't for PAP, they won't be here in first place.  </p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr.Language - what you said may be true but when polling day comes, Real Singaporeans (i.e. those born in SG) will still make up the majority of voters. It is up to us Real Singaporeans to determine our future - whether we still want a PAP govt. who has stripped us of our national identity and given away our country's sovereignty to the foreigners.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hitler once said that if you want to tell a lie, you have tell a very big lie so that it will be so big that everyone will believe it to be true. That's what he did and that's exactly what the PAP is doing when it comes to the subject of foreign workers. Tha PAP has een telling an outright lie that foreign workers bring jobs to SG. Common sense will tell you that unless that foreign worker is doing a job that locals do not want or that foreign worker has some specific skill that Singaporeans do not have, that foreign worker will be competing against a Singaporean for a job - resulting in lower wages for that job and more misery for Singaporeans.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The result of lower wages (relative to the cost of living in SG) has kept our country competitive resulting in a spectacular 14.5% economic growth, plenty of jobs for foreigners and skyrocketing compensation for our ministers - which is all the PAP govt cares about.</div>

Never mind that our sovereignty has been given away to the foreigners. Never mind that one third of our country's land, air and space is given to the foreigners. All the ministers in the PAP govt ever cared about was maximizing their compensation even if they had to flood our country with foreigners.</div>
