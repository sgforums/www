              <h1 class="clr">More work in store for Singapore, Malaysia after ICJ ruling</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The International Court of Justice has awarded sovereignty
              over Pedra Branca to Singapore, while the Middle Rocks went to
              Malaysia, but the court left open the ownership of South Ledge, a third
              disputed cluster of rocks.</p>
              <p>Sovereignty over South Ledge was left to be determined later between
              the countries when they sort our their territorial waters, the ruling
              said. So more work is in store for Singapore and Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Associate
              Professor Robert Beckman from the NUS Faculty of Law said: "Indonesia
              may have to intervene in this case if the boundary is to be determined
              because their interest will be affected as well... if you look at the
              map — at least the map in the court’s decision — the islands are
              actually quite close to the Indonesian island of Bintan."</p>
              <p>However,
              Professor Beckman believes an amicable agreement is within reach, given
              the ’very good’ relations between Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>He
              said: "Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia (relations) have been very
              good for the past three years, and there is a cooperative mechanism in
              the Straits of Malacca that was agreed in Singapore at an unprecedented
              level of cooperation. So, I would expect that these talks would proceed
              quite smoothly."</p>
              <p>In the meantime, Singapore and Malaysia will
              discuss the steps and procedures to implement the court’s decision. For
              one thing, both sides have to discuss how to delimit the territorial
              waters in the Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks area.</p>
              <p>A Singapore—Malaysia technical committee is already in place to discuss this and other related issues.</p>
              <p>Prof
              Beckman said the committee will need to come up with an interim
              arrangement on who takes charge of certain areas in case there are
              incidents of ship collision or grounding in the area. This process can
              take months or even years.</p>
              <p>Prof Beckman also said that while
              referring the Pedra Branca case to the ICJ shows a healthy development
              in bilateral relations, he does not foresee that all cases of
              territorial disputes in Asia will be brought before the international
              court.</p>
              <p>He said: "Disputes like those between Korea and Japan are
              far more sensitive. (Korea—Japan dispute) involves a history of Japan
              and Korea and so much is at stake that they may not want an
              international negotiation. So, another way that states can resolve this
              issue is to leave — especially if resources are involved, like offshore
              gas — the sovereignty issue frozen. In other words, let’s not talk
              about sovereignty, but talk about jointly developing the area for
              offshore gas and oil."</p>
              <p>He added that another option countries can consider is to get a mediator to settle disputes. — CNA/ir</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Ministers, MPs hail ICJ recourse as way to resolve dispute</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Law Minister K Shanmugam has said the Pedra Branca issue is
              a long—standing dispute between Singapore and Malaysia and agreeing to
              resolve it through the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is a very
              responsible way of dealing with it.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam also said the Singapore team had put in a lot of effort
              and that the delegation had been "very professional, very thorough and
              totally prepared" in presenting Singapore’s case before the court.</p>
              <p>Other ministers and MPs have also hailed the ICJ recourse as a model for two countries to resolve a dispute amicably.</p>
              <p>"I
              think it shows that if we have a dispute, we can go to such
              international organisation — whether it’s arbitration or International
              Court of Justice — and get a third party to rule on the decision and
              then both sides... accept and abide by the decision," said Dr Lee Boon
              Yang, Minister for Information, Communications and The Arts.</p>
              <p>Ms
              Indranee Rajah, Deputy Speaker of Parliament and MP for Tanjong Pagar
              GRC, said: "Between sovereign states, there will always be issues,
              going forward. The important thing is that you decide it in accordance
              with the rule of international law, that means, states really submit
              themselves through a tribunal for a ruling. That’s much better than
              having a situation where you have constant friction, constant dispute."</p>
              <p>Others said that the way Singapore and Malaysia have reacted to the judgement shows a level of maturity.</p>
              <p>MP
              Irene Ng, who is also the Defence and Foreign Affairs GPC’s deputy
              chairman, said: "I noticed that both sides have assured each other that
              they will abide by it and so far, the response has been very rational
              and there’ve not been any attempts to work up nationalistic feelings.</p>
              <p>"I
              think that also says a lot about our relationship... whether it’s
              win—win or not is for experts to say, but where individual countries
              are concerned, I think we can take courage that this is the way to go
              to resolve disputes. It is fair, it is transparent."</p>
              <p>Dr Teo Ho
              Pin, chairman of Law and Home Affairs GPC, said: "There are already
              many assurances by the leaders that our bilateral ties are very strong.
              So I don’t think it (the ICJ ruling) will have any impact on bilateral
              ties. In fact, I think it’ll enhance bilateral ties between the two
              countries." — CNA/ir</p>

              <p> Hmm, according to the Law of the Sea, EEZ extends 200nmi from the baseline of the coastal Island. With that, the nation also have rights to regulate navigation and flights over the EEZ. ...<br><br>Anyway, looking at the map, the only extendable area is towards the South China Sea, but i doubt PB can be defined as 'baseline of the coast' ...

                  <strong>Malaysian MPs slam govt for losing Pedra Branca </strong><br>
                  Parliament debate shows island issue could become a political hot potato <br>
                  By Carolyn Hong <br><br>
                  
                  KUALA LUMPUR - THE 'loss' of Pedra Branca to Singapore became a topic of debate in Parliament yesterday as several MPs expressed unhappiness at the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). <br><br>
                  
                  The debate was led by several Johor Members of Parliament, as well as opposition leaders. <br><br>
                  
                  The vocal Datuk Puad Zarkashi, an Umno MP from Johor, said Malaysia lost because it failed to archive its historical documents properly. <br><br>
                  
                  He lambasted the government for failing to locate a crucial letter from the British colonial government seeking the Johor sultan's permission to build a lighthouse on the island which he described as a key piece of evidence. <br><br>
                  
                  'As a Johorean, I am disappointed. We lost, simple as that. I don't believe in the win-win situation as claimed by the government,' he said. <br><br>
                  
                  The debate in Parliament came after a weekend of measured response from politicians and the media, and is an indication that the loss of the island could become a political hot potato. <br><br>
                  
                  The MPs had been briefed in advance of the ICJ verdict last Friday as the government attempted to moderate the response to the decision, but strong sentiments are beginning to surface. <br><br>
                  
                  The opposition has also jumped onto the bandwagon to blame the government for its poor handling of the case. <br><br>
                  
                  The opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) in Johor yesterday lodged a police report against former foreign minister Syed Hamid Albar for having been 'careless' in the handling of the case. <br><br>
                  
                  'They did not do anything against Singapore when it constructed buildings and a light house on the island,' Johor PAS information chief Mazlan Alimin said. <br><br>
                  
                  The party is also planning to table a motion in Parliament today to debate the matter.<br><br> 
                  
                  Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim wrote in his blog yesterday that the ICJ decision was a bitter pill, and attacked the Malaysian government for its weak case. <br><br>
                  
                  'Malaysians should express their anger and regret at the carelessness, and protest to the Umno and BN-led government, and Attorney-General,' he said. <br><br>
                  
                  His wife, Wan Azizah Ismail, an MP from Penang, said in Parliament that Malaysians were saddened by the decision, against which there was no appeal. <br><br>
                  
                  Mr Mahfuz Omar, a PAS MP from Kedah, blamed the Attorney-General for failing to advise the government adequately. <br><br>
                  
                  Independent MP Ibrahim Ali urged the government to be wary of Singapore, pointing out that the Republic has a water treatment plant in Pulai which was manned by its personnel. <br><br>
                  
                  'I have been made to understand that it is big, and <b>if it was to overflow, half of Johor will be flooded,</b>' he said. <br><br>
                  
                  Meanwhile, Malaysian analyst Datuk Dr Cheah See Kian was quoted in the Nanyang Siang Pau yesterday as saying that the ICJ decision could have military and strategic significance for Singapore. <br><br>
                  
                  He said Pedra Branca was a strategic spot from the military point of view, and that it could even be used as a new naval base. <br><br>
                  
                  'Although we are not certain whether there are oilfields around Pedra Branca, Singapore has achieved a historical breakthrough with the verdict,' he said.<br><br>
                  
                  lmao.

              <p>The actions was started when Mahathir was PM, and those who led the Malaysian case were also leftovers from the Mahathir hand selected group of cronies and suffering beneficiaries to his patronage scheme.</p>
              <p>Is it the fault of the Badawi Government ?</p>
              <p>They should continue leaning towards Mahathir, and perhaps Singapore will gain a few more islands.</p>

              <p>It
              has asked the media on its side of the Causeway to drop the word

              <blockquote>KUALA LUMPUR, May 26 — If you take a look at news of Pulau Batu
              Puteh from today, you may notice something. A subtle name change. <em>The Malaysian Insider</em> learned that there was a request from Wisma Putra – specifically the
              technical committee set up to study implications of the International
              Court of Justice’s (ICJ) decision – to refer to Pulau Batu Puteh not as
              an island.
              <p>Essentially, they want it to be referred to as either Batu Puteh or
              Pedra Branca. A check with the editors of two national dailies
              confirmed the request. "There is no directive but it was more of a
              favour ... to <span style="color: #ff0000;">not</span> refer to the island as an island," said one of the
              editors.</p>
              <p>He went on to elaborate that since it now belongs to Singapore, the
              newspaper will now refer to the island as Pedra Branca – the way
              Singapore has always referred to it. He also noted that it should also
              not be a problem to refer to the island as Batu Puteh. "Just drop the
              word pulau ... like the way we refer to Penang or Singapore."</p>

                  of the International Court of Justice's decision, which ruled that

              <p>May 27, 2008<br><strong>Malaysian MPs slam govt for losing Pedra Branca</strong><br>Parliament debate shows island issue could become a political hot potato<br>By Carolyn Hong<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - THE 'loss' of Pedra Branca to Singapore became a topic of debate in Parliament yesterday as several MPs expressed unhappiness at the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).<br><br>The debate was led by several Johor Members of Parliament, as well as opposition leaders.<br><br>The vocal Datuk Puad Zarkashi, an Umno MP from Johor, said Malaysia lost because it failed to archive its historical documents properly.<br><br>He lambasted the government for failing to locate a crucial letter from the British colonial government seeking the Johor sultan's permission to build a lighthouse on the island which he described as a key piece of evidence.<br><br>'As a Johorean, I am disappointed. We lost, simple as that. I don't believe in the win-win situation as claimed by the government,' he said.<br><br>The debate in Parliament came after a weekend of measured response from politicians and the media, and is an indication that the loss of the island could become a political hot potato.<br><br>The MPs had been briefed in advance of the ICJ verdict last Friday as the government attempted to moderate the response to the decision, but strong sentiments are beginning to surface.<br><br>The opposition has also jumped onto the bandwagon to blame the government for its poor handling of the case.<br><br>The opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) in Johor yesterday lodged a police report against former foreign minister Syed Hamid Albar for having been 'careless' in the handling of the case.<br><br>'They did not do anything against Singapore when it constructed buildings and a light house on the island,' Johor PAS information chief Mazlan Alimin said.<br><br>The party is also planning to table a motion in Parliament today to debate the matter.<br><br>Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim wrote in his blog yesterday that the ICJ decision was a bitter pill, and attacked the Malaysian government for its weak case.<br><br>'Malaysians should express their anger and regret at the carelessness, and protest to the Umno and BN-led government, and Attorney-General,' he said.<br><br>His wife, Wan Azizah Ismail, an MP from Penang, said in Parliament that Malaysians were saddened by the decision, against which there was no appeal.<br><br>Mr Mahfuz Omar, a PAS MP from Kedah, blamed the Attorney-General for failing to advise the government adequately.<br><br>Independent MP Ibrahim Ali urged the government to be wary of Singapore, pointing out that the Republic has a water treatment plant in Pulai which was manned by its personnel.<br><br>'I have been made to understand that it is big, and <strong>if it was to overflow, half of Johor will be flooded,</strong>' he said.<br><br>Meanwhile, Malaysian analyst Datuk Dr Cheah See Kian was quoted in the Nanyang Siang Pau yesterday as saying that the ICJ decision could have military and strategic significance for Singapore.<br><br>He said Pedra Branca was a strategic spot from the military point of view, and that it could even be used as a new naval base.<br><br>'Although we are not certain whether there are oilfields around Pedra Branca, Singapore has achieved a historical breakthrough with the verdict,' he said.<br><br>lmao.</p>
