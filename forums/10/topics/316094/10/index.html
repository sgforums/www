              <p><br> Listened to the CNA live, heard the judge said 12-4 ruling in
              favour of Pedra Branca to Singapore and 15-1 ruling in favour of
              Middle Rock to Malaysia. Not sure though. Let's move on!</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It was commented that SG had not shown that it had a claim over middle rock, which in all fairness, is true. Our arguments were centered on PB and I guess it shows that the SG team put up a strong case for PB.</p>
              <p>I don't agree with the judgement because its potentially another can of worms. But in all fairness, it was a judgement based on sound application of intl law: i.e. because MY has a historical title to the islets in the area, and both countries had agreed for the judgement to be rendered separately, they had to render a judgement that gave due recognition to that context.</p>
              <p>MY had shown it had title, so it got the middle rocks. In the same way, it had shown that it never regarded PB as theirs (in fact, they denied it) and SG had effectively controlled the island, we got PB.</p>
              <p>South ledge is a low tide elevation so that brings with it its own complications so the only fair way is to split it according to the maritime boundaries of each state.</p>

              <p>There's no need for any further disputes.</p>
              <p>It is sad, to have a 3rd party to decide, but as both can't agree, the court's decision is final.</p>
              <p>Both sides had agreed to abide by the court's decision.</p>
              <p>Both country respects the law, for without law, we are no more than animals.</p>
              <p>If anyone else dispute the court's decision, they would be deem to have no respect for the law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as for territorial waters, let's look at it this way:-</p>
              <p>The main island is ours, the rock theirs, - therefore we have as much rights to travel on those waters as much as theirs, for recreation and fishing industry - waters which are far from our country :-P</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any disputes or civil suit, just have to refer to that court decision awarding us rights to that land and with that land, waters surrounding it as well. We just have to learn to live side by side and share.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Singapore’s Foreign Ministry pleased with ICJ’s decision</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said it is
              pleased with the judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),
              which awarded sovereignty of the Pedra Branca island to Singapore on
              Friday.</p>
              <p>But the ministry said the judgement is not totally in Singapore’s
              favour as the court has awarded Middle Rocks to Malaysia and has
              decided that South Ledge belongs to the country in whose territorial
              waters it is located.</p>
              <p>Even though Singapore had argued that these features are part of Pedra Branca, MFA said it accepts the court’s decision.</p>
              <p>The
              Foreign Ministry added that the judgement brings to a closure a
              longstanding territorial dispute between Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
              <p>Both
              countries will discuss the steps and procedures to implement the
              court’s decision. Officials from both sides had already been in
              discussion prior to the announcement of the judgement.</p>
              <p>Responding
              to queries on the implications of the ICJ’s decision regarding
              Singapore’s entitlement to territorial maritime zones around Pedra
              Branca, an MFA spokesman said that the court was not asked to determine
              such questions of maritime space or boundary delimitation.</p>
              <p>But Singapore’s rights and interests on these matters will be pursued in accordance with international law.</p>
              <p>A
              1980 press statement from MFA had said that Singapore has an Exclusive
              Economic Zone and a territorial sea limit that extends up to a maximum
              of 12 nautical miles. This is consistent with the United Nations
              Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s
              Foreign Ministry said the precise coordinates of Singapore’s
              territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone will be announced at an
              appropriate time.</p>
              <p>Should the limits of its territorial sea or
              Exclusive Economic Zone overlap with claims of neighbouring countries,
              Singapore will negotiate with those countries with a view to arrive at
              agreed delimitations, in accordance with international law. — CNA/so</p>

              <p>Idwar is here..... <a class="tinymce_control" href="316094?page=10#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1210389655" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>
              <p>So Singapore got the PB island. Malaysia got Middle Rocks which are less than 1km to the south ( 0.6 nautical miles). This means Singapore waters extend 0.3 nm southwards only, to the half way mark to Middle Rocks. Norrthwards Singapore gets 3 nm. as Johore is about 7 km away</p>
              <p>It also means Malaysian ships can cut into PB waters to get to Middle Rocks...right of free passage.....without having to ask for permission. </p>
