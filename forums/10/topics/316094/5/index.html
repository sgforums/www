              </blockquote>
              <p>there are 2 question here.</p>
              <p>first... the name pulau batu puteh, is simply a malay naming for a geological feature just as malaysia would call USA as amerika syarikat or JAPAN as jepun, fried rice as nasi goreng.... the name itself do not confer a title, its just a naming done through interpretation of the original name.... otherwise malaysia could lay claim to the whole universe by giving it a malay word.</p>
              <p> pedra branca is a portugese word... translated to english as "white rock", unless i am mistaken... pulau batu putih appears to be a simple translation of the portugese word pedra branca.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the second question is fisherman landing on the island.</p>
              <p>under the international law... fisherman do not have "official" capacity to claim any island, tree or the sun on behalf of a sovereign state.</p>
              <p>malaysia tried that during the ligitan and sipadan trial against indonesia... claiming that orang laut (sea gypsies) who pledge allegiance to the sabah sultanate has claimed those island through their repeated visits.</p>
              <p>however.. the ICJ flatly rejected malaysia's claim base on fisherman or fishing activities on or around the island... as these are considered as "private activities" therefore NOT OFFICIAL.</p>
              <p>the ICJ eventually granted the island to malaysia BECAUSE... malaysia has shown that it has been regulating the collection of turtle egg on the two island officially through laws and deploying officials to enforce the law on ligitan and sipadan.</p>
              <p>yes..... indonesia lost the two island because of turtle eggs.... i am sure the indonesian were coughing blood that day when the judgement were pass down at the ICJ.</p>
              <p>hmmm... seems like i miss one question... the british asking for permision to build the lighthouse...</p>
              <p><br>for your information... the british NEVER asked for permission to build the lighthouse on pedra branca... malaysia did made such a claim.. but they have NO evidence to back up such a claim.</p>
              <p>the letters between the johor sultan and governor butterworth was clearly referring to the island call PEAK ROCK within the rumenia (romania) island group... which is next to johor.... as singapore has shown during the trial from the official letters of governor butterworth... to the johor sultan.... which malaysia has already grudgingly agreed.</p>

              <p>that is because peak rock is within the 3nmi territorial water of johor... thus though it may not be inhabited.. it belongs to johor in the absence of other claimants... under the british system.</p>
              <p>in the past prior to the concept of territorial water... the british mark their "territorial water" base on how far their cannon can shoot (defensible water) from their shores or harbour...</p>
              <p>afterall... as the saying goes..., what you cannot defend do not belong to you... if the british cannon cant hit the tresspassing ships from their shore battery... its a moot point to insist someone is invading your water... and so this system was applied to johor who by then was more or less a vassal of the english empire...</p>
              <p>malaysia federation treaty also clearly spelt that malaysia is made up of participating sultanate and any island within 3 nautical miles of the main land... (prior to this... the concept of territorial water is a western concept, malay rulers never had such a concept of owning a body of water.)</p>
              <p>pedra branca was more then 3 nmi from either malaysia or indonesia.... thus under the british system ... its a No Man's land....</p>
              <p>the 12 nautical mile territorial sea that most nation claim today...was only after the passing of the law of the sea in 1982.</p>

              <p><br> This infomation from Wikipedia: The Malaysian state of Johor
              asserts that when Johor Sultanate ceded Singapore to the British in
              1824, the island was not part of the secession and that the Sultan
              of Johor only allowed the British to construct a lighthouse on the
              island in 1844.[10] This follows a letter dated November 25 1844
              from the Sultan and the Temenggung of Johor to the British which
              gave the British a permission to build a lighthouse on an
              island.[11] In 1824, Sultan of Johor ceded Singapore and the
              surrounding 10 nmi (18.5 km) to the British East India Company.[12]
              Pedra Branca is located 25 nmi (46.3 km) away from Singapore; the
              island is 7.7 nmi (14.3 km) away from Johor.[13]</p>

              <p>this is a unilateral map from malaysia which is rejected by both indonesia and singapore.</p>
              <p>however... there are something worthy of attention on that map... that is the black colour line drawn close to indonesia islands like a string...</p>
              <p>those are official indonesian baseline... and you can see from the black line stretching from west to east... indonesia DO NOT claim pedra branca as its baseline did not use pedra branca as a reference point.</p>
              <p>here is another map... from the official treaty between indonesia and malaysia on continental shelf boundary signed in 1969 (about 10 years before malaysia suddenly claim pedra branca with its 1979 map) which is available on the internet.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i43.photobucket.com/albums/e352/shadow200671/pedra.jpg" alt="boundary"></p>
              <p>PB denotes the island pedra branca... but that is not the main point here.</p>
              <p>look at point 11 and 12.. those are the official continental boundary between indonesia and malaysia (in the absence of singapore claim... singapore will no doubt claim its fair share once we win the case at ICJ)</p>
              <p>point 11 never touch pedra branca... which indicates both nation do not claim pedra branca.</p>
              <p>but MOST IMPORTANT of all is the thin red line next to the bold red line....</p>
              <p>the thin red line is the OFFICIAL malaysian territory baseline.... look at where did it start! it started from the rumenia island group !! NOT from pedra branca!!</p>

              <p>in conclusion... way back in 1969, more then 100 years since pedra branca belong to singapore...</p>
              <p>malaysian officials as well as indonesian officials have accepted without question that the island pedra branca do not belong to either of them as neither of them use pedra branca as their territorial base line in international official treaties.</p>
              <p>point 11 is a testament of that... otherwise it would have shifted (southward if pedra branca is malaysians territory, northward  if pedra branca belongs to indonesia)rather then pointing straight at pedra branca.</p>

              <p>hmmm... didn't log in for 1 day and its been so interesting...</p>
              <p>to be fair, anyone who has read the transcripts of the ICJ with an open mind would come to an initial conclusion that both sides raised pretty good arguments but this mindless re-hash of the malaysian perspective really makes me wonder just how many malaysians are here trying to start a pissing contest.</p>
              <p>i wasn't aware that the malaysian propaganda machine is so "powderful" that it has successfully brain-washed ordinary singaporeans into thinking that malaysian actually "owns" the island and the fight was over before it began.</p>
              <p>to give credit where its due, it must be said that the singapore side did a better job of tying it all up, responding to opposing counsel's points and making it neat and persuasive.</p>
              <p>did i mention that i especially liked the part when the light-house keeper's account of the sultan's visit to the island was read in full? it makes me wonder why a sultan visiting his "own island" would need to seek the governor's permission and use his boat for that purpose. Won't his orang laut subjects be honoured to ferry such a VIP?</p>
              <p>no permission was sought <strong>from</strong> the sultan to build the lighthouse. but permission was sought <strong>by</strong> the sultan to visit it. hmmm...</p>
              <p>the malaysian arguments were full of holes. if they did not damage their "historical" claim in the process, they certainly looked like clowns grasping at straws.</p>
              <p>and that's not even bringing in that ridiculous photo they tried to pass off as "evidence"...</p>
              <p>the only saving grace they had was sir elihu lauterpacht who managed to weave together the disparate and fragmented argument into something resembling coherence... i can only imagine how hard the poor old man must have worked to earn his fee for this particular representation...</p>

              <p><br>I wonder if those boys can handle the Ruski instruction manuals, or get those translated into Bahasa in time for it to get pass any surprises sprung by the stealthy Apaches guarding the island.</p>
              <p>Not a pretty sight to see, if those big boys get fried in the steel coffins - which will only add to the dust polution raised by the ashes from the fires that clear the palm oil plantations.</p>
              <p>This clinically clean island can surely take the weight of more ashes coming over from the border.</p>
