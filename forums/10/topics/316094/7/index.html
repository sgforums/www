              <p class="abstract">The long-drawn saga of conflicting claims to Pulau Batu Puteh is
              drawing to a close in a victory of process over protest, writes RAIS
              YATIM.</p>
               
              <table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="0" width="200" align="right">
              </table>
               A PANEL of 16 judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
              convenes on May 23 in The Hague to deliver judgment on the case of
              Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, a longstanding
              territorial dispute between Malaysia and Singapore.<br><br>For
              generations, Pulau Batu Puteh - roughly half the size of a football
              field located 7.7 nautical miles off Johor's coast at Tanjong Penyusoh
              - was a tranquil haven for fishermen plying the surrounding waters. But
              a claim on the island, which is part of the Johor Sultanate, surfaced
              three decades ago.<br><br>It began on Feb 14, 1980, when Singapore
              protested against the 1979 map published by Malaysia clearly placing
              Pulau Batu Puteh in our territory. Singapore then expanded its claims
              to the nearby Middle Rocks and South Ledge in February 1993. On Feb 6,
              2003, Malaysia and Singapore signed a special agreement to refer the
              matter to the ICJ.<br><br>Malaysia's position is that Pulau Batu Puteh
              is and has always been part of the state of Johor. We have asserted to
              the ICJ that nothing has happened to displace our sovereignty over it.
              Singapore's presence on the island for the sole purpose of constructing
              and maintaining a lighthouse there - with the permission of the
              territorial sovereign, Johor - does not displace Malaysia's sovereignty
              over Pulau Batu Puteh.<br>   Our nation has more than 1,000 islands. Many of them sit in
              strategically important, resource-rich seas, so territorial disputes
              are bound to occur for one reason or another. It is unfortunate that
              Malaysia has had to seek international legal recourse. But it is only
              when diplomatic and political channels are exhausted that Malaysia
              refers the dispute to a third party.<br><br>We
              have had to exercise this option twice before. A territorial dispute
              between Malaysia and Indonesia over the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan
              off the coast of Sabah was referred to the ICJ, while our concern over
              Singapore's land reclamation led us to institute arbitral proceedings
              at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS).<br><br>In
              the case involving Sipadan and Ligitan, the ICJ on Dec 17, 2002, in a
              16-1 majority decision, ruled that both islands belonged to Malaysia.
              On Singapore's land reclamation, the ITLOS tribunal issued a
              provisional ruling on Oct 9, 2003, which, among others, directed
              Singapore not to conduct its activities in ways that would prejudice
              Malaysia's rights or damage the marine environment.<br><br>In both
              cases, the outcome of the proceedings confirmed Malaysia's position.
              But neither outcome would have been possible for Malaysia without a
              strong, meticulously prepared case. That track record continued with
              the Pulau Batu Puteh proceedings at the ICJ.<br><br>Three of the five
              leading international law experts who argued our case for Pulau Batu
              Puteh also represented Malaysia at the ICJ during the proceedings for
              Sipadan and Ligitan and at the ITLOS tribunal on Singapore's
              reclamation works. Cambridge University professors Sir Datuk Elihu
              Lauterpacht QC and Datuk James Crawford, and Leiden University
              international law professor Datuk Nicolaas Jan Schrijver are among the
              best in the business.<br><br>Under the capable leadership of Malaysia's
              Agent for the Pulau Batu Puteh case, Tan Sri Abdul Kadir Mohamad, as
              well as our Co-Agent, Datuk Noor Farida Ariffin, the legal team
              assembled a case that involved research spanning nearly 30 years. More
              than 50 experts were roped in to scour records in nine countries. No
              stone was left unturned in our research to present the most compelling
              arguments to the ICJ.<br><br>Our preparations would not have been
              successful without the assistance of the attorney-general, the National
              Archives of Malaysia, the Department of Survey and Mapping, and the
              Johor government. The inter-departmental co-operation involved 35
              ministries, agencies, departments, the armed forces, police and local
              institutions of higher learning. It easily serves as one of the best
              case studies in teamwork and dedication to protect the interests of
              Malaysia.<br><br>To put the nearly 30 years spent researching the Pulau
              Batu Puteh case into perspective, consider how the top position at the
              Foreign Ministry changed hands not once or twice but seven times in
              that period! Tan Sri Tengku Ahmad Rithauddeen Tengku Ismail was foreign
              minister at the time the work began. He was succeeded by Tun Mohd
              Ghazali Shafie in 1981, but was reappointed to his old portfolio in
              1984.<br><br>I was made the minister two years later, and Tan Sri Abu
              Hassan Omar succeeded me in 1987. But the research went on
              uninterrupted right through to when Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
              was appointed foreign minister in 1991, and when Datuk Seri Syed Hamid
              Albar assumed the position in 1999.<br><br>Now, as fate would have it,
              I have again found myself back in the saddle at the ministry, just as
              the case draws to its conclusion. All my predecessors deserve their due
              credit. This is a story of a torch being handed from one helm to
              another. I would be remiss not to record the highest appreciation to
              all the many officers - some of whom have retired - who dedicated
              themselves to helping Malaysia present the best possible case at the
              ICJ.<br><br>We all have a special attachment to this case. Not just for
              the time and effort spent on it, but because of our responsibility to
              the Malaysian public to give our all in protecting our nation's
              territorial sovereignty.<br><br>The judgment on May 23 will mark the
              end of a long journey. We must bear in mind that in any legal case, the
              outcome is not guaranteed. We can only prepare the best possible
              arguments and hope that the judges will agree and rule in our favour.
              As I have communicated to my counterpart in Singapore, in the event
              Malaysia gets the judgment, Singapore should accept the fact. And if
              Singapore gets the decision, Malaysia will do likewise. Inasmuch as
              both nations respect international law, so shall we respect the
              decision of the ICJ.<br><br>The dispute over Pulau Batu Puteh has
              constrained our ties with one of our closest neighbours and fellow
              Asean member states. We hope a resolution to this dispute can pave the
              way to easing our other outstanding bilateral issues with Singapore.<br><br>Our
              decision to take this matter to the ICJ demonstrates that Malaysia is a
              nation that places great emphasis on the rule of law and affirms our
              position as a respectable member of the international community.<br><br>There
              should be no acrimony on either side, no matter what the judgment may
              be, and on this both Malaysia and Singapore have agreed. I'm happy to
              report that both countries have also agreed to have a Joint Technical
              Committee meeting headed by our Foreign Ministry secretary-general, Tan
              Sri Rastam Mohd Isa, and his Singapore counterpart, before the judgment
              is made.<br><br>In the end, it is what Malaysia and Singapore do after
              May 23 that will decide whether we can bring closure to a bilateral
              issue that has besieged us for more than three decades. Whatever the
              final outcome, Malaysia and Singapore will remain steadfast as friends
              and neighbours bound by understanding and harmony.<br><br><strong><em>Datuk Seri  Dr Rais Yatim is Foreign Minister of Malaysia.</em></strong></blockquote>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">After reading this thread, I would like to post some of my thoughts on this issue….</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">The Pedra Branca issue involves the territorial, sovereignty and strategic survival issues of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">. As much as I dun agree with PAP, I believe even if today, WP, SDA, SDP is in power, they would definitely also have exercise all means to protect SG’s interest in terms of Pedra Branca. Anyone that calls him or herself a SGrean must stand together as a united front to deal with the PB issue, bcos, the challenge faced today involves all SGreans and not any political party, or any policy this and that. So one must be clear this is a SG issue and not a PAP issue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">I have read in some other forums, ppls felt that we should back-down from this issue as MY can easily take up retributive actions against SG, or this PB issue is a classic example of Kiasu SGrean mentality.<span>  </span>I can only say, pls get your realities checked. Remember WW2? Neville chamberlain and many pacifists claim that by supporting </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Germany</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">’s claim on </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Austria</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">, Hilter will be contented and be willing to work with the western power. But it nv happened, Hilter went on to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Sudetenland</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> and eventually the whole of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Europe</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">. This example may not be perfect, but it illustrate the situation well. MY unilaterally increase their territorial wate from 3nm to 12nm without consulting neighouring ASEAN nations. By going to ICJ and winning it, we are sending a strong msg to MY not to push its luck and redefine its border into our backyard. If not, who knows when the 12nm may become 20nm the next day, and soon, all our offshore islands will be claimed by them. Lets not forget, SG depends heavily on maritime trade and activities like petrochemical industries. PB acts as a gate-keeper/sentry for the easten end of SG.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Let me give u a real-life example of how serious these ‘small’ problems can get. Not too long ago, PRC unilaterally planted naval markers in regions around an island of the spratley regions. PRC did this despite an agreement between ASEAN and PRC that indicates no party was allowed to build new structure unilaterally on these islands. The Estrada administration took a bold stand by sending F-5 to bomb those markers. PRC got the msg and no further buildings occurred. After a few yrs, during the Arroyo administration, PRC decided to test their luck and build some port facilities and watch towers on one of the island. Arroyo did not take up any action against them and merely raised some matters of concern to the PRC counterparts. This was a disastrous move as PRC are rapidly solidifying their infrastructures on the island. To rub salt on the wounds, PRC dangled millions of dollars of aid to the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">Philippines</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"> in exchange for their agreement to allow hydrographic exploration of the region. For that, I’m not sure whether they agreed, however if the pinoys agreed to it, their nightmare is abt to begin. Many may just think that those ocean surveys are just for innocent maritime studies. But most dun understand the implications of such activities in the military sense. It can be used for facilitating the planning of submarine usages during wartime, in which, PRC have many.<span>  </span>So one can see how not so innocent these small matters may seem.</span></p>

              <h1 class="clr">Island dispute between Singapore and Malaysia to be finally settled</h1>
              <p>The Hague: The International Court of Justice will hand down its
              verdict Friday over a sovereignty dispute between Malaysia and
              Singapore for an island half the size of a football field on the
              eastern approach to the Straits of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The dispute over the island known as Pedra Branca by Singapore and
              Pulau Batu Puteh by Malaysia, arose in 1980 after Malaysia published a
              map and included the islet within its maritime boundaries.</p>
              <p>Both
              parties agreed to seek the intervention of the UN court and the
              International Court of Justice heard arguments from both parties last
              November on sovereignty over Pedra Branca and a pair of nearby rock
              clusters known as Middle Rocks and South Ledge.</p>
              <p>Malaysia claims
              the land was always its property, although Singapore has been operating
              the Horsburgh Lighthouse on the island for more than 130 years.</p>
              <p>Sixteen judges who are elected by the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council, heard the Pedra Branca case.</p>
              <p>The
              judges hailing from countries like the US, China and Slovakia, included
              two ad—hoc judges, Mr P S Rao of India who was appointed by Singapore,
              and Mr Christopher John Robert Dugard from South Africa who was chosen
              by Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Presiding over the case was ICJ Vice—President, Awn Shawkat Al—Khasawneh, of Jordan.</p>
              <p>Normally,
              ICJ President, Rosalyn Higgins, would be part of the panel, however she
              excused herself from the case because Singapore had sought her opinion
              before she joined the Court.</p>
              <p>Pedra Branca is the first case that
              Singapore has referred to the ICJ, while for Malaysia, this is its
              second. Malaysia had brought its territorial dispute with Indonesia
              over the islands of Sipadan and Ligitan before the same court in 2002,
              and won the case.</p>
              <p>The aim of the ICJ, also known as the World
              Court, is to settle legal disputes between countries and to give
              advice. Without the court in the Hague, ICJ President, Rosalyn Higgins,
              believes it would be very hard to imagine how such issues could have
              been resolved.</p>
              <p>Speaking to Channel NewsAsia, Judge Higgins said
              it was the ICJ that first made clear that self determination is not
              just a political aspiration, but a legal right. "How important that has
              been in the world" she added.</p>
              <p>"I’m sure the world would be a less good place, had the court not been able to make its input."</p>
              <p>Decisions by the ICJ are binding and cannot be appealed.</p>
              <p>However, if one party fails to comply with the Court’s judgment, the other can bring the matter to the Security Council.</p>
              <p>But
              as Judge Higgins points out, "It’s now becoming appreciated that you
              can maintain very good relations with neighbours, which I know is very
              important for the Southeast Asian countries. Maintain very good
              relations with neighbours, while having a third party, the
              International Court, resolve a problem between you that you haven’t
              been able to settle yourselves."</p>
              <p>That was the step taken by
              Singapore and Malaysia, and both have said they will accept the ICJ
              outcome without letting it affect bilateral ties.</p>
              <p>The Court has delivered over 94 judgments on issues like territorial sovereignty and maritime boundaries since 1946. CNA—AFP/sf</p>
