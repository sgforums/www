                                1824, the island was not part of the secession and that the Sultan
                                of Johor only allowed the British to construct a lighthouse on the
                                island in 1844.[10] This follows a letter dated November 25 1844
                                from the Sultan and the Temenggung of Johor to the British which
                                gave the British a permission to build a lighthouse on an
                                island.[11] In 1824, Sultan of Johor ceded Singapore and the
                                surrounding 10 nmi (18.5 km) to the British East India Company.[12]

              <p>1. johor never claimed the island of pedra branca in its hundreds of years of history... so you cannot say that island belong to them since time immemorial...</p>
              <p>just because its near your house... doesnt make it belong to you. the same points applies to falkland being next to argentina but belong to british... like wise the french micronesia which is in the pacific ocean half way around the globe but belong to france.</p>
              <p>2. the treaty on cessation of singapore and the surrounding 10 nmi, only relates to singapore... it does not infer or imply that pedra branca must then belong to johor... the treaty never said that... nor did it imply that the british  accept johor ownership of pedra branca.</p>
              <p>the same argument was presented in the ligitan and sipadan argument... indonesia has a legal treaty which was signed by the anglo-dutch power, which stated that the border between the two powers is based on a straight latitude line cutting across an island next to kalimantan.</p>
              <p>the indonesian takes that as implying that all the water and island(including ligitan and sipadan) below that latitude line cutting across the island and all the way east as indonesians.</p>
              <p>however, the court totally disagreed... and stated that the treaty only relates to the island and nothing more should be implied by the treaty to assume that all the water and island south of the latitude line beyond the island mentioned must belong to indonesia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>with regard to the letter of permission to build the lighthouse... singapore has already proven to the court.. that the island mentioned was not pedra branca but peak rock which is a about 1 mile from johor mainland... through the various correspondence between governor butterworth and the johor sultan.</p>
              <p>furthermore.. malaysia was not able to produce the letter... which would mean it would carry little or no weight since no letter... how you know with absolute clarity and certainty its refering to wat? maybe it could be refering to a ship or a women call pedra branca.... it might even be a letter from the sultan to cede johor to the british.</p>
              <p>malaysia claimed that singapore has hidden the letter, which singapore denies base on 2 fact.</p>
              <p>1. the letter was addressed to the johor sultan... why would the letter be in singapore?</p>
              <p>2. complete singapore archieves were copied to various universities around the world including melbourn university well before the dispute arise over pedra branca... in the form of microfilms... all these microfilms and copies attested to the singapore point that such letter was not in singapore's possesion.</p>
              <p>malaysia's final day rebuttal however.. claimed that singapore have the letter because the sultan and the temengong was staying in singapore at that time.</p>
              <p>but honestly... its a weak counter... afterall, would malaysia file top secret files in singapore archieves because their prime minister happen to recieve the files while in singapore?</p>

              <p>the 1953 disclaimer by johor state secretary...</p>
              <p>malaysia claimed that the federation treaty prevents the johor state secretary from disowning pedra branca..</p>
              <p>a quick look into the malaysian federation treaty of 1948 would show that the malaysian federation is founded on the signatory states and any islands within 3 nmi of these states...</p>
              <p>how far is pedra branca from malaysia? 7.7 nmi... well beyond the specification of their federation treaty of 1948.</p>
              <p>thus the johor state secretary wasnt disclaiming/disowning/giving up/ceding or even selling anything...since pedra branca was never part of malaysia to begin with..... he is just saying the island pedra branca dont belong to johor just as he would answer that batam/java/sumatra and japan do not belong to johor.</p>

              <p>And Pedra Branca is not 1 rock. It's a few rocks. The main one on the lighthouse stands is the only one that's visible during high tide.</p>

              <p><br>You're the mistaken one.</p>
              <p>The lighthouse is very important. You guys must see for yourself why I say so.</p>
              <p>If you have this rock, you have control and access to the waters there. And it is an opening to the S China Sea, a very important one.</p>
              <p>And at Horsburg Lighthouse, there's equipments to monitor the ships there. Much like an eye for us to monitor the ships. In the same vein, having the area there under us means having a buffer zone.</p>
              <p>Lastly, it is a fight in which honour is at stake. There's no doubt about that.</p>
