              <p><br>Agree that it should not be blown out of proportion but while u feel that it is a "non-issue", i view it as current affairs which i've been monitoring for years.</p>
              <p>I am alive and I feel alive regardless of the rock. But I am interested in the outcome nevertheless. Is this interest so inconceivable to you? Does it seem more reasonable that EPL fans should lose sleep and wear their team colours and harangue fans of opposing teams of their misplaced loyalty?</p>
              <p>Why am I not as upset with loser FT atheletes? The simple answer is that I'm simply not a sports fan. I also do not believe that winning or losing in a sports game makes a country better.</p>
              <p>While losing a piece of rock in a strategic location where we have placed important navigation and communication equipment and which control gives us a strong advantage in the extent of our territorial waters and enables us to protect the sea-trade that is so important to us... Hmmm... Not important?</p>

              <p>I dont care about the rock. You still havent answered my question, what if Singapore loses the rock? Would you protest at Malaysian Embassy or ask for Walter Woon or Jaya to resign. Just wait and cross your fingers until May 23rd.</p>

              <p>the amateruish doctored photo is nothing if you compare to their OFFICIAL DOCTORED MAP! where pedra branca was moved 25 km north and place east of johor rather then in the straits of singapore.</p>
              <p>obviously singapore was not impressed and told the 16 judge about it.... and malaysian team didnt even dare to refute it in their last presentation.</p>

              <p>UN is oppose to USA's attack on afgan and iraq but USA still go and smack those islamic turban heads around. Any repercussions imposed on the US? sure, there is alot of talk but nothing was done againts USA for its strong arm actions. why is this so? it is because USA can smack anybody around so nothing was done.</p>
              <p>I propose that Singapore do the same. beef up its military might to smack ASEAN and take pedra branca by force</p>
