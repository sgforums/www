              <p>Dun worry lah, I think this unilateral change of name means nothing, it is simply sheer stupidity!! LOL</p>
              <p>During ICJ ruling, the judges have already given the legal definition for each landmarks:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>16. <strong>Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh is a granite island</strong>, measuring 137 m long, with an average width of 60 m and covering an area of about 8,560 sq m at low tide. It is situated at the eastern entrance of the Straits of Singapore, at the point where the Straits open up into the South China Sea. Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh is located at 1° 19' 48" N and 104° 24' 27" E.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>As for desciption in ICJ ruling for Middle rocks is "two clusters of small rocks" and South Ledge "is a rock formation only visible at low-tide." </p>
              <p>Even when dealing with the 1953 letters, the then Colonial Secretary of Singapore described it as "the rocks" , but in the court view , when giving judgment, it put inverted comma over "the rocks', as if the description is inconsistent with the current rules and regulation.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>204. The Singapore letter of 12 June 1953 seeks information about <strong>“the rock”</strong> as a whole and not simply about the lighthouse......</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>So the ICJ court has already defined each of them according to int'l laws, so they cannot suka suka change that fact, so do we need to worry!?!LOL</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Afterall, just like the ICJ case over Pedra Branca, MY thru 1953 letters and 11 official maps prior to 1979 had already admitted that Padra Branca belongs to SG.</p>
              <p><br>Likewise for the name change,MY prior to the ICJ judgment, MY had thru various official statements to the Press and during the proceedings in ICJ etc, I think at least a hundred times had referred (i.e. admitted) Pedra Branca as an Island!!!<br><br>Afterall, I believe there are internationally recognised legal definition of Islands and Rocks just in case for such dispute, especially if there is a difference between an Islands and Rocks regarding territorial seas, then there should be legal definition for Islands and Rocks.</p>
              <p>So there is no fxxking chance that this unilateral change of description will have any implication over the negotiation of territorial seas!!!</p>
              <p>Those loser is only good at twisting facts, insinuating and produce bogus evidence from a blog, other then that totally no substance!!! Lol</p>

              <p>Law Minister K Shanmugam says he will be surprised if Malaysia is
              able to produce new evidence to stake its claims on Pedra Branca.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a youth camp today Mr
              Shanmugam was commenting on suggestions that Malaysia is looking for
              new evidence.</p>
              <p>He said he wasn't quite certain what the legal basis of such suggestions are.</p>
              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><p><strong>My own view is, you know, the International Court has ruled. Both
              countries have said that they accept the ruling. I will be surprised as
              to what this new evidence is. We'll wait to see. Really difficult to
              comment on newspaper reports.</strong></p><strong>

              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">The International Court of Justice ruled in favour of Singapore in its 28-year sovereignty dispute with Malaysia over</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> Pedra Branca.</span></p>
              <p>But Malaysia's Foreign Minister Rais Yatim reportedly told local
              newspapers that he has directed his officials to search for new
              evidence to stake claims on Pedra Branca.</p>
              <p>He allegedly claimed that although the court's ruliing was final and
              not subject to appeal, a specific ruling in the court's rules allowed
              for a judicial review of a case within ten years if new evidence was
              found.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Sub—committee to oversee joint survey of Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Singaporean and Malaysian officials met on Tuesday to
              discuss the implementation of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
              judgement on Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge.</p>
              <p>The foreign ministers of both countries released a joint statement
              on Friday, saying that a technical sub—committee will be set up to
              oversee joint survey works, to prepare for eventual talks on maritime
              issues in and around that area.</p>
              <p>They also agreed that if an
              incident occurs, humanitarian assistance will be provided by either
              side, as part of a common aim to ensure safety and security in those
              waters.</p>
              <p>The joint committee representing the two countries also
              agreed that fishermen on both sides will be allowed to continue with
              their traditional fishing activities there.</p>
              <p>Both sides reiterated their commitment to honour and abide by the ICJ’s judgement, and fully implement its decisions.</p>
              <p>The
              two delegations were led by the Secretary—General of the Malaysian
              Foreign Affairs Ministry, Rastam Mohd Isa, and Permanent Secretary of
              Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Peter Ho.</p>
              <p>On May 23, the ICJ awarded sovereignty of Pedra Branca to Singapore, and ownership of Middle Rocks to Malaysia.</p>
              <p>The
              court, however, left the issue of South Ledge open, and said that it
              should belong to the state in the territorial waters of which it is
              located. — CNA/ac</p>
