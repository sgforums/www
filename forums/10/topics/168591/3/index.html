Even if you take a neutral stand, there is still some parts of you that will swayed towards one side. You may not feel so, but it is true.<br><br>I always think that I am taking a neutral stand for this WWII thingy, but I still find myself getting angry when the newspapers report.</div></blockquote>My feeling often goes left and right, got pissed off with china when their nationalism went wild during LHL's visit to Taiwan, but stood firmly on their side, and that of the Koreans whenever the japs visit the shrines and denied WW2 atrocities. I felt china should restrained themselves when they faced off the Phil in Spretly but I feel they are entitled to voice out loud in protecting their tourists visiting Malaysia. Put it this way, I am never on the side of the Japanese, with whoever they are disputing.<br><br>Balancing is nvr easy, more so for chinese who know about modern chinese history but I am looking at a balance of power in Asia, involving china, korea, india, japan, russian and Asean. with a balance of power, no small country will be forced, and I hope we will never have to take side, for we will never win if we do.<br><br>We have stood firm against the US, the OZ, the Chinese, the Malaysia, the Indonesia, the Phil, who else??
