            <div class='col-md body'>There is a false analogy in your "very simple argument" between human lineage and the succession of government. A child does not have to pay for his father's crimes because they are independent human beings who are responsible for their own actions. A government, however, is an extension and continuation of its predecessor in many respects and thus has to assume responsibilities for what happened in previous administrations. This is why the German government still expresses remorse for what happened in Hitler's times. This is why in any historical account about a government, there is normally a chronological account of it previous administrations. However, an autobiography of a human being stops when the person dies.  You do not go on and include the life of his children.<br>Hope you get the point.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by Fatum:<br><br><strong>I shall only use a very simple argument, one that i've used many many times over  here ... suppose a man kills somebody ... do we jail the man ... or go after his children ? ... do you think it's fair to judge these children for what their father did ? .... </strong><br></div>
