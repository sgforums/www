And it's always the same old song, in the same old tune.<br><br>Today, 2 days to National Day, I Looked out my window and I can see just one  or two flags displayed outside one or two balconies of the opposite block. My block itself, has only ONE flag displayed, and as I look further into distant estate visible from my window, I see NO flags displayed.<br><br>Some 10 years ago, ONE WEEK before National Day, there will already be flags hung up EVERYWHERE, and at EVERY block.<br><br>Can we see the difference? Do they ever notice?? Will they ask themselves WHY?<br><br>No, we do honor our country. We do not believe in violence. We will only NOT favor your views and policies until what needs to addressed or reformed are addressed and reformed. Not just in speeches and Rallies.<br><br>Since 1997, I have been waiting for improvements they said they will bring about - instead, life is becoming a nightmare even for the heartland General Practitioners!

I think we need "kwai Lan" people in politics and insist on an answer just like the "Mr Brown Mee Poh" case and how the current party cannot deliver but can only nick pick small issues about another party.
