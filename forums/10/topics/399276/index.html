              <p>The PAP and the state media have always propagated and perpetuated the myth that “multi-party” politics is “messy”, “confrontational” and “partisan” in nature and detrimental to the long-term interests of the country.</p>
              <p>Law Minister Shanmugam said no less than two times that Singapore needs a “strong” government with a “clear majority” to govern, in explicit reference to the PAP’s overwhelming dominance at the expense of a vibrant democracy in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The orderly transfer of power from the Labor Party to the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in the recent U.K general election is ample proof that politics can be both “confrontational” and “gentlemanly” at the same time.</p>
              <p>For those of you who have been watching the U.K parliamentary debates, you will not fail to notice the intense rivalry between the outgoing Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his nemesis David Cameron.</p>
              <p>However, both only have kind words for each other after Brown tendered his resignation for Cameron to take his place at the next Prime Minister of U.K.</p>
              <p>After announcing his resignation, Brown said:</p>
              <p><em>“I wish the next prime minister well as he makes the important choices for the future. Only those who have held the office of prime minister can understand the full weight of its responsibilities and its great capacity for good.”</em></p>
              <p>David Cameron returned the compliments hours later:</p>
              <p><em>”Before I talk about that new government, let me say something about the one that has just passed. Compared with a decade ago, this country is more open at home and more compassionate abroad and that is something we should all be grateful for and on behalf of the whole country I’d like to pay tribute to the outgoing prime minister for his long record of dedicated public service.”</em></p>
              <p>This is what “gentlemanly” politics is all about, not threatening to “fix” the opposition should more of them get elected into Parliament or calling in the army in the event of a “freak” election.</p>
              <p>The United Kingdom may have bequeathed its Westminister form of parliamentary democracy to Singapore, but obviously after fifty years and eleven general elections, we resemble more of a one-party totalitarian fascist police state than a functional democracy.</p>

              <p>ahahahahahaha... the people in temasek review got to be out of their fricken minds!!</p>
              <p>gentlemanly??</p>
              <p>Brown hung on desperately as long as he could trying to see if he could still be PM...</p>
              <p>the left and the right went into major horsetrading mode to scrabble together a coalition which seems doomed from the start (showing you what politicians will go through to get power)</p>
              <p>Cameron's people started immediately pulling the rug from under the people in need (like the right-wing shithead that they are) and the Lib-Dems probably can't or are refusing to see it coz they may still have their heads in their arses...</p>
              <p>Brown fell on his own sword only after his party made him to it because without him, the Lib-Dems may actually negotiate with Labour to form a "coalition of losers"... in fact, it was actually stated that they were in talks with Labour.. but Labour seemed to have double-crossed by the Lib-Dems...</p>
              <p>the list goes on and on.. and this was only one week of UK politics!!</p>
              <p>now.. gentlemanly? there is no such thing in the world of politics.. there is only backstabbing, trickery and deceit...</p>
