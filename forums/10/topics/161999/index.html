            <div class='col-md body'>by all common sense , void decks should never be used as playgrounds or even huge seating areas or study corners except for destinated ceremonies.<br><br>many of these plans are initiated by grassroots leaders and MP support to boost whatever they want support from residents. i am sure many have seen youths across the island burning stuffs in seats at void decks for the sake of having fun.  These youths will start testing out burning materials, like plastic, papers, wrappers and so on.  Police and grassroots or even town councils close blind eye as its a small matter.<br><br>even paints on concrete or wooded seats are potentially fire hazrd materials.   Few seats together with wrappers can generate into a huge fire potential fireball. WHO are the victim , the flats that are above these fire hazard.   Who is the creator of the event or situation.  The persons who initiated such things.<br><br>Seats must be limited to one set and not together for large gang of youths.<br><br>Who must pay?  The person who build or requested such dangers in the void deck.  and the youths who set the fire.  If happens in the dead of the night, someone will be burn alive in his deep sleep.<br><br>I am sure this will make all town councils rethink facilities in void decks if they are penalised, if not it will be just another passing episode.</div>
