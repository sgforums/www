Blame on human problem.<br><br>The building of play ground and study centres under void decks is definitely NO as it will be become more thrill for arsonist now.   Even more damage then motorcycles.

            <div class='col-md body'>I returned to show the police pictures taken on the ashes along the coridor, balcony, blacken wall and water mains. The NPP don't give a damn. I then insisted on filing a report for record. I even told them they shall be held responsible should there be a fire cause by incosiderate burning of incense in my block. They bo chap! wtf!<br><br>In the case of the Tampines fire, only with such damage that they take action. WTF, reactive and not proactive! Report in the papers the kids ranging from 8 to 12 were brought to the police station. What for? The NPP should wake up their f++king idea.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last time, CD got no divers in their unit. Now have liao, formed only recently.<br><br>Sometime in 1998, I called the civil defence for a drowning case. A worker was missing under the water when the sand bags collapsed. It was sea water flooding the monsoon drain which was still undergoing construction. Told the CD it's drowning and they have to call the naval diving unit for help to send divers. Guess what? They send fire fighters for a drowning case.<br><br>When the CD arrived, told the Captain that seawater flooded the monsoon drain. You know what the captain asked? Where can I pump out the water? Wow lao! a captain asking where to pump out seawater. How to depend on these CD, bird brain one...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
