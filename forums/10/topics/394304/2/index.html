              <p><br>For a millions times, please, mini wage is not viable for Singapore economy which has no natural resources, nor kampongs to go back to, I have no quolm that even if Oppositions took over as the ruling party of Singapore, they will still adopt this flexi wage system, because at the both extreme of mini wage, in term of singapore social economy, we are at disadvantage, no opposition MPs has ever bring out Mini wage system in the parliament, because as a trained or well versed economist, they can also see the disadvantages in it.</p>
              <p>First, if economy is up, employers will abide mini wage and paid as per mini wage, workers will suffer with more work and yet paid at the mini wage, that will lead to protest and strike as you seen in many countries</p>
              <p>2nd, if economy is down, employers will cut workers because they cannot sustain the mini wage labour cost, this lead to more unemployment and social unrest, and you can see that in many countries with mini wage too.</p>
              <p>3rd, singapore economy will be worst off with mini wage because going jobless and getting less paid in Singapore is not a joke, we got not natural resource or village for jobless people to go back and enjoy bananas or papayas and wait for the upturn in economy.</p>
              <p>You can said this and that or scold, but, please be clear about mini wage impacts on singapore workers and the society at large.</p>

              <div>Do support my petition to "Employ Singaporeans First" -</div>
              <div> </div>

              <div> </div>
              <div>Due to the recent high influx of foreigners, many of our own  people are been sidelined  by employers. Many new graduates are also  jobless now as they have to compete with  thousands of foreigners for jobs.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Our people are also not protected by any minimum wage policy here and their salaries have being pressed down by cheaper foreigner imports. Employers are kings now as they have a host of choices now whenever they advertise for positions. Many who apply  for jobs are foreigners.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>This petition urges all employers in Singapore to consider employing Singaporeans FIRST despite the slightly higher cost and their older age. If not, we will see ourselves being over-run by foreigners in time to come.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>If you support this cause, do sign on the peition so that we can rally together and bring hope to those who are jobless and struggling.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Do also spread this cause to your friends for active participation! We need to send the right message out to our government!</div>

              <p><br> For a millions times, please, mini wage is not viable for Singapore
              economy which has no natural resources, nor kampongs to go back to,
              I have no quolm that even if Oppositions took over as the ruling
              party of Singapore, they will still adopt this flexi wage system,
              because at the both extreme of mini wage, in term of singapore
              social economy, we are at disadvantage, no opposition MPs has ever
              bring out Mini wage system in the parliament, because as a trained
              or well versed economist, they can also see the disadvantages in
              it.</p>
              <p>First, if economy is up, employers will abide mini wage and paid
              as per mini wage, workers will suffer with more work and yet paid
              at the mini wage, that will lead to protest and strike as you seen
              in many countries</p>
              <p>2nd, if economy is down, employers will cut workers because they
              cannot sustain the mini wage labour cost, this lead to more
              unemployment and social unrest, and you can see that in many
              countries with mini wage too.</p>
              <p>3rd, singapore economy will be worst off with mini wage because
              going jobless and getting less paid in Singapore is not a joke, we
              got not natural resource or village for jobless people to go back
              and enjoy bananas or papayas and wait for the upturn in
              economy.</p>
              <p>You can said this and that or scold, but, please be clear about
              mini wage impacts on singapore workers and the society at
              large.</p>

              <p><br>That is different, i have many japs drinkers coming to my pub here. They are mostly doing sushi and some other jap food for top hotel and restaurant, it is a total different issue, Singaporeans selling curry pao or carrots cake in PRC had it unique Singapore style and taste, those are business venturers, they earn there, live there at that cost..sure to save alot if their business attract Q-up. But if you ask them to sell Carrots cake and curry pao here, they will have much competition.</p>
              <p>U go sweden and start a laksa shop, you may make tons of money, but u open one here may land you in debt. Futhermore, this are entrepreneurs or so called SME venturing overseas, not workers or employees looking for jobs ya.</p>
              <p>The last time, i want a experience accountant, i got 10 applications, 4 from india, 2 from Malaysia, 2 from PRC, 1 philipino, and 1 singaporean. My dad told me, about 15 to 20 years ago, when he advertised to employ an accountant, 10 out of 10 are Singaporeans. The 4 indians are age btw 28 to 40, malaysia are 30 to 35, PRC also about 30 to 35, philipino only 27 and Singaporean already 44yo. Now listen probably,</p>
              <p>Singapore put on expected salary to be $8,000</p>
              <p>out of the 4 indians,. 2 stated around 2.3k and another 2 only 1.8k to 2k, and one of them also got a computer science degree cum accountancy degree.</p>
              <p>PRC asked for between 2.5 to 3k</p>
              <p>Malaysia asked for 5k</p>
              <p>and philipino wrote negiotiable.</p>
              <p>We call up the singaporean and offered him 5k, he put down his hp and never called back....so in the end, i get a malaysian for 4k plus some allowances. And he is doing well, very well.</p>

              <div>Hi Dr Tan,</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>You were quote on the Straits Times saying, æ�¥DA should work actively to help citizens get jobs. When these people turn down jobs once, twice, three times, the Government then doesnæŠ° have to make apologies about bringing in foreign workers.?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Rather than just blaming Singaporeans for rejecting the jobs found by WDA, perhaps WDA should do more analysis for the reasons of objections by these Singaporeans? I suspect that salary is the main issue here. How do you expect an over 40 years old retrenched Singaporean with 2 schooling kids and a HDB loan to pay off to survive on $1K+ salary? $1K+ may be alright for foreigners but certainly it's not going to be enough for Singaporeans with families. The main problem is really, we are over importing foreigners which in turn depresses our salaries in Singapore.</div>
