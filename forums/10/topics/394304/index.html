              <h1>LKY School Prof: Singaporeans are “protesting” too much that foreigners are taking away their jobs</h1>
              <p>An economist and associate professor from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Dr Tan Khee Giap has lashed out at Singaporeans for complaining about foreigners taking away their jobs.</p>
              <p>Echoing PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew’s views that Singaporeans are “champion grumblers”, Dr Tan claimed that Singaporeans are “protesting too much” at a roundtable session at the Tax Academy of Singapore’s annual Budget seminar yesterday.</p>
              <p>He told the audience presence that figures last year showed that about three out of ten job vacancies had been unfilled for at least six months which implied that Sinagporeans are turning away the jobs.</p>
              <p>Dr Tan did not provide any explanation as to why the unfilled jobs are not accepted by Singaporeans. Perhaps the pay is too low and the working hours are too long.</p>
              <p>The PAP and the state media have been busy trying to portray Singaporeans are being “fussy” in job application to deflect blame from their discriminatory labor polices which favor the foreigners.</p>
              <p>In the last few weeks alone, the Temasek Review has published job advertisements put up by companies based in Singapore seeking foreigners for positions which can otherwise be filled by Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Dr Tan accused some Singaporeans of being “voluntarily unemployed” and suggested that “every resident worker who is unemployed for more than three months should be made to register with the Workforce Development Agency (WDA), which will have to help him find a job based on his last drawn pay.”</p>
              <p><em>“The WDA can then track how many times each unemployed person turns down a job – much like the statistics the Housing Board recently revealed of new flat buyers turning down flat options,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>He believes that WDA rejection rate will be “fairly high” without substantiating his statements and that this will “quash the perception there are not enough jobs to go around for Singaporeans.”</p>
              <p><em>“WDA should work actively to help citizens get jobs. When these people turn down jobs once, twice, three times, the Government then doesn’t have to make apologies about bringing in foreign workers,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Being an economist by training, it is appalling that Dr Tan is not aware of the basic fact that having jobs alone is not enough – the jobs must pay reasonably well to ensure a decent standard of living for Singapore workers.</p>
              <p>The PAP has opened the floodgates to foreign workers without putting in adequate measures to safeguard the interests of Singaporeans. It is impossible to expect Singaporeans to compete directly with the cheaper foreigners while remaining “cheaper, better and faster” at the same time.</p>
              <p>Despite recent promises made by PAP leaders to “slow” the inflow of foreigners to placate angry Singaporeans, Dr Tan continues to call for foreign workers to spur Singapore’s growth:</p>
              <p><em>“Foreign workers, while unpopular, are necessary for Singapore’s growth, which may not be able to rise on higher productivity alone. This is especially so as the Government has been spending more than it earns – for instance, on help for the needy – and running budget deficits for a number of years now,”</em> Dr Tan said.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, the relentless influx of foreign workers in recent years has depressed the ordinary wages of Singaporeans, increased the cost of living and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>It is pretty obvious that there will not be any major overhaul of the PAP’s disastrous liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies so long it remains in power.</p>
              <p>Unless Singaporeans reclaim their rights as citizens of their country and vote out the despotic PAP regime in the next general election, they will soon be relegated to second class minorities in their own homeland with the males having to serve two years of National Service to protect the lives and wealth of the PAP elites and the immigrants.</p>

              <p>This was roughly the same level as the year before and implies that Singaporeans are turning their noses up at some jobs, he said at a seminar on Budget 2010.</p>

              <h1>LKY School Prof: Singaporeans are “protesting” too much that
              foreigners are taking away their jobs</h1>
              <p>An economist and associate professor from the Lee Kuan Yew
              School of Public Policy Dr Tan Khee Giap has lashed out at
              Singaporeans for complaining about foreigners taking away their
              jobs.</p>
              <p>Echoing PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew’s views that Singaporeans are
              “champion grumblers”, Dr Tan claimed that Singaporeans are
              “protesting too much” at a roundtable session at the Tax Academy of
              Singapore’s annual Budget seminar yesterday.</p>
              <p>He told the audience presence that figures last year showed that
              about three out of ten job vacancies had been unfilled for at least
              six months which implied that Sinagporeans are turning away the
              jobs.</p>
              <p>Dr Tan did not provide any explanation as to why the unfilled
              jobs are not accepted by Singaporeans. Perhaps the pay is too low
              and the working hours are too long.</p>
              <p>The PAP and the state media have been busy trying to portray
              Singaporeans are being “fussy” in job application to deflect blame
              from their discriminatory labor polices which favor the
              foreigners.</p>
              <p>In the last few weeks alone, the Temasek Review has published
              job advertisements put up by companies based in Singapore seeking
              foreigners for positions which can otherwise be filled by
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Dr Tan accused some Singaporeans of being “voluntarily
              unemployed” and suggested that “every resident worker who is
              unemployed for more than three months should be made to register
              with the Workforce Development Agency (WDA), which will have to
              help him find a job based on his last drawn pay.”</p>
              <p><em>“The WDA can then track how many times each unemployed
              person turns down a job – much like the statistics the Housing
              Board recently revealed of new flat buyers turning down flat
              options,”</em> he was quoted as saying in the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>He believes that WDA rejection rate will be “fairly high”
              without substantiating his statements and that this will “quash the
              perception there are not enough jobs to go around for
              Singaporeans.”</p>
              <p><em>“WDA should work actively to help citizens get jobs. When
              these people turn down jobs once, twice, three times, the
              Government then doesn’t have to make apologies about bringing in
              foreign workers,”</em> he added.</p>
              <p>Being an economist by training, it is appalling that Dr Tan is
              not aware of the basic fact that having jobs alone is not enough –
              the jobs must pay reasonably well to ensure a decent standard of
              living for Singapore workers.</p>
              <p>The PAP has opened the floodgates to foreign workers without
              putting in adequate measures to safeguard the interests of
              Singaporeans. It is impossible to expect Singaporeans to compete
              directly with the cheaper foreigners while remaining “cheaper,
              better and faster” at the same time.</p>
              <p>Despite recent promises made by PAP leaders to “slow” the inflow
              of foreigners to placate angry Singaporeans, Dr Tan continues to
              call for foreign workers to spur Singapore’s growth:</p>
              <p><em>“Foreign workers, while unpopular, are necessary for
              Singapore’s growth, which may not be able to rise on higher
              productivity alone. This is especially so as the Government has
              been spending more than it earns – for instance, on help for the
              needy – and running budget deficits for a number of years
              now,”</em> Dr Tan said.</p>
              <p>According to a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, the
              relentless influx of foreign workers in recent years has depressed
              the ordinary wages of Singaporeans, increased the cost of living
              and led to an overall decline in the standards of living.</p>
              <p>It is pretty obvious that there will not be any major overhaul
              of the PAP’s disastrous liberal immigration and pro-foreigner
              policies so long it remains in power.</p>
              <p>Unless Singaporeans reclaim their rights as citizens of their
              country and vote out the despotic PAP regime in the next general
              election, they will soon be relegated to second class minorities in
              their own homeland with the males having to serve two years of
              National Service to protect the lives and wealth of the PAP elites
              and the immigrants.</p>

              <p>As far as check it out, LKY school of public policy still need a Dean, and basically, Dr Ah Tan is looking forward to it. Well, you can't be that blind to see it, and you can't be so unkind to him, he is merely earning a living.</p>
              <p>The question this Dr failed to address is the paid, singaporeans are choosy, not just because of transportation, or shift work, or dirty jobs, but rather most will balance themselve between cost of living here and the paid given, if the paid justify a deficit impact to the cost of living here, how on earth, is a local going to take the job?? It will end up pay and pay to the govt, resulting in no saving, not enuf the spent, and certainly, poor condition.</p>
