              <p>a professor but yet making a fatal mistake- not factoring in the standard of living cost here to verify if we are really choosy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and for the million time and beyond-min wage is a must have here, since when it is not beneficial for the economy? this would really prevent employers from making shady deals and holding the govt "hostage" by taking advantage of the situation here, also to angel7030 miscule mindset whos small scale sight is grossly ignoring the larger picture, it also pans and balances the after effects caused by the large influx foriegn workers here while at the smale time slowing the intake, it also slows the overheating rising cost of the standard of living here.</p>
              <p>so what do you have to counter this time angel 7030?</p>

              <p><br>Dear Uncle,</p>
              <p>First of all, in life, sometime you have to think in miscule, otherwise you find it difficult to understand certain problem, why think big when you are not big. I see many Uncles talk big, but earn little ya. So try to think small first before you embark on big things if you can afford to do so.</p>
              <p>I am still young, but for those uncles or aunties who had lives here for decades, ask yourself, is there a time when cost of living goes down??? no right? it is alway rising, not only in Singapore, but all over the world, it just that we are bit faster because of our ever fast changing economy and adaptation. The govt takes cost of living as a cane to it any laymen on the street, if cost of living remain the same or lowered, peoples tends to laze off, become complacent and have no morale to work hard or improve themselves, just like some 3rd world countries, the cost of living do increase, but not much, therefore people there are not so hardworking and do not have the sense of improvement so as to earn higher paid. Many Singaporeans who travelled use to nag and complain about such countries poor and slow services. But that is the way of their life, no morale, no kick, no cane to beat them on.</p>
              <p>Any layman on the street, will knows that a plate of chicken rice in singapore cost average $3 now, if tomollow, the price goes up to $4, what happens??? that layman will sense that cost of living is up, he would grumble and curse alots, but life still goes on.</p>
              <p>On the hindsight, this layman knows that he needs to get higher paid to off set  inflation, and to do that, he needs to be better educated and trained with better skills to offer himself to the market at a higher paid, he also needs to save and be wary of his finanical situation, in another words, he will move on and improve himself to work harder, smarter and more skillful in order to get a better job with higher paid, better position, higher paid increment, higher promotion etc etc just to match it. It is a continous improvement progression, and that is what the govt wants, by increasing the cost in secondary products (with the primary being essential goods which most are capable of fulfilling), people will be motivated to move toward achieving those goods. And that, on the whole, move the whole country economy, skills, education, improvement and productivity to the next level of standard of living.</p>
              <p>So, to put it simply, by using the cost of living as a cane, people will move, and the carrot will be improvement and better living conditions.</p>

              <p>i sorry but i have different way around that, what you describe is only for here, not as humanity as a whole, granted we need to improve ourselves..but you made 1 mistake again: did the japanese need a cane and carrot to dangle to improve themselves?</p>
              <p>the last i know in the 80s to mid 90s there was a good number of sporeans learning something that almost like basic japanese way od work.</p>
              <p>and as again i need to stress this: not every employer is like you, since your view os only one sided abd bias the ruling party kind of thinking..i suppoes you have not run into those that is at present abusing the employment system, or shall i put to you a sceneario where you have a office or home where you get a contractor to do renovations, who inturn get some cheap labour but with only 1 thing: "finish the job on time and make the outward apperance look nice", which inturm is the main cause of shoddy workmanship and give you a ton or problems with additoonal cost to recitify the faults?? why did this happen in the first place?? coz the system has already allow such things to happen not only to citizens home, but to also a few govt projects, i believe the  famous recent "nicoll highway incident" can be attirbute to this cause?</p>
              <p>you said a cane and a carrot is used to get people to improve themselves here but as times are a changing, it getting more and more less effective, self improvement and time is more effient way of improving, after all who want a ton of problems that can give headaches and not benefical to them?. once they are passed this point, the rest of what the people can accomplish is an est 2-5 time greater than that of your predicited output, provided if they know how to do their jobs well, regardless with or without the cane and carrot, it have no effect on them.</p>

              <p>You are reasoning with a forumer who claims that eating chicken wings is hazardous, and when challenged, posted a scam article that existed since 2004 claiming that injection of antibiotics are made to the wing of the chicken.</p>
              <p>And when exposed for his/her/it's stupidity, came out with a claim that he/she/it went to visit a chicken farm in Malaysia and saw them doing it.</p>
              <p>And when exposed again for the stupidity (and whether it's even practical) to inject each chicken manually with antibiotics (the actual thing is to place the antibiotics into the feed for the chickens), claims that an art film is evidence that eating chicken wings is hazardous.</p>
              <p>Absolute nonsense from someone who doesn't know when to shut up and instead choose to continuously be a clown and get whalloped for stupid comments made.</p>
