              <p>Naturally in a capitalist society, the rich get richer and the poor, poorer. In sg's context, this problem is further compounded by the import of cheap labour to work as our executives and professionals, causing a downward pressure on salary levels.</p>
              <p>And we have been told that these foreigners help us keep our jobs, 'cos without them, the companies would have high costs, then collapse and we lose our farking jobs!! Hahaha, I love the way they sweep these statements.</p>

However, our cost of living is still far below them. For their poor, they really cannot make it in life there. But having a average wage here attract foreign investors, which is very important for singapore, especially a country without natural resources. If you look at some of the europe wage level, it is very high and that lead to investor moving away from them, even their own country big companies are moving out to invest in lower wage country like china, indonesia singapore etc etc.... , so as long as our consumer price index is at the norm range, we shouldn't be saying that our paidis low.

              <p>Perspective differentiation at play. Our bus stop and road side is a heaven for bangadesh and some indians from poor state of their countries, we move them in with residents, all start to complain like the serangoon case, we move them into dormitory, people like you start to claim outsouring or diversion of poverty. In my opinon, in an economy sense, these peoples come and help us build our economy physically, added the drained physical strength that our own workforce is depleting, I have alway respect them, poor or not poor, as long as they work, no rob, no snatch, no make money illegally, we should welcome them. And if you study the condition and statistics of crime rates for the past few years, Local and PRs are committing much much more layman offences such as cheating, molesting, raping, corruption etc etc than a foreign worker, in another words, they are more well behave, just the look seem to scare you off.</p>

              <p>With the strengthening of the sg dollar lately, sg low wages strategy of cheap foreign labourer or 'FT' is becoing a joke to ppl who live outside sg who see things outside-in.  I always though that the cyclical thinking mentality happen only in underdevelop countries but it sad to see how our leadership in sg keep churning out conflicting policy. If we really want to increase our competitiveness we should be consistence, either lower our wages or lowering our currency. It is so stupid on one hand, lower the salary by 5-10% and or the other hand increase the currency by 5-10% and start telling the world that we want cost of operating in sg competitive!</p>

              <p>The reason is simple.<br><br>As Singapore opens her domestic economy to global talent, there will be a global-led pressure on domestic demand (inflation).</p>
