            <div class='col-md body'>Japan's debate on privatization<br><br>By James Rose The Straits Times / Asia News Network<br>2005.12.28<br><br>There is a lot to be bothered about in relation to the faked building-safety reports scandal rocking Japan at the moment. First there are the immediate problems - fixing the potentially unsafe buildings, ensuring the safety of residents, cleaning up Japan's construction sector. But there are bigger issues at play as well, and their implications stretch across Asia and beyond.<br>As some commentators have noted, standards in Japan's building inspections began falling when the industry was deregulated in 1999. One of the unintended consequences of that deregulation was that safety inspectors began to develop a cosy relationship with their clients.<br><br>Some inspectors became unwilling to find fault in the course of their examinations of buildings lest they lose future business from their developer clients.<br><br>Allowing private interests such scope may have made an already problematic business culture in Japan's building sector worse.<br><br>The safety of residents became just another factor to consider against bottom-line profit concerns.<br><br>Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, arguably the political pioneer of privatization, was always pretty clear about why she believed in it. In her memoirs, she wrote: "For me it was one of the central means of reversing the corrosive and corrupting effects of socialism." As such, her moves to sell Britain's utilities, including splitting British Telecom from the Post Office and opening up the telco sector to another server, were, at their core, ideological.<br><br>Does Asia need this ideological war to be brought to its shores?<br><br>Privatization debates are raging across the region. In Pakistan, there is uproar over proposals to sell off the country's nationally owned telecommunications and electricity concerns.<br><br>In Thailand, the proposed listing of 25 percent of electricity provider Egat has been blocked twice by public protests and subsequent court rulings, despite the fact that it was a cornerstone of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's 2005 election platform.<br><br>Australia is still in the grip of a heated debate over the sale of the majority government-owned telco, Telstra, though parliament has already passed legislation approving the sale.<br><br>South Korea, Vietnam, China - there's virtually no Asian country where privatization is not a major issue.<br><br>India's struggle with the issue is probably the most explosive. Its influential communist parties, especially at the state level, are seeking to block a range of high-profile national asset sell-offs, including airports, universities, banks, electricity and water utilities.<br><br>The issue has mobilized civic groups, given them momentum and profile and brought cities to a halt as protests and rallies clog the thoroughfares.<br><br>It is important to remember that privatization has historically brought about a radical alteration of organisational culture in the affected companies. Bureaucratic caution - some may say laziness or insouciance - tends to give way to a hard-nosed business approach, where the bottom line is revered.<br><br>In Australia, for instance, deregulation of the government-run wheat export authority, AWB, may have contributed to that authority's becoming embroiled in the United Nations' oil-for-food kickback scandal. It was named as a major player in funding Iraq's Saddam Hussein through the oil-for-food program.<br><br>Japan's current construction scandal potentially raises similar social concerns. But is Japan debating the question?<br><br>Prime Minister Koizumi won re-election this year by replacing the term "privatization" with "reform." All agree Japan is in need of serious reform in important areas of its business and administrative culture. The term "reform" suggests getting things done and fixing up a broken system. It was a smart move on Koizumi's part.<br><br>"Privatization," however, is a far more loaded and less easily digestible term.<br><br>Japan doesn't need to sell off the assets it has built up over decades of hard work and sacrifice, especially to international interests, on the basis of poor debate and the application of skewed ideological imports. Despite Koizumi's stunning re-election, Japan still needs a debate on privatization and its so-called "reform" agenda.<br><br>Given its role in the region, and current trends, this is a debate it should have, and it should be in the interests of all who have a stake in Asia.<br><br><a href="http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2005/12/28/200512280003.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2005/12/28/200512280003.asp</a></div>
