            <div class='col-md body'>The flawed argument that helping single moms would encourage more of such cases is simply illogical. Why more any rational person be "encouraged" to take the risk of bearing such a heavy burden, jus 'cos the Govt may be more forgiving..<br><br>Another point is perhaps heavier penalties shld be melted to the irresponsible fathers. Why have all these jerks got away totally scot free, free of any responsibilties towards the child as well as any social responsibilites.<br>It does not make sense when u view it this way: A man who is responsible, got married but realized somethk wrong later in life, seek a divorce &amp; has to have half of his fortune splited (or made to pay monthly alimonies ).<br><br>But for these jerks who f-u-c-k &amp; flee, they are not held liable. These ppl would most likely move on in life &amp; start a new family, with nothing more than a bad memory?<br><br>How difficult is to locate these irresponsible men &amp; then impose penalties on them?

[/b]</blockquote>i beg to differ.  according single moms the same privileges and tax rebates is hardly a sign to encourage people to have babies out of wedlock.  ask yourself and people around you.  will one starts sleeping around and be irresponsible just because of the privileges and tax rebates.  your concern is a bit stretched.<br><br>without the proper support in place we are only adding to the burden of single mums.  there is no denying that they have made a mistake.  but who doesn't make mistakes?  like ex-convicts they should be given a chance and proper support.</div>

Period.</div></blockquote>Perhaps. But you have the choice. If you choose to have the child, you should be prepared for the responsibilities that come along with it. If you aren't able to support the child, whether or not society frowns on abortions, it is a life that you must be ready to bear full responsibility for. Where do you think the govt gets the dough to fund these 'perks' that single mothers want to ask for? They are single, they get whatever 'perks' the govt allots to singles; if they are marrieds/families, they get whatever 'perks' the govt allots the marrieds/families. So is the single mother asking for special treatment - to be eligible for whatever it is that singles are eligible for <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">and</span></strong> to be eligible for what married parents are eligible for? Are single mothers discriminated against from purchasing flats that any other single, unmarried person is allowed?<br><br>And I don't get the comparison between a single mother and a convict. They seem to be completely separate issues. My understanding of the situation with giving convicts a second chance simply this: asking people to employ them so that they are given the opportunity to contribute to society.  Are employers being given cashbacks or refunds by the govt for employing them? Does anyone know about this?</div>
