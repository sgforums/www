If you choose to have the child, you should be prepared for the responsibilities that come along with it. If you aren't able to support the child, whether or not society frowns on abortions, it is a life that you must be ready to bear full responsibility for. Where do you think the govt gets the dough to fund these 'perks' that single mothers want to ask for? They are single, they get whatever 'perks' the govt allots to singles; if they are marrieds/families, they get whatever 'perks' the govt allots the marrieds/families. So is the single mother asking for special treatment - to be eligible for whatever it is that singles are eligible for [b]<span style="font-style: italic;">and</span></strong> to be eligible for what married parents are eligible for? Are single mothers discriminated against from purchasing flats that any other single, unmarried person is allowed?<br><br>And I don't get the comparison between a single mother and a convict. They seem to be completely separate issues. My understanding of the situation with giving convicts a second chance simply this: asking people to employ them so that they are given the opportunity to contribute to society.  Are employers being given cashbacks or refunds by the govt for employing them? Does anyone know about this?[/b]</blockquote>Then, do you want them to abort or abandon the child?</div>
