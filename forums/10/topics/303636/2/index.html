However if there are tests involved there should another piece of paper that states how well this person has done. All the more if these tests are a certification of professionalism or expertise. Did you get that? You might want to send a note to the Thai body for it.<br><br></div>

And I've calculated that my graduation will be in mid 2008, a time where it might be hard to find jobs due to a possible recession, which led me to search for a job right after JC (for working immediately after graduation).<br><br>Result: I secured a job in 2005.<br><br>Analysis: Economy has periods of ups and downs, something like a sinusoidal curve. Currently, one period is around 10 years plus a bit. History wise, the previous recession was 97/98. The one before was the late 1980s. And the one before was a number of years in the 1970s. Thus, one can already expect that the next possible recession is around 2008/2009.<br><br>I've told a few friends before, but none took me seriously.
