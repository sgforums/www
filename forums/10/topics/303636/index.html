They have to do something.<br><br>When you say: 'by then our 2 IRs completed and our stock and ppty mkts will crash further.....now ppty still shooting thru the sky and severe downturn expected by 2090-2010.Agree?'<br><br>... I would only say, right now, agree but, watch and see.<br><br>'Watch and see what?' you might ask.<br><br>Lookout for further developments! If the 'further developments' does not change anything, then you continue with your expectations. If it can change the course that we see it going, then you have to change your mind!<br><br>For example yesterday's rally. Did it change anything? Do you change your expectations? No! It was a fool's rally!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>There is no room for sentimentality and to hold on to your positions and predictions with pride. Forget Pride Love Pity Hate and look at the circumstances will a heart of stone and eyes of an eagle.<br><br>The despots will not just sit back and watch. So you try to predict what they will be doing and ride on their despotic tail-coats when they take their despotic actions.  They will say one (nice, politically correct) thing and do another. (2% GST increase is to help the poor)<br><br>That is why I said so many times, to make money, you cannot just blindly read the propaganda the immoral despots churn out in the controlled mass media.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
