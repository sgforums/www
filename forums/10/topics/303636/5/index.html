            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure if I'm still on topic but here's my 2 cents:<br><br>During the last 2 decades, USA borrowed and bought while much of the rest of the world lent and sold. Simply put, the main reason why an American recession might cause the whole world to crash is because they are one of the world's biggest consumers and have one of the world's biggest demands.<br><br>Now, the global economy seems to be taking a turn. American exporters are finding overseas markets for their products while Asia, the Middle East and Africa are absorbing more of the world's imports than they did before. So, instead of depending as heavily on USA for demand, the world economy could become more balanced.<br><br>More importantly, we have the power of a new engine. And that is China. For several decades, Asian economies like Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong etc have actually accounted for more of global GDP growth than America has. Now, I have read that by the end of this year, China alone will for the first time accomplish the same growth as the 4 or 5 other Asian countries did, all on its own.<br><br>Of course, if America suffers a recession, then Asia's exports will also weaken. But there is still Europe (and the African countries), China and most other Asian countries are now exporting more to the European Union than to America. Besides, the Chinese government is trying to keep the yuan artificially weak against the dollar, and this masks the influence that the China will be exerting on the world economy.<br><br>So you see what I'm getting at? Even if USA falls in the next decade (which they probably won't), chances of the world going down with them is not as high as it used to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the only weapon from the poor Fed<br><strong><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080122/ap_on_bi_ge/fed_interest_rates" rel="nofollow"> Fed cuts interest rate 3/4 of a point,22.01.2008--no joke</a></strong><br><blockquote><br><br>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer 3 minutes ago,Singapore time<br>(10.20pm,22.01.2008 posted on this forum)<br><br>WASHINGTON - The Federal Reserve, confronted with a global stock sell-off fanned by increased fears of a recession, slashed a key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point on Tuesday and indicated further rate cuts were likely.<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>The surprise reduction in the federal funds rate from 4.25 down to 3.5 percent marked the biggest one-day rate move by the central bank since it cuts its discount rate by a full percentage point in December 1991, a period when the country was struggling to get out of a recession.<br><br>Analysts said the Fed will likely delay cutting rates further at its Jan. 29-30 meeting but will probably keep moving rates down aggressively as the economy continues to weaken.<br><br>"This move is not an instant fix," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. "The economy is still staring recession in the face, but at least the Fed now gets it."<br><br>In addition to cutting the funds rate, the Fed said it was reducing its discount rate, the interest it charges to make direct loans to banks, by a similar three-quarters of a percentage point, pushing this rate down to 4 percent.<br><br>Commercial banks responded to the Fed's action on the funds rate by announcing similar cuts of three-quarter of a percent on its prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of business and consumer loans. The action will mean the prime lending rate will drop from 7.25 percent down to 6.50 percent.<br><br>The Fed action was the most dramatic signal it can send that it is concerned about a potential recession in the United States.<br><br>The Fed decision was taken during an emergency telephone conference with Fed officials on Monday night. Those discussions occurred after global financial markets had plunged Monday as investors grew more concerned about the possibility that the United States, the world's largest economy, could be headed into a recession.<br><br>In a brief statement, the Fed said it had decided to cut the federal funds rate "in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth."<br><br>The central bank said that the strains in short-term funding markets have eased a bit, but "broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets."<br><br>The move caught financial markets by surprise. Many had expected the central bank would wait until its meeting next week to make any move in interest rates. The Fed made the move before markets had opened in the United States, hoping that the bold move would limit the decline in U.S. stocks.<br><br>Before Tuesday's move, the Fed had cut interest rates three times, beginning in September, the month after a severe credit crunch had roiled Wall Street and global financial markets. The Fed cut the funds rate by a half-point in September and then by smaller quarter-point moves in October and December.<br><br>In its statement, the Fed said, that "appreciable downside risks to growth remain" and held out the prospect of further rate cuts.<br><br>"The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risk," the Fed statement said.<br><br>The Fed's action was approved on an 8-1 vote with William Poole, president the Fed's regional bank, dissenting. The statement said that Poole objected because he did not believe current conditions justified a rate move before the Fed's meeting next week.</blockquote><img src="http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20080121/capt.ccb619bf589e483ba6d90ec2800798cf.recession_watch_nybz104.jpg?x=180&amp;y=119&amp;q=85&amp;sig=ecAxv5WPmbRbzekKbwwbGw--"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Birkin_H:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm not sure if I'm still on topic but here's my 2 cents:<br><br>During the last 2 decades, USA borrowed and bought while much of the rest of the world lent and sold. Simply put, the main reason why an American recession might cause the whole world to crash is because they are one of the world's biggest consumers and have one of the world's biggest demands.<br><br>Now, the global economy seems to be taking a turn. American exporters are finding overseas markets for their products while Asia, the Middle East and Africa are absorbing more of the world's imports than they did before. So, instead of depending as heavily on USA for demand, the world economy could become more balanced.<br><br>More importantly, we have the power of a new engine. And that is China. For several decades, Asian economies like Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong etc have actually accounted for more of global GDP growth than America has. Now, I have read that by the end of this year, China alone will for the first time accomplish the same growth as the 4 or 5 other Asian countries did, all on its own.<br><br>Of course, if America suffers a recession, then Asia's exports will also weaken. But there is still Europe (and the African countries), China and most other Asian countries are now exporting more to the European Union than to America. Besides, the Chinese government is trying to keep the yuan artificially weak against the dollar, and this masks the influence that the China will be exerting on the world economy.<br><br>So you see what I'm getting at? Even if USA falls in the next decade (which they probably won't), chances of the world going down with them is not as high as it used to.</div></blockquote>1) Exporters to USA are suffering from rising raw material (cost) weakening US Dollar (selling price) and weakening consumer spending (strinking market).<br><br>2) USA import about US$1,800 billions worth of goods a year, which is more than half size of China GDP. Plus lets not forget that Japan (the second largest economy in the world) is already heading for recession.<br><br>Lets not kid ourselves. when the USA goes into a recession, all hell will break loose, China stock market will crashed and this will lead to the burst of the China red hot property bubble and then global recession begin.<br><br></div>
