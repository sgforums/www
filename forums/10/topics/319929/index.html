              <p>The Question in the topic Title assumes that whatever we have today is at the cost of political freedom.</p>
              <p>For example, not arresting Chee is not going to me poorer. The pliant press and media have succesfully made him look stupid to many citizens already, anyway.</p>
              <p>What I am willing to give... hmm, give up some of the BUDGET SURPLUSo that we have year after year... for some political freedoms.</p>
              <p>The freedom to disagree with the state, even verhemently, as long as I remain non-violent. Thats not going to make SG a worse off place to live in is it?</p>
              <p>I want to distribute flyers about something I disgree agree about, using recycled paper and not littering. Thats not going to make Sg a worse of place to live in is it?</p>
              <p>If I so choose to represent an ISA detainee, do I have to get locked up under the ISA as well?</p>

              <p>I wonder how much value will the Great Mentor Shepherd give in return if we were to trade the life of a black sheep that pretend to be a Gazelle - in exchange for all that we are supposed to be entitled to as spelled out in the Singapore Constitution.</p>
              <p>Should there be a trade-off when the good things are already paid for by the Citizens ?</p>
              <p>This is an attempt at insulting the intelligence of everyone by this sheep who has sold his own freedom, that paid for the high standards of health-care, security, transportation, food, housing, employment, cleanliness, and stability - and despite having paid the initial large downpayments, we are continuously milked to maintain the high standards of these essential services - while the government surplusses become bloated annually.</p>
              <p>With the bloated annual surpluses from Singaporean's hard labor and sacrifices, the Government will have the shameless audacity to pat themselves on their back for a good job done at screwing the wallets and savings of the Citizens.</p>
              <p>Only a Sheep will dream of asking others to follow his ways deeper into the pen to have the Great Shepherd tear remove the shirts from our backs.</p>
              <p>Surely, this Sheep is not after our under-garments after leading us to the Great Shepherd ?</p>
              <p>Has he changed his habits to be less discerning of whose undergarment he want to sniff ?</p>

              <p>must one always give something up in return for something? singapore still can be as successful, probably more if there is political maturity in her.</p>
              <p>you are implying that for most singaporean to have a roof over their head, 3 decent meals, good public transports, gainfully employed, etc., one must be subjected to the kind of political strangulation that we are experiencing now.</p>

              <p>Freedom from the LKY oppression. I was a foreigner in your country and the ruler of your island turned out to be a psychopath. All I did was falling in love with a girl in the Bukit batok Catholic church: St. Mary of the Angels. It has been 7 years of abuses and tortures. You know the most hurtful thing that could happen is when your own mother betray you.</p>
              <p>I was starved in the hospital for three days and not allowed to call anyone even when I asked for a telephone, eventually they did give me a phone but they killed the line.</p>
              <p>When I was in the ambulance a distincly Chinese Singaporean accent male said over the Ambulance radio that they just wanted to play with me. Everybody inside pretended not to hear anything.</p>
              <p>I jumped off the MRT platform because I was so scared because I was manipulated into believing that the ruler of Singapore is satanic. Stupid eh?</p>
              <p><span style="color: navy;">I'm a victim of grave abuses from people
                                                      in power in Singapore with access to telepathic person(s). They have
                                                      friends here too. All abuses are to convince people I'm mentally ill to
                                                      cover their grave evil. Even my own mother abuses and defames me
                                                      insisting I'm mentally ill i.e crazy. telepathy is not a fiction it's a fact though it's not a public fact.</span></p>
              <p> But I still believe that the ruler of Singapore is satanic but it turns out that satan's greatest weapon is a mind reader-paranormal, manipulation, lies, trick, technology, fear, money and the IMH.</p>
              <p>I did another 3.5 year of tertiary education in Jakarta, abandoning my 4 year at NTU. I refused to take medication to prove I'm not insane as defamed.</p>
