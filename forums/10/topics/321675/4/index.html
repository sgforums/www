              <p>More clips of the 1992 riot... I think the reason why people still think a riot is no big deal is because you have not experienced it before... always thinking that it happened in other countries and it can never happen in Singapore...</p>
              <p>Imagine those clips above happening, not in the TV screens, but outside your window... on the streets... On orchard rd, Jurong Point, City Hall etc... Would you risk that happening over a protest...?</p>

              <p>More clips of the 1992 riot... I think the reason why people
              still think a riot is no big deal is because you have not
              experienced it before... always thinking that it happened in other
              countries and it can never happen in Singapore...</p>
              <p>Imagine those clips above happening, not in the TV screens, but
              outside your window... on the streets... On orchard rd, Jurong
              Point, City Hall etc... Would you risk that happening over a
              protest...?</p>
