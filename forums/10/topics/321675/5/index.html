              <p>Its not the government, it is not the opposition...may or may not actually. MOST IMPORTANT IS THE PEOPLE.</p>
              <p>We have one party...a group of activists actually who do not care about votes. That is why they get raped at every election..other than the period when CST was at helm. Then you have people supporting them.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, you have people through their support of these activists ignoring a party that holds Hougang, almost won Aljunied and took a big chunk of votes in Ang Mo Kio...Just because a group of activists who do not care about votes started questioning them !!</p>
