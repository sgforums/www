              <p><strong>That ranking was published back in Jan 2007, which means the survey was conducted a couple of months earlier. So the data is already 2 years old !!!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Thailand went through a coup d'etat in Sep 2006 but amazingly Thai society felt a lot more  of freedom of speech under the military regime than it did under Thaksin and the current Thaksin-backed governments. However, most western media fail to understand this because then tend to come to a convenient generalization that an elected government is more democratic than a military-backed regime.<br></strong></p>

                                              people even think there is a possibility that a peaceful
                                              demonstration can lead to a riot... (Tibet) especially in
                                              Singapore, can such a small country afford such a riot... (1992 Los
                                              Angeles Citywide riot). Would you have this country in<strong> full

              <p><br>I thought the same thing too. There are people here who would twist and turn the facts to just blast PAP. Perhaps they really hate PAP or perhaps they blast because it make them feel accepted in SC by the more senior blasters. True that there are many areas PAP can improve but blasting, is totally unconstructive.</p>
              <p>Another thing the Senior Blasters here use is they get personal. After saying their piece, they'll say something about the you being stupid, brainwashed or the like. This does not consitute to a constructive discussion, only flaming.</p>
