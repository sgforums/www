              <p>when riot is in concern it's decided by how much people could tolerate the government's policy, In history people fight through wars, because we are not happy, and riot is not big deal, situation could always be settled, afraid of it, it's just like a baby want to learn run without fall, or ride a bycycle without fall.If people choose what we want to do, we are more happy to do it, not stay there and wait.</p>

              <p>Dude, then everybody would have differing ideas and theories of what democracy is. In the end LPPL because One very big reason why we can't have full democracy is we can't hold referendums all the time on every single issue.</p>

              <p>you know how hard is it to control a crowd? New Year's eve 2008, my friend was deployed for crowd control to make sure no one cross the street by Fullerton Hotel. But one mangkok cross then suddenly the entire New Year's eve crowd break the cordon and freely walk on the road. More police were deployed but still the crowd don't care because of the feeling of anonymity in a crowd... it took the deployment of the SOC troop and 30mins + to rebuild the cordon... and that is just a happy going New Year crowd...</p>
              <p>You need to be out there on the ground handling corwd control in a major event to fully appretiate the power of a crowd... let alone a riot...</p>
              <p>And even if we can control it, can you imagine the damage that would be caused every minute a riot is not brought under control?</p>
              <p>Hundreds of thousands of people in a confined space rioting, how many thousands will get injured?</p>
              <p>Can you imagine our business district getting trashed, vandalised, and burnt? Our infructure, roads, communications any one of them damaged by rioters... But most importantly, our reputation... If a country wide riot would to happen in Singapore, how many businesses would just pack up and move to Batam or Malaysia...</p>
              <p>How much grief would would it cause the citizens and economy...</p>
              <p>Adain, I am 100% against large scale public protest in small Singapore...</p>
