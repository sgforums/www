              <p>Prime Minister <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=lee+hsien+loong&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Lee Hsien Loong</a>'s open admission that PAP wards are favoured for HDB upgrading exercises has touched a raw nerve among netizens. <br><br>His admission came as a reply to a university student living in the Hougang <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Single-member+constituency&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz35">Single-Member Constituency (SMC)</a> ward who asked if he could pay less tax since the opposition-held ward does not enjoy upgrading programmes.</p>
              <div id="yscsingleblock" class="sc-art-summary ysc-active ysc-single-block">
              <div class="ysc-name">
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p class="first">Since
               this story was first posted, reaction has been swift with over 1,500 
              Facebook shares and 150 comments. The majority were highly critical of 
              PM Lee's stand.</p>
              <p>The highest-rated comment came from Yahoo! user <em>Chia</em>, who posted, "Upgrading is not delivered solely based on policies. It is driven by money from 
              the reserves. The money comes from the people and not from PAP."</p>
              <p>He added that,  "It (upgrading) is a national building programme. A nation does not belong to any party but 
              the people."</p>
              <p>Another Yahoo! user, <em>Davido</em>, said, "I can't believe the PM said that, my only respect left for him is that he is 
              candid enough to admit not all wards are treated equally."</p>
              <p>User VKH was also appalled at the PM's comments.</p>
              <p>He wrote, "I thought that as PM, he was there to represent ALL the people, without favour 
              or preference. He is not the PM of just those he voted for, but for each and 
              every Singapore citizen, including those who did not vote for him or his 
              party... How can the PM say that if you vote for PAP, you get nice chocolate cake and 
              coffee, but if you vote for other party you only get water and biscuit?"</p>
              <p>The furious reaction comes a day after fourth-year engineering student <span id="lw_1302070979_0" class="yshortcuts">Seah</span> Yin Hwa asked PM Lee why residents living in Hougang SMC are penalised 
              for picking "a 'Teochew nang' (dialect for Teochew person) who doesn't 
              wear a white uniform"</p>
              <p>When asked by PM Lee on how he was 
              penalised, the 25-year-old Seah said, "When it comes to upgrading, what 
              is being told to us is that we don't have the funds to actually go ahead
               with lift upgrading, as well as shelters to the bus stops. When I look 
              across the road to Aljunied GRC, they have everything, " reported <em>The Straits Times</em>.</p>
              <p>Paraphrasing the question posed, PM Lee said that what Mr Seah meant 
              is why opposition wards are not treated at least as good, or maybe even 
              better than the PAP wards.</p>
              <p>PM Lee's reply was, "The answer is that there has to be a 
              distinction. Because the PAP wards supported the Government and the 
              policies which delivered these good things."</p>
              <p>He said that while basic goods such roads, transportation, housing, healthcare and defence apply to <span id="lw_1302070979_7" class="yshortcuts">Singaporeans</span>, the extras — which come down to the upgrading programmes — is a national programme.</p>
              <p>"Between the people who voted and supported the programme and the 
              government, and the people who didn't, I think if we went and put yours 
              before the PAP constituencies, it would be an injustice," PM Lee told 
              the 1,200 students who were attending a <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=kent+ridge+ministerial+forum&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Ministerial Forum</a> organised by the <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+university+of+singapore&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">National University of Singapore</a> (NUS) Students' Political Association.
              .</p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>In response to PM Lee, Seah cheekily asked if he could pay less tax 
              and maybe "take one or two years off my NS?", which drew laughter and 
              applause from the audience.</p>
              <p>But PM Lee said that this is not possible because the SAF, defence, 
              taxes and all the facilities which have been provided, are enjoyed by 
              every Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Rounding off his reply, PM Lee said, "But you can do something about 
              it, you know. You don't have to keep voting for people not in 
              white-on-white."</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee explains ministerial salaries</strong></p>
              <p>The contentious issue of <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+ministerial+salaries&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">ministerial salaries</a> was also discussed at the forum after a <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=nanyang+technology+university&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</a> accountancy student brought it up, comparing the salaries of leaders from Singapore and <span id="lw_1302070979_9" class="yshortcuts">the United States</span>.</p>
              <p>"The US <span id="lw_1302070979_6" class="yshortcuts">president</span> is actually paid less than a Cabinet minister in Singapore. I'm sure we
               agree his job is a lot tougher than our Cabinet ministers," said the 
              student.</p>
              <p>In his response, PM Lee said that <span id="lw_1302070979_2" class="yshortcuts">US President</span> <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=barack+obama&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Barack Obama</a> may be earning less than a Singaporean minister, but the American system is not without its flaws.</p>
              <p>For example, he highlighted that the US had different ways of 
              rewarding its presidents and that the low salary of the president had 
              suppressed salaries down the line<em></em>.</p>
              <p>Explaining his first point, PM Lee said that <span id="lw_1302070979_5" class="yshortcuts">former US presidents</span> are involved in money-spinning book and lecture tours after they step down.</p>
              <p>"Retired US presidents go on book tours, they write books, they are 
              paid US$10 million (S$13 million) advance, they get somebody to help 
              them write a tome and they make a lecture tour…Every lecture (by former 
              president) Bill Clinton: US$100,000 to US$200,000 for half an hour.</p>
              <p>"That's the system. I think that's not a good system for us. We don't want ministers to retire and go on lecture tours."</p>
              <p>Touching on his second point, PM Lee said the low salary of US presidents adversely impacted the rest of the <span id="lw_1302070979_3" class="yshortcuts">civil service</span> down the line.</p>
              <p>"Because the president's pay being set at a level which is not quite 
              right, all the rest of the civil service and government pay in the US 
              system has to take dressing from there and come down…and come down," he 
              said.</p>
              <p>PM Lee stressed that Singapore's ministerial pay structure was one that works.</p>
              <p>But when asked if salaries should still be pegged to the private 
              sector given the many candidates taken from the civil service and 
              unions, he replied, "The reason I can get good people from the 
              Government and the unions is that I have a pay system which is working 
              properly.</p>
              <p>"People do not enter politics to get rich but neither will they enter
               politics and as a result, they and their family will become poor."</p>
              <p>He added, "It is something which is not easy to accept emotionally 
              but is the right thing for Singapore. If you want the system to work for
               the long term, you must be honest about it. What do I pay for? I pay 
              for the importance of the job and how difficult it is to do."</p>

              <p>Prime Minister <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=lee+hsien+loong&amp;amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Lee Hsien Loong</a>'s open admission that PAP wards
                  are favoured for HDB upgrading exercises has touched a raw nerve
                  among netizens.<br> <br> His admission came as a reply to a university student living in the
                  Hougang <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=Single-member+constituency&amp;amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;amp;fr=moz35">Single-Member Constituency (SMC)</a> ward who asked
                  if he could pay less tax since the opposition-held ward does not
                  enjoy upgrading programmes.</p>
              <div>
              <div>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Since this story was first posted, reaction has been
                  swift with over 1,500 Facebook shares and 150 comments. The
                  majority were highly critical of PM Lee's stand.</p>
              <p>The highest-rated comment came from Yahoo! user <em>Chia</em>,
                  who posted, "Upgrading is not delivered solely based on policies.
                  It is driven by money from the reserves. The money comes from the
                  people and not from PAP."</p>
              <p>He added that,  "It (upgrading) is a national building
                  programme. A nation does not belong to any party but the
                  people."</p>
              <p>Another Yahoo! user, <em>Davido</em>, said, "I can't believe the
                  PM said that, my only respect left for him is that he is candid
                  enough to admit not all wards are treated equally."</p>
              <p>User VKH was also appalled at the PM's comments.</p>
              <p>He wrote, "I thought that as PM, he was there to represent ALL
                  the people, without favour or preference. He is not the PM of just
                  those he voted for, but for each and every Singapore citizen,
                  including those who did not vote for him or his party... How can
                  the PM say that if you vote for PAP, you get nice chocolate cake
                  and coffee, but if you vote for other party you only get water and
                  biscuit?"</p>
              <p>The furious reaction comes a day after fourth-year engineering
                  student <span>Seah</span> Yin Hwa asked PM Lee why
                  residents living in Hougang SMC are penalised for picking "a
                  'Teochew nang' (dialect for Teochew person) who doesn't wear a
                  white uniform"</p>
              <p>When asked by PM Lee on how he was penalised, the 25-year-old
                  Seah said, "When it comes to upgrading, what is being told to us is
                  that we don't have the funds to actually go ahead with lift
                  upgrading, as well as shelters to the bus stops. When I look across
                  the road to Aljunied GRC, they have everything, " reported <em>The
                  Straits Times</em>.</p>
              <p>Paraphrasing the question posed, PM Lee said that what Mr Seah
                  meant is why opposition wards are not treated at least as good, or
                  maybe even better than the PAP wards.</p>
              <p>PM Lee's reply was, "The answer is that there has to be a
                  distinction. Because the PAP wards supported the Government and the
                  policies which delivered these good things."</p>
              <p>He said that while basic goods such roads, transportation,
                  housing, healthcare and defence apply to <span>Singaporeans</span>, the extras — which come down to the
                  upgrading programmes — is a national programme.</p>
              <p>"Between the people who voted and supported the programme and
                  the government, and the people who didn't, I think if we went and
                  put yours before the PAP constituencies, it would be an injustice,"
                  PM Lee told the 1,200 students who were attending a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=kent+ridge+ministerial+forum&amp;amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Ministerial Forum</a> organised by the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+university+of+singapore&amp;amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">National University of Singapore</a> (NUS) Students'
                  Political Association. .</p>
              <p>In response to PM Lee, Seah cheekily asked if he could pay less
                  tax and maybe "take one or two years off my NS?", which drew
                  laughter and applause from the audience.</p>
              <p>But PM Lee said that this is not possible because the SAF,
                  defence, taxes and all the facilities which have been provided, are
                  enjoyed by every Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Rounding off his reply, PM Lee said, "But you can do something
                  about it, you know. You don't have to keep voting for people not in
                  white-on-white."</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee explains ministerial salaries</strong></p>
              <p>The contentious issue of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+ministerial+salaries&amp;amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">ministerial salaries</a> was also discussed at the
                  forum after a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=nanyang+technology+university&amp;amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</a> accountancy student brought it up, comparing the salaries of
                  leaders from Singapore and <span>the United
                  States</span>.</p>
              <p>"The US <span>president</span> is actually paid less
                  than a Cabinet minister in Singapore. I'm sure we agree his job is
                  a lot tougher than our Cabinet ministers," said the student.</p>
              <p>In his response, PM Lee said that <span>US
                  President</span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=barack+obama&amp;amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Barack Obama</a> may be earning less than a
                  Singaporean minister, but the American system is not without its
                  flaws.</p>
              <p>For example, he highlighted that the US had different ways of
                  rewarding its presidents and that the low salary of the president
                  had suppressed salaries down the line.</p>
              <p>Explaining his first point, PM Lee said that <span>former US presidents</span> are involved in money-spinning book
                  and lecture tours after they step down.</p>
              <p>"Retired US presidents go on book tours, they write books, they
                  are paid US$10 million (S$13 million) advance, they get somebody to
                  help them write a tome and they make a lecture tour…Every lecture
                  (by former president) Bill Clinton: US$100,000 to US$200,000 for
                  half an hour.</p>
              <p>"That's the system. I think that's not a good system for us. We
                  don't want ministers to retire and go on lecture tours."</p>
              <p>Touching on his second point, PM Lee said the low salary of US
                  presidents adversely impacted the rest of the <span>civil
                  service</span> down the line.</p>
              <p>"Because the president's pay being set at a level which is not
                  quite right, all the rest of the civil service and government pay
                  in the US system has to take dressing from there and come down…and
                  come down," he said.</p>
              <p>PM Lee stressed that Singapore's ministerial pay structure was
                  one that works.</p>
              <p>But when asked if salaries should still be pegged to the private
                  sector given the many candidates taken from the civil service and
                  unions, he replied, "The reason I can get good people from the
                  Government and the unions is that I have a pay system which is
                  working properly.</p>
              <p>"People do not enter politics to get rich but neither will they
                  enter politics and as a result, they and their family will become
                  poor."</p>
              <p>He added, "It is something which is not easy to accept
                  emotionally but is the right thing for Singapore. If you want the
                  system to work for the long term, you must be honest about it. What
                  do I pay for? I pay for the importance of the job and how difficult
                  it is to do."</p>

              <p>PM only has to make the decision for the by-election. He need not be involved. </p>
              <p>Just give the word, and the various political parties' machinery will swing into action.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, his party has the advantage over the others. The others must make preparations now and be ready, the PAP knows when or if a by-election even going to take place.</p>
