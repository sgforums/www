            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the "Are Singaporeans too racist" thread, I was reminded of a conversation I had yesterday with one of my Singaporean friends (who has moved to China). Basically, we were discussing about the stereotypes and misunderstandings that she and I both had to face while we were in Singapore.<br><br>It awes me how innocent actions that are meant to benefit others are instead greeted with weird stares. All the Singaporeans that I have ever met have been pretty friendly people, and yet, whenever I've tried to smile at random people on the street (it works in China and in the US... it's meant to brighten up people's day xD), I've always been greeted with stares.<br><br>It awes me how people suddenly change their perspective of you just when you tell them what school you're from. As if they think you're going to look down on them.<br><br>It awes me how not getting a girl/guy, or not being popular, seems to be the worst of many people's problems.<br><br>It awes me how certain people are greatly looked down upon simply because of their sexual orientation.<br><br>These are problems that could occur anywhere in the world, and not just Singapore. However, it's frustrating. It's frustrating, 'cause Singapore is said to have the best of East and West. It's frustrating, 'cause Singapore's education system, which is meant to encourage people to move forward, seems to be reaping self-degrading and grade-oriented clones. Okay, that's a bit harsh. But look around.<br>There's always a "correct" way to answer a question.<br>There's always a "correct" way to behave.<br>There's a net that seems to separate some people from others.<br>People grow up with certain ideas and theories pinned into their head, and, sometimes, they allow these ideas and theories to lead them through life without bothering to check the reliability of them.<br>If you grow up thinking that certain people are better than others, won't it reflect in your actions?<br>If you grow up believing that those with good grades are going to be the future leaders of Singapore, even if they are simply text-book oriented, won't it influence the way you treat your future kids?<br>Won't it influence the way you look at yourself, when you constantly get good grades, or when you constantly fail?<br>Why can't people pick themselves up and try to see things from another view point?<br>You don't have to agree with the other view point, but simply trying to look will help you understand others so much better.<br>I won't say, "Why can't people think for themselves?"<br>Because obviously, people DO think for themselves.<br>It's just that sometimes, their thinking is so limited.<br>It's limited within the confines of what society deems to be "correct" or "appropriate" or "moral".<br>We know that what we are taught may not always be true.<br>SO why aren't we breaking free?<br>You can keep your original values and yet try to see things from other people's view points.</div>

The education system is actually promoting degrading behaviour, and most usually it kills self-esteem.<br><br>When you think of the psychological effects the system had, and still is giving to thousands and thousands of Singaporeans, how can your words be harsh?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its a society that is tense and tight that if you are A nail sticking out it will hammer you down., because ur different may be a life style or sucess that other people can't attend.    Everything need to stay ahead of something....not sure ahead of what but at least something.....Its about better life...since we are a small place...there is a yawning desire to have something better living...for ourselve.  I think some characteristics of  the facts of life in a commercial City.<br><br>but if you can look closer into the micro life in Singapore u should be able to find people who have the personality to lead their own life. I learn that if we focus on the negative we will see everything negative.  So just have to look at the positive side of life and not get caught up by the negative influence.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The education system esp in math and sciences are getting too algorithmic!! Just apply the steps and u get the answers. With sufficient practice, getting an A is not really a prob.....but this kind of system kills the observation skill that is needed in frontier researches. That is why we dont see many great scientists produced locally. In short, We became computers that only know how to apply algorithm and continue to solve problems others have solved many years ago.</div>

It's about people who want to "fit in". We are trained to "fit in" form a young age. Those who dun, are frowned upon.<br><br>Moreover we have this society divide about "elites" and "others". Elite is defined as persons of the highest class or a group of persons exercising the major share of authority or influence within a larger group. (dictionary.com) Hence whoever held power are the Elites, unfortunately our current educational system groom the younger generation to only aim for good if not perfect grades, and perfect grades equals to Elites. Sometimes I wonder why not the ruling government just employee the top-top-topest scholar from the top-top-topest unversity and make him/her our Prime Minister.<br><br>I guess many will agree that what we are taught will not always be true. This had been proven many times in history, ie world is flat, twins are devil's creation, women should bind feet, blacks are slaves, no one needs computers, we are the universe, etc...<br><br>However history had also proven it takes enormous courage to question these beliefs. Stimund Fraud (father of psychology) was house arrested when he introduce healing using psychology techquies where the religious people at that point of time proclaim "mad" people are people possesed by evil spirits. Galio Galie was arrested when he claim we're not alone in the universe. People are beaten to death when they fight for the blacks' freedom. Women who do not bind feet are beaten, humuliated, disowned. Imagine us living in that era. Do an average singaporean dare to question these beliefs?<br><br>It takes a great risk to question the beliefs, and even more courage to change them. To put it on a larger scale, many locals are always complaining about our ruling party. However if God came down one day and say alrite, I'll wipe away PAP and replace the entire government with the Opposition of your choice. How many singaporeans will dare make the choice?<br><br>I guess ultimately it's about "fitting in". Do we want to live our short 85 years on Earth having friends, enjoying a good dinner, living in a good flat, working your heart out paying taxes, having children with good academic education, etc etc and knowing we will have a coffin and a place in the cemetry when we die, OR do we want to spent our lifes running to another country, fighting lawsuits, facing public fire, where our wives (hehe) and entire family will be avoided by people?<br><br>A true leader will fight for what he believe. On a hypotatical case of the above, he will pick the latter. If he succeed, his name will be in the history books. That will be it. For the rest of the population, their name wun be in the books, but they'll be ok.<br><br>Me too.<br><br></div>
