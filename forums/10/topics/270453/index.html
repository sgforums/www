            <div class='col-md body'>Decrease in bus &amp; mrt frequency has been happening before the fare hike a few year ago. You can see that sometime the buses is so packed. Worst still the bus is extremely slow moving and can have accident some more. The green light is still green but they purposely slow down for it to turn red.<br><br>I missed the two buses coming at the same time. At least you can choose the less crowded bus. I don't think fare hike is going to improved anything. At most included more air-con bus station, less buses coming, more old dirty buses.<br><br>They are doing it, so that more people can complains. So they have more reason to increase prices by saying excuses like to improve service, increase in oil price, etc. Let see what excuse they will give to increase price next time.<br><br>There are more talents in the fields, but most are greedy, selfish talents.</div>
