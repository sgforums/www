(Core business)<br>Profit for the year would be instead: a Modest 38.26 Million<br><br>Not increasing Smrt bus fares. To maintain a 2.1 cent profit per ride.(Side business)<br>Profit for the year would remain at 10.2 million<br><br>Not increasing SBS bus fares to maintain at 5.23 cents (Core business)<br>Profit for the year would remain at 40.79 million<br><br>Not increasing NELine fares to maintain 6.08 cents per ride (side business)<br>Profit for NEline for the year would remain at an acceptable: 6.4 million<br><br>Total Annual Profit Performance for EACH company would be Slightly below $50 million dollars<br><br>Profit Taking by Temasek from SMRT alone will be @ 55% = 27.5 million dollars for the year.<br><br>Not bad for <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Privatise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Public  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> transport company.<br><br>I rest my case.<br><br>P.S. for nitpickers: This profit has already taken into account bus/train/parts maintainence/replacement costs/ AND TAX.

They are citing the same reasons this time.<br><br>SBS Transit, part of the ComfortDelGro group, for instance, said their costs have gone up significantly.<br><br>"Energy costs, for example, rose by 20 per cent or $20.3 million last year - having already increased by 41.2 per cent in 2005," SBS Transit spokesman Tammy Tan said.<br><br>"Manpower costs, the company's largest cost component, also increased by about $12.1 million during the year."<br><br>SBS also pointed out that it had invested heavily in buses as well as commuter services.<br><br>It spent $135 million on new buses in the past two years. And it has rolled out an online bus arrival system, which helps commuters to plan their journeys better.<br><br><img src="http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/8346/frontbuslk0.jpg"><br><br><strong>Lower SMRT earnings </strong><br>SMRT pointed out that the increase in the goods and services tax as well as the 1.5 percentage point rise in employers' CPF contributions will pull down its earnings by about $11 million a year.<br><br>It said the fare increase, if kept to this year's cap of 1.8 per cent, would only partially offset the company's total cost increases.<br><br>SBS is proposing to keep children and school student fares as well as concession pass charges unchanged.<br><br>SMRT has also said it will not raise fares for children and students, and all bus cash fares.<br><br>SMRT is also waiving any increase to the first fare band of its MRT single-trip ticket, which costs 90 cents. It added that it would extend its senior citizen concession hours to match SBS'.<br><br><strong>Schemes to help the poor </strong><br>Both operators said they would come up with schemes to help the poor cope with any fare rise.<br><br>The Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) is not entirely convinced that a fare hike is in order.<br><br>Case executive director Seah Seng Choon has pointed out that transport companies are enjoying "good returns." For instance, SMRT achieved a 39 per cent rise in net earnings to $37.94 million in the first quarter.<br><br>"'With such significant increase in net earnings, commuters would certainly expect it to show clear justifications for any need to hike fares at this point in time,' he said.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2007 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
