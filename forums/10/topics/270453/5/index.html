            <div class='col-md body'>don't think our good news times will publish this:<br><br>Press Release - Burden of Fare Hikes on Commuters is Unjustified<br>Wed, Sep 12, 2007<br><br>The National Solidarity Party (NSP) condemns the latest approval of bus fare hike by the Public Transport Council (PTC). Fare hikes have become an annual ritual which highlights the sordid mechanism behind the regulation of standards and fares by the PTC.<br><br>The Chairman of PTC Mr. Gerald Ee acknowledged that Ã¯Â¿Â½the current service frequency was not good enough when 'operational deviation' was factored inÃ¯Â¿Â½. The tightening of the basic Quality of Service (QoS) by the PTC therefore constitutes a tacit admission that the service standard for buses has dropped below the mark of decent acceptability for some years, even as fare hike applications continue to be favourably approved year after year.<br><br>The PTC stated that it was "mindful not to increase the cost of compliance" to Public Transport Operators (PTOs), thus opting to phase in the new standards in 2 years, with fines thereafter of up to $10,000 per month for each instance of non-compliance.<br><br>The NSP would like to punctuate the salient point that such punitive fines will unavoidably result in either the passing of the cost liability to commuters, or in an invariable reduction in service standards not directly measured by the QoS such as interior ambience and comfort of ride.<br><br>The NSP strongly recommends that fare hike applications by PTOs be dismissed until the basic service standard is first achieved within the stipulated 2 years, and subsequently maintained for at least 5 years thereafter, subjected to a stringent and transparent process of annual assessment.<br><br>Mr Gerald EeÃ¯Â¿Â½s assumption that SingaporeÃ¯Â¿Â½s economic growth automatically translates to affordability for bus commuters is questionable. In the latest hike, the highest increment was for the shortest trips. This will hurt the heartlanders most as they are often those with low or no income. Affordability is a nonsense reason for a fare hike, especially since public transport is an essential service.<br><br>SingaporeÃ¯Â¿Â½s Ã¯Â¿Â½economic growthÃ¯Â¿Â½ has seen workers in the lower 40% of the population suffering little or no improvement in their salaries. Their misery is compounded by the fact that the inflation rate for the lowest 20% continued to peak well above that of the highest 20% income earners, even surpassing the general household inflation rate. And this is despite the occasional government handouts. Those with Ã¯Â¿Â½extraÃ¯Â¿Â½ money would prefer to save it or spend in on other essentials instead of Ã¯Â¿Â½squanderingÃ¯Â¿Â½ it on increased bus fares.<br><br>In the latest quarterly financial report of SBS Transit, fuel cost decreased by 6.6%, while operating profit increased by 36.9% as compared to the corresponding quarter last year. Profit after tax to shareholders increased by 25%. Manpower cost increased by a manageable 4.4% which was more or less offset by the decrease in fuel cost. For SMRT, cost of staff and fuel decreased, while profit after tax increased by a whopping 38.5%.<br><br>The impressive double-digits profits of PTOs far overshadow the meagre pay increment of many citizens. It is hence dishonourable to further fatten the coffers of the PTOs by diluting the citizensÃ¯Â¿Â½ hard-earned gains.<br><br>The PTC acknowledged that Singapore has a Ã¯Â¿Â½restricted number of service providers and an absence of real market competitionÃ¯Â¿Â½. The unchallenged business position of the existing PTOs will allow their businesses to continue to stay attractively profitable for the foreseeable long-term without needing to rip more from commuters. This is evident from the rapid expansion of profitable businesses of the PTOs both at home and overseas.<br><br>The NSP would like to pound on the need for improvements to the grotesquely inadequate fare formula, a demand which have been repeated incessantly by the indignant public.<br><br>The formula must include elements which incorporate the degree of compliance to the QoS. The PTC must recognise that the lower and lower-middle income group constitute the bulk of public transport commuters. The formula must thus factor in their (low) earning power and relatively higher incurred inflation, and not merely incorporates the national average which skews in favour of the well-to-do who do not generally commute by bus.<br><br>Finally, the profits of the PTOs and their payouts to shareholders must be considered in the equation. If necessary, the PTC should oblige these lucrative PTOs to raise extra funds from their benefited shareholders instead of exploiting the lack of viable alternatives for the people through constant fare hikes. It is preposterous for the PTC to safeguard the interest of the shareholders of PTOs at the expense of commuters.<br><br>The NSP hopes that the members of the PTC can step onboard public transports more regularly to enable them to empathise with the commuters, and recognise their fair rights and interests.<br><br>Central Executive Council<br>National Solidarity Party<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bus fares are 1-3 cents higher?! What the hell are you thinking Mr Lim(Chairman of SBST)??? Have you lost all traces with your Sanity, your Artistic Integrity? Have you lost the cool, logical and balanced mind that the great leaders need when forging plans of SBST's calibur? You have singlehandedly destroyed SBST and its integrity with this change. You have harnessed the chains of malice and incompetency to drive your hellish steeds of destruction and despair through the rejoicing worlds of the living and ruin SBS in the process. Words simply cannot EXPLAIN how angry I am with this change, your development skills and your love for the human race. Here is what you have done by increasing the contribution:<br><br>What the hell were you thinking? I have supported you for 18 long years Mr Lim, 18 years, ever since you took the SBST's Matrix from Sir Raffle's dying hands by his hospital bed 3 years ago promising to uphold the tradition of excellent development as his winded breath wheezed a promise that was only half finished before his gentle head slumped into the creamy hospital bed pillow and then tears streamed down your mottled face as you screamed why into the sky and beat upon Sir Raffle's corpse in uncontained rage and anger towards God and the unfair world he created dooming the most cherished to die first.<br><br>You have destroyed your vow to your forefathers when you met on that fateful summers noon as a young and lost boy who didn't have a true purpose in the world and decided to ask those with more wisdom because you were afraid of being unable to live up to the great expectations bestowed upon you, down at the serene windy lake with it's glassy surface and lone fisherman in a small and easily overturnable boat hovering quite near the center worrying about feeding his family and the deers trotting off in the distance being jealously eyed by small rabbits who envied their youthfulness but at the same time were glad they were such innocent symbols of cuteness that were sometimes ignored by the MEDIA, you have destroyed the oath you took with him as he decided to leave the glowing jeweled crown with the more exuberant youth of his dying generation.<br><br>You have betrayed your mother and father, whose sole wish for you as a small, frail orphan child by the name of Oliver Twist who worked his way up on Temasek Holdings using relentless precision to take down his financial rivals to ultimately rise to stardom. was to create a popular contribution rate that was balanced and enjoyed by all.<br><br>DID YOU FORGET THE VOW YOU MADE WITH ME IN VIETNAM WHEN I DRAGGED YOUR LIMP BODY FROM THE THORNY BRAMBLES THAT HAD ENSNARED YOU, WITH THE VIETNAMESE INSURGENTS FIRING THEIR CHEAP BUT EFFECTIVE RIFLES BEHIND OUR BACKS, AND THE WEAK SMILE YOU GAVE TO ME AFTER YOU REALIZED YOU WEREN;T GOING TO BE TORTURED FOR INFORMATION REGARDED THE SINGAPORE GOVERNEMNT?

            <div class='col-md body'>we can well do without the ptc!<br><br>Analysis of PTCÂ’s news release on fare increase<br>By Leong Sze Hian<br>Posted by theonlinecitizen on September 12th, 2007<br><br>I refer to the Public Transport CouncilÂ’s (PTC) News release on 11 September, on the increase in bus fares from 1 October.<br><br>I would like to comment on the following:-<br><br>Â“PTC considered SingaporeÂ’s economic outlook and the affordability of public transport. The economic outlook has been positive with the latest GDP gowth forecast for 2007 revised upwards to 7 to 8% and the unemployment rate for June 2007 at 2.4%, the lowest in 5 years.Â”<br><br>Will the positive economic outlook reverse the trend of declining nominal wages (before inflation-adjustment) for about the bottom 30 percentile of workers?<br><br>Unemployment has actually increased<br><br>Although overall unemployment was the lowest in 5 years, according to the Ministry of ManpowerÂ’s (MOM) 2nd quarter report on employment, Â“among the resident (Singaporean and permanent resident) labour force, the non-adjusted unemployment rate was 4.2%Â… higher than (the) 3.4% in March 2007″<br><br>The estimated 79,600 unemployed residents, was higher than the estimated 66,000 last quarter.<br><br>So, the resident unemployment rate went up, and the number of resident unemployed has increased!<br><br>Return on Total Assets<br><br>Â“ROTA (Return on Total Assets) in 2006 of SBST (Bus and Rail) and SMRT (Bus and Rail) was 7.9 and 11.4% respectively.<br><br>These are higher than the 6.5 and 9.1% respectively in 2005.<br><br>The Ministry of Transport has said that these 6.5 and 9.1% ROTA Â“returns are healthy but not excessive, compared to companies with similar industry structures and risk profilesÂ”.<br><br>Since ROTA has increased by 22% (7.9 divided by 6.5) and 25% (11.4 divided by 9.1) over the last year, how can a fare increase be justified on the basis of ROTA?<br><br>Why do we always seem to be comparing with countries and companies with high ROTAs?<br><br>Why donÂ’t we compare with public transport companies in countries with lower ROTA?<br><br>Comparing with other countries Â– use a fairer approach<br><br>Why do we always seem to be comparing average fares with cities like Hong Kong, London and New York City, which have higher fares than Singapore?<br><br>Why donÂ’t we compare with other lower fare cities and countries as well?<br><br>As cities like London and New York City have multi-modal bus passes, an average fares comparison may not be very appropriate.<br><br>DonÂ’t we realise that the median wage in these cities are much higher than SingaporeÂ’s (about $2,050) ?<br><br>With the Residential Feeder Services Aircon Adult fare increasing from 65 to 67 cents, has the PTC done any analysis on the percentage rate increase of fares for feeder services over the last 8 years?<br><br>In this connection, a local university study found that about 15% of commuters walked a straight-line distance of more than one kilometre, despite the availability of feeder services. Has the high rate of increase in feeder service fares deterred people from using them because of affordability?<br><br>Transport vouchers Â– to cover only one yearÂ’s increase?<br><br>As to the $30 transport vouchers to be given out to needy commuters, has the PTC reconciled the number of transport vouchers (total funding amount divided by $30) with the number of people who live in households with monthly income below $1,500?<br><br>Is it not obvious that giving $30 or $20 whenever fares are increased does not take into account that it only covers one yearÂ’s increase? ShouldnÂ’t transport vouchers be given to reflect 7 yearsÂ’ increases over the last 8 years?<br><br>The PTC report makes no mention of the ever increasing record profits of the transport operators, or the possible effects of the GST hike.<br><br>Flaws in the Fare Adjustment formula<br><br>As there are more than 500,000 cars in Singapore, how can the Fare Adjustment Formula be based on average Wage Increase?<br><br>ShouldnÂ’t it be the median wage increase to reflect the fact that it is the lower-income who take public transport?<br><br>As the CPI (inflation) for the lower-income is much higher than the higher income, shouldnÂ’t the formula be based on the CPI of those who take public transport rather than the average CPI?<br><br>Why is the Public Transport Affordability Index (PTAI)* on a downtrend since 2003, when as I understand it, the MEPT has been increasing due to yearly fare increases and declining wages for the bottom 30 percentile of workers?<br><br>As to Â“the average wage growth was 5.5% for the 1st quarter of 2007″, I understand that the median wage has hardly moved in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) over the last few years.<br><br>$30 per year vouchers for the poor. Adequate?<br><br>According to the Straits Times report, Â“100,000 needy families to get $30 transport vouchersÂ”,Straits Times, 12 September, it says:<br><br>Â“Among commuters who have to make one transfer to another trunk<br>bus, they will see a fare increase of at most 4 cents.<br><br>For example: A bus journey from Ang Mo Kio to Alexandra Road with a<br>transfer at MacRitchie Reservoir currently costs $1.583. From 1st October,<br>the commuter will see an increase of 3 cents to $1.61 (a 2-cent increase<br>for the 1st leg and a 1- cent increase for the 2nd leg). This is an increase of<br>6 cents per day or about $1.32 per month.Â”<br><br>If Â“they will see a fare increase of at most 4 centsÂ”, why is the example one which shows a 3 cent increase per trip of 6 cents per day?<br><br>Based on just 2 trips a day, 30 days a month, an increase of 6 and 8 cents a day, works out to $21.60 and $28.80 a year, respectively.<br><br>So, does it make sense that the Â“Transport Ministry spokesman estimated that, typically, a single voucher ($30) could defray a poor familyÂ’s fare increase cost for one yearÂ”<br><br>$30 a year for a typical poor family of 3 to 4 persons can cover $21.60 or $28.80 fares increase per person?<br><br>Do more Singaporeans generally take buses more often and spend more on buses than trains?<br><br>*(Monthly Expenditure on Public transport (MEPT) divided by Monthly Household Income (MHI)</div>
