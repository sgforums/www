            <div class='col-md body'>Has anyone noticed, precision engineering has been slowly phased out of ITE?  Occasionally I pow wow with my vendor, and they highlight the fact that its hard to find skilled machinists who are singaporeans anymore.  They have only one and he's close to retiring, the rest of thier staff have to come from china and yes, india, and they don't like it, mainly coz of admin problems.</div>

Few would choose to be politicians.<br><br>When I read that our minister(s) had to visit Switzerland/euporean countries to come back with lessons that Spore future is in R&amp;D, esp those D with relevance to the commercial world. I really want to laugh.<br><br>So it takes some million dollar a yr salary minister(s) to realise that only now?!?<br>I think almost everyone in the engineering field know these.<br><br>On a simliar note, it takes the PAP so many years just to realise<br>that private sector is very important in contributing to a nations overall employement.<br>MNCs are not going to transfer real technology to you and<br>will leave here for China, India for cost reasons<br>(living std too high, another major problem that PAP had caused).<br><br>So those pro-GLC policies had been deeply flawed.<br>Too late? They have already impeded the growth of many<br>potential local companies by having GLC compete unfairly with them in the past.<br><br>In the process, they had created a culture where everyone just want to work for GLCs and MNCs. Not startups.<br>Wait..who is going to start a tech startup in the first place,<br>when non-profit Government-linked Defence agencies, Astar institutes are paying engineers so well with tax-payers money?!?<br>And MNCs too, with its prestige and reasonably good pay.<br><br>Where than, do you see our technology-based companies blossoming?<br>With backing schemes from government-linked institutes like Astar?<br>Well. Thats another story and analysis.<br><br>Ps: Apologies for bringing out other topics on this thread.<br>The coming GE make all these relevant huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
