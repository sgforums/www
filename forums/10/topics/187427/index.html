I would be talk on technical topics to achieve a First World Standard Country.<br>Firstly, we  will need to recogise all professional in each and every fields of work. This must not be generalised by the title. It must be specified even in work that only have small field of experienced people.<br><br>Mine is quite top ended..hence may not be so easy to understand by layman. Hence I would only make it simple.<br><br>Few example of such professional title on engineering are as follows:<br><br>Electrical Engineers<br>Electronic Engineers<br>Mechanical Engineers<br>Surveyor<br>Civil Engineers<br><br>All must be named after what course they studied and very general which may not be the real experience and expertise that they really good in.<br><br>It's good that we recognised them as what they had studied for their course during Universities. For first world standard, I believed that they are to be indentified and recognised by their experiences and knowledge in their work more than just course of studies.<br><br>Electrical Engineers - many type, some are general , some are special.<br>Electronic Engineers - many too, some are general, some are very unique.<br>Mechanical Engineers - many too, some are too general, some are unique till being forgotten by peoples.<br>and so on so on.<br><br>I had experiences working with Japanese Professional before. No saying that they are better than us in technology, or knowledge within our grounds. However, I must admired there regulation office for recognising their expertise in the field while no generalising them..<br><br>By generalising them, we may no knowingly be getting expertise in the right jobs. I am more afraid that we may get one that is too general and may be planting timely problem within our surrounding unknowingly...<br><br>This is one area that the relevant ministry must really be looked into before we can be totally be First World Standard.<br><br>Finally, go for First World Standard as a whole. Good for singapore, good for everyone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many years ago, I wrote two letters one to Straits Times "Lack of Technical excellence in Singapore" and the other to Business Times "Promoting Accountability and Transparency" which were published.<br><br>I questioned in those letters our society's attitude to education and jobs which to me was merely concerned with getting recognition and name but not pursuit of innovation and knowledge application in all fields which are much more diverse than what the universities and institutions of higher learning usually equip our students for.<br><br>I said that many engineers are in the habit of switching their jobs or careers to managerial and administrative ones instead of pursuing excellence and innovation. They tend to hop on to the management bandwagon to do something different thereby neglecting their original engineering training.<br><br>I think there was very few such letters published in our newspapers which was full of news about how well our government is doing in various endeavours forgetting mention of neglect of developing excellence or knowledge application, innovations or new technology start-usp which is what Singapore needs most for competitiveness and national survival.<br><br>What do we expect with the current crop of new MP candidates mostly being lawyers and some what have you degree which show the absence of leadership encouraging and implementing research engineering and innovation in every field.<br><br>If we keep leading the country in laws and general investments and trading we will keep sending the wrong signals to good engineers who will eventually pack their books and join the more established professions like managers, administrators and forgetting about technological applications and start-ups.<br><br>That is why it is necessary for younger generation to offer their new ideas to the older generations to change and become more competitive.</div>

(Read various feedbacks posted to Feedback Unit).<br><br>Singapore has become uncompetitive as compared with competitions whether from China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan , Korea or even Vietnam.<br><br>Many Singapore's SMEs and domestic sector companies have closed shops and many continue to go under due to high costs.<br><br>The old economic strategy and other major government policies since 1970s did not work. The pro-foreign and the same tax-and-recover system of government could not produce competitiveness.<br><br>Government has only one ability - to tax and recover all costs by double-charging on land and triple-charging on vehicles to the tune of $500,000 - $800,000 per household life-cycle to build reserves without any corresponding plan to use these vast reserves created from taxing people to lower costs of living or creating a value-adding technology-driven new economy.<br><br>The private sector suffers from squeeze of liquidity and losses of economic and social vibrancy. Such old policies did not change driving away our people's entrepreneurial spirits.<br><br>If our leaders are indeed world-class then they should solve the 20 major problems urgently.<br><br>Have the leaders the simple leadership of the third world - interest, passion or abilities to govern the country.

            <div class='col-md body'>you are right to say that many in the tech expertise field have migrated to managerial posts.<br><br>why?<br><br>because in singapore, decisions are all made by managerial staffers and not neccessarily by scientific logical course. if a true scientists have transposed into a managerial post, the decisions he make may have been very different or on a different bias.<br><br>another point to note is that, science and technology communities requires time, patience, freespace and resources to nuture. take for example somthing that we may have watched on TV. discovery channel recently highlighted taiwan's farming community and the gains they have reap from the decades (YES decades) it has put into this field. the docu focused on a single very old man who spent his entire life into research of flora for profitable farming. from the program, one can easily note it is a very long time and he is very fortunate to have good understanding and support from taiwan government. his specialty is watermelons, and more than half the world carries his breed of watermelon, will you call this a commendable achievement?<br><br>based on above, and looking at our local science and research community, does anybody know what we have achieved based on that?<br><br>taking it a step further, if we do have the local talents then there must be a lack of opportunities (because of government policies, focus of our EDB, critical mass of local support groups in similar field, etc). we take an example, graphic artists/programmers. commercial 3D software giants have shifted their focus to neighboring states up north and have successfully organised many 3D related industrial showcases for the public and enthusias. did their government have a hand in helping them out or was it because they had the luxury of freeplay in the media industry?<br><br>in another thread (and other forums) regarding playing of massive online games, our games sucks big time. not enough programmers? or is it programmers feel that it is not an iron rice bowl? as it stands, due to malaysia's very successful gaming/programming industry (comparatively around this neighborhood of ASEAN), is that the reason why EDB coaxed ILM (starwars maker) to open a regional HQ here to save our own face? IMO our media industry (or lack of it) does not have the fuel to "finance" this sector to the end of having great success. end of the day, we are all still consumers(players) and not producers.<br><br>end of the day, we have all been trained day to day in school and society that we only do things for good profit, pushing for entrepeneurs day in and day out, reaping in Mr Sim Wong Woo to give more talks. what else do we have imprinted in our minds from society that will relate to building a society focused on advancing the scientific barriers, a more science-driven think tank breed? and what is this society we have today being shaped by?</div>

The past policies of trying to phase out certain businesses or industries have been too narrow and should be revised and amended.<br><br>Innovations can happen in any field and should not be confined to biotech or marine biological R&amp;D or new drugs but in every field. So when our many academic EDB scholars tried for many years to promote foreign investments and scholarships we have neglected promotion of innovations and application of knowhow and humble existing knowledge in broader fields.<br><br>If they have had better understanding of overall creative endeavours among the people and the needs and aspirations in grooming our domestic sector of the economy, we could have promoted many new business opportunities and new start-ups and we could have done much better. So it is wrong to have such pro-foreign mindset all the time as we cannot keep promoting only the foreign businesses and must look after and groom our own economic competitiveness in larger perspectives.<br><br>Problem is the old mindsets of stereotyping the businesses and industries or talents that we want should give way to new motivational forces that will promote practical knowledge application even in existing knowledge and humble businesses. We should not allow our ministers or civil servants to become too narrow in their pursuing of foreign investments or pro-foreign talents as they will only end up neglecting alternative solutions by the common men and people with passion and do not understand enough in wanting to promote them. The old mindset is only foreign companies of MNC status will be the industries or businesses we want but not the domestic sector of the economy.<br><br><blockquote>taking it a step further, if we do have the local talents then there must be a lack of opportunities (because of government policies, focus of our EDB, critical mass of local support groups in similar field, etc). we take an example, graphic artists/programmers. commercial 3D software giants have shifted their focus to neighboring states up north and have successfully organised many 3D related industrial showcases for the public and enthusias. did their government have a hand in helping them out or was it because they had the luxury of freeplay in the media industry?<br><br>in another thread (and other forums) regarding playing of massive online games, our games sucks big time. not enough programmers? or is it programmers feel that it is not an iron rice bowl? as it stands, due to malaysia's very successful gaming/programming industry (comparatively around this neighborhood of ASEAN), is that the reason why EDB coaxed ILM (starwars maker) to open a regional HQ here to save our own face? IMO our media industry (or lack of it) does not have the fuel to "finance" this sector to the end of having great success. end of the day, we are all still consumers(players) and not producers.<br><br>end of the day, we have all been trained day to day in school and society that we only do things for good profit, pushing for entrepeneurs day in and day out, reaping in Mr Sim Wong Woo to give more talks. what else do we have imprinted in our minds from society that will relate to building a society focused on advancing the scientific barriers, a more science-driven think tank breed? and what is this society we have today being shaped by?[/b]</blockquote>I have to agree with you that software engineering in developing games and new capabilities in design of equipment and tools is a very large area which we are not promoting. If we do not have leaders who are well versed in such areas at least they should keep an open mind and not close up all the venues and perspectives. People when given some help and empowerments by understanding environmental support can do wonders and produce wonders.<br><br>Do our First-world leaders understand these factors of competitiveness and do they still want to manage the country by their own micro-manage style based on some simplistic assumptions.</div>
