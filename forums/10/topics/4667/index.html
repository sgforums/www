            <div class='col-md body'>I sympathies with your problem. I know how it feels like cos I have the same problem too. I've recently applied for 2 jobs as a technical officer and was turned away as soon as they know that I am colour deficient. It really sucks man! They donÂ’t even bother to ask how severe my problem is and how it would effect my work! As you know, we Â‘colour blindÂ’ people can actually see colours. I donÂ’t think that the job IÂ’m applying for really requires great colour sensitivity. As a result, IÂ’m now jobless and really considering joining the teaching profession. I really regretted wasting my time in Singapore Polytechnic slogging for 2 damn years for my Mechanical Engineering diploma!!!!<br><br>These companies in Singapore and even the government should start to realise that people with colour deficiency are not really seeing the world in black and white! They should try to classify our colour deficiency into different categories like trichromat or dichromat, and try to recruit those with slight colour deficiency for jobs they THINK require normal colour capabilities.<br><br>Do you know that some police department in the US actually do recruit people with slight colour deficiency. They found that the police do not actually need to be too sensitive to colours. (For further details you can browse this website: <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~medtox/poll.html)" rel="nofollow">http://home.earthlink.net/~medtox/poll.html)</a><br>If the Singapore police force could adapt the same recruitement policy, I donÂ’t think they will be facing a shortage of police officers. Just imagine what they can do with an extra of 10% of Singapore's male population in their organisation!<br><br>I really think that Singapore or even the rest of the world should start classifying colour deficiency just like myopia(different degrees and type of myopia such as shortsightedess). They really should start learning that almost most of us do not see the world in black and white! And most jobs do not require super sensitive colour capabilities!!!<br><br>DonÂ’t you agree???<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Probably one thing that was never openly addressed in public was the education in CVD. As far as i know, many ppl know that we are "colour blind", and thats it, their knowledge abt our vision gets no where.<br><br>I don't know if MOH  had actually realised about the problem if there is so many ppl born or inflicted wif CVD. If so, have they did some research on it and sum of the effects on spore in general due of this condition? Probably our problems with finding jobs maybe eased wif some companies accepting some classifications in color vision and making some leeway like letting us wearing those lenses that aid in vision...<br><br>As i far as i know, some courses in SP for electrical and electronic engineering has been closed to students with CVD (they made the notices in the information brochures). Probably our education system should be adapted to fit into individuals with CVD, again with sum leeway given.<br>(the danger of taking a course and not being accepted due to CVD is another problem though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> )<br><br>Excuse me krashbug, juz one little q, where did u get the fact that 10% of spore males are CVD? hope u can post a reply on this....<br><br>Shotgun: im not sure abt night vision aspect, but im sure i have some problems in the dark myself :</div>
