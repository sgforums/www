              <p>"<span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">A fascist country 
              is one where the state controls virtually everything; it is a country where the 
              state bureaucrats decide what is good for the ordinary citizens; it is a country 
              where the state makes all or most of the decisions about how money should be 
              spent; it is a country where the state grabs most of the wealth and then doles 
              the cash out in dribs and drabs. A fascist state is paternalism gone mad: 
              everyone works and the state hands out pocket money. Fascism is the annihilation

              <p>dear discerning fellow singaporeans of this great country,</p>
              <p>i do not know the motive of this TS, but i do know that he is picking up selective quotes from this author to suit his hidden agenda........</p>
              <p>in the same website, this author also wrote <span style="color: #ff0000;">"the evidence that britons and americans are living in fascist countries"</span>.....??? what talking man, this author??</p>
              <p>i quote:</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Today, both America and Britain have fascist Governments</span>. Fascism reduces our freedom and privacy because only the state really matters and the state (and those who work for it and control it) take precedence over everyone and everything else.<br><br>: the state comes first and the people come second. The state's employees exist to defend the state (rather than to care for the people) and their loyalties are to the state. That's the fundamental difference between a fascist state and any sort of democracy. <br><br>Democratic states provide leadership; representing the people in the nation's relations with other countries and making decisions designed to protect the safety of the citizens. They also manage the infrastructure without which no country can survive; providing services which can not properly be provided by individuals within communities.<br><br>Any time a government does anything that isn't protecting the lives, liberty and property of its citizens it is exceeding its authority. <br><br>Running an army is an essential government activity. Providing a decent transport infrastructure (roads and railways) is an essential government activity. Starting wars for no good reason is not within the remit of a proper government.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Politicians in the world's two largest fascist countries</span>, who were hired to protect individual citizens, have adopted policies designed to exploit the citizens and to take advantage of them. Politicians who were elected to look after the voters now expose the people they are paid to look after to increased danger. These fascist governments exists to protect their own survival (and the survival of the politicians) rather than to protect the interests of the electorate. "......</span></p>
