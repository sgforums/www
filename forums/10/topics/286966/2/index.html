            <div class='col-md body'>The last time i was in NS, there was this quote "If sh1t dun happen, thing will never change" Why fix something when it is not broken?? This principle apply even if the thing is wrong, meaning if no one die in the process of find out the "broken" the hard way, nothing get change in SAF. Ppl there are too chicken to change what that has been there since ancient years ago even if it is not applicable anymore. Hope the SAF today are not so thick to figure that out.</div>

I served a total of 32 years, comprising full-time national service, reservist and regular service, from 1974-2006.<br><br>I was one of more than 200 regular servicemen and women in the Army who were notified in May last year that we would be given Special Early Transition. Some of the reasons cited included difficulty in offering us 'suitable jobs' in the long run, restructuring and possible 'stagnation'. We were given only six months to transit.<br><br>Having attained the rank of a warrant officer in 2001, it meant that I was able to serve till the compulsory retirement age (CRA) of 55. I transitted last November after just turning 50, five years short of the CRA.<br><br>The Control of Personnel Centre announced that we were not under-performers. I was still PES 'B' and I received my performance bonuses annually without fail. I had also met all other requirements, i.e., Individual Physical Proficiency Tests, Annual Trainfire Programme, Body Mass Index, and Annual Proficiency Knowledge Test.<br><br>I also did not have any discipline or medical problems. The latter meant that I was still combat fit and still deployable. There are some who have not conformed to one or more of these requirements and yet are still serving in the organisation.<br><br>Till today, I am still somewhat in a state of depression at how the organisation had overlooked all my years of loyal and dedicated service.<br><br>The SAF Management Philosophy states:<br><br>'The SAF is concerned with the well-being of its people and their families, the SAF values its people, looks after them and their families so that they can give wholehearted attention to their assigned duties.'<br><br>The Defence Minister himself said last year:<br><br>'Every soldier is precious to us. Every national serviceman, every operationally ready national serviceman, every regular who serves with us is a precious and valuable person.'<br><br>The organisation failed to honour its word to allow me and many others to serve till the CRA of 55. I have a wife and two young children still attending school.<br><br>Second Warrant Officer (Retired)<br>Henry Minjoot</div>

People are key to this transformation and, as far as possible, the SAF actively retrains, re-skills and redeploys its personnel to take on new roles.<br><br>But as with any major restructuring effort, there will be some personnel who cannot be suitably retrained and redeployed. In the restructuring exercise carried out last year, less than 1 per cent of SAF regulars were so affected.<br><br>In recognition of the good and dedicated service that these servicemen had provided, Mindef had been upfront with them about their career prospects in the SAF and offered them a transition package which is in line with Civil Service guidelines, to help them pursue a second career.<br><br>The transition package provided for affected employees to take their superannuation benefits or receive one month's last-drawn gross salary for each year of qualifying service, subject to a cap of 25 years of service.<br><br>The package also provided for medical-insurance coverage for six months from the date of leaving the organisation and a training grant of up to $2,000.<br><br>In addition, Mindef also provided various forms of assistance in making a career transition, such as partially- paid leave to work in an alternative job, sponsorship of skills-training courses, conduct of career transition and education workshops and career fairs, as well as job vacancy link-ups.<br><br>This package was similarly offered to Mr Minjoot to encourage him to take on new career options. We would like to invite him to contact us to see how we can be of further assistance.<br><br>Col Darius Lim<br>Director<br>Public Affairs<br>Ministry of Defence</div>
