              <p>Look, Auntie, without the PAP, you MAY not get a good education, but you MAY get a better education as well. And even if you have the option to have a good education, a lot of that is credited to your parents. So please give your parents due credit. And even as such, it's up to you, Auntie, to do well in your education. So give yourself due credit as well.</p>

              <p>That I agree, sister. Man's ego is a bit hard to manage, but I need to correct your perception a little. I do not like to see people who are incapable and yet sit above me. It takes some effort to gain my respect. I too am the ambitious type that goes into combat mode in order to get what I want (90+% of the time I get what I want). Perhaps you are right. I cannot help this society as much as I would like to, unlike in my own life, I control my own destiny.</p>
              <p>Anyway, as an food for thought, I always believe that ladies are better than men, in terms of detailed thinking, calm and controlled, and able to maintain their thoughts better. But don't let the "0" and "1" extreme thoughts get the better of your positive attributes.</p>

              <p>I share your sentiments, soul_rage that i cannot stand incompetent people sitting above me. Sometimes in groups and small working cirles, it may be easy to pin-point how your leader is nothing more than a mouth piece. But when it comes to good governance, who is to say what is right and wrong? Honestly to me leading is a thankless job and especially for politics. Right or wrong also kena arrow. You cannot please everyone. Even between 2 person, a simple thing like decide what movie to watch also can become complicated. For politics and policies, its even worse. You have to pander to the need of millions.</p>
              <p>I agree that PAP is pro-business to a certain extent. You would not be wrong to say they are inculcating the wrong values about being money-orientated too (i brought this up from what you mentioned in the previous thread about teaching the young the wrong values). But at the same time i agree with angel because in Singapore, being pro-business is pro-people because you are creating the environment for our people to thrive. The government lays the groundwork for us to be educated, become professionals and compete on the global stage. Yes its all about money. But survival is about money too. The government is callous, is harsh is anti-people. But it is also pragmatic, which is what i believe is the most important.</p>

Mr Tan, some things and people in this country you cannot offend! Some people are above all things! You better make sure you know this! Mr Tan,we can arrange for things to happen to you.You understand or not!”</p>

              <p>Not her, she's not capable to me. She's there because of relationships in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Ladies I admire are Hilary Clinton, or Meg Whitman, the ex-eBay CEO now running for governor in California. She single-handedly turned eBay from 30 employees with 4.7m turnover, to a company with 15000 employees and multi-billion turnover.</p>

              <p>I share your sentiments, soul_rage that i cannot stand
              incompetent people sitting above me. Sometimes in groups and small
              working cirles, it may be easy to pin-point how your leader is
              nothing more than a mouth piece. But when it comes to good
              governance, who is to say what is right and wrong? Honestly to me
              leading is a thankless job and especially for politics. Right or
              wrong also kena arrow. You cannot please everyone. Even between 2
              person, a simple thing like decide what movie to watch also can
              become complicated. For politics and policies, its even worse. You
              have to pander to the need of millions.</p>
              <p>I agree that PAP is pro-business to a certain extent. You would
              not be wrong to say they are inculcating the wrong values about
              being money-orientated too (i brought this up from what you
              mentioned in the previous thread about teaching the young the wrong
              values). But at the same time i agree with angel because in
              Singapore, being pro-business is pro-people because you are
              creating the environment for our people to thrive. The government
              lays the groundwork for us to be educated, become professionals and
              compete on the global stage. Yes its all about money. But survival
              is about money too. The government is callous, is harsh is
              anti-people. But it is also pragmatic, which is what i believe is
              the most important.</p>

              <p>Regardless, if one wants to become a leader, then one must learn how to deal with people. If one does not want to deal with people, then DON'T become a leader. It's not a thankless job. It's a choice one makes, so don't complain.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned to Stevenson in the other thread, pro-business does not necessarily mean that the people will benefit. Other policies, such as the Foreign Talent policy that is too liberal to foreigners in my opinion (read, I support the policy, but I DO NOT support its implementation) hurts the people. Sometimes you need to build dams to direct water coming from the source in order go the right direction. Do not think that providing the source is sufficient. It may not reach the beneficiaries that you want it to reach.</p>
              <p>As I also mentioned, there are 3 other things I wish to emphasize:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>There must be a balance between morals and $$$. Without morals, people will let greed get the better of them (morals is a form of control over our basic instinct of greed) and proceed to reward themselves endlessly. Think the excess ministers being elected in our cabinet, and AIG.</li>
              <li>There must be a balance between pro-business and pro-people. The extremes of both ends tend to make the country suffer in one way or another. We look rich, but most of us are empty within. We don't really know what is called enjoyment of life. We believe we are slaves to work and work and work. <br></li>
              <li>There must be a balance between vision and implementation. One cannot do without the other, or the end result will be disastrous. Vision is NEVER naive, because without vision, implementers are headless ducks running in different directions, in the end resulting in nothing. Without implementers, visionaries become paper-generals.<br></li>

              <p>Please enlighten me which great leader in history has been unequivocally agreed upon as a fantastic leader or have earned the adoration of the whole world. There is no such thing as perfection or unaninimous agreement that anyone or anything is undoubtedly good. Politics and life are not simple 1+1 mathematics.You cant just 'deal' with people. Talk is cheap. I mean you are working and even if you arent, school life should have taught you that in any group, disagreements are ubiquitous in every human community. Just like you and me here, we cant even see eye to eye in such simple issues. How do you expect 4 million people to agree that a particularly policy is good? Everyone has their own ideas how to do things. As a leader the best you can do is to assimilate the various good points and come up with a solution. You really cannot please everyone.</p>
              <p>Honestly I still suscribe to the belief that its $$$ before morals cause honestly (i have used this example before) you do not see a beggar doing charity. Although I agree people are continuously looking for more and more wealth. I do not deny that i foresee myself working and hoping to rake in millions within my first 10-15 years of working or something. But there is nothing wrong with this idea and that is what keeps our capitalist society and meritocratic economy going. In my opinion $$$ having a higher weightage is inevitable and a true 50-50 balance can only be accomplished when your $$$ needs is settled first.</p>

              <p>This thing you mentioned here is what we should truly be concerned about. Its not about being money minded or pro business or whatever. It is about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> achieving monetary wealth, there is a lack of thirst for spiritual and mental wealth. That is what we should be focusing on.</p>
