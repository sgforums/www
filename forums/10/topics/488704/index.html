              <p class="MsoNormal">He had been a journalist for Tempo Magazine for sometime.
              During 1994 to 1995, his name appeared and became widely known as a “criticizers” 
              during the reign of Ex President Soeharto's government in corruption and East

              controversial books, which were documented from the web, newspapers, and and
              other sources.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 8.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Controversy</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At the end of December 2009, During the launching of his
              book  which entitled "Dismantling Cikeas Octopus", George was
              accused of committing violence against Ramadhan Pohan, who is a member of the
              Parliament from the “Democratic Party”. The incident were reported to the local
              police. Later on he was sued by Mr. Pohan.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Some time after the launching of his book, Ex President
              Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono expressed his concerns regarding the contents of the book. Soon,
              the books were taken off the shelves across the nation . At that time, there
              were no judicial decision were made regarding the circulation of the book.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Many people &amp; academia were considering that the books
              didn't based on the  “research methodology” to prove the validity of the
              facts.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In November 2011  George Aditjondro was one of the
              speakers in the Faculty of Agricultural Technology of Gajah Mada University,
              with the theme titled  "Dissecting the Sultan Status Ground / Ground
              Pakualaman” concentrated on Yogyakarta.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">George gave a controversy statement : ”The Palace of
              Yogyakarta is not similar to the British Empire nor the Sultan Palace. It is
              only a  "Keraton" (Keraton : Kera yang ditonton). English
              translation:  “watching the ape monkeying around"). </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As the result of his statement: a number of parties who were
              members of the Public Forum at Yogyakarta (FMY) reported this incident to the
              Regional Police (Polda) DIY. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">According to FMY,  George statement were insulting and
              abusing to the cultural institutions of Yogyakarta Palace ( Keraton ) . George
              later on were charged with the clause 156 of the Criminal Code which refers to
              “the act of defamation of a person or institution”.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">His colleague were saying that George is an irrational man
              and  has a bad moral. For instance, last year, George were planning to
              marry another women , he decided to divorce his wife by asking the court to
              certify it. His excuses  were plain and simple  that he was not
              sexually satisfied with his wife and he believes that he made a wrong decision by
              marrying unintellectual wife. His planned was to  giving up a parental
              rights.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">During the trial, all the evidences and the acts  were
              not enough for George to divorce his wife. In return the Judge recommended his
              wife to give a counter sue. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">He is definitely a master of deceit by making up stories and
              manipulating the facts. He is willing to discard his wife for the sake of
              filthy desire.</p>
