Let's say you earn about $1500 per month. If you scrimp and save and you stay in rental flat, you probably have enough to migrate to other countries in 10 years' time.

Just like your company will you a little percent of their stock if you do well.<br><br>Renting is discouraged because you don't own the flat. You can save a lot of money from buying a flat. Let's say you earn about $1500 per month. If you scrimp and save and you stay in rental flat, you probably have enough to migrate to other countries in 10 years' time. By making you buy the flat, you have to finish paying everything before you could do that. If not, I don't think you can migrate.<br><br>The government is indirectly keeping all Singaporeans in Singapore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>xiaomayi,<br><br>you don't have to finish paying for your flat before you can migrate you know. you can just sell the flat to someone else.</div>
