            <div class='col-md body'>My take on the issue:<br><br>It is good that the govt acknowledge the needs of the low-income and provide for accomodation for them.<br><br>The amt of over supply 5 rooms flat shows poor planning for HDB in focusing large flats without looking into the demand for the flats.<br><br>Rental.. it depends on the room type.  Correct me if I am wrong, rental for large flat type (5 rm and above) may be justified (instalment payment is in the 1.3k range whereas rental is about 1.2k).  Smaller size units will have rental payment higher than the instalment payment.<br><br></div>
