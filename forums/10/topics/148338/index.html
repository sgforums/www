            <div class='col-md body'>You are wrong.... now its china stockpiling oil. As reported by newspaper.... china is builing 6 giant containers to house million of million gallon of fuel.<br><br>Its aim is to last china for 3 months of petrol needs in case china wage wars with taiwan and US cut the supply line which runs from arab countries thru melacca straits till china seas.<br><br>Somemore while China insist persuading russia to build the billion dollars gas pipe which Russia count as not economical feasible but CHina still want it? In case the fuel supply was cut off from sea.<br><br>Somemore the desert area or inner mongolia or xinjiang has the 3rd largest oil reservers. China isnt digging it at all first.... they wanted to let other depleted before digging and then can sell at far better price.<br><br>US suffers most with high oil price as their cars has the biggest cc and drink far more fuel than other country and the have the highest no. of vehicles in the world.<br><br>Dont simple shoot the gun at US just because you dont like the country or government. Get the facts right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Both giants are playing games lah.<br><br>If you look at the entire oil industry, Arabs are only the producer of the raw material known as crude oil. These crude oil is like iron ores which needs special facilities to process to refine them into petrol, diseal or kerosene. The Arabs and OPEC members, would sell the oil to the few international giants like Exxon Mobile, British Petrol, Shell etc, these giants are the ones which control the majorities of the oil refineries in the world. Their work is the MOST value added part of the oil industry. Small refineries are very difficult to compete with them due to the sheer volume of oil process capability and distribution network. In addition, these giants are very active in the trading markets (New York, London &amp; SINGAPORE, suprise!!). Oil is traded as a commodities in these 3 international market for futures.<br><br>Now you see, majorities of the oil industries are in hands of Ang Moh already. Our indon and malaysian friends oil fields are actually also "managed" by these few giants. Why? You must remember that the oil requirement in the world is very big. They are traded in volumes beyond your comprehension, thus only big giants are capable and confident to meet the stingent requirements listed in the trading contracts. Any delays in fulfilling the trading contracts will results in many millions dollars of compensation to the customers.<br><br>So despite our US friends are pumping expensive oil, they are still at the winning ends. The oil giants are mostly listed in States would report strong profits and generate employments in the home turfs. The recent oil price spike has also encourage US to do drilling in the California and Alsaka. Soon, we will see States becoming and net oil exporter in the world stage as well.<br><br>Our china friends are not in the losing ends either. They host the huge community of US companies in the China. Any expensive oil in china will straight away pass on to the manufacturing cost of the US based companies in china. These will hurt their US profit reporting coming soon in Dec 2005. The recent oil shortage saga is a show for US to see, let the US decide if the benefits for cheapo oil can be shared with China. More will unfold in 17 Sep 2005, when Chinese President WU Jin Tao visit Mr Bush in States and discussed it over the fireplace on how to share the cake.</div>

In addition, these giants are very active in the trading markets (New York, London &amp; SINGAPORE, suprise!!). Oil is traded as a commodities in these 3 international market for futures.<br><br>Now you see, majorities of the oil industries are in hands of Ang Moh already. Our indon and malaysian friends oil fields are actually also "managed" by these few giants. Why? You must remember that the oil requirement in the world is very big. They are traded in volumes beyond your comprehension, thus only big giants are capable and confident to meet the stingent requirements listed in the trading contracts. Any delays in fulfilling the trading contracts will results in many millions dollars of compensation to the customers.<br><br>So despite our US friends are pumping expensive oil, they are still at the winning ends. The oil giants are mostly listed in States would report strong profits and generate employments in the home turfs. The recent oil price spike has also encourage US to do drilling in the California and Alsaka. Soon, we will see States becoming and net oil exporter in the world stage as well.<br><br>Our china friends are not in the losing ends either. They host the huge community of US companies in the China. Any expensive oil in china will straight away pass on to the manufacturing cost of the US based companies in china. These will hurt their US profit reporting coming soon in Dec 2005. The recent oil shortage saga is a show for US to see, let the US decide if the benefits for cheapo oil can be shared with China. More will unfold in 17 Sep 2005, when Chinese President WU Jin Tao visit Mr Bush in States and discussed it over the fireplace on how to share the cake.</div></blockquote>can't blame ang moh..we only have ourselves to blame to lagging behind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> confucian culture kills.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

And such investments will be hit due to global slowdown in terms of spendings by the absurd oil price. And what will happen to the US dollars? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>You ain't strengthening greenbacks with higher oil prices, you are pressuring it to weaken even further. The nature of the greenbacks' strength is not on fundamentals, but on high transactions on a huge multiplier effect. What will happen if Oil price is hurting US investments worldwide, especially in growth areas such as China?<br><br>You are hence correct to say the capital surpluses is financing current deficits, but here be reminded that it's always the growth markets that supports the needed investment growth rates (and hence capital surpluses), hurt them, and you gotta increase the price to $1000 a barrel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  It's a vicious cycle, because while US controls the oil, other growth areas controls US's investments' outcome. Hence, indirectly investment vacuums such as China and India determine the fate of US's captial surpluses. And US needs these growth areas more than these areas need those Oil at such high prices. They were poor and developing, but US is sitting on a huge massive bubble and more demands for cheaper imports in their shops.<br><br>You can say US people'd spend much more on such cheap products and investment out there than people would on Oil the US controls. It's either gonna hurt US investments or bloat US appetitide for consumption of imports. Neither is going to be good for either accounts.<br><br>And even US population ain't gonna like it when they have to pay so much for the petrols in or not in US$.<br><br>See? So what happen when Oil Price does go down? It's gonna hurt no one but US$ more heavily.</div>
