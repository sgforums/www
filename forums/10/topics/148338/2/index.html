Whichever the case, there's no way you are not gonna hit US investment and goodwill out there with such fuel cost. Ultimately, you ain't really removing the current deficits but you are bloating it eventually.<br><br>What'd happen to US internal economy itself when capital growth is hit? The entire banking system is gonna be crushed no matter how much Fed'd raise rates. People'd just invest elsewhere, and abandoning more US$. The point is, oil price definitely cannot last high forever. Any smarties would realise after oil price returns to normal the growth areas such as China will bounce back even harder. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  The main flagship that's sustaining such consumption in US is really the capital market. And capital market cannot just create more debts when overseas investments in growth areas got hit. It threatens to kill businesses in US and blow up the bubble.<br><br>So it's really what happens after the oil price falls back. This has to be more stupidiest thing to do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  It is kinda blowing up others and blowing up yourself as well. Whatever debt you are clearing here is simply created there at the instance to make up for investment losses out there or channelled back directly to China, out of US. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  You end up only more reliance on (eg) China.<br><br>US exports will also hurted given the unnatural resilience of the Dollar, based not on fundamentals... And that'd hurt US businesses/economy more than anybody.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">I heard that the petrol price goes up partially due to the China's high demand.<br><br>But also heard (from a Land Banking presentation) that once Alberta in Canada opens up, the price will come down.  Alberta has the most oil after Saudi Arabia.<br><br>Hope this is true.  Now the price is killing us!! </div></blockquote>What the land banking people tell you is only partially true.  They know as much about oil as I know about open-heart surgery, which is nothing.<br><br>The tar sands in Alberta is not oil.  It is a hard bitumen-like substance which takes a lot of energy (specifically natural gas) to convert to synthetic petroleum.  At present, Canada is only able to produce around 1 million barrels of such synthetic oil per day.  The Saudis produce around 9 million barrels a day.<br><br>At current rates of natural gas production in Canada, 60% of which must be exported to the USA under the NAFTA agreement, one wonders if natural gas in there will run out before tar sands contribute meaningfully to world oil supplies.<br><br>regards,<br>siginah</div>
