              <p>I read other forum postings which are far more "worse" than here.   I believe the lees are aware what people talk about in forums.   If they change for the better for the good of the people, there will not be so many talking against them.    Basically, I believe majority of us are not troublemakers who surf forums to harm them.</p>

              <p>Well smart is one thing. But being able to show concern is another in itself. The government has to have a combination of both. Brains and concern to be successful. Because, no matter how smart you are, lack of true concern will be detected sooner or later.</p>

              <p>So if to say our other political parties are keep opposing to
              the ruling parties, they going to get themselves destroyed too.</p>
              <p>It's a matter of what is their fundamental and primary motives
              in running their parties: for the interest of people or out of ego

              <p>Another thing I believe of the government body is that they
              don't understand the people's hardships to go out and work day
              after day. They increased the taxes because we spend on luxury
              items. But we work for that. And they want to take it.</p>

              <p><br>1st part.. lee said no 1 owes sg a living, a facist remark. so dun expect govt will give u a single cent after u retire. u should have so much money to last since they so lovingly introduced the system of cpf that wipe clean any $$ in the OA when ppl buy house. den u get to start saving all over again. usually poor folks dont meet the minimum sum scheme and gets to enjoy the enomorous amount of a few hundred dollars monthly to retire beautifully. as if afriad u wun die, they raise tax to drain off the huge amount one would receive monthly from cpf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>tell me why m i taxed for the income i earned with my own effort again???</p>
