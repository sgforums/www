              <p><br>No, I haven't. Those are quite creative names. Haha...</p>
              <p>Well, for them, they have reasons why they quit...</p>
              <p>I personally believe people like/hate Singapore, be it locals or foreigners, for their own reasons, which is somewhat related to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.</p>
              <p>Singapore can give you the first two levels, food, water, shelter, security, property for you and your family. But perhaps not the other levels, such as creative expression (individual expression which may include lifestyle preferences) and the Western-style freedom of speech.</p>
              <p>That's why people leave Singapore for US/Europe/Australia for reasons such as the need for individual expression and lifestyle preferences, while on the other hand, people come to Singapore from other SEA countries/India/China for its stable environment and job opportunities.</p>

              <p>Your initial posts (those long ones), I take it, are well-meaning and trying to be encouraging.</p>
              <p>People are entitled to feel disgruntled now and then in this forum, and this is the best way to voice out one's feelings, barring slander of course.</p>
              <p> I may be wrong, but if I guess correctly, perhaps you may be a volunteer with Meet-the-People session, and if that's the case, I'm sure you know better than most the various pressing issues, e.g. inflation, with the common people, that's causing them to be disgruntled.</p>

              <p><br>Just a minor correction. I have no links to the ruling party, none at all and don't wish to allude that i am some party elite. I am just an oridinary citizen like you.</p>
              <p>It's common here that many adopt several clones to push their agenda, espacially the rabid ones, and it sure is outrageous fun to watch those opposition political opportunist suspect every new clone is the same person, because they cannot accept reality and prefer to live in denial that there could be oridinary citizens who would support the ruling party ( est70% at last election).</p>

              <p>Speaking late Wednesday, Lee, 84, warned Singapore voters against putting the opposition at the helm of government "in a moment of fickleness or just sheer madness" when they get "bored" at some point in the future.</p>
              <p>Should this happen, "I think all bets are off because in five years they (opposition) can ruin this place," he told hundreds of delegates.</p>
              <p>He stressed that, unlike many other countries, <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">Singapore</span> does not have natural resources such as oil, gas, forests, timber and aluminium.</p>
              <p>"When you are Singapore and your existence depends on performance -- extraordinary performance, better than your competitors -- but that performance disappears because the system on which it is based is eroded, then you've lost everything."</p>
              <p>Lee, widely credited for shepherding the underdeveloped port into one of Asia's wealthiest nations in one generation, said younger <span>Singaporeans</span> often tell him he is "playing the same old record" when he delivers his message.</p>
              <p>Singapore's small opposition has only two seats in a parliament dominated by the People's Action Party which has been elected since 1959.</p>
              <p>Despite its economic success, local and international civil rights groups have criticised the government for cracking down hard on dissenters and political activists.</p>
              <p>Street protests are rare and public gatherings of five people or more are banned without a police permit.</p>
              <p>Lee has maintained that Western-style liberal democracy is not the right model for Singapore.</p>
              <p>He said one ingredient for a country's success is putting able leaders in government, but that this could be difficult under a more freewheeling US-style democracy.</p>
              <p>Lee holds the cabinet rank of Minister Mentor in the government of his son, <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong</span>.</p>

              <p>Government of other advanced countries that have natural resources do not directly engage in mining of these resources.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Yes, your point of contention has always been natural resources. But do you know how mining industry works? Do you think that the Australian Government is directly involved in the mining and sale of these natural resources? Think again.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining">While exploration and mining can sometimes be conducted by individual entrepreneurs or small business, most modern-day mines are large enterprises requiring large amounts of capital to establish. Consequently, the mining sector of the industry is dominated by large, often multinational, mostly publicly-listed companies. See <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Category:Mining companies</span></span> for a list. However, what is referred to as the 'mining industry' is actually two sectors, one specializing in exploration for new resources, the other specializing in mining those resources. The exploration sector is typically made up of individuals and small mineral resource companies dependent on public investment. The mining sector is typically large and multi-national companies sustained by mineral production from their mining operations.</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">A number of large multinational mining companies including <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">BHP Billiton</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Newcrest</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Rio Tinto</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Alcoa</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chalco</span></span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Alcan</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Xstrata</span></span> operate in Australia. There are also a lot of small mining and mineral exploration companies listed on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Australian Stock Exchange</span></span> (ASX). Overall, the resources sector represents almost 20% of the ASX market by capitalisation, and almost one third of the companies listed. <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[8]</span></span></sup></a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Mining contributes about 5.6% of Australia's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gross Domestic Product</span></span>. This is up from only 2.6% in 1950, but down from over 10% at the time of federation in 1900. <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[9]</span></span></sup> In contrast, mineral exports contribute around 35% of Australia's exports. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal (35% of international trade), iron ore, lead, diamonds, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">rutile</span></span>, zinc and zirconium, second largest of gold and uranium, and third largest of aluminium. <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[10]</span></span></sup></a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Of the developed countries, perhaps only in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Canada</span></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Norway</span></span> does mining play as significant a part in the economy; for comparison, in Canada mining represents about 3.6% of the Canadian economy and 32% of exports <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[11]</span></span></sup>, and in Norway mining, dominated by petroleum, represents about 19% of GDP and 46% of exports.<sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[12]</span></span></sup> By comparison, in the United States mining represents only about 1.6% of GDP<sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[13]</span></span></sup>.</a></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">Despite its export importance, the mining sector employs only a small proportion of the workforce - roughly 129,000 Australians, representing only about 1.3% of the total labor force <sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">[14]</span></span></sup>.</a></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Essentially what the government does is sell the land to these stock exchange listed mining companies and leave the sourcing and procuring of minerals to these private companies. The government gets paid for the lease of the land in the form of either a fixed sum or annual sum, alot like the selling of commercial land in Singapore. The money obtained from the sale or rental of these mines goes into helping the citizens of Australia as claimed by you. But where has the money from the sale of commercial land in Singapore gone. Unless you going to start arguing with me, telling me that these publicly listed companies on the stock exchange gives donation to the Australian government for no apparent reason, that I have nothing else to comment. </span></strong></span></p>

              <p><br>MM Lee said if the opposition took over the govt, it might b ruined within five years. Could u all please ask your self all these years since 2006 general election, ruling</p>
              <p>party votes dropped n a lot of locals are migrating to other countries resulting in a brain drain, is there a possibility he is afraid that in the next coming election, one GRC might b lost to the opposition? Take a look at Aljunied GRC's vote in 2006 election result</p>

              <p>Sad to hear the predicament of that aunty.   Few MPs are kind.  Most are  heartless for they allow themselves to be brainwashed and practise the PAP style of managing people, interacting with people.   They don't care for they are paid well and can't be bothered to be kind and helpful, understanding to people in need.   They just need to say one statement and that is it people will get what they mean and not go to them for help.   Do we need people like that to take care of us?</p>
              <p>Please encourage that aunty to tell as many people as possible about the way she was treated by the MP.   BY the way, if you don't mind what is the name of the female MP?    </p>

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew must have known there seem more and more people in Singapore are aware of how the oppositions are treated by him.    I believe he does not underestimate that there is continuous growing number of supporters for the oppositions (we saw that in the last election), so he is smart to step in to brainwash Singaporeans through his lky's controlled media that opposition would ruin Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is not possible that oppositions ruin Singapore when he is after their every step.  He is watching them closely and always never hesitates to fight back with oppositions even making them bankrupt, defaming them.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee, you must be joking when you said opposition would ruin Singapore.  We are mature adults we know who are lethal, oppositions or yourself/your son/PAP.     Mr Lee, your words are not magic.   Mr Lee, we singaporeans don't need to kowtow to you, we don't need to believe every word you say.</p>
