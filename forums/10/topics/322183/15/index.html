              <p><br>Yes you may be right. But then they seem to be captitalising on it, squeezing the people dry. And now that the people are not happy, LKY gone onto the stage and says not to vote for the opposition. The current governing party, PAP knows that we do not have faith in the opposition.

              <p>The education system here is propaganda of PAP.   PAP being the ruling party, of course the school has to show all the good side of PAP and hiding the ugliness.   LKY, PAP are in control of the newspapers, radio, TV, magazines, so what you get from these sources are many times propaganda.</p>

              <p>Don't talk so much lah everyone.  If the next election we still vote for PAP, we can slap our own face.</p>

              <p>The analogy goes like this: PAP is an experience taxi driver but tempered his fare meter and take the longer route so we are always overcharged.  Opposition is a new taxi driver who got a kopi license,</p>
              <p>The opposition parties must make Singapore feel secured and gain their confidence.  They must recruit more creditable professionals especially those brain-drained talents overseas.  They must have a definite plan for the future and must show strength of character like Dr.Chee SJ.</p>
