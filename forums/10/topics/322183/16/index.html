              <p>Don't talk so much lah everyone.  If the next election we still vote for PAP, we can slap our own face.</p>
              <p>We are conditioned to be bo-ji (no guts), we were given a big fright until our balls retracted inside our body in KK the day we were born.</p>
              <p>He is out there to scare us again.  The question is, do you really dare to vote for the opposition.</p>
              <p>The analogy goes like this: PAP is an experience taxi driver but tempered his fare meter and take the longer route so we are always overcharged.  Opposition is a new taxi driver who got a kopi license,</p>
              <p>The opposition parties must make Singapore feel secured and gain their confidence.  They must recruit more creditable professionals especially those brain-drained talents overseas.  They must have a definite plan for the future and must show strength of character like Dr.Chee SJ.</p>

              <p><br>You are absolutely right. The opposition also must show that they are capable. But then, the PAP are not proving anything anymore. Except how much pay they are getting.</p>
