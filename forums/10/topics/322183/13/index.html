              <p>DeerHunter, stfu &amp; gtfo, you've rated yourself as a pure mfb, you talk so highly of PAP, when the opposition wins over, let's see where you hide. It's just a matter of time, you can have all the fun now, but let's see who has the last laugh.</p>

              <p><br>Please dimtri, it is not a matter of hiding their heads if PAP does not win. Support of a party is just that support. Not that they are frantics. They have the right to adress their views as much as you. Mrs Lee is not the person who did all the things we disagree with. Such as rasing taxes and the rest of it. It is the PM and MM. Why don't we concentrate on those two characters?</p>
