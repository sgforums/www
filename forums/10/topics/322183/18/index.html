              <p>wat lee has said is an opportunity cost question. he has no grounds that opposition cannot bring sg to greater heights. neither can he guarantee sg will be brought to greater heights under pap dynastic rule.</p>
              <p>by greater heights i meant not just economically, but also a better distribution of wealth among common sg ppl. morally, and basically that will help sg commoners be able to live better. not considering that every person will have a car as it will have an adverse effect on the planet.</p>

              <p>How long has it been since US soldiers have been in Iraq? does Bush Jr not clam that it will be a swift victory and power will return to the Iraqi people? He is sitting comfortable at his posh residence while innocent soldiers and civilians are dying each day? How do we justify this war? Freedom from Saddam Hussein? Nothing has changed since he died....war still goes on within Iraq and its people. Is it the oil the US are trying to control?</p>

              <p>There is a reason for the growing discontent among Americans about Bush Jr and there is an increasing no. of them who now opposes the war whereas support it in the 1st place (due to fear propoganda).</p>

              <p>Well, tell that to Raymond Lim. I rather they raise road tax or COE to reduce the number of cars than raise ERP. Or better still, speed up the improvements to the public transport network.</p>

              <p>You do realise it is much more of a luxury to own a car in Singapore than in most other developed countries.</p>

              <p>Many people are undecided who they will vote for in the next election.
              They seem to be thinking that either way, they will have to live with
              the reality without any solution with the government hell bent on
              getting its way while th oppositions are not yet ready to attract good

              brainwashed into believing that the ruling party is honestly working
              for the people. <br> <br> Today they have seen the true color. What they see is a ruling party
              selfishly working to preserve and protect its own gains using one
              excuse after another to do so. Despite all the problems like rising
              costs of living or failures of ministers in working for and in the
              interest of the people, no one is willing to take the rap for any
              shortcomings or failures.<br> <br> If you see such a rogue government what do you do? There is no if and
              but now except to change for whatever it is worth. Unless within these
              three years before the next election there are fundamental overhaul of
              the whole governing system to a people-centred government.</p>

              <p>Mr LKY is correct, running a small and powerless country like singapore needs a different form of administration. If the opposition comes in, I can opt for migration le. No point.</p>
              <p>And to some losers of repliers, the present George W. Bush, president of America now. Have a military manufacturing company called United Defence and have used Iraq as a scapegoat. I will not go into the details, its classified, I dun wanna get sg into trouble.</p>
              <p>So to those who said opposition should come in, I will say its dumb of u. Plain dumbshit.</p>
              <p>Different "business", different running methods. As for sg, we cant even stand on the line of neutral, we are not evening in the battleline. So ya, stfu guys and dun get urself into trouble.</p>

              <p>if the opposition can only boast of people like Chiam and Jeyer as their most outstanding candidates (which I happen to think that yes they definitely are great people), then yes I think the opposition will ruin Singapore. 2 great people will not be able to bring Singapore to greater heights. You need more people like them in the opposition.</p>

              <p><br>If you are jealous, just say so. Why attempt to smear me as copying someone else's work? Show me whom i plagiarised from, but you won't do it, because your way is the slander way, go ahead then, but my poem will keep ringing in your ears, so much so you had to attack it, a proof that it hurts you. I wonder if i replaced robertteh name in the poem with CSJ name, would it rhyme and fits the context as well?</p>
