              <p>But deerhunter is right. Without putting in effort, clever as you may well be, You will not go far. If you think that talent is very good and stuff, what is so clever about doing something that comes naturally to you? Sometimes, people admire hard work more than any other.</p>

              <p>Hey if things are so easy, I would be millionaire le. Look at the three most easy money raking businesses. All concerns war. Drugs, Arms and Oil. Thats why there is a phrase "War is always good for business". So u see how tight a situation singapore is in? If the Lee family step down, I hope there is an equivalent family going up.</p>

              <p>great question.</p>
              <p>however, they certainly have well qualified, hard gelled, side-parting technocrat who chalked up more paper qualification than their years of service in their fold. their servitude to the country is questionable since they will only work if their pay is comparable to that of the (hi-end pay scale) private sectors. never mind if they were to go out to the private sector, probably half of them could not command the kind of (obscene) pay scale they are getting now.</p>
              <p>has one ever wonder what can happen to singapore if a credible alternative voice is allowed to flourish? obviously it is a moot question here.</p>
              <p>analogically speaking, if prez bush were to changed its constitution to allow for perpetual rule to himself, shut down opposition forcibly, and declare any opposing views as threatening to national security, starts to put his own people into his circle of fiefdom, e.g. senior bush as president menthol, his florida gov bro as defence secretary, etc., the usa will be walking a narrow plank to national disaster. but of course, this will not happen as the constitution and the political process there protects this freedom of vote of the people. the reverse is also true here in singapore. </p>
              <p>in the current day and age, i have yet to witness any meltdown of a developed country because of a change in political leadership. the reverse is also true. it is those who perpetuate their rule that is doing the country &amp; its people a huge disservice. think north korea, myanmar and zimbabwe. you could also argue that singapore is still pretty much 3rd world from a political point of view since we still try to cling on to absolute rule.</p>
              <p>the question of whether there is (credible) opposition in singapore is a postscript. the question we should ask first is why such heavy-handed demonization of the opposition is practiced by a so-called rational, level headed crop of leaders? if we can practise and tolerate diversity in religion, race, etc., why not political viewpoints? and the bigger question we should ask ourselves is, why this current government is setting up the country for failure? never say `never', so the eventuality will happen. political winds of change will come sooner or later; and when it happens, this small, fragile, land locked, resource poor island will be ill-prepared for this and come down hard with a loud thud. or if by some freak results, the MIW loses its majority, can singapore brace itself to continue on with minimal disruption? probably not, all thanks to the kind of political process we have now.</p>
              <p>either way, singapore loses.</p>

              <p>Yes they have. Not saying that they are all good. But give credit where credit is due. We are a young country. To be where we are today, there must be something that they are doing right and of cos as some would countered, there are things or people they sacrificed. We cannot deny that Singapore, being a small country has proven to be outstanding and stood out tall in times of crisis. No matter what we say about them achieving success thru sacrificing singaporeans, lets just put it this way that there are no enjoying the best of both worlds. I dare say that there are no countries can give us what Singapore cannot give us and still give us what Singapore could. So despite of all my grouses, I still give credit to the current government for what they achieved.</p>
              <p>And coming back to that, I am always in support for opposition but to be honest, look at their kind of arguments they bring up sometimes in the parliament. Nitpicking at their best. Picking on small things and try to blow it big. Its laughable at times. But Chiam and Jeyer is different. I am especially impressed by Jeyer and to be honest, it wouldnt hurt the opposition if there are more like him.</p>

              <p>That I do not know. I am not that politically inclined anyway to make thorough analysis into so called conspiracies or the so called schemes of the government to kill singaporeans as claimed by some people in this forum.</p>
              <p>But I guess for anyone to commit to a cause, it has to be a worthy cause and something you are passionate for. Jeyer is a lawyer. He could have lived in luxury but knowing he could lose everything, he went ahead to fight the government. How many times has he lost but he just does not know when to quit. He just wun quit and i think it all boils down to fighting for a cause he truly believes in. Whats the difference between him and people on this forum? He did something. He stood out there and make a statement "I know I may and will lose everything but I gonna do it anyway." I feel that he has that "I may need to lose everything before I can gain something for the good of others"</p>
              <p>I am not so noble thats why I hardly participate in political discussions. But I have seen so many heated discussions that are against the government, it makes me wonder then why there are not many "TALENTS" from this forum who has joined Jeyer and Chiam in their crusades and actually do something. I thought I can gather that people just talked but are not willing to give up their money, their house, their bank savings or whatever possessions. People talked alot but ideals and just ideals.</p>

              <p>it just seems that there are some people who just think that for everything that happen, it is always a consipracy, it is always the fault of the government.

              <p>Ok apologies I did not make myself clear. I do think that there are some things that the government has to take responsibility for and at least owe us a more reasonable explanation. For the GST part, I do think that they have the power to either make it stay or increase it. And their explaination for increasing the GST to be honest, only people who are well versed in the market forces of economics would understand its long term impact. To most singaporeans, nobody would ever understand the rationale of increasing the GST and thus in that sense, I would say that yes the government has not done alot to justify their actions.</p>
              <p>What I was trying to say is that while some things the government need to justify, there are some things being brought up like the rest of the issues are just seriously funny if they really insist the government be responsible. I mean I heard some things like why some women cant give birth is because the society is so stressed and why it is so stressed is because the government make it so. I mean, what the hell haha.</p>
