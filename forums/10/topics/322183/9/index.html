Just wanna say this, I'm 18 and really, i have no faith in the youth of today, I find many of the to be either apathetic or bitching like spoiled brats. Many people like to point their fingers at the government for the rising cost of living etc... But randomly throwing insults at LKY as if he was Hitler is going too far, don't forget the fact that he has built what singapore is in 43 years, and if I were him, I'd be very proud of my work and would be extremely afraid of those opposing me. Personally, I have an attitude of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". The people of my generation are so spoiled, they think that life in singapore is bad, I'm half filipino and when i go to visit my relatives there and i walk down the street, that's what you call bad. I don't blame the rising cost of living on the government, I blame it on the towel-headed ragheads who sell the black liquid that is controlling the world right now.</p></div>
