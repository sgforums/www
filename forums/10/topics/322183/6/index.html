              <p>What he means is oppositions are in so-money-minded that once they are in power they will bankrupt the country by paying themselves millions in salaries to prevent self-corruptions and appointing all their wives and cronies to all the GIC or Temasek wildly spending our citizens' hard-earned monies on buying over Shin Corps or Barclays or UBSs for their own glories and all the terrorist security prisoners will be in danger of escaping through all the open windows or gates like the Mas Selamat.

              <p>A good and fair leader will not say such to brainwash people.    As we see from the Taiwan election, that is a fair one for the politicians give the people fair chances for voting.   Oppositions are given fair chances of appearing in public for election campaign.   PAP has lots to learn from Taiwan.   The KMT though had landslide win is humble.    This is the opposite of PAP.  When that loong won, he claimed that he had strong mandate which we know is bullshit.     Look at Taiwan, Mr Ma even allows the opposition member a chance to contribute.</p>
              <p>If lky is smart, he should shut his mouth.  The more he talks the more sins he incurs.  He is responsible for making people so "fan gan" of him.</p>

              <p>Speaking late Wednesday, Lee, 84, warned Singapore voters
              against putting the opposition at the helm of government "in a
              moment of fickleness or just sheer madness" when they get "bored"
              at some point in the future.</p>
              <p>Should this happen, "I think all bets are off because in five
              years they (opposition) can ruin this place," he told hundreds of
              delegates.</p>
              <p>He stressed that, unlike many other countries, <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">Singapore</span> does not have natural resources such as oil, gas, forests, timber
              and aluminium.</p>
              <p>"When you are Singapore and your existence depends on
              performance -- extraordinary performance, better than your
              competitors -- but that performance disappears because the system
              on which it is based is eroded, then you've lost everything."</p>
              <p>Lee, widely credited for shepherding the underdeveloped port
              into one of Asia's wealthiest nations in one generation, said
              younger <span>Singaporeans</span> often tell him he is
              "playing the same old record" when he delivers his message.</p>
              <p>Singapore's small opposition has only two seats in a parliament
              dominated by the People's Action Party which has been elected since
              1959.</p>
              <p>Despite its economic success, local and international civil
              rights groups have criticised the government for cracking down hard
              on dissenters and political activists.</p>
              <p>Street protests are rare and public gatherings of five people or
              more are banned without a police permit.</p>
              <p>Lee has maintained that Western-style liberal democracy is not
              the right model for Singapore.</p>
              <p>He said one ingredient for a country's success is putting able
              leaders in government, but that this could be difficult under a
              more freewheeling US-style democracy.</p>
              <p>Lee holds the cabinet rank of Minister Mentor in the government
              of his son, <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong</span>.</p>

              <p>It's very common for people to trust himself/herself <strong>more</strong> than other people isn't it? I guess LKY trusts himself more than he thinks he can trust the opposition? But only he himself knows whether he himself can be trusted or not. Any single one of us can guess or deduce as to who is more trustworthy, LKY or opposition. But no one can be absolutely certain, unless we're worms in their brain.</p>
              <p>Hence, PAP and the oppositions can do/say whatever is needed to grab votes, and we can choose whoever we think is more trustworthy. In the future then we will know whether we made the right choice or not. It's how this world works isn't it? We can be confident we know something about someone or something, but we can never be sure until the very last moment.. *sigh*</p>

              <p>TS may have a point. I do have a real concern about our opposition. Not any opposition but those seating in the parli now.</p>
              <p>My concern arises from the fact that its been exactly 4 MONTHS now since abang went on freedom marathon, and look what the Opps have done in the respect of asking for the latest report on abang , the toilet breaker. Opps in parli may have attempted once to ask the status. But that may be long long long ago. What is needed now is the latest update given its 4 months anniversary today.</p>
              <p>There could be some reasons.</p>
              <p>But I believe public is very much interested to know the truth as to what is the latest findings about abang escape.</p>
              <p>Absolutely no clue, some clue or found him already? Dead or Alive?</p>

              <p>It's very common for people to trust himself/herself <strong>more</strong> than other people isn't it? I guess LKY trusts himself more than he thinks he can trust the opposition? But only he himself knows whether he himself can be trusted or not. Any single one of us can guess or deduce as to who is more trustworthy, LKY or opposition. But no one can be absolutely certain, unless we're worms in their brain.</p>
              <p>Hence, PAP and the oppositions can do/say whatever is needed to grab votes, and we can choose whoever we think is more trustworthy. In the future then we will know whether we made the right choice or not. It's how this world works isn't it? We can be confident we know something about someone or something, but we can never be sure until the very last moment.. *sigh*</p>

              <p>singapore is a zimbabwe-in-the-making. when credible opposition do emerge (eventually) and challenge the incumbent for office, the military will come out in force to protect the status quo. i think lky himself alluded to that some time back.</p>
              <p>if the singapore political process does not change soon, i am sure of it that it will happen. singapore will go thru' a painful process of change to `cleanse' itself of all these crazy political gumbo we are in. and when that happens, the singapore generation then that will have to live thru' this `hell' will be handed a great (undeserved) injustice; all because of the insatiable lust for (absolute) power from this current crop of PAP men.</p>
