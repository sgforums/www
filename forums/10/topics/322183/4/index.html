              <p>Hi DH,</p>
              <p>Your initial posts (those long ones), I take it, are well-meaning and trying to be encouraging.</p>
              <p>People are entitled to feel disgruntled now and then in this forum, and this is the best way to voice out one's feelings, barring slander of course.</p>
              <p> I may be wrong, but if I guess correctly, perhaps you may be a volunteer with Meet-the-People session, and if that's the case, I'm sure you know better than most the various pressing issues, e.g. inflation, with the common people, that's causing them to be disgruntled.</p>
              <p>MM Lee himself said in today's papers that he might have been sounding like a broken record. It may suggest he knows the young in Singapore is not convinced. As far as I know, the older generation (50s-60s) has split loyalties, depending on whether they are English or Chinese educated, the middle-aged generation also have split loyalties, but perhaps the young generation is not convinced life in Singapore is good.</p>
              <p>One cannot sweep their attitudes away like it's plain wrong, or what.</p>
              <p>In general, whether it's between parent-child, spouses or govt-people, nobody likes to be lectured, without first being heard and acknowledged.</p>
              <p>Hope this post doesn't come across as offensive to anyone.</p>
