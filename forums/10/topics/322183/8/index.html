              <p>You can safely ignore the gibberish mouthed by maurizo 13. He was the first one who claimed HK, Australians and whatnots as better off than Singapore, and had been shot down by me time and time again for his stupidity, half truths and lies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Australia has a whole lot of natural resources and collect ROYALTIES from the private companies that mine them. Minerals and Petroleum amounted to AUS$2 billion in royalties in 2007, with trade figures at AUS$10billion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These equation will show why australia can afford to give whatever they wish for their society:-</p>
              <p>Australia</p>
              <p>Natural resources royalties + 30% corporate taxes + 7 million sqkm land revenues + trade revenues + 21 million citizens market X 10% GST +  est 6 million working adults X 45% personal income tax</p>
              <p>=lots of money for social spending, subsidies</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore</p>
              <p>No natural resources royalties + 20% corporate tax + land revenues est 700sqkm land revenue + trade revenues + 3.5million citizens market X 7% GST + est 1.7million working adults X income tax(only 30% pay taxes, with highest at only 20%)</p>
              <p>= minimal amount for careful social spending and subsidies, only for required areas and balance saved for future generations.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/242323">£ Ä¬ €Ú°</a>, just ignore maurizo13. He is an ignoramus blundering irrational lout. As for the rest of his loutish gang, i don't even want to mention.</p>

              <p>Please, what LKY say can be right, mainly because there is no way for us to tell the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current opposition may not run singapore well, mainly because the current opposition don't really want to do so. But, the ability of the opposition party can change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Voting for an oppostion does NOT mean that the opposition can run the country better than the ruling party. There<strong> IS </strong>a possibility that the oppostion will mismanage singapore..which some members here <strong>LOVES</strong> to ignore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is seeking a politcal gain better than us having a harder time living in singapore? I don't think so. Some members view about the politics is way too personal and short-sighted. They don't give a damn about what is good for other singaporeans, they just want to have things that suit their personal interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And at times, their personal interest in the short term may cause them much hardship in the long term.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would rather have the opposition having a harder time to climb it's way to the top, as compared to simply spoon-feeding them and granting them power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An oppostion party that climbs it way to the top have a better chance of being prepared in the role as the government as compared to an opposition which won a sudden and dramatic victory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless one person is from the future, there is NO way for anyone to say if LKY is right or wrong, other than saying there is a chance for it to happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And please, we don't need to go V for vendetta just to ensure the opposition can win, In fact, even if the oppostion came to power via 'V for vendetta', there is no way to tell if that oppositon is any better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A good opposition can defeat a strong ruling party just like how some commanders can defeat an army larger than him through sheer genius.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also, the PAP is already having trouble finding support from the 4th generation of singaproe, my generation that is, the people who was born in the late 80s-90s, people who have experienced the full prosperity that singapore enjoys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the opposion fail to gain their support from the 4th generation, then it is the opposition fault for losing it and not the PAP's fault.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, the current political landscape is good for the opposition, because they needs to be smart just to win the election...as compared to simply shouting out <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oGkl2VXmRIS2kAhoJXNyoA/SIG=15r8kg71k/EXP=1214623765/**http%3a//search.yahoo.com/search%3fei=UTF-8%26fr=yfp-t-501%26fp_ip=SG%26p=rhetoric%26SpellState=n-3180876162_q-5yQqMIi1SAkX2w0ulDo19wAAAA%2540%2540%26fr2=sp-qrw-corr-top"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #041be5;">rhetoric</span></span></em></strong></a><span style="color: #cc3232;"> </span>...</p>
