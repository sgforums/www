              <p>Why our old folks believe that leh?</p>
              <p><br>In the 60s, public housing was upgraded (from village to HDB), and I think a lot of people were very pleased with that.</p>
              <p>Malays and Chinese were also fighting one another. LKY and team personally settled the differences between Malays and Chinese. I think they went down personally to army camp to settle a gangfight between first-batch recruits among Malays and Chinese. This brought stability to Singapore (look at Malaysia, Indians were rioting some months back, they had that problem since 1957)</p>
              <p>You can say quality of life of our old folks back then is improved many fold.</p>
              <p>But you're right, now it doesn't work. Nobody can live on past glory.  The lives of our generation are harder, thanks to globalization.</p>
              <p>Our current leaders need to give us room for a voice, and they need to work on building trust with the people again (Look at Ong Teng Cheong, who has had a bad thing to say about him, at least not that I know of), something which they lost somewhere between the mid-80s and now.</p>
              <p>They cannot remove distrust by policies. It will only act like a slow disease.</p>

              <p>LKY contributed in the past but now he is taking that as reason for him to behave as he wants at the expense of the people.    LKY is evil.</p>
