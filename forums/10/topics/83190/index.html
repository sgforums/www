Because if u offended me so much so that i remembered it when i was powerful/rich (like some teacher did) i would conveniently scratch your car, or take your life.

If you have a problem with someone why not talk it out face to face instead of hiding behind petty vandalism?   Maybe this is why people don't like you and you keep getting beaten up (or so you claim)...  Not because of the way you look.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I think owning a car in Singapore, is not a cheap and easy thing to do. Firstly, one needs to ensure one can support a car. Once financial ability is confirmed, and the car is bought, one needs to take every effort to prevent / avoid having one's car scratched.<br><br>The popular thinking and opinion that owning a car is covenient, is a misconception. Because with it, comes parking space hassles, parking coupon time running out when visiting clients or friends, and then there's the current issue of having it scratched by some schizo maniac.<br><br>Several years ago, my car got scratched, and the culprit though reported to the Police, nothing was done about it. Until recently last year, the culprit who scratched my car cut the throat of an NUS proffessor and was diagnosed to be suffering from severe schizophrenia. This is my real experience with car-scratching individuals. They're mostly mad people.<br><br>Next, my solution is to park in well lit and exposed lots, where general public can see my car, and in corner lots . In covered multi-story carparks, I park near adjacent flats where residence can see the carpark and is bright - as well as in corner lots.<br><br>I believe if you park carelessly, such as near pick up trucks, vans and lorries, these illiterate drivers will fling their door open so hard and wide, it bang against the side of your car, causing an ugly dimple to form. Or if you park so close to the neighboring vehicle that the driver of the other parked car find hard to enter his vehicle, he may scratch your car in frustration and out of revenge. REMEMBER, people ( or motorists ) in Singapore are VERY vengeful. Generally, with the costs of living and owning a car in Singapore so high, these sort of behaviour is inevtiable. So to live with it, we all need to adopt certain extreme measures to avoid these sort of disappointments, and heartaches.<br><br>I always take my time when looking for a "safe" parking lot. I park far away from where I am going to if I have to, just so that my car can be safe from sick people, in heartlands.<br><br>In this regard, forget convenience of owning a car. Because when you park conveniently, and without consideration of such probabilities, chances are, one day your car WILL be scratched.<br><br>Believe me, I've been driving for more than 20 years, and even when you are careful as a motorist, you cannot be sure to stay out of accidents - just because others are wreckless on the road.<br><br>So owning a car in Singapore, and driving it is stressful. Not convenient. Why do I own a car than?? Because I don't wanna be amongst those buried underground should some maniac manages to sneak a bomb into an MRT train some day.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is petty to worry and complain about one's car being scratched. What's more, it minimizes your chances of enjoying your car.<br><br>Worry less about your car's outer appearance. Be a little more concerned about taking care of your car's engine performance through regular servicing.<br><br>A car is merely a hunk of metal that transports one from point A to point B. A less detached attitude towards one's material possessions increases one's chances of happiness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But now that you all mention it. I actually would like to scratch someone's car. He was my old math teacher who gave me a hard time over some scribbles on my test paper. When i couldn't do a question because it was a much higher level qn, not even supposed to be included in a test at our level, i was like "wtf". Although i only wrote an abbreviation in small letters out of momentary surprise, time was up at that moment, and he was yelling for me to give him the script, before i could even erase it, since intuition told me people here like to jump at anything, especially authoritatrian teachers.<br><br>Well he gave back the script a while later all marked. And he started scolding me and yelling, accusing me of being "vulgar" towards him. Before i could even explain, he kept shutting me up. I really hated that situation, it fills me with anger thinking about it now. So by the time i am powerful to make him suffer in a dungeon, i think i would have forgotten him. SO i suppose by the time i am "semi"-powerful as in wealthy, i could hire some riff raff to scratch "WTF" on his car, it would be satisfying to have him remember me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anywayz, so am i mad in that sense?
