            <div class='col-md body'>This topic can only be relavent after it's privatised.<br><br>Being a stat board currently, and that all CISCO officers are legally similar to policemen, there are no legal avenues to take that organisation to task.<br><br>Then again.. it would be interesting to ponder then.. whether traffic wardens sould be outsourced to CISCO since there would be clear conflict of interest between the enforcer of traffic rules and one of the most blatant abuser of no parking traffic rules.

            <div class='col-md body'>the law will not immuse a CISCO officer, or even a police officer, from jaywalking across a road to get a pack of cig at the 7-11 store...<br><br>For tat matter, turning on the siren to fend cars away just to make it in time back to the station so that the officer can go home on time is not an excuse either.</div>
