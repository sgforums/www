The Health Minister did not blame anyone, but was very tactful to attribute the shortcomings to "honest human error", which should not lead to any "blame game" being pinned onto anyone - since the error was largely due to the types of high risks work involved.<br><br>This explanation is similar to that given by the previous Finance Minister Richard Hu, who had to defend the loss of Public Funds in the Ho Ching led debacle in the multi-million dollar loss in taking over MICROPOLIS.<br><br>There is always a soft explanation for the mistakes made by the Government, but there is no tolerance for any committed by the Singapore Citizens - even if it is an honest mistake, and even if it is very serious or minor mistake.<br><br>After the explanations, the Government intends to legislate laws to prevent a repeat of such an incident.<br><br>The creation of new laws, and more laws, and even tougher laws, seems to be the expertise of this Government to control and corner every activities in the lives of Singaporeans.<br><br>With a majority in Parliament, it will be little wonder that any legislations tabled in Parliament will be easily approved and passed to become Law - even if it is a lousy piece of legislations that the Justices will find it difficult to implement - (and there seems to be more such legislations that the Justices in the Court of Appeals, chaired by the Chief Justice himself, are finding out more of such weak and poorly legislated laws that need further clarifications).<br><br></div>

I share what he had found disturbing abt how the entire episode was handled by the authority: Lack of official accountability.<br><br>That, IMO, is a qualified argument and and nor it is a "totally irresponsible" way of throwing "the blame on everyone". The blame is squarely on the authorities this time, not any tom-dick or jerry. </span><br><br></div>

I think you've mis-read my point here:<br><br>It is NOT about how one show's the level of apology.regret or  remorse. Nor is it about why the their system is at fault. To err is to be human.<br><br>The ISSUE is how the authority had attempted to play down and even deflect THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY about the source of infection. Even the chief of EHI made a public statement claiming their labs and procedures are according to "US stardard" . He didn't attempt to eleborate more of WHAT sort of standard was applied to his lab. Now, it took WHO's investigation to reveal to true practices behind those supposedly highly-secured institutions.<br><br>So did EHI attempted to misled to public or did they made an "honest mistake"....<br><br>In this kind of risky-business EHI or MOE are dealing with, if their can't even adher to that fundermental concept of self-policing, strict standards and display a complete lack of competency and professionalism which has lead to this leak, they I suggest these pple be replaced.<br><br>Nation and the world is at stake here, not some individual's ego or rice bowl.</span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>It is a sign of the stagnancy of a system that has stopped to evolve, beginning to be self-contented, self-delusionary by arrogance, sense of infallibility and over-confidence.<br><br>The attitude displayed by the Head of the EHI was similar to the Acting Minister of Education's way of responding to parents concerned when no one knew what kind disease that broke out in Singapore - just when the last school holidays was about to end.<br><br>In any case, within four days, the statements made by the Acting Minister had to be corrected (without apologies), and schools were hurriedly closed for almost two weeks.<br><br>It will be very interesting if Singapore allow an audit by some UN appointed panels of Political and Judiciary Specialists to vet the Singapore system, so as to come up with another check-list of the weaknesses in the Singapore Political, Legislative and Judiciary system.<br><br></div>
