            <div class='col-md body'>'Angela'  (Cheshire)<br><br>Dad and I were very close. He had cancer and the doctors said there was nothing they could do. As his condition deteriorated he asked me to "help" him. I brushed it off, but I told the nurse who cared for Dad at home.<br><br>I thought that someone would intervene and help him. I couldn't believe that the medical professions were so inhumane that they would just stand by. I hadn't realized that the law in this country was so unbendable.<br><br>The night before he died I was up all night with him. Dad was still taking his morphine orally and I thought about overdosing him with the tablets, but he couldn't swallow them. I rang for the doctor and asked him to help. He said there was nothing he could do, but he authorized a morphine syringe driver. The nurse connected it up to a needle in my dad's chest and placed my hand over the button. Dad was conscious and able to tell Mum that he loved her. I delivered a 24-hour dose of morphine in five minutes.<br><br>People say to me that I did what my Dad wanted and it was a brave thing but at the end of the day it was an awful responsibility - I killed my father.<br><br>Properly controlled assisted deaths would not be so traumatic. Instead, a terminally ill patient could administer appropriate prescribed drugs which would allow them to die peacefully, and with dignity, at a time of their choosing.<br><br>Many "mercy killers" experience guilt, which can lead to self-mutilation, depression, drug dependency and even suicide. I turned to alcohol for a time. It is only recently, with counselling, that I have come to terms with all of this and finally grieve properly for my dear Father.<br><br></div>

By the time he was 21 he had gone through over 300 operations.

The doctors would not help him die and instead Danny practically had to starve himself to death. What he went through at the end of his life is a disgrace. After all Danny had to go through he should have at least had the choice of dying well.Â”<br><br>These are the words of DannyÂ’s parents, Mike and Beverley Dodds.

            <div class='col-md body'>Debbie Purdy - (Bradford)<br>My story<br>I live in Bradford with my husband Omar.<br><br>About ten years ago I was diagnosed with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. It reminded me that is that it's the quality of life that counts, not the quantity. Before I was diagnosed I jumped out of airplanes, went scuba diving and skiing. Now I have MS I can still do many of these things and I enjoy my life and the people around me.<br><br>What worries me the most about my disease is that it is degenerative. It is incurable. It will keep on getting worse and it will not stop. I have to live with the uncertainty of what this may mean. It may mean I lose control of my arms, to my ability to speak, swallow or breathe.<br><br>That uncertainty is why we need to change the law so that there is a choice. I don't want to be forced to make a decision about the end of my life before I am ready to stop enjoying it.  I want to wait until the last minute to decide if I can bear the facing pain and indignity I am facing.<br><br>I live my life with dignity and I want to make sure I have dignity in dying as well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Diane Pretty (Luton)<br>My story<br>Diane Pretty desperately wanted a doctor to help her to die. Motor neurone disease left her mind as sharp as ever, but it gradually destroyed her muscles, making it hard for her to communicate with her family. It left her in a wheelchair, catheterised and fed through a tube. Diane fought against the disease for the last 2 years of her life and had every possible medical treatment.<br><br>She was fully aware of what the future held and decided to refuse artificial ventilation. Rather than the fear of dying by choking or suffocation, she wanted a doctor to help her die when she was no longer able to communicate with her family and friends. She discussed this with her husband of 25 years, Brian, who had to come to terms with what she wanted and to respect her decision. Brian says that losing her was devastating for him and their two children but he would have been pleased if Diane could have had the good death she so desperately wanted, a quick death without suffering, at home surrounded by her family so that she could say good-bye to them.<br><br>If she had been physically able Diane said she would have taken her own life. That's not illegal. But because of the terrible nature of her illness she could not do this - to carry out her wishes she would have needed assistance. Diane died in a hospice in May 2002, having fought in the High Court and the European Court of Human Rights. Her widower, Brian, has never stopped campaigning for justice for Diane. Nobody has done more to promote the need for reform of our law.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr Anne Turner (Bath)<br>Dr Anne Turner explains in her own words why she went abroad for assistance to die.<br>The reason I want an assisted suicide is because, at the end of November 2004, I was diagnosed with PSP (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy), a neurological degenerative disease for which there is no treatment or cure.  Dr Thomas Stuttaford, writing in The Times in April 2002 said:<br><br>"It is said that old doctors in their prayers don't thank God for their continuing survival, but rather recite a litany of the diseases they wish to be spared.  Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) would be near the top of every praying doctor's list."<br><br>I am nearly 67, and a retired medical doctor.  My husband, also a medical doctor, died in September 2002 aged 72 of MSA (Multiple Systems Atrophy).  In January 2002 his brother (younger by only a few years and not living anywhere near here) died of Motor Neurone Disease.  Apparently PSP is somewhat akin to MSA.  Dudley Moore, a well-known entertainer, died of it in 2002 and at the end of his life was unable to walk, talk, swallow, or even blink.  I do not want to end up like that.  That is the main reason for my wanting to commit suicide.  Now I am finding walking, speaking and swallowing increasingly difficult and have had a series of nasty falls.  I broke my wrist twice and thumb once earlier last year and seemed to spend the early half of the year in plaster and waiting for hours in Out-patients'.  These fractures were the result of falls.<br><br>I started having falls in January 2003, which I put down to carelessness and I was unaware of my slurred speech.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy in February 2004.  I was then investigated for the falls and slurred speech as I had had a dreadful fall before the mastectomy and was very bruised.  An MRI scan did not show very much but a diagnosis of "mini-strokes" was made in May 2004. It was only because I reported deterioration in my speech in summer 2004 that I was referred to a neurologist who made the diagnosis of PSP. Because the diagnosis is so devastating I sought a second opinion, which confirmed the diagnosis.<br><br>I have discussed the question of suicide with my three children and my sister and one or two friends whom I had to tell.  In fact I tried to commit suicide on 9 October 2005 and was very nearly successful.  The net result was that I spent most of the next day asleep in the company of my above-mentioned family and it was after that that I contacted Dignitas to start the process of applying for assisted suicide.<br><br>I have been seen by one psychiatrist three times (and she also saw my children) and by another one once and they left no questions about my soundness of mind.  Nor did they think I was depressed and I do not think I am.  I know that I cry a lot but I also laugh inappropriately.  I think it is all part of the emotional lability, which is a feature of PSP.<br><br>Applying for assisted suicide with Dignitas is a lengthy process but eventually I was able to fix a date which is 24 January 2006 a day before my 67th birthday.  My three children all support my decision, especially as we have all seen the effect of a very similar illness in my husband: his terrible suffering, loss of dignity and his long slow demise.<br><br>I feel strongly that assisted suicide should become legal in this country.  In order to ensure that I am able to swallow the medication that will kill me, I have to go to Switzerland before I am totally incapacitated and unable to travel.  If I knew that when things got so bad, I would be able to request assisted suicide in Britain then I would not have to die before I am completely ready to do so.<br><br>I know that I am more fortunate than many other people in my situation, in that I have the knowledge and the finances and the support of my family to make assisted suicide in Switzerland possible.<br><br><strong>To die with dignity should be everybody's right.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Graham Lawson (Kent)<br>Graham tells how his sister Sue committed suicide and what happened to him after<br>In December 2003 I was arrested for assisting the suicide of my older sister, Sue, who suffered from multiple sclerosis.<br><br>Sue worked as a bank manager until her muscles started wasting away to the point where she couldnÂ’t walk. All of our family helped look after her, and we had a lot of support from the medical team and carers. SueÂ’s health went badly downhill in December 2002. She lost mobility and was in terrible pain. Because she was suffering so much, she decided she would end her life while she was still able so that she did not incriminate anyone else. She did not want anyone else to suffer because of her decision.<br><br>She told everyone, including her doctor and our mum and dad, that she was going to kill herself. She even wrote her Christmas cards early so we would have them on the day. Sue tried to end her life, but she was unsuccessful. Then she asked if I would be there for her when she died. She had already been through so much, I did not want her to be alone in her final hour.<br><br>She ended her life by taking some tablets and putting a plastic bag over her head. I sat with her and held her hand. It took Sue 26 hours to end her life. It was a harrowing experience.<br><br>After Sue had died, I called the doctor. The doctor got in touch with the coroner and I was arrested on suspicion of assisting in her suicide. I was stripped and searched, and it was the police who told my parents that Sue had died, not me. I spent 24 hours in the police station with all sorts of terrible things going through my mind. I knew I hadnÂ’t done anything wrong but I was scared.<br><br>This experience had a terrible effect on my dad and my mum, who became ill because of the stress of the investigation. It took 5 months to hold SueÂ’s funeral because the police wouldnÂ’t release her body until they decided whether to prosecute me.<br><br>I donÂ’t regret being there for Sue.  I do wish that she could have had a more dignified death.  I wish a doctor could have helped her end her life quickly and without fear.  When you are suffering as much as she did, the one thing you should have some control over is the way you die. The law put all of my family through appalling suffering. Please help change the law so that others do not have to suffer like Sue and my mum and dad.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>John Close (Milton Keynes)<br><br>Lesley Close explains how John had help to die in Switzerland<br>In 2001 my brother John Close, aged 53, was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND). His decline was slow but, by Christmas 2002, he needed full-time care: he could not stand or swallow, and communicated through a computer because his speech was unintelligible.<br><br>John saw a news item about Reg Crew's trip to Dignitas in January 2003 and 'said' "that's how I'd like to go when my time comes."<br>I immediately understood why John wanted an assisted suicide - it allowed him to choose a death which was guaranteed to be peaceful and dignified. Opponents of assisted dying have suggested that I should have stopped him - what would John have gained from my selfish insistence that he continue suffering until MND ended his life 'naturally'?<br><br>Knowing that John would be in control of his death was a tremendous source of comfort for me as well as for John. Indeed at a stage when MND had almost totally eroded his dignity, knowing he would have that control gave some dignity back to him. John's death was sad but my grief at losing him was tempered by the control he had over the way he died. Having said our goodbyes, I held his hand as the barbiturate overdose took effect: he fell into a deep sleep which was followed by unconsciousness and, after 20 minutes, death.<br><br>If legislation such as Lord Joffe's had existed in 2003, John might have lived for a few weeks longer: he needed some bodily strength to undertake the journey to Zurich. I wish he had been able to die the same peaceful and dignified death at home in Milton Keynes, as the sun set, and with his own GP writing the prescription. That GP, Eric Rose, spoke to the BMA a few weeks after John's death and said that knowing John had changed his opinion about assisted dying. That is John's legacy: it is proof that a personal experience, such as knowing John, can turn opposition based on theory alone into whole-hearted support.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kelly Taylor (Bristol)<br>I am a 30-year-old woman. I live in Bristol with my husband Richard and I am suffering from a life-threatening heart and lung problem called Eisenmenger's syndrome. My health has been getting steadily worse since I was seven years old. I was taken off the transplant list years ago - my body is far too weak to survive such a complex operation. I need oxygen all the time and I am severely physically limited, almost totally confined to a wheelchair. My health is getting worse and worse, and my consultant has told me I do not have long to live.<br><br>I love my husband and my family very much and I am still trying to do as much as possible - I am studying part-time at college for an English literature A level. But my health just keeps deteriorating. I have to sleep for about 18 hours a day but I have terrible nightmares as a side effect of my medication. I have bed sores and suffer from breathlessness. I am in constant pain and I feel I am denied almost every pleasure by my illness. I want my suffering to end.<br><br>The law forbids assisted dying, so in August 2005 I made the decision to starve myself to death - it was the only way to die without getting Richard into trouble with the law. I had to give this up after nineteen days because it was simply too painful. Ever since then I have been working to try to change the law on assisted dying - I strongly support any law that enables doctors to help patients to die if they request this.<br><br>I contacted the Bristol Post eight days into my starvation because I wanted to raise awareness of the kind of the terrible position the law forces people like me into. I was having to starve myself because my doctors could not help me die.<br><br>I did not want to travel to a foreign country to end my life. I want to die at home. If I went abroad to die I would do so knowing that my wonderful husband Richard, who would go with me, could face prosecution on his return to the UK, and I could not allow that to happen. I admire the people who make such a journey, but really, it should not be necessary.<br><br>I truly believe that the law on assisted dying will change but not in time for me. My personal campaign is to fight for assisted dying while I live but I may have a limited choice, and may have to ask to be sedated permanently. My doctors are not sure if they can legally do this, so I am mounting a legal case to allow a doctor to do this for me. I am hoping that once I am sedated the terms of my living will will come into effect. This states that I would not wish to receive afrtificial food or fluids, and would mean that I could die peacefully.<br><br></div>
