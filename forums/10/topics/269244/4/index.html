Get lost if you are here to create trouble and not contribute positively.  Get lost!  With your kind of attitude and character, if you so claim that you are a doctor, you are a disgrace to the medical profession.   Senior Professor and Emeritus told us that it is vital for doctors to have good character.  Mind you, he sets a good example.  He is very respectable, and as for you you are nowhere to be respected.   YOu are nothing but a troublemaker in Speakers' Corner.  Get lost!@</div>

Because our<br>health declines as we age and health spending increases accordingly, any<br>compulsory savings scheme based on the principle of self-reliance should<br>ask people to save as much as they can during their working years for<br>their health- and long-term-care costs, particularly the high costs after<br>retirement. However, Medisave caps the balance in the medical savings<br>account to a maximum amount. This amount is not sufficient<br>to protect the elderly who have serious chronic diseases and need<br>surgery. Moreover, CPF allows participants to withdraw their savings<br>savings at age Sixty-two (now sixty-five), leaving only a tiny balance in the account. These features defeat the whole purpose of compelling people to save so that they have the financial means to be responsible for their own health expenses.<br><br>Private insurance schemes tend to select healthy people to insure and<br>exclude those who need more health services. Often a nation justifies<br>using a public monopoly to provide health insurance to avoid this risk<br>selection. Public monopoly also pools the risk nationwide. The Singapore<br>government created the MediShield as a public monopoly, insuring its<br>citizens for a part of their catastrophic medical expenses. Yet MediShield<br>adopted the risk selection practices of private insurance schemes by<br>excluding as enrollees persons aged seventy and older and by not covering<br>some expensive services, such as treatments for congenital abnormalities,<br>mental illness, and HIV/AIDS (Central Provident Fund 1999).<br><br>These restrictions contradict the rationale for using a public monopoly to<br>provide catastrophic insurance and defeat the purpose of insurance.<br>These irrational practices leave those who need risk protection the most<br>without insurance coverage. Those who canÂ’t afford to pay have to forgo<br>medical care or plead for public charity.<br><br>No replies for this too.</div>

Sort of like our Human Organ Translant Act (HOTA) where everyone is assumed to be a willing organ donor unless he specifically opts out.<br><br>I donÂ’t know about you, but seems like everytime the government wants to take stuff from us, we need to opt out just so they donÂ’t take it whereas if the government is giving out money like rebates, singapore shares or whatever, we need to opt in.<br><br>Maybe its just the mentality out the government- we owe them for the awesome job they are doing.</blockquote></div>
