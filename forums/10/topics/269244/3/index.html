And do you actually realised that most Singaporeans have no choice but to die? The medisave with it's red tapes is a joke and has no practical use at all.<br><br><blockquote>SingaporeÂ’s 3Ms plan has some glaring contradictions. Because our<br>health declines as we age and health spending increases accordingly, any<br>compulsory savings scheme based on the principle of self-reliance should<br>ask people to save as much as they can during their working years for<br>their health- and long-term-care costs, particularly the high costs after<br>retirement. However, Medisave caps the balance in the medical savings<br>account to a maximum amount. This amount is not sufficient<br>to protect the elderly who have serious chronic diseases and need<br>surgery. Moreover, CPF allows participants to withdraw their savings<br>savings at age Sixty-two (now sixty-five), leaving only a tiny balance in the account. These features defeat the whole purpose of compelling people to save so that they have the financial means to be responsible for their own health expenses.<br><br>Private insurance schemes tend to select healthy people to insure and<br>exclude those who need more health services. Often a nation justifies<br>using a public monopoly to provide health insurance to avoid this risk<br>selection. Public monopoly also pools the risk nationwide. The Singapore<br>government created the MediShield as a public monopoly, insuring its<br>citizens for a part of their catastrophic medical expenses. Yet MediShield<br>adopted the risk selection practices of private insurance schemes by<br>excluding as enrollees persons aged seventy and older and by not covering<br>some expensive services, such as treatments for congenital abnormalities,<br>mental illness, and HIV/AIDS (Central Provident Fund 1999).<br><br>These restrictions contradict the rationale for using a public monopoly to<br>provide catastrophic insurance and defeat the purpose of insurance.<br>These irrational practices leave those who need risk protection the most<br>without insurance coverage. Those who canÂ’t afford to pay have to forgo<br>medical care or plead for public charity.</blockquote>All in all, unless you are rich in Singapore, be prepared to die.</div>

By the way, the increase in fares by PTC is that they need to be accountable to the shareholders.  That is what they claimed.   Was in a project on public transport, it is said that the priority of providing public transport is to serve the need of the public, making $$$ does not take priority over providing the public with the need.<br><br>Back to the topic, I am not surprise at all one day they make it a must for the govt to decide whether the terminally ill should continue to live or to go for euthanasia!

At 9pm, our family doctor had left so we went to another private clinic - 'Street 11 Clinic' at Block 139 Tampines Street 11.<br><br>After a brief consultation, she was given these medicines cough syrup (one bottle, 'Dhasedyl, 90ml'); a packet of 'Danzen' (20 tablets, 5mg) for the throat; 'Telfast D' (10 tablets) for runny nose and antibiotics 'Klacid MR' (five 500mg tablets for throat and nose).<br><br>I was astonished when I received the bill. These medicines cost me $80. I am puzzled at the high cost because I believe that my daughter's symptoms were fairly common and she was treated by a locum.<br><br>I feel the clinic had either overcharged and jacked up the price of common drugs, or did it give me unnecessarily expensive drugs for a common illness<br><br>I asked the receptionist for a breakdown of the cost of the various medicines. To my surprise, the staff informed me that the five antibiotic tablets alone cost $37.<br><br>I believe Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan had mentioned that affordable medicines be provided for patients at reasonable prices. Yet the clinic in our heartlands is charging drugs such as 'Klacid MR' at an exorbitant price. This is a worrying problem which I hope can be addressed to benefit the masses.<br><br>Gan Siok Wah (Mdm)<br>The Straits Times<br>Feb 23, 2006<br><br></div></blockquote>You probably didn't see the reply - the lady deliberately left out some important details. Lucky she never kena sue for defamation.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>Clinic did not overcharge patient </strong><br><br>THERE are two issues in the letter by Mdm Gan Siok Wah in 'High prices for common drugs in HDB heartland' (ST, Feb 21).<br><br>First, the alleged overcharging. I would like to clarify that the $80 bill includes both the consultation fee and the medication prescribed to her daughter.<br><br>Her daughter was billed $22 for consultation fee for a visit at 9.20pm, when the Singapore Medical Association's recommendation to all clinics is $25 to $55 for consultation between 9pm and midnight.<br><br>With regard to the five tablets of Klacid MR 500mg costing $37, the price charged at our clinic adheres closely to the recommended retail price set by Abbott Laboratories (S) Pte Ltd. Mdm Gan is at liberty to confirm the price with them at customer.services.sg@ abbot.com.<br><br>Second, unnecessarily expensive medication.<br><br>As Mdm Gan has chosen to breach doctor-patient confidentiality by going public with her daughter's medical condition, I would like to highlight the fact that <strong>she omits to mention that her daughter had the symptoms for five days prior to the consultation in my clinic and that she had been treated elsewhere for similar complaints without improvement</strong>.<br><br>It is medically prudent to treat a patient with second line medication if the patient shows no improvement after treatment with first line medication. This was why her daughter was prescribed such medication by our clinic.<br><br>I stand by the fact that our clinic did not overcharge Mdm Gan. Nor was her daughter given any unnecessary treatment.<br><br>I would be most grateful if you can publish this to clarify the misconception that Mdm Gan's letter has created in the minds of the public.<br><br>Dr Low Jin Kheng<br>Clinic Manager<br>Street 11 Clinic<br>Feb 24, 2006</blockquote></div>

The consultation with the doctor was over in about five minutes as he had to rush off elsewhere.<br><br>The doctor prescribed Elidel (pimecrolimus) cream 1% for the rash and told me to apply it twice daily on the affected area. Although this cream cost me $50, I did not mind as I thought it should be good for my son. But this was not the case.<br><br>Imagine my shock when I found out through the Internet that Elidel is not approved for use for children below two-years-old.<br><br>The possibility of carcinogenicity of Elidel aside, our Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and the US Food and Drug Administration concur in the recommendation against the use of Elidel for children younger than two-years-old.<br><br>In addition, both authorities recommend that Elidel should be used only if other creams have not worked.<br><br><strong>It was my baby's first visit to the doctor</strong> concerning the rash on his face. Yet he was given a cream that is not meant for babies of his age. The doctor also did not caution me on the use of the cream.<br><br>I e-mailed Thomson Medical Centre my complaint on Feb 11. To date, it has not responded.<br><br>I am disturbed by the lack of consideration in prescribing Elidel for babies against the HSA's recommendations and the medical centre's slow response in this matter.<br><br>Are there any measures to ensure that such strong medication is not prescribed carelessly? I hope the relevant authorities can look into this matter to protect other babies and parents who may be none the wiser about this.<br><br>Ruth Tan Yueh Herng (Ms)<br>The Straits Times<br>Feb 23, 2006<br>[/b]</blockquote>Last reply.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><br>Safe to use rash cream on young infants<br><br>I APPRECIATE Ms Ruth Tan Yueh Herng's vexation over her child's skin condition in 'Doctor prescribed unsuitable rash cream' (ST, Feb 23). But her letter contains a few misperceptions.<br><br><strong>First, this was not the first time Ms Tan had visited our clinic for her child's eczema. It was their third visit for the same condition</strong>.<br><br>A steroid cream prescribed in a previous visit was obviously ineffective. In fact, Ms Tan had mentioned that the rash was not responding to treatment elsewhere.<br><br>As the eczema was severe, a second line medication like Elidel 1% or Protopic 0.03% is in order. This was a considered prescription and not a careless one as mentioned.<br><br>The question is: Is Elidel safe in the dosage and duration prescribed? Elidel is an approved drug in Singapore, USA and other countries.<br><br>When the US Food and Drugs Administration approved the drug in 2001, the studies were based on children two years and older. Since then, there have been published studies showing that Elidel is safe for use as a topical skin medication in children three months and older.<br><br>As a result, the following countries have approved Elidel for use in children three months and older: Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, and Thailand.<br><br>In Singapore, a multicentre trial involving the National Skin Centre, Changi General Hospital and National University Hospital has been initiated to establish the efficacy and safety of Elidel 1% cream in infants.<br><br>Perhaps this is why the Health Sciences Authority has not yet updated its recommendation for the use of Elidel 1% in young infants.<br><br>Both steroids and Elidel work by suppressing the immune system. Theoretically, both could cause cancer.<br><br>Indeed, oral and injectable steroids and Elidel have been implicated in studies to be carcinogens.<br><br>However, the topical forms of these drugs have been found to be very safe in large-scale use.<br><br>Topical steroids have been in use for decades while there are over seven million users of Elidel 1%. Studies have shown that such creams have minimal penetration beyond the skin and are not well absorbed into the body.<br><br>I understand Ms Tan's frustration when her email went unanswered. But she had chosen to email Thomson Medical Centre instead of our clinic.<br><br>We could have clarified the matter and saved her unnecessary worry. We would also have told her that <strong>I was called to attend to an emergency Caesarean section</strong> immediately after the consultation.<br><br>It was unfortunate but my patients who have further queries will wait for my return, which takes up to 15 minutes.
