            <div class='col-md body'>Ken Jones (Aberystwyth)<br>I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2001 and received radiotherapy treatment. Since then the cancer has returned more aggresively, and has been treated with cryosurgery, which may keep it at bay for another couple of years. Dying of prostate cancer has been described by a surgeon as one of the more sensationally awful ways to go.<br><br>Palliative care provision, even at best, will be far from a hundred percent effective in my case. And even to the extent it may be, I don't look forward to dragging out my end in a doped, constipated, morphine-induced haze.  I have several friends who are hospice nurses or working in other capacities with people dying of cancer. All recall many harrowing incidents of patients pleading for a merciful release, and how their own attitudes to assisted dying have been changed by such experiences.<br><br>I have made my own arrangements for a graceful exit (and am pestered by many friends who want to know  how to do likewise!). But the agonising dilemma is that when I'm still fit enough to leave of my own volition my disease will not have progressed so far that I yet feel ready to go. And when it has so progressed, I may not by then have the strength and resolution to take my life. I know of several others who anticipate being faced with this cruel quandry, and for whom the mere fact of voluntary assisted suicide legislation would bring a huge sense of relief and comfort, even though in the end they might never actually avail themselves of the new freedom.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lisa Cook - Huddersfield<br>My story<br>I am a 38-year old mother who in 1997 tested positive for the Huntington's Disease faulty gene.<br><br>Although I am symptom free at present, it is clinically certain that I will develop this incurable illness. I have grown up in a family where I have seen sufferers of HD endure a long and slow decline. They have gone from being busy, lively, active, entertaining, well loved people to twitching, bedridden, doubly incontinent, lonely, skeletal, incoherent shadows of their former selves. I live on a day-to-day basis with the knowledge that that is my future.<br><br>There is little I can do about my genes but I want to do something about the amount of suffering that my family and I will have to endure as a result of HD. I firmly believe that the degradation and indignity this condition imposes is a greater concern than death itself.<br><br>The law needs to be changed to allow me and the many others like me the chance to choose a dignified death.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Peter Chesterfield (Brighton)<br><br>Peter's story<br>"I am Peter Chesterfield. I am 50 years old and for many years I had a successful acting career that was cut short by ME.<br><br>In March 2004 I experienced pains and in May I was diagnosed with bladder cancer. I had two operations, the second involving major surgery. But on Monday 8 November my doctor gave me no more than three months to live. I am in great pain, and this increases daily, despite the fact I take significant amounts of pain relief. I do not want to die in pain, but despite my condition, the law prevents a doctor from helping me to die at my request.<br><br>When I first raised the subject of suicide with my medical team they referred me to a counsellor, who concluded that I was as sane as him, and sympathised with my wish to have a gentle death.<br><br>My current regime leaves me bed-bound for the majority of the time. The bladder cancer has now spread to my lungs and is blocking my kidneys. My cancer is terminal. My pain is great and constant. I am afraid of dying in pain, at an unknown time, and probably alone. Why does the British law impose such tragedy and injustice on human beings?<br><br>My doctors and surgeons cannot help me to die at my request. They could be charged with murder, even if it were clear they were acting at my request. Only with a law that allows a patient to have a choice and to express this within a properly safeguarded system will we allow true human justice and dignity. A terminally ill, mentally competent patient like me should not be forced to suffer. This is as morally unacceptable as murder."<br><br>Peter Chesterfield died of cancer on the 11th February 2005<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Peter Jones (Warrington)<br><br>My name is Peter Jones, I am 53 years old and just over two years ago, after a year of tests, I was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND).<br><br>My life has been spent out side working with my hands as a car mechanic then a milkman, finally moving indoors as a facilities manager.<br><br>Throughout my personal and working life I have evaluated my choices and then made the decisions I knew were right for me. The final decision I want to be able to make for myself is how and when I die but I am denied this by the current and outdated laws in this country.<br><br>Having choice is a critical factor in allowing me to live as long as possible and remain emotionally strong for my self and my family. In order to have the choice I am joining Dignitas. But this means I would have to go outside the UK to Switzerland to die in a strange land, in a strange flat, with the threat of prosecutions hanging over any family member who accompanies me. I would rather die at home in comfortable and familiar surroundings with family around me.<br><br>MND is taking me away from my family a little bit more each day, as the things I could do yesterday I can not do today. I can not change my MND - it will not go away, but the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill would at least help me to stay with my family as long as possible, and allow a man with a sound mind make a sound decision about how and when he finally leaves his family for good<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reg Crew (Liverpool)<br>by Win Crew<br>My husband Reg suffered from Motor Neurone Disease. In January 2003, Reg, myself and my daughter Jan were forced to travel to Switzerland to seek an assisted death, because the alternative - to remain, and suffer, and die, in this country, would have been too horrendous.<br><br>My husband suffered terribly as a result of MND. Only weeks after the diagnosis he was unable to move his arms, depending on family and carers to feed him, wash him, dress him. This progressed to his legs, and in no time at all, he could neither feed himself nor go to the toilet, and he had to sleep and live in a chair. He was barely able to support his own head, and was told by doctors that he would soon have to be fed from a peg. He was given an informative video to watch, which outlined this process.<br><br>As each day passed, Reg found his life increasingly unbearable - a living hell. Palliative care did little for him. His dignity was stripped away, each time the disease closed down another part of his body, and so was his independence. Reg loved life, but not in the incapacitated shell of his former self. Motor Neurone Disease robbed him of his autonomy.<br><br>Although I am a Roman Catholic, like many others in my position, when Reg said he wanted medical assistance to die, to avoid a long and painful death, I felt this was the right thing to do. I agreed with him that the disease should not rob him of the ability to choose the manner of his inevitable death.<br><br>Because assisted dying is illegal in the UK we were forced to travel to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland for Reg to get his last wish. The journey to Switzerland was terrible for us all and it is unkind to force people in RegÂ’s position to travel overseas to get their last wish.<br><br>Reg always said he loved his country and wanted to die at home.  He felt it was grossly unfair that he had been called up to do National Service and was prepared to die for his country but then wasnÂ’t allowed to choose the manner of his death.<br><br>For several months after my return, I had the threat of legal action hanging over me but what alternative was there?<br><br>Hundreds upon hundreds of people from all over the UK have written to me with letters of support to say how unjust the current law is and that it must be changed to give people like Reg the option of requesting a dignified death.<br><br>Please help Dignity in Dying change in the law so that other people do not have to make that same desperate journey to Switzerland.<br><br></div>

Many years before Alison was taken ill we had made a pact that if either one of us became terminally ill then we would want help to die. We both believed that there had to be quality of life.<br><br>Alison developed breast cancer and despite having a mastectomy and chemo therapy the cancer returned. Despite all the efforts of the doctors and nurses the cancer continued to spread. When it affected the spine her pain became so severe and no amount of pain control could alleviate her discomfort - at this time she was taking about 100 units of morphine a day.<br><br>She was fearful of being taken into hospital or a hospice and so my mother and I nursed her at home. It was a very happy time that we had together and it gave us time to say goodbye to each other properly. When Alison decided the time had come I sat with her whilst she took an overdose.<br><br>When I reported the manner of her death to the authorities I was arrested and locked up in a police cell (within 4 hours of Alison's death). My offence was that I had not stopped her from committing suicide. I was arrested, because the police had no other option but they were most apologetic because they could imagine themselves being in a similar situation. Fortunately I was only in custody for some 20 hours although I did remain on police bail for a further 8 months.<br><br>I did not care about the fact that I was facing a custodial sentence in prison of up to 14 years when all that mattered was that Alison's wishes had been granted.<br><br>Although I miss her terribly I have no regrets about what happened that day.<br><br></div>

I was trying to carry out his wishes based on his prior strongly stated requests, also expressed in his Living Will. This was his choice and I helped only out of love and respect for him.<br><br>It is too late for Tim now - he suffered more than enough before he eventually died. But I beg the politicians and doctors to get to grips with the problem and discuss it fully and openly. And for ordinary people to speak out to change the law.<br><br>It is inhumane that the law prohibits people seeking help to die from a doctor, within proper safeguards. But for as long as these situations continue to happen, and intelligent people are not allowed personal choice over dying with dignity when there is no longer any hope of improvement or recovery, I do not believe this country can call itself civilised.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Waltraud Coles (Durham)<br>Waltraud's story - dying in slow motion<br>My wife, Waltraud, died in February 2005 aged 54. The cause of her death was an infection which her body, weakened by the combination of 19 days starvation and very advanced secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, could not resist. Her actual death, in her sleep and at home, represented the kind of end we both believed anyone in her situation should have the right to choose. We had few grounds for hope.<br><br>Waltraud was a very courageous, well-informed, completely law-abiding person. She knew alsothat her illness would, step by step, destroy but not end the quality of her relatively young life.  Her decision to starve was both considered and brave. She knew it was the only lawful option.<br><br>Whilst accepting her long illness and certainty of a premature death as part of life's lottery, Waltraud was furious that something entirely avoidable, namely the current law, forced her to endure the ordeal of what she called "dying in slow motion".<br><br>She was not suicidal, but saw a fatal overdose as an option to be seized whilst she could do this unassisted. She planned it but then lost the use of her hands by the time she was ready. It represented a darkest hour for us both.<br><br>Waltraud thought of every legitimate way of dying, and ensured her Living Will was effective in practice. We were indebted to Dignity in Dying (VES as it was) for intervening to make a care agency respect her living Will to prevent interference from others if she were choking. Waltraud found it empowering to harness her articulacy about her personal suffering and her outrage at her lack of choices about dying to successive VES campaigns.<br><br>Twelve days before she died Waltraud asked me to record what were literally her last words to anyone.<br><br>"Society is making me die in this abysmally cruel way. Society is anybody who cannot be bothered to lift one single finger to change this (current) inhumane law, and thus give completely helpless people like myself, in the very advanced phase of a degenerative illness, no other legal option (than starvation) when we want to end the unbearable daily ordeal which is all that is left of our 'life'."<br><br>Oliver Coles<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With the high costs of medical treatment in Singapore and the joke of a medical coverage, one wonder is it a choice of choosing to die, or not having the financial means to have treatment?<br><br>The biggest joke is that despite Singapore's aim to be a medical hub, it is actually behind countries like Thailand. Any visitors to Bangkok's private hospitals HAVE to admit they administer better treatments, better service, a better environment at less than half the price.<br><br><blockquote>No MRI on weekends, blame it on 'bad luck'<br><br>MY FATHER, Ang Teong Hui, was admitted recently to Changi General Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a mild stroke. However, his condition deteriorated and he fell into a coma on the same day.<br><br>The doctors did various tests on him and took scans of his brain where they eventually found the cause of his deteriorating condition.<br><br>However, the last scan - an MRI - was done a day after he was admitted, after the doctors felt that he might not pull through and needed the scan urgently.<br><br>When asked why the scan was not done earlier, the doctor replied that it was bad luck on my father's part as MRI scans were not done on weekends.<br><br>After my father was transferred out of the intensive-care unit to a normal ward, we asked one of the nurses why such a piece of state-of-the-art equipment was not used on weekends.<br><br>The nurse replied that it was unfair to recall the doctors just to do the scan because weekends were supposed to be their rest days.<br><br>Well, if it was unfair for the doctors to work on weekends, was it fair for my father to be denied treatment on a weekend, especially when the situation was so crucial?<br><br>My father died on Oct 8, aged 53, and there is nothing my family and I can do to bring him back. But I would like to make it known to Changi General Hospital and the relevant government departments that attitudes such as those mentioned above were incorrect.<br><br>Ang Yu Ying (Ms)<br>The Straits Times<br>Oct 29, 2004 </blockquote></div>

The consultation with the doctor was over in about five minutes as he had to rush off elsewhere.<br><br>The doctor prescribed Elidel (pimecrolimus) cream 1% for the rash and told me to apply it twice daily on the affected area. Although this cream cost me $50, I did not mind as I thought it should be good for my son. But this was not the case.<br><br>Imagine my shock when I found out through the Internet that Elidel is not approved for use for children below two-years-old.<br><br>The possibility of carcinogenicity of Elidel aside, our Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and the US Food and Drug Administration concur in the recommendation against the use of Elidel for children younger than two-years-old.<br><br>In addition, both authorities recommend that Elidel should be used only if other creams have not worked.<br><br>It was my baby's first visit to the doctor concerning the rash on his face. Yet he was given a cream that is not meant for babies of his age. The doctor also did not caution me on the use of the cream.<br><br>I e-mailed Thomson Medical Centre my complaint on Feb 11. To date, it has not responded.<br><br>I am disturbed by the lack of consideration in prescribing Elidel for babies against the HSA's recommendations and the medical centre's slow response in this matter.<br><br>Are there any measures to ensure that such strong medication is not prescribed carelessly? I hope the relevant authorities can look into this matter to protect other babies and parents who may be none the wiser about this.<br><br>Ruth Tan Yueh Herng (Ms)<br>The Straits Times<br>Feb 23, 2006 </blockquote></div>
