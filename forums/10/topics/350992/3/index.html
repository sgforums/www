              <p>I can understand how you, a civilian, may have doubts about the capability of your brave fellow citizens whom may not have been seen in the best of light or reviled against handsome blue eyed men of the western world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I for one will head for the frontlines, regardless if the elites or any other coward flee. I will say my last farewell to my love ones, and head for the front. But i know i wont be the only one there. There will be 99 other men in my reservist company who will do the same and be there too. It is a mystical bond that most  young NSmen are not aware of till they matured and go into their respective reservist unit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With only 100 men or even 100,000 men, we will not perform foolish and stupid stunts such as charging at the enemy, but use delaying tactics to hinder their advance, which will be costly in blood on both sides.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We delay them without crazy charges NOT because we are afraid to die, but because we know that each minute we delay them and live longer for another minute, it will mean one more civilian can be evacuated to safety under protected shelters or get onboard Red Cross evacuation ships.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is people like you that we will be giving our precious life for. And it will be your responsibility to ensure you and our next generation reclaim back our land paid with our blood. The land that had given us all, chinese, Indian, Malay and others freedom. Freedom from starvation, freedom from illiteracy. Freedom from diseases, and freedom from discrimination. This is above politics. Human lives will always come first.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is our one and only home in a turbulent world. It is people like you that we singaporean men defend and sacrifice our time to be prepared and protect our nation, made up of you, your family, friends and mine in this piece of rock named Singapore we all call home.. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one wants to die. But if it must come to pass, rest assured you will have 100 men to defend Singapore for sure. And I am sure there will be more than 100 men, based on what I know of my fellow brave citizens in various units i had the honour and priviledge to train and had military excercises with.</p>

              <p>If war is imminent, the government would declare martial law and close our border to prevent military manpower from fleeing. So like it or not NSmen would have to fight,</p>
              <p>If martial law is declared, military police would comb the island for deserters and arrest them. Probably those arrested would be given a choice to rejoin their units or face being charged for desertion and thrown into DB. The maximum penalty in most militaries for desertion during wartime is death. (For the more serious cases)</p>
              <p>I believed however unwilling one is, if you see your loved ones or your home being bombed out, without hesitation you would report back to your unit. Not for the love of your country, but rather to protect the things and the ones you love. That I guess would be where NSmen would draw their fighting strength from, admit it. </p>
              <p>I served in an air defence unit, and during wartime when the air raid sirens wail, civillians would be running into bomb shelters, I have no choice but to be out there with my fellow brothers awaiting the unknown. And I know my brothers will be there, each and everyone of them.</p>
              <p>Honestly like what xtreyier said, every minute we delay the advance of our enemies, we give our civillians a chance at survival. The malay and muslim population would probably have a higher chance of survival due to the fact that they share the same religion as our surrounding neighbours. But what about the chinese? I believe what happen in indonesia during the riots of 97 is still fresh in everyone heads. </p>
              <p>When basic social order breaks down, you can expect humans to show their true colours in order to survive. We can see this through history and the ongoing wars in Africa. Geneva conventions or not, atrocities are bound to happen when conflict breaks out.</p>
              <p>China and Taiwan share the same ethinic Chinese population, at the worst, Taiwan would probably just let China walk over it, it will only be a change of government for them. But can we say the same for Singapore and our neighbours?</p>

              <p>If war is imminent, the government would declare martial law and
              close our border to prevent military manpower from fleeing. So like
              it or not NSmen would have to fight,</p>
              <p>If martial law is declared, military police would comb the
              island for deserters and arrest them. Probably those arrested would
              be given a choice to rejoin their units or face being charged for
              desertion and thrown into DB. The maximum penalty in most
              militaries for desertion during wartime is death. (For the more
              serious cases)</p>
              <p>I believed however unwilling one is, if you see your loved ones
              or your home being bombed out, without hesitation you would report
              back to your unit. Not for the love of your country, but rather to
              protect the things and the ones you love. That I guess would be
              where NSmen would draw their fighting strength from, admit
              it. </p>
              <p>I served in an air defence unit, and during wartime when the air
              raid sirens wail, civillians would be running into bomb shelters, I
              have no choice but to be out there with my fellow brothers awaiting
              the unknown. And I know my brothers will be there, each and
              everyone of them.</p>
              <p>Honestly like what xtreyier said, every minute we delay the
              advance of our enemies, we give our civillians a chance at
              survival. The malay and muslim population would probably have a
              higher chance of survival due to the fact that they share the same
              religion as our surrounding neighbours. But what about the chinese?
              I believe what happen in indonesia during the riots of 97 is still
              fresh in everyone heads. </p>
              <p>When basic social order breaks down, you can expect humans to
              show their true colours in order to survive. We can see this
              through history and the ongoing wars in Africa. Geneva conventions
              or not, atrocities are bound to happen when conflict breaks
              out.</p>
              <p>China and Taiwan share the same ethinic Chinese population, at
              the worst, Taiwan would probably just let China walk over it, it
              will only be a change of government for them. But can we say the
              same for Singapore and our neighbours?</p>
