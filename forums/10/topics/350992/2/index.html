                                <p>But then again,i feel strange that some PAP ministers n leaders
                                would actually have the idea that once opposition parties win the
                                GE,it will be a disasterous for them n the whole Singapore.</p>
                                <p>Actually,from what i see,it is actually good if other party win
                                GE coz all the critics from the public will diversify to the
                                opposition as well.Not like now,all the critics mostly concentrate
                                on the PAP.Becoz since the PAP control everything in Singapore,once
                                got anything goes wrong,we dont blame PAP,we blame who?</p>
                                <p>And also,it will lighten the burden on PAP also,so it is a
                                Win-Win situation.Why some ppl in the PAP party are so
                                narrow-minded.</p>

              If opposition parties do win GE, of course it will be disastrous for them.  With opposition parties forming a larger part of the parliament, you think they still be able to keep their million dollar salary?
              
              Anyway, when things do go wrong, they would just say it's an honest mistake, let's move on

              <p>Taiwan rightfully should end conscription. Taiwan belongs to China. No reason for a standing army of a quarter million for a province. She can get all the troops she wants from China, and save the money for the people of the taiwan province.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hongkong belong to China. Which is why Hong Kong citizens dont need conscription, and saved tons of money. China provides the troops.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore dont belong to China. She dont belong to anyone but us! When shit happens, who will defend us? Next, we live amongst not exactly friendly neighbours whom love to rattlesabers when their political leadership is having problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our military might may be small, and there is no denying that we will not last forever in a major conflict, but each and everyone of us males know we are there to buy time - time to evacuate our loved ones to safety, time to appeal to UN, and meanwhile make the enemies pay a high price and delay them as long as possible with our own blood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Each generation of Singaporean males had known that fact, held that torch with courage, and pass it to the next generation with honour when the time was due. As such, anyone who dares make a move against our country knows well that price they will have to pay, and so far, those previous generation had done well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That torch is now held with the new generation. Some may be pampared and believe a standing proffesional army will do the job. But the cost for a proffessional army is high and unfavorable compared to lower cost if everyone pitches in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some would prefer to run and flee when conflicts arise. Such options are limited to the rich few. Many more will not have that ability. It will be a sad day for a nation when the poor, children and old folks grab sticks to challenge enemies' tanks while its youth goes into hiding elsewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some claims that NS is unnecessary because when the times to fight arrives, they will fight. But that is a flawed theory. If they know nothing about organisation, logistics and weaponery, how to fight? More likely be canon fodder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or just stand by and helplessly watch as frenzied mob loot, rob, molest and rape their loved ones as actually happened in Indonesia.</p>

              <p>No need for extended rhetorics: Here's a simple answer.</p>
              <p>Singapore do not have a large population, Taiwan does. Stopping conscription would not dent their overall force, if Singapore ditch conscription, we would not even have enough men to protect even one GRC.</p>
              <p>What we need is better incentives for serving NS and reservist liabilitY(100 bucks extra for serving NS, WTF?), Make a new law to prevent companies from firing NSmen who have to do ICT, Make Singapore worth dying for by making these so called "foreign talents" do military or paramilitary training for a least a year before getting citizenship or PR. Oh, and make the entrance tests harder. etc, etc. If i am suppose to feckin die for my country, at least give me some motivation for it. Call me mercenary, but my life is not cheap, in fact none of our lives are. if the PAP elites want us to go to combat, they better be totting an assault rifle with me or else my barrel will be pointing somewhere else....and it wont be at the so-called "enemy".</p>

              <p>Depending on perspective i suppose, i don't really think what they do is anything great and is more a "feel good" measure than of any practical purposes.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Socially speaking, there is no productive uses for a military. Reducing the unemployment rate via hiring through the military is no different from putting them on full welfare because you have to feed/cloth/house them.  </p>
              <p>Unless you intend to use them to rob resources from others a military contributes nothing to society because essentially they produce nothing nor do they provide any helpful services.</p>
              <p>Giving out the Consumer Vouchers is no different from the government using our money to spend on useless projects or gambling on stocks.  It's STILL our money, just because it came from the government doesn't make it any different from them taking it straight from our wallets.</p>
              <p>Undoubtedly, there are things we can learn from Taiwan. But not for the reasons you've brought up. Get a few Taiwanese in here and i bet they'd bitch just as much as us about their own government.</p>

              <p><br>1. Taiwan depend very much on electronics manufacturing sectors, now it is not doing well, they are starting to create jobs by introducing army professionism instead of getting FDI. In the end, you will find army doing production work for the govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. Unlike singapore who emphasis on education, train and retrain, they seek other way out to get people employed, in the army, after few years, you lack the skill and experience of the outside world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. We do offer back to school vouchers, MRt voucher, govt rebates, NTUC discount voucher, transport voucher etc etc, all these targeting on the poorer peoples thru CDC, CC and other religion insitution like Sinda, Muis, Chinese chamber etc etc, unlike taiwan who give equally to all, so the rich get richer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing about taiwan to learn about is their pretty gals, notorious underworld gangsters, mafias, and of course, taiwan porridge and sausages. Other than that, try out their bing lang mei mei or for me, look out for their handsome hunks.</p>
