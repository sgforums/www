            <div class='col-md body'>Im not sure what your premise exactly is. This topic title assumes that there's no equality/ equity. But I think the issue is more of stereotyping, whether it is based on gender, race, age, or even looks. Everybody of us, including you and me, is subject to this stereotyping by other people, and conversely we also stereotype on others around us. It is not so much of inequality or inequity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not just sexes. Everyone has their own strength and weaknesses. Even amoungst men...some are very adapt at survival. Others are just whiners and always bitching about how little money they got...how much taxes they pay...COE...high cost of fuel...blah blah blah...<br><br>Some men are just cool level headed people who just make it in life.<br><br>Who said this world was fair?</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The issue is not sexual equality but one of RELATIVE equality.<br><br>For the calculative breed, there will never be a balance that qualifies as such. Stinging issues such as National Service, labourous industries including construction and shipping etc will always remain a firm barrier to 'total equality'.<br><br>But with a broader spectrum of education, a greater awareness of the opposite sex and a reversal of the stereotype mentality that has long branded females as 2nd class to men, attitudes may change over time and a deeper respect may develop between the two sexes.<br><br>Scandinavian countries such as Sweden have been very successful in this aspect and their population has been extremely receptive to the idea of women being granted bigger and more prominent roles in various industries including the civil service. This is to such an extent that it is required by LAW that 1/3 of Swede Parliament comprise female MPs.<br><br>No female visitor feels intimidated nor discriminated in Sweden as a result.<br><br>For Singapore to reach this goal requires an open mindset, one that we are still decades away.<br><br></div>

A girl's brain is formed differently from a guy's brain. So are our genetics.<br><br>Physically, girls will be able to do things as well as guys do, as seen in the corporate world. However, there are still some things they can't do which the guys can do, like 3-D imaging. Girls' brains aren't as well formed to see such things, but a guy's brain is made to be so.<br><br>And we can talk better with people of the same gender. Most of those top position holders are males, so it makes sense to send males to close deals.</div>
