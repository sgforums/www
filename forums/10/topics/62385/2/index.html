In psych, it's different because the emphasis is on measurement of dimensions that have a discrete definition, and it pretty much works on the basic tenet of Chaos Theory: if you can account for all of the applicable elements, you can predict anything.<br><br>This debate's been an absolute gas!

(which is probably why some will accuse grads of being intellectually pretentious and dressy in their speech... the original premises which this argument was based on...)<br><br>but then again, different pple take away different things from a uni education... some see it as a means to an end, some see it as an end in itself, some just don't see what the point is even though they're in it...<br><br>one thing that uni has done for me, is that it has helped me think and decide for myself. hasn't really made me a lotta money, but that was never the point for me in the first place... its really an issue of how u wanna live, not how much u wanna study.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CX, I think we are agreed that the main aim of a university education is to broaden one's mind.  However, on Atobe's point, wouldn't you agree that the money-making aspect of having a degree is a welcome fringe benefit?  After all, money can be used wisely to improve quality of life.<br><br>In my case, as I posted on the salary thread, I have just left a job in Melbourne to return to Singapore for a year.  In that job, the actual time spent working was about four hours a day typically, the rest of which was spent mucking about on the Internet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Seriously, pulling in 5 grand a month on a strict 37.5-hour week allowed me to easily pursue other interests.  Most of my free time was spent giving my former classmates swift kicks up the arse to finish their theses, during which I had a lot of fun learning about their thesis content.  I also used my recruitment experience to help other friends find jobs.  That still left me with enough free time to learn latin dancing, work on my tan and explore restaurants.<br><br>Over and above all that, the qualification has given me the credence to state my terms at work, in that I have the luxury of choosing the work that I want to do.  I had a lot of fun in my last role in market research, although it was admittedly thin on statistical analysis, which I do enjoy (yes, I'm a nerd).  Before that job, I spent a fun six months researching and developing policy on the implementation of wireless local area networks at my old university.  My point is that with my university qualifications, I could afford to look for jobs that actually interested me.<br><br>On a separate point, the outsider may, I suppose, be forgiven for thinking that the language used by degree holders is a wank.  However, I think you would agree that it in fact serves a purpose - it allows us to state what we mean most clearly and precisely, rather than being limited by more colloquial vocabulary.  The vernacular, after all, can often be somewhat ambiguous.</div>

Do you learn to live through adversities (by the way, I believe it is grammatically correct to say "adversity" ) rather than to complain, or should a person complain and whine?  In the former case, if the person is to learn to live through adversity, then the opinion needs to be substantiated to be applied to the situation.  I'm not the one asking for a constructive view here- you're the one who brought up "learning to live through adversities (sic)", leaving yourself in a position to be hoisted up on your own petard.<br><br>Ah, now we get to the question of exactly what is polemic.  By definition, a polemic is "A controversial argument, especially one refuting or attacking a specific opinion or doctrine".<br><br>If anything, your responses to Atobe's and my posts have by definition been polemical, because you have been challenging our assertions.  I have absolutely no problem with that, but that being the case, it just doesn't sit right for you to say "no point indulging in polemics" - you are simply contradicting yourself.<br><br>As for:<br><blockquote>that is just downright paternalistic and elitist PAP crap. if society goes that way, u'll just end up advocating forced abortion of deformed foetuses, incarceration of the mentally disabled and a disgusting eugenicist regime.</blockquote>it is most certainly polemic, not fact.  You are attempting to apply early 20th century Germany and America to Singapore in 2003.  Is there enough in common between the situations to justify this application?  If so, please substantiate it, because from this point, it looks like you are trying to pull a fast one on the unwary.  Of all people, as a historian, you ought to know that comparing events and situations from two different eras and cultures is hogwash if there are inadequate grounds for equating the two.<br><br>Also, I didn't call you post-modernist - you did:<br><blockquote>or maybe that makes me an extreme post-modernist cos i believe that no one position is absolutely correct.</blockquote>I honestly cannot conceive your line of argument as being a grey path - yes, you do offer the different black and white views, but it somewhat lacks the integration of the black and the white into grey.</div>

That's the kind of thing that gets you a 25% score in a uni assignment: 50% for only using half your word space effectively, with half taken off for you telling yourself that you are wrong through unintegrated contradictory points.<br><br>Bottom line is that the way your points contradict each other, you don't know if you're Arthur or Martha, and you're just drifting along without an overall standpoint.  When someone asks you to clarify what you are saying, you choose to throw your toys out of the pram and say that other people have closed minds, rather than admitting that you have no point.  However, if that makes you sleep better at night, knock yourself out.<br><br>You didn't make it past undergrad, did you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aw, CX, I didn't trip on your itty-bitty little ego, did I?  Don't go letting that chip on your shoulder show too much.<br><br>Besides, you're the one going on about marching to your own beat, and damn what anyone else thinks, so why are you getting your buns in a knot now?  Maybe it's time to practice what you preach.<br><br>Ambiguities and complexities I am trained to deal with.  Your incoherence and inconsistency, however, are contrary to the expressive skills that a university education should have imparted to you.  That is exactly why I asked if you had gotten past undergrad - your inability to build a proper structure indicates that you have not.  If brushing your inadequacies off as a matter of semantics floats your boat, go fot it.<br><br>Besides, what's the point of me agreeing or disagreeing with you when you're already doing a thorough job all by yourself?<br><br>Yes, yes, we already know that you are trying to share your thoughts.  Therein lies the problem - like I keep asking, could you clarify your thoughts instead of breaking out in a rash whenever someone asks for further expansion?  I'm a psychologist, not a mind reader.<br><br>I simply asked for clarification of your standpoint 6 days ago.  What any normal person would do when asked for clarification is - guess what? - clarify.  Instead, you choose to go off on a paranoid tangent thinking that someone is questioning your assertions and going off into tripe about close-mindedness and other hogwash.  I do highly recommend growing up - it will do you a world of good.</div>

I have ask a lot of people and they said that if they only have Poly Dip. , its hard to find a job.. and very "no face" but if u have University Deg. , you can find job easily and also when people ask about your level of education u can proudly say u are university graduate. So far i have seen other exception whereby its the poly student who is more sucessful then the University students. </div></blockquote>Well, from what I see, there are 2 type of people who goes to university for its importance.<br><br>First type goes for the education and their future. With a degree or post-grad degree, they see as their future lies there.<br>Second type goes to the university not for education but for sex. These type actually goes there for the pretty meimei there and chase every pretty skirts there.<br><br>That is how I see the importance of going to the university <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>honestly it makes sense to work get a sense of what you really enjoy before studying a degree. Otherwise, you just end up with a useless piece of paper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To an extent, I'd agree with you, Azrael.  However, another aspect to consider is the discovery of an interest in a subject along the way.  In my case, I started university with an interest in media and ended up switching over to psychology, which I took as an elective, by the end of my first year.  Conversely, I have known a number of people who, by following their interests, finished degrees in law and medicine, but ultimately did not graduate, or switched to other fields of work after graduating.  Perhaps examining the drives behind one's interests has some importance here, since the drives are less subject to change.  At one point, a few of us were planning to do a study on what made medical students choose their course, since anecdotal evidence indicated that many did it for status or family tradition  - we were going to call the report "The Hypocritical Oath".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
