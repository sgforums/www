Just do what you desire to do most as a career and take the path that's most suitable for yourself. With enough determination, perseverance and passion, one will succeed no matter whether he or she is holding a diploma or a degree. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>And someone holding a diploma only can go and study for a degree mah.

            <div class='col-md body'>a good degree may open more doors in the first 2 years after graduation IF the economy is doing ok...<br><br>bad economy means that u won't get a job easily anyway... whether u got a dip. or a deg.<br><br>and they're two different things lah... there are job openings for deg-holders AND dip-holders... and deg. jobs don't always pay better... it really depends on where your interests lies. no point feeling "tui" only after u get your qualifications.<br><br>so the answer: just follow your interests. if a uni offers a course u are interested in, go for that. if a poly offers something u're more interested in, go for that.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm - good question.<br><br>Can't say I've ever had difficulty finding a job - in the last 10 years (apart from when university semesters were on) I have been unemployed for a maximum of four days at a stretch, and I have only been turned down for a job twice.  The question is, did the degrees make it easier?<br><br>Certainly, at the end of my undergraduate years, my degree paved the way for me to breeze through the selection process.  However, in 2000 I beat a number of more qualified applicants for a job as well, and the reverse happened in 2002.  In both cases, the decisions were close, and personal qualities ultimately constituted the deciding factor.<br><br>Certain professions require educational prerequisites, of course.  Not any Tom, Dick or Harry may walk in and become a lawyer or doctor, although the rules seem to vary across countries in psychology, which is my profession.  In countries like Australia, Britain and the US, you need professional registration to practice; this does not apply in Singapore.<br><br>The question is, what do you want to go to university for?  If it is for future employment prospects, a degree is good for helping you get shortlisted, but ultimately your personal qualities will be the clincher.<br><br>Personally, I did my doctorate for the fun of it.  Yes, it does tend to slingshot me past some other job applicants who hold Honours or Masters degrees, but I normally let my curriculum vitae do the loudest talking.<br><br>Call it indulgence if you will, but I make a point of doing something only because I want to, and never because I have to, be it education or work.  Right now I've decided that I want to return to Singapore to work, but in a few years' time I will probably start a PhD in Strategic Planning - I've taken a sniff at it and it looks like it's going to be a real gas.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you have a degree, it makes you a more confident person. You also earn more than others for the same job(because of the qualification). Success cannot be measured by level of education alone. Some people who earns a lot but have no university education may say university sucks big time but they will most likely still want their sons/daughters to get into a university. Getting a degree is not a must but it will be good to have one. Plus points if you get top class honours, Masters, PHD.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is important if you think it is. Nothing wrong with thinking its important neither is it wrong to think otherwise.<br><br>I think most young people nowadays do not realise that straight after ur university days, you will jump straight into the working world and most likely thats where you will stay for the rest of your life, albeit in different jobs.  You got to know what you want in life. I got frens who study study study then now suddenly graduate came to realisation that its too late to regret. I also have frens who quit school early to do business, one is doing well in his transport business, one is going to fold soon...one have already given up and join the police force...<br><br>If university can give what you want in life later on, go for it.  If you do not even know what you want in life, then the question does not even matter anymore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This society sees too much in paper grades. Those of us who are in the working world know all too well that scholars move up corporate ladders faster than the average employee, that scholars are offered opportunities wider than the average employee, and more often than not, scholars are at the pinacle of each conglomerate.<br><br>It seems experience and capability fall short of 'unquestionable'  As and Distinctions on your degree, along with an ink chop that stamps "scholar".<br><br>Is there anyone out there who runs a company who was not a scholar? Very few, and fewer still as this absurd trend continues. Therein lies the problem.<br><br>We think of a uni degree as a doorway by which greatness follows. We stereotype an obsolete thinking: Those that do not make it to a uni are failures.<br><br>Was it not all too recently that we looked upon normal/technical stream students as the bottom of the barrel? Do we not continue to do so?<br><br>It is in this nature that we should be deemed short-sighted. It would be conceited to think that a uni degree holds all the answers to a prosperous and comfortable life...<br><br>It merely holds a higher educational standard, but proves nothing if you already have the focus and desire of blossoming entrepreneurs like Dennis Wee.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the things that many people fail to realise about tertiary education is that the object is to teach one <strong>how</strong> to think, not what to think.  The level at which teaching takes place moves from the concrete to the abstract Â– you are expected to look beyond individual facts and pull all of these facts into concepts.  Sadly, many university students I have seen seem to be challenged even by handling facts, and instead often lapse into opinion.<br><br>The raison dÂ’etre of university is to impart the techniques of tuning oneÂ’s intellect towards dealing with concepts Â– to take individual points of information and to analyse and synthesise them into a cogent argument in favour of a concept.  The question then is, is that entirely necessary?<br><br>In the case of the examples that Atobe cited, the answer would be no.  They already knew these things, so putting them through university is simply overkill.  On the other hand, most of us need such an environment to cultivate such qualities in us.  On the flip side, I have seen many graduates leave university no smarter than they were when they entered Â– you canÂ’t make a silk purse out of a sowÂ’s ear.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CX, what exactly do you mean by Â“informed opinionÂ”?  If it means what you seem to be getting at, which is in fact a properly founded conclusion, then we do indeed have a meeting point.  Perhaps further clarifying my terms would help here.<br><br>LetÂ’s start with facts.  A fact is an observable and measurable object, action or event.  For example, Â“He accesses the Internet five times a day, spending a total of eight hoursÂ” is a fact, while Â“HeÂ’s on the Internet a lotÂ” is not.  Said personÂ’s use of the Internet can be measured by frequency and duration, providing hard facts, while Â“a lotÂ” does not constitute a fact.<br><br>A number of facts, assembled in a logical manner, can lead to a conclusion.  For example, adding logic to the first statement can make the second statement a properly founded conclusion.  Â“He accesses the Internet five times a day, spending a total of eight hours.  Given that the average person accesses the Internet once a day and spends half an hour, we can say that he spends a lot of time on the InternetÂ”.  Even so, the use of a vague term like Â“a lotÂ” can put this conclusion under question.  If there are a number of people out there who spend 16 hours a day on the Internet, this personÂ’s usage will not seem like a lot.<br><br>If it is a proper fact, it is neutral and one can assemble a set of facts in a certain manner to reach a conclusion.  That the person spends eight hours on the Internet is a measure that stands by itself.  Its implications, however, can be modified according to what other facts are presented alongside it.  As above, if the person is compared to an average user, he looks like a heavy user.  On the other hand, next to a 16-hour-a-day user, he looks like a light user.  Along these lines, you seem to have mixed facts and knowledge together inappropriately to conclude that facts are contentious.  Facts stand by themselves and are therefore neutral by definition, while knowledge, as a collection of certain facts, can take a bent in a certain direction.<br><br>It is not a case of Â“you canÂ’t go wrong with factsÂ”.  Regardless of definitions of opinions and conclusions, they both attend to the question Â“What?Â”, which, by itself is not good enough.  If someone tells me Â“whatÂ”, I would certainly want to know the Â“whyÂ” part of it.  For example, if someone told me Â“Put ten thousand dollars into stocks of X companyÂ”, I would not immediately go off to the bank and sign my life away.  I suspect you would not either.  The first questions I would ask is Â“Why should I do that?  Has X company been doing something that is likely to make their share prices rise?Â”.  If X company has indeed been making some good moves, that might be the basis for investing in them.<br><br>My point here is: donÂ’t go providing an opinion or conclusion without backing it up.  Without that foundation, they are useless.  You cannot automatically trust the source of the statement.  Fine, if Bill Gates was to provide an opinion of where the computer industry is going, his word may have some credence given his track record in the computer business.  However, he probably knows jack squat about the pink tutu business, and I would not automatically take his word for it in that particular arena.<br><br>Hmm.  You want an example of a concept?  OkayyyyyÂ…<br><br>Â“However, IRT models with more parameters may sometimes be preferable (Suen, 1990).  For example, selecting a homogeneous set of items with equal discrimination may not always be possible.  With sets of items with varying levels of discrimination, using the more complex 2PL model may be more suitable than attempting to apply a 1PL model where the assumption of homogeneity in item discrimination is not supported.  Hambleton (1989) also notes that items that fit a 1PL model are harder to find than for other models, and a 2PL model may in this way be more attractive than a 1PL model from a practical perspective.Â”<br><br>Okay, I took the lazy way out and cut-and-pasted from my doctoral thesis.  One of the points of my thesis was to test if a two-parameter model (2PL) IRT model provides more accurate results than a 1PL model.  I took actual examples of undergraduate exam results to produce mathematical models that showed that the 2PL model did indeed produce more accurate results, but that they were more sensitive to disparities between the difficulty of the exam and the ability level of the examinees.  While I prefer 2PL models personally (accounting for more parameters makes more sense), I examined the facts Â– the actual exam results, the data from the exams (and the resulting mathematical models), correlations between the model results and the actual results, estimated difficulty levels and the examineesÂ’ estimated ability levels.  Looking at these facts, I demonstrated the point I wanted to, which was that 2PL models indeed provided more accurate results.  However, at the same time, the results revealed that 2Pl models can be twitchy and need careful use Â– that part I did not want to demonstrate.  However, being intellectually honest, one has to provides both the pros and cons, and the facts would not let me get away with providing the pros alone.  If I had glossed over the limitations of the 2PL model, the examiners would have crucified me.<br><br>This leads me to my next point, addressing your issue about facts being presented in a biased manner.  With the examiners, I could not have possibly gotten away with it, because their analysis of the facts I presented would have highlighted the things that I omitted.  With an ignorant audience, it is extremely easy to get away with chucking out a whole lot of facts and stunning them into silent agreement.  Hell, IÂ’ve done it enough times at board meetings Â– some so-called human resources professional with a chip on his shoulder questions my assertions, and I drown him or her in a sea of relevant facts and statistics.  However, it is not a cop-out; if someone of an equal level of knowledge were to analyse my facts and stats, they would see it as logical.<br><br>In my line of work, there is always the chance of someone questioning what I say, and I always make a point to be prepared to provide a detailed answer to a fine-point question.  My professional reputation hinges on my ability to provide these answers, and my obligation to my clients is to provide sound advice.<br><br>This brings me to my point about students who lapse into opinion.  I will not send out a student to go make a fool of himself by trying to slip an unfounded opinion by a future client.  Every student that I have taught has at some point been hammered by me for doing that in their university assignments, and every single one has learned to ask themselves Â“is this opinion or conclusion?Â”.  I had the advantage of having individual students referred to me by my lecturers, and IÂ’m not quite sure if I could have done that at a class level.  However, my former students have gone on to be manage university departments, run war-trauma programs in third-world countries and set up their own consultancies.  And all of them have stuck by that one simple question in everything they do: Â“is this opinion or conclusion?Â”, and it has worked very much in their favour.<br><br>I donÂ’t have a problem with polemic opinions Â– if youÂ’ve read my posts on previous threads, you will know that I am not at all uncomfortable with controversy.  I do, however, have a problem with unfounded opinion, and again my previous posts have reflected that.<br></div>

A fact exists and remains a fact regardless of its integration into a framework.  If this person spends 8 hours a day on the Internet, that amount of time spent does not depend on our observation.  The distinguishing feature of a fact is that it is <strong>observable</strong>, not that it is observed.<br><br>I am not a subscriber to Cartesian logic Â– Â“I think, therefore I amÂ” does not apply to the non-living, which nonetheless exist.  The fact exists by itself Â– it is the observation of the fact that is dependent upon the observerÂ’s actions.

For example, the red car sitting in front of my house exists regardless of whether I choose to take note of it or not.<br><br>I suspect that you might be alluding to the changes in the fact that may be brought about by the act of observation.

If we already had perfect knowledge, why would I have performed research on it?<br><br>It is not that the examiners have perfect knowledge of the subject matter, but instead their ability to use their ability to handle the subject matter on a conceptual level, that would have allowed them to spot the holes in my argument.<br><br>In fact, this is exactly what I am talking about.  Only one of my examiners was required to have knowledge in Item Response Theory, because the main aim of the examination process was to verify the logical consistency of my research.  IÂ’m not sure if you have done postgraduate research before, but a postgraduate thesis is required to be Â“an original contribution to the fieldÂ”.  If it is original, how could someone know more about it than the researcher?<br><br>Instead of falling back upon their existing knowledge of the subject, the examiners take what is written, and extrapolate it to their own conclusions.  If these conclusions are not addressed, it highlights shortcomings in the research.<br><br>This principle all seems random unless you consider that the examiners themselves employ methods of properly assessing concepts through the use of rules governing logical structures.  These rules have been developed since the days of the early philosophers, in order to assess the soundness of their arguments.  For a good description of these rules, I would recommend Trudy GovierÂ’s Â“A Practical Study of ArgumentÂ” Â– it provides a clear explanation of what forms a properly constructed argument.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">Continued in next post...</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As you have said before, total dependence on existing knowledge is a flawed approach, and I agree wholeheartedly.  First, as you have also said, you cannot assume perfect knowledge of anything.  Second, it does not account for learning anything new.  What is needed is a way of handling intellectual material without a complete store of specific subject material, and this is where the ability to conceptualise comes in.  I occasionally participate in multidisciplinary groups with professionals from other fields such as medicine and law, and I need to be able to understand what these other professionals are saying without being an expert in their field myself, so that I can make a useful contribution to the discussion at hand.  While I pick up specific bits of information from their fields, I integrate them into my understanding of the topic by applying them to that conceptual framework, which itself is modified as more information is added to it.<br><br>This in fact brings us full circle, and indicates that we are in fact talking about the same thing, only couched in different terms.  In a previous post, you said:<br><blockquote> u have to know HOW to ask yourself questions to know WHAT these facts MEANS to u... part of this is training, part of this is applying a concept/framework that at best, only fits partly, and most of it is just plain informed OPINION. </blockquote>Well, how do you know what questions to ask?  Along the lines of my existing argument, I propose that those questions are the result of applying the rules of logic to the information presented, extrapolating from the bits of information to form conclusions, comparing it to the information presented, identifying aspects that have yet to be addressed, and bringing those aspects to light by asking questions about them.<br><br>Perhaps one thing that I am remiss in not making explicit is that this process is not necessarily a formalized process, in that it is carried out consciously.  Some people seem to have an innate knack for performing such a process without thinking about the process itself.  I believe that the owners of Tee Yih Jia and Creative Technologies, whom Atobe identified, are examples of such people.  They think that way as a matter of course Â– research into people who are successful in their fields indicates that this manner of thinking is common across these people (IÂ’ll follow your lead here in not providing a bibliography in a friendly conversation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).<br><br>This brings me back to my original point, and back onto the topic.  While there are such talented individuals who think in this manner as a matter of course, the rest of us mere mortals need to learn to think that way.  Ironically, therefore, the point for many of us going to university is to learn to think like these people without degrees.  The problem is that many university students seem to miss this simple point and end up no smarter than they were when they started, because they were too busy memorizing the basic facts Â– they have missed the forest for the trees.<br><br>WhatÂ’s your discipline, by the way?</div>
