            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Singapore students receive a poor education</strong><br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>The main purpose of an education is to teach us to think. To inculcate a desire to find the truth. And when it is found, to have the courage to enforce it. And in enforcing it, mankind benefits. Justice and decency is served. And mankind advances.<br><br>The main purpose of an education is to develop certain principles in us; certain convictions. And to have the courage to defend it.<br><br>This is the most important part of an education; besides learning medicine, learning law or engineering. What good is it, if you have all the technical education, but no soul? But you cannot be a good lawyer, a good engineer or a good scientist without first having certain convictions. Which convictions the student has developed through a desire for knowledge and the truth. Through assiduous study and research over time.<br><br>And based on this definition of a good education; if there is a grading system for college education around the world, Singapore would probably rank 146th worst education system; just as Singapore is ranked as having the 146th least free press in the world by an internationally recognized organization monitoring the newspapers in the world.<br><br>My bleak assessment of Singapore students comes from watching Riz Khan's interview with Singapore students aired on Al Jazeera Television on Dec 27, 2007. The interview was with students in their 20s from Singapore University. The questions by Riz Khan related to Singapore's rigid and controlled society. About the lack of free speech and expressions. Lack of fundamental rights.<br><br>The students were described and confessed that they were well travelled. More than one student confirmed they had studied in the United States. We therefore would have expected a more open view as regards fundamental human rights, like free sppech.<br><br>We all know these students are aware of the restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression in Singapore. Yet when asked directly about the restrictions on the freedoms of speech and expression, they were prevaricating. Hedging and hemming. Dodging the issue. Through fear. Fear of the government. Fear not to upset the government. Making sure they did not directly attack this government. So that their criticisms if any were calculated, diluted and moderated.<br><br>They appeared apologetic of the government, saying things like, Singapore was different from the west. That Singaporeans value judgements were different. That Singapore was not yet ready for the freedoms. That the government is working towards giving more freedoms to Singaporeans. That they expect change to come slowly. That they hope it will come. That they themselves wanted more freedom. That freedom was good for Singapore.<br><br>Yet, not even one student said that he or she was prepared to do anything about it. None of them were engaged in any real activity to bring about the desired change. They said they were hoping that the government will bring about the change. And they appeared to say that they will wait until the government sees fit, if and when they eventually decide, to give them freedoms.<br><br>The students said they were afraid to criticize the government for fear of being arrested by the government. They did not want to go to jail. So they are not prepared, they said to openly criticize the government.<br><br>This is in spite of the fact that they know, or should know by now, that the Singapore constitution gives them these fundamental rights of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and various other fundamental freedoms. But not one of them was prepared to exercise these rights, even though it belonged to them.<br><br>By the way, all these students also know and are aware that Dr. Chee Soon Juan and other activists are repeatedly being arrested and imprisoned for doing nothing more than merely exercising their fundamental rights. Yet none of them even mentioned the name of Dr. Chee Soon Juan during the entire interview; let alone actively participating with him in the cause of freedom!<br><br>Even though they appeared in their 20s, they were nothing more than overgrown babies, waiting for their guardian Mr. Lee Kuan Yew to give them more freedom; just as Lee Kuan Yew will give them jobs security and everything.<br><br>These are not the men and women who can govern or run Singapore. They are not leaders. No leadership qualities at all. No convictions of any sort whatsoever. No burning ideals. No aspirations. No hope. It appears to me now that in Singapore only Lee Kuan Yew has any strong ideas about anything. All the rest are waiting for him to tell them what to do next.<br><br>These Singapore college students appeared weak, acting like overgrown babies; as if they were waiting for their parents to tell them what to do next. Or for Lee Kuan Yew to tell them that.<br><br>While American students defy the police in protest against the war in Iraq, the inaction in Dafur and even tying themselves to trees to prevent their felling by loggers to save the spotted owl, these Singapore college students are waiting for Lee Kuan Yew to give them their freedoms! Now these American students are some students. They have convictions and passions. They will one day become leaders. Not like the overgrown babies of Singapore University.<br><br>The Al Jazeera u-tube video interview with these obedient Singapore college students can be watched on the blog Singabloodypore.<br><br>Thank God, I did not receive my college education in Singapore! Imagine, I would have turned out like them!<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br><br><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/12/singapore-students-receive-poor.html" rel="nofollow">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/2007/12/singapore-students-receive-poor.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ehhhh, we can all just talk around about it, but when it's all said in done, what will all this talking do?<br>I'm thankful that the threadstarter is concerned for singapore and its future =). At the same time, besides bringing awareness to the issue, what good will all these words on a website do?<br>I know that people may simply believe that I'm yet another 'child' who has been brainwashed by the government. I do not believe that everything the government is doing is correct, but at the same time, I do not believe that the government is completely in the wrong either.<br>singapore is not a democratic society =). Yes, I've realized. However, simply because it is not a democratic society does not mean that people cannot come around to live with passion. the chinese textbooks that we read in secondary school [or, in this case, I still read xD] are full of propaganda, but that doesn't mean that, though they are fed with half-lies, people will not learn to see through the lies they are presented with and instead search for the truth.<br>it would be unfair to release the statement "singapore students receive a poor education". it is too generalized. simply because selected singapore students were shown to have a mentality that you have deemed to be 'incorrect' does not mean that every singapore student receives a poor education. not all are nurtured to duly accept the circumstances in which they live =). evidence would be the case in which several singapore students sold tshirts to bring awareness to ... an unfinished mrt project, I think it was? would that not be evidence of pouring your soul into the environment around you and letting your voice be heard? xD<br><br>yeah well, I don't know what else to say, so I'll just end here. thanks for reading this if you did. xD<br></div>

Relinquished Singapore citizenship 2005 because I was not prepared to permit Lee Kuan Yew to unjustly retain my CPF funds if I remained Singapore Citizen.

            <div class='col-md body'>Tuesday, December 25, 2007<br>Singapore's reluctant lawyers<br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>Dr. Chee Soon Juan, of the Singapore Democratic Party, the most outspoken critic of Lee Kuan Yew Administration's dictatorial policies; has repeatedly complained that he has not been able to find any Singapore lawyer, not even one, to represent him in the various criminal and defamation cases brought against him by Lee in the Singapore courts. Dr. Chee Soon Juan is not a lawyer and has no training in the law.<br><br>As a result, Dr. Chee Soon Juan has had to represent himself in almost all these politically motivated cases. Even the one going on now; the speaking without a permit charge, which has already begun and due to continue next month, in the Subordinate Courts before Judge Jusvinder Kaur who will undoubtedly find him guilty as charged and send him to prison yet again.<br><br>It appears that lawyers in Singapore are afraid to represent him. The possible consequence, they say, in such representation is the fear Lee Kuan Yew will, through his agents, make like difficult for them. For instance, if they were getting government clients, this source will possibly terminate. Judges would be ordered to find against their clients when are are in court. Their clients will be threatened to stay away from them. False accusations would be made against them, such as professional misconduct and their licences revoked. This fear runs throughout the legal profession in Singapore. Therefore, Singapore lawyers refuse opposition politician's cases. It is not good, they say, for their livelihood. But what about their conscience?<br><br>Not too long ago, a prominent Singapore lawyer, who is now the head of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, unashamedly stated in an interview with a foreign correspondent that "he was prepared to represent any murderer, thief or serial killer that you throw at him. But please, no political dissidents". Imagine that.<br><br>In any other self respecting country with a self respecting bar, any lawyer would have been ashamed to say such a thing; that he is not prepared to represent political dissidents! But not in Singapore. In Singapore it is no longer shameful, even for lawyers trained in the law, to say that they live in fear of Lee Kuan Yew. That their legal representation will only extend this far. That despite their training and their knowledge in the law, they fear to use it, when it is something that Lee Kuan Yew may disapprove!<br><br>Singapore lawyers, should be ashamed of themselves. All of them. They allow themselves to be used in a charade, a make believe, because it suits this man, Lee Kuan Yew.<br><br>I was a lawyer myself in Singapore. <strong>Lawyers when they are admitted to the Bar, have to take an oath. This oath requires them to uphold the Singapore Constitution. The oath is taken before a High Court Judge in a courtroom. Yet, having made this solemn oath, every Singapore lawyer unashamedly, the very next minute professionally behaves as if they have never heard of the free speech clause or the freedom of assembly clause; provisions that they only a minute ago had solemnly promised to uphold!</strong><br><br>They have also completely forgotten the law of defamation or its procedure; if they were asked to represent Dr. Chee Soon Juan!<br><br>These lawyers are seen shamelessly with the outward trappings of lawyers; black robes, black suitcase, black suit and necktie and so on, speaking or trying to speak in high sounding English, as if they were in fact lawyers. But in fact, they lack the very basic underlying quality a lawyer is supposed to have; the courage to represent your client when your client needs you. This question we should ask the lawyers in Singapore. Where were you when your fellow citizen Dr. Chee Soon Juan needed you?<br><br>It is not a case that Dr. Chee See Juan's cases are without merit. If there was a single case, worthy of merit, surely it has to be Dr. Chee's. All his cases were either for defamation of character, i.e. Lee Kuan Yew's character; for illegal protest or speaking in public without permits. Every lawyer in Singapore knows that there are a thousand defenses, meritorious defenses, that can be mounted in every one of these cases, starting with the valid argument that laws contrary to the constitution are ultra vires and unenforceable, except on a showing that there is an overriding public interest.<br><br>Any first year law student knows it and can do it. But yet there is not one; not a single lawyer in the entire profession of 3,000 who will come forward and do his duty to the law and to Singapore.<br><br>If there is one profession, among all the professions in that island, who should be particularly ashamed themselves, it is sadly the legal profession.<br><br>In such a case, we begin to ask the motivation that made these lawyers read law in the first place. Was it not a desire to seek justice? Was it not a desire to seek the truth? Was it not to represent your client in his time of need? If not, what was it?<br><br>I say this to the entire legal profession in Singapore, starting with the President of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. It is about time you searched your conscience and ask yourself if you are truly upholding the oath you took when you were first admitted the Bar, perhaps decades ago. And if not, perhaps, it is time that you did what is right.<br><br>Just across the Causeway, a mere 2 hour drive on the Malaysian highway, or an hour by air as the crow flies, is Kuala Lumpur and the Malaysian Bar Association. There however the lawyers are a different breed entirely. The President of the Malaysian Bar spoke up fearlessly against the erosion of the rule of law in Malaysia and swore to fight till the bitter end to uphold it. These brave words were said at the International Bar Association annual meeting held in Singapore last year. Ironically these words were said by a woman; the President of the Malaysian Bar happens to be a woman. One courageous woman and one courageous group of lawyers.<br><br>If only Singapore lawyers had half the courage of this woman president of the Malaysian Bar!<br><br>Gopalan Nair<br></div>
