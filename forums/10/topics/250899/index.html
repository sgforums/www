How do you explain other family members getting into prominent position in politics and other government businesses?<br><br>Inefficiencies is when you have 84 MPs for a population of 4.3 million, which is a ratio of 1 MP to 51,000 citizens. Whereas in other countries like the U.K., South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the ratio is 1 MP to 100,000 citizens. The rationale? To maintain a large pool of MPs so that the possibility of being out voted by opposition MPs is non existent. We used to have 55-56 MPs in the past.<br><br>Inefficiencies is when the job could be perform by someone with a salary of S$1 million a year, but instead the person wishes to be paid S$3 million.<br><br>Motivating yourself relies alot on the environment too, if you're environment is quicksand, all your struggles are futile.<br><br>When you vote in a CEO of a large multinational corporation (MNC), you would expect that CEO to outperform all the other MNCs in the competitive arena. Hence <strong>protect</strong> your investments from just getting an average return. Year after year, you hear your CEO tell you, that the profits are mediocre because of competition from globalisation. But you see other MNCs who are outperforming the market average. Something must really be wrong with your group of shareholders. A good CEO does not come up with lame excuses for his failure, a good CEO should be able to outperform the market average whatever the market conditions.<br><br>They serve alright, they serve their own self interest.</div>

Is it only to tax and recover all possible costs and hoarding taxes as surpluses for paying themselves the highest salaries?<br><br>The leaders have been talking for years about restructuring the economy since 1970s to a value-adding technology-driven economy.<br><br>To create such an economy, obviously it is inadequate to promote only the top talents. It is common sense the leaders themselves cannot accomplish much by only talking about their policies and ideas or assumptions.<br><br>They have to motivate people, an essential ingredient of successful companies like the Fortune 500 to get the masses to apply their practical knowledge and skills.<br><br>But no our leaders do not bother with motivating people. Instead they have been too self-centred in promoting only themselves including paying themselves the highest salaries and getting away with negligence in NKF and Shin Corp or Nicol Highway collapse with constant denials of problems.<br><br>Without practising EQ or motivational corporate governance their many policies including economic restructuring could not work and achieve results. Their many workers' re-training schemes have failed as admitted by Spring in their seminars on workers' trainings.<br><br>It is therefore a fact that the leaders have indeed miserably failed to bring about the necessary motivational changes badly needed to bring about a competitive economy.<br><br><blockquote>RT:We are now after the world recovers from recent prolonged recessions seeing MM Lee talking again about his being extraordinary when he was lying low throughout the worse period without any solutions<br><br>User: YouÂ’re expecting the government to play the role of a nanny to shield you from the real world. I guess you must be disappointed that they didnÂ’t do that.</blockquote>No body wants the government to interfere in citizens' personal rights and freedoms with the 2-child policy and graduate mother policy. It is MM Lee who has elected himself to be the nanny with his autocratic style as people do not expect him to be nanny. By his autocracy he is unable to motivate the people towards working closely with his government for years and he should know this himself why people are not pulling in the same direction and good people are migrating in large number if he has any sense of proportion.<br><br><blockquote>RT:Up to now he is still promoting a few ideas of his like his ministers being the most talented or deserving the highest salaries without producing any new Goh Keng Swee transformation or restructuring.<br><br>User: These people are extraordinary, and you seem to think that they will always be there to serveÂ…<br>Chances are, you will not see another leader like Lee Kwan Yew, or Goh Keng Swee in the governmentÂ… ever.</blockquote>If the scholars he has put up indeed have worked they should have restructured the economy with some major transformation over the past 20 years. Nothing much has been accomplished. Three economic restructuring plans announced during the recessions have so far not produced the desired results namely: value-adding technology-driven economy talked about for years.<br><br><blockquote>:4.5 million population suffering from high costsÂ…<br><br>User: Yes, like every other 4.5 million people, I am suffering from high costs for satisfying my craving of shopping Â…</blockquote>Whether the ordinary people are getting better as compared with the early 1980s, it is all too clear for all to see. The failure to upgrade the restructure the economy is largely the result of self-centred system of government which only benefit the holding on to power of the ruling party and its few elites.</div>

The government needs to manage its assets better," a Beijing economist said.<br><br>The Government of Singapore Invest-ment Corp, set up by the island's government in the 1970s, is an example of managing excess foreign currency reserves through long-term investment to generate higher returns.<br><br>Another example is the world's fifth-largest oil exporter, Norway. Its US$292 billion global pension fund has invested all oil revenues abroad to prevent the domestic economy from overheating, with the long-term goal of paying for future pensions.<br><br>In order to increase investment returns and diversify risk, economists and market observers have recommended the agency should broaden its investment scope from focusing on low-yield US Treasuries to equities and other alternatives, which have higher yields, but higher risks.<br><br>"The agency should invest overseas in equity and commodities markets," said Stephen Green, senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank.<br><br>He said the agency could hire overseas managers to run part of the funds. This is how Hong Kong's Foreign Exchange Fund and even the mainland's National Social Security Fund operate, mandating part of the fund to certain professionals in designated areas like fixed-income or equity markets.<br><br>Ha Jiming, an economist at China International Capital Corp, citing Singa-pore's GIC, believes the new agency will diversify into investments ranging through stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and direct equity holdings, to real estate.<br><br>The California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, the world's biggest pension fund, may be a good example to study.<br><br>"A large portion of our money invested in stocks is 'passively managed.' We are long-term investors - we buy and hold," the fund's board said on their official Web site. "We do maintain some active equity management and have contracted with a group of US and international money managers with expertise in specialized areas."<br><br>This pension fund, with assets of US$232.5 billion, has developed diversified strategies in international and domestic markets with an asset allocation of about 60 percent in equities, 26 percent in fixed income, 8 percent in real estate and 6 percent in direct investment.<br><br>Compared with the low US Treasury yield of about 3 percent, Calpers' total return in the fiscal year ending January was about 11.96 percent, while its three-year and five- year returns were 13.05 percent and 10.66 percent, respectively.<br><br>Although the new forex agency still needs time to finalize its constitution, former vice finance minister Lou Jiwei has been appointed to head it, after being promoted to vice secretary general of the State Council, the immediate supervisory body of the agency.<br><br>This structure is based on the Singapore model, including both Temasek and GIC, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore-supervised Temasek holding the state-owned assets for the government and investing in overseas sectors, while the government directly holds GIC, which manages the island's forex reserves by investing actively in overseas and domestic equity and money markets.<br><br>The size of the fund to be managed by the new agency is a state secret, but it is common belief the fund will start with US$200 billion, about a fifth of the existing forex reserves.<br><br>This is larger than Dubai's pension fund. "We estimate China needs a normal forex reserve of US$800 billion at most to meet its liquidity needs. Thus, as much as US$200 to US$300 billion could be placed under the management of the state forex investment company," Ha said.<br><br>The new agency will source its base funds either through direct transfer from the State Administration of Foreign Ex- change or by issuing bonds to tap the central bank, and through commercial bank subscription, Green and Ha said.<br><br>"Raising yuan through issuing yuan- denominated bonds in the interbank market and swaps with the central bank for foreign currency are the most probable," Green said in his recent report.<br><br></blockquote></span><br><span style="color: darkred;">At least China will not run the State Reserves as anyone's Private Asset, with sons and daughter-in-law roped in to help run the Enterprise.<br><br>If anyone were to lose $3 Billion in China, we will certainly get to see heads rolling, unlike in Singapore where embarrassing matters quietly fizzle out, and the ashes swept under the carpet - while the Citizens continue to be financially and politically abused by the State. </span><br></div>

In fact, Singapore government has been so successful, it is being observed and emulated by many countries in the world. </blockquote>To be efficient, it is essential to set up a competitive manpower structure to avoid over-spending people's taxes on ministers', MPs' and civil servants' salaries, life-long pensions and double-salaries for certain ministers (one for retirements who did not take place and one for full minister posts)<br><br>So it is right for people to tie the number of posts of ministers and MPs to the population. Do our talented ministers who are paid million-dollar salaries understand such an objective assessments which were not mentioned in the ministers' salary benchmarking at all, just like their life-long pensions which were conveniently left out in the benchmarking.<br><br><blockquote>The environment you refer to is the societal environment. You can put the blame on the society. You can even blame the government for that. You are probably right tooÂ… Fine, now that you know that you live in an environment that is difficult to motivate yourself, what are you going to do about it? Are you going to shake your head, admit your fate, stand down and blame it on others? </blockquote>Such rebuttal as this has too often been used as a last triumph card when ministers meet with more logical arguments to debunk their wrong policies. They will say "what can you do about it, we have received 66.6 % of the popular votes" or stuff like "why don't you stand for election" If our ministers want to receive feedbacks they have to show their sincerity that they will address problems caused by their wrong policies such as wrongful benchmarking of their salaries equivalent to asking taxpayers to let them write their own lottery winner pay cheques. Are they talented enough to see that their recent policy to increase their world's highest bill collector salaries is immoral and sinful and not just wrong. To rub salt into the wound when after they forced their way through autocracy to fill up their own pay cheque they quickly turned down the Alpha-S pilots' benchmarking of pilots' salaries to cosmopolitan pilots in other airline without allowing them to quote the ministerial benchmarking criteria.<br><br><blockquote>The last time I looked at SingaporeÂ’s historical economic growth, unemployment rate, GDP, standard of living etc., it was doing well. Well, I just donÂ’t know how you come to a conclusion that SingaporeÂ’s growth is anything short of spectacularÂ…<br><br>I will reply to Robert next time... </blockquote>This was the reason given by Danabalan - the last time we had a peek at our investment we saw it was still performing pretty well - when asked to be more open and accountable to taxpayers in spending their monies on shin corp etc which did not benefit the citizens in lowering medical costs or their eventual retirements.<br><br>How are our talented ministers going to convince citizens that they are not losing their hard-earned savings on careless investments like the Shin Corp with this sort of "holier than thou" attitude or the unspoken craze of power like "we will do as we like because we are voted by 66.6 % of the popular votes" when they are making decisions without accountable implementation processes in running a government.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>RT:By dubious benchmarking salaries of ministersÂ…</blockquote>We were talking about government taxation, corporatization of services and tax surpluses. I was stating that there is nothing wrong with all these three.<br><br><blockquote>RT: What is the role of government ? Is it only to tax and recover all possible costs...<br></blockquote>The role of government? To provide national security, economic growth, a working public service, a decent country to live in, employment, opportunities and stability. If you would read their Â“propagandaÂ” with less cynicism, you would see that they have actually done an outstanding job.<br><br><blockquote>RT: The failure to upgrade the restructure the economy...<br></blockquote>Your insistence on the fact that the restructuring of economy has been a dismal failure is fallacious. Because of the right government policies, Singapore economy has been experiencing more than average growth for a long time.<br><br><blockquote>RT: Without practising EQ or motivational corporate governance their many policies including economic restructuring could not work and achieve results.<br></blockquote>Well, you are right on this point. The government needs to motivate people in the case youÂ’ve presented. I was of the wrong impression that you were arguing the need of government motivation to work for your own livelihood.<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â…getting away with negligence in NKF and Shin Corp or Nicol Highway collapse with constant denials of problems.<br></blockquote>Robert, it is always easy to blame others when you have the benefit of hindsight. I find that this kind of Â“if onlyÂ” exercise futile. There is negligence, and thatÂ’s why bad things happen. The perpetrators are now brought to court. WhatÂ’s more important are the actions taken to remedy the situations, and to prevent future occurrences.<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â…the mistake of 2-child policy and graduate mother policy.<br></blockquote>Perhaps you might want to read more about the genuine motivations behind these policies. Unless you think itÂ’s all a conspiracyÂ…<br><br><blockquote><br>Whether the ordinary people are getting better as compared with the early 1980s, it is all too clear for all to see.<br></blockquote>Sorry, still too young then, canÂ’t compareÂ… and youÂ’ll probably tell me itÂ’s much better then, right?  Then my question would be Â“Should you blame the government for that?Â”<br><br>I know I wonÂ’t, because IÂ’d blame myself if I am worse off in 20 years time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Robert,<br><br>Wow, you write real long essays. I have shortened them in my reply...<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… unionism</blockquote>You are advocating a socialistic argument, while I am advocating a capitalistic argument. The arguments never endÂ…<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… autocracy</blockquote>If thatÂ’s what you think our system is. Well, I am of the opinion that when things suck, the government will be voted out. 1) Things donÂ’t suck today. 2) That doesnÂ’t sound like autocracy, does it?<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… ministerÂ’s salary</blockquote>Again, I am ambivalent to this issue. Frankly, I am not sure. I am actually waiting to see how much pay cut the ministers will take when times are bad. Then, IÂ’ll decide.<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… foreigner-begging economy</blockquote>If you are referring to FDIÂ… ThatÂ’s our economy. Maybe you are really a socialist who is waiting to witness the fall of capitalism. DonÂ’t hold your breathÂ…<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… appointments of CJ and others </blockquote>Just like most other democratic countries. Well, letÂ’s see if the opposition can deny the current government a two third majorityÂ…<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… dropping wages</blockquote>If you are advocating minimum wages, I am for it. If you are advocating protectionism, I am against it.<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… pensions</blockquote>No, I am against pensions for Ministers.<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… rebuttal as triumph card</blockquote>I donÂ’t know if the Ministers are copying my argumentsÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> The point I am making is try to be less cynical and more positive.<br><br><blockquote>RT: Â… unspoken craze of powerÂ… holier than thouÂ… etc.</blockquote>Really?
