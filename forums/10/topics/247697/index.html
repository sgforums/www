            <div class='col-md body'>Wow...i heard from radio today,<br><br>Some bench-warmer MP questioned the govt whether should they have a system whereby performance should be more stringently reviewed in terms of KPI and stuffs because generally basing performance to GDP growth is to broad.<br><br>Teo Chee Hean replied something like, because the duties of ministers are too broad, they should not have a performance review system.<br><br>Talking about performance review huh? THERE ISN'T!!<br><br>Performance would be based on GDP. who cares about senior citizen, welfare, social and ecology issues?<br><br>Our country minister's Key Performance Indicator would be just on GDP<br><br>I really think we are living in a very sad country... someone save us..</div>
