            <div class='col-md body'>Some people have criticized Li Ao as a talk-cock or big mouth.<br><br>It may be true to say that Li Ao is a talk cock or big mouth. But then if what he talks makes sense, then the question to be asked should be: should we listen to his sense?<br><br>He has said Singaporeans are lacking quality or without spine or weak to stand up to bullying by their own government which encourages their government nilly wily to take them largely for granted over time and being over-bold to pass any legislations including rewarding themselves with writing their own salary cheques just by some clever cunning in comparison their salaries with a few lucky individuals in the entrepreneurial world.<br><br>It has gone so wild that it has no hesitation in imposing all kinds of direct and indirect taxes on lands and assets even where lands and assets were already paid for or owned by the people by creating the monopolistic GLCs to charge them all over again while the government pockets all the windfall profits from clever sale proceeds from the GLCs.<br><br>That has been the root cause of our loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>The latest government proposal to postpone people's collection of their own CPF savings at age 55 to 85 would not have happened if Singaporeans are not taken for granted by their government.<br><br>To make matter worse, the people just unthinkingly voted this kind of government back to power at every past election just for some cheap goodies without thinking out their own long-term interest as a people.<br><br>Thus the people have failed to check on many of the wrongful policies due to embolden abuse of power - power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br><br>Now let us consider this criticism objectively. Is it true or false that as a people we the Singaporeans seem to be unable to stand up to such bullying government.</div>
