            <div class='col-md body'>Li Ao one of the most outspoken social critics of Taiwan once famously criticised Singaporeans as lacking quality or spine implying that because of such lack of quality in this regard they have been allowing their government to ride roughshod over them as it likes.<br><br>Whatever is the truth, this may be a honest to goodness truthful statement. But unless Singaporeans start to change as a people and prove they have the mettle to stand up to bullying Li Ao would be regarded as right in his observation.<br><br>In the latter regard there exist enough evidence already to show that government has been bullying the citizens of Singapore because they are easy to bully. One clear example is the latest daylight robbery of their own CPF monies and right to retire at 55 but no the people are too complacent or weak to resist ending up in government taking it again for granted to deem their own CPF monies are to be commandeered pragmatically to solve a national problem for their common good.<br><br>This is how the country has been run - by coercion, by deeming by assumptions of all kinds which run against the interest of citizens with little or only very weak objections soon found to be simplistically overruled.<br><br>(Good grief this kind of tongue-in-cheek misguided rule could still happen in today's society with the government doing as it likes and getting away with claims of being pragmatic or doing the unpopular good for the good of citizens when clearly the opposite is most probably the truth)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(For information)<br>Friedquest has nothing much to say and is unable to debunk Li Ao's criticism of Singaporeans as spineless people without the ability to stand up to bullying by the government thereby losing their rights and status as citizens.<br><br>His rebuttal consists only of the same lame excuses given by newspapers daily news like Singapore has done well over the past 40 years with all kinds of unrepresentative one-sided comparisons made against failed countries to get away with real problems.<br><br>He could not explain why if we have done well and government's taxing and freedom-suppressing policies there are so many problems with ordinary citizens struggling for a living against dropping wages and having their CPF lately being commandeered by the authority to serve its own narrow-minded national purpose of preventing destitution which in the first place was a problem caused by government's own failure in economic restructuring over the recent past 20 years.<br><br>Now a little blip of economic recovery on the world horizon has benefited the GLCs and the rich and upper middle class to recover from the last deep recessions which wiped out ordinary citizens's saving due to many wrong policies in the GCT era.<br><br>People in the rich and upper middle class are make monies due to a temporary blip or hype in the economy and there is no sign that the ordinary citizens are recovering from their losses and sacrifices in terms of jobs, wages or property values hyped up beyond their affordability by HDB's profiteering schemeds.<br><br>So MM Lee has failed over the past 40 years to show his policies of the past are working. He has failed to bring about economic restructuring of our own domestic economic sector of the economy.<br><br>This issue that the past policies of MM Lee have failed to work well over the recent 20 years has been brought up many times by citizens but sadly due to newspapers playing the government tunes it has not been debated in parliament.<br><br>If post-65 MPs and younger ministers have the real interest to serve citizens instead of safeguarding their own million-dollar salaries advancements dependent on MM Lee's goodwill, I would ask them now to raise such an issue in the next parliament.<br><br>It is of no use if we have so many scholars and none of them are willing or prepared to deal with such a serious problem as raised by Li Ao of which none in the establishment has been able to face squarely.<br><br>Let us not hatch such a critical national issue impacting our survival like the apathy of the people and debate it without constraint and identify real solutions so that all could work productively with cooperations at all levels to work towards reaching the first world standards of advanced countries like Korea, Finland or Switzerland.<br><br></div>
