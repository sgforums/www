If i do feel that way, i'll cast my vote for the opposition regardless of who the opposition is as there is nothing to lose. Anyway, i haven't been able to vote.

Singapore passport just as convenient. But I think Canadian really got problem with their identity, go to quebec you need to speak french, else where they are mistaken as american, all Chinese in vancouver are hongkonger. It is a nice place, but you need money. When I got money I can travel there as and when I like, but never in January. Want to migrate also go to australia, why canada? like the snow? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
