However it is in citizens' long-term interest to evolve a political system which can endure and to do so there is a critical need to examine whether there may be shortcomings of such nature as political apathy or weak-mindedness of the people. If people do not have good views about how the country should be run and continue to accept bullying like the latest commandeering of people's retirement funds (their own saving and not welfare) we the citizens will be doing a even greater injustice to our future generation 30 years down the road.<br><br>In this context, I hope to share the view on Li Ao's criticism and hope too people who are happy with whatever government are doing will see this discussion in this light.</div>

For the price of your HDB flat and your car you'll probably be able to afford a nicer house and a nicer car elsewhere. With that car you can drive up to a nearby vineyard, enjoy the scenery and grab some wine. Thereafter you have the option of going fishing with your buddies where the view is nice and the fishes plentiful and big. In between, you guys talk cock and drink relatively inexpensive alcoholic beverages like beer and wine. Inexpensive because, they are produced locally and others probably don't tax as high as Singapore.<br><br>I'm contented in Singapore, you can say that i am happy staying here but its not Utopia.
