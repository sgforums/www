            <div class='col-md body'>Quite a good suggestion to send direct email to LHL or put up ideas with discussions with him.<br><br>If there is no such connections, how to say you are the people's PM. Robust debates were welcome by him. So if it is for real, the casino idea can be openly debated in such a gettogether with him without all the bureaucracy pre-determining on the issue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Idea club of sgforums can generate ideas and convey to him in such informal setting. If he disagree with any ideas, it does not matter as he will give his reasons and be open. All could agree to interact in a certain acceptable above-board manner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

First, Minister Lim Swee Say disclosed that he would re-look at the past policy on creation of jobs. This seems to spell a certain positive change reversing past thinking that Singaporeans are too choosy and nothing more could be done.<br><br>Second, Minister of state Dr. Vivien Balakrishnan announced that he welcomes all feedbacks from all youths via SMS.<br><br>Third, Lim Swee Says says that people should not keep going feedbacks on past issues and problems or past policies but should give new ideas.<br><br>Sizing up the whole of these pronouncements, it looks to me that there is an emphasis that the past policies were right and nothing much can be done to change things. I may be wrong in this assessment. Similarly let us hope that the calls on the young or openning up of more feedback channels is not just an eye-wash to close on past issues and problems. If Singaporeans are indeed more educated and mature, they should be able to see this is not change but the same as before. Nothing has changed.
