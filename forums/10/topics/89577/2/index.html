Like the GST hike, most of the Singaporeans are against it. They know it but they don't give a damn...<br>Then comes the fare hike....etc etc...Tell us to speak up...RLMAO...<br><br>"Jiang le deng yu bai jiang, jiu shuo xin bu yao jiang"...Thats why most Singaporeans don't speak up..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forumnites have identified the following past policies as unworkable because they did not help Singapore to overcome problems like high costs, structural or non-structural unemployments and constraints of all kinds as pointed out to freedom of expressions, correctons to past policies etc:<br><br>(1) High Cost policy - traceable to anti-welfare policy of the past auto-piloted to the extent that government depts and stat boards are accumulating huge surpluses. Monies get sucked up from the economy and cannot spin to benefit all causing unemployment and loss of economic competitiveness.<br><br>(2) Pro-erudite talent instead of pro-practical knowledge application policies - giving rise to class society and elitism. The rest of the population do not contribute as they should have done because of feeling a sense of alienation.<br><br>(3) Pro-foreign policy - trade off in terms of stifling growth of domestic sector not recognized or pre-empted. S-passes and work permits are issued too liberally causing foreigners to come in to take up many jobs that could be filled by locals because of a few dollar difference.<br><br>(4) Because of (1) (2) and (3) as stated abovesaid, Singaporeans do not feel encouraged or motivated. We can try to please the young with some carrots like getting to listen to them more but how about going forward to implement changes to (1) - (3)<br><br>There are many more policies that are unworkable. There was some indications that LHL is going to do something. He will implement openness first and perhaps change unworkable or mixed policies later. All got to give him more time.<br><br>To get to the next level of making changes to fundamental polcies like anti-welfarism which GCT has somewhat moderated, LHL encourages robust debates. If we want to go for robust debates robustness must be allowed to the people taking part. Any OB markers? Any watchful ISDs. Any putting up of past policies on the table for robustness of debates to pin point problems. Can remaking of Singapore happen as recommended at key policy level?<br><br>Ministers who give some indications include Dr. Balakrishnan and Lim Swee Say. May be Minister Khaw Boon Wan can offer some tips on lowering of costs. May be Tony Tan can help to give his vast experiences on how to change deeply entrenched but unworkable policies? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
