Our media reports, accompanied by analytical and op-ed pieces, help them to do this.<br><br>It is important for Singapore newspapers to distinguish clearly commentaries on regional affairs which reflect non-Singaporean views both from Singaporean commentaries and from factual reports of events.<br><br>Otherwise readers may be misled into thinking that these foreign views reflect the newspapers' Singaporean position. This is especially so as all the major Singapore newspapers employ journalists and writers from other countries, who will naturally from time to time comment on events from a foreign perspective.<br><br>Furthermore, when covering regional affairs, a Singapore newspaper should present a broad and balanced range of views, enabling readers to appreciate how different countries see the same issues.<br><br>The newspaper itself should remain detached from conflicts and disputes involving other countries but not Singapore. It should neither advance the position of another country, nor take on a foreign government as if it were itself engaged in such a dispute. Nor should it become a participant in the domestic political debate of another country.<br><br>Both in its explicit editorial line and in the implicit point of view of its reporting, its stance should be a Singaporean one.<br><br>One recent example is the editorial and two commentaries published in the Lianhe Zaobao on Feb 22, on the joint US-Japan statement identifying easing tensions in the Taiwan Strait as a common strategic objective.<br><br>The unsigned editorial was entitled 'A new flash point in Sino-Japan relations'. The two articles, entitled 'China faces US-Japan-Taiwan alliance' and 'A political battle by proxy', were authored by a journalist and a scholar from China respectively.<br><br>All three were written from a PRC perspective, and took Japan and the US to task for conspiring to constrain China.<br><br>Similarly, several years ago, The Straits Times carried articles championing the cause of one South Asian country against another, written by a South Asian journalist. The Government had to remind The Straits Times not to get embroiled in the complex disputes of the South Asian subcontinent.<br><br>We appreciate the contributions of foreign journalists and writers. They add to our talent pool of journalists, and provide insights into the thinking of their compatriots.<br><br>However, when they go beyond straightforward reporting to expressing opinions on regional issues, the newspaper should make it clear that these are the views of foreign nationals, and take extra care to maintain overall balance in its reporting and commentary.<br><br>K.

If that does not highlight its loyalty, The Straits Times' incessant criticism of other countries is surely an indicator of its hypocrisy.</div>
