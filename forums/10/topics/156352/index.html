            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the only easy solution to this problem is to either tell the women in SG to begin to produce more babies than the usual 2 per family(ideal now is to get one boy and one girl to balance things) and think about our National survival in the future. So to start things going guys, if you are young enough, take more vits and oysters, spend less of your time chasing so many degrees which may be a waste of time to many of you as only the Masters will pay more, not the Phds(better to employ yourself as specialist consultants as not many companys can afford your salary expected) and prepare for more day or night baby making activities! If you are like me over the hill and almost down the other side, look for stimulants like viagra and goats horn, etc which will set you up for an early death! However, make sure the Nation will be able to handle the new population boom like the roads, the cars, the MRT, the schools and the HDBs and the eventual retirees in about 50 or 55 years time. Where are they all going to live? Migrate all over the world if any country will accept them. Not easy my friends. First they want your money to boost their economies, then they want you to elect their political parties into Government. They don't want your top degrees or your need to work to pay for your expenses there as they already have unemployment. Think about this in the long run please, not just short-term solutions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>though our birth rate in dwindling, our population is actually going up. This because we have been accepting more and more migrants from china india and the rest of the world.<br><br>One way to tackle this problem<br><br>having babies is a form of national service to the country that women can play a part in. Maybe making women who have not had kids by the age of 35 serve two years of national service will boost our population! And fathers by the age of 35 will have reduced reservist liability. We can all help to do our part in nation building!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, ageing population is a problem that most developed nations are currently facing due to the large number of baby boomers (i.e. babies born after WWII). Together with the rising costs of living, the age demographic is becoming like an inverted triangle, with the elderly on the upper end.<br><br>Say, we Singaporeans are migrants ourselves. Thus, African-Singaporean is a real possibility.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spinex:</div><div class="quote_body">One way to tackle this problem<br><br>having babies is a form of national service to the country that women can play a part in. Maybe making women who have not had kids by the age of 35 serve two years of national service will boost our population! And fathers by the age of 35 will have reduced reservist liability. We can all help to do our part in nation building!<br><br></div></blockquote>This is a really lousy idea.<br><br>Why do u want to force women to have kids by 35 or else NS? It really sounds like a threat instead of service to the country.<br><br>Women/parents who are forced to have children may not be ready or committed to raise children up.  It's not just the finances; u have to raise children, spend all ur free time with them, learn parenting skills so that u don't raise children who are "havoc", or latch-key children, rebellious kids who go astray.<br><br>Sure it may boost population, but what kind of population are u getting when parenthood is forced?<br><br>And if something needs to be done, women should get a right to choose which form of NS they want to undertake, not just bearing children.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe policies that dangle carrots to encourage childbirth:<br><br>- free medical treatment for children up to a certain age i.e. 6 years old.  i think that will really boost population<br><br>(i think free education is hard to achieve cos MOE is already in the red.  All children go to school but not all children are unhealthy and need medical services every day)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is in human nature:<br><br>(1)  Before arrival, talk about fairness, equity, justice, level-playing field and goodness for the greatest number.<br><br>(2)  After arrival, talk about leadership and talents, and meritocracy as such policies or talks allow greater self-rewards for those who arrive.<br><br>This human nature is at work in Singapore. The lack of level-playing field against local businesses in pro-foreign and pro-GLCs policies is no longer an issue.<br><br>Creating surpluses by privatizations schemes so as to avoid welfarism is constantly drummed into the population national psyche until everyone accepts higher government charges and fees as the way to go.<br><br>The fact that owing to higher fees and prices people are not doing well and property prices are dropping to the lowest is not a problem. All shortcomings with the business vibrancy and economy can be easily explained - world economic situation and emergence of lower cost countries.<br><br>The problem of a private sector not doing well against high costs and government's business competitiveness is not an issue.<br><br>All the doings and consequences of human nature to reward those who arrive can be easily explained. Forget about high morals, socialist principles, empathy for the poor and destitute, fairness and equity because these policies are not creating wealth for the arrivals and prevent the arrivals from raising fees and taxes.</div>
