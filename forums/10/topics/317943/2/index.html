Even Tycoon lee Ka Sing donated us 3.5 Million alone, 25 times of the whole SG’s donation. One Good thing, or rather smart thing Gov did was to send 55 SCDf members to go there boast up the polictical image of SG, well make use of Oppotunity.<br>And pls do not ask ppl to donate themselves if they want to donate more, Gov already took away so much of our $$ by <span>GST</span> and Taxes.</p>
              <p>Being stingy is not only abt donation issues, looking at the <span>GST</span> rebate that they give us. Do u all not remember who is the one that increase our <span>GST</span> after <span>PAP</span> won the election. It is like borrow $200 from us(long term, mayb more) and then giving us back $100. Pls open ur eyes and think ppl…U guys can do some research on <span>GST</span> and Economic rebate that different countries gives to its ppl. Even some smaller and poorer countries give more than our Gov did.</p>

              It is money minded...they have so much $ in hand and they keep on save and save. When it is time to help the people, they only take out a little bit..like the inflation now. What i expect is Billions to help..not thousands and millions..even a Big and poor country like Indonesia spent Billions to help the people from increased rice and oil prices..Being a smaller and Rich country, they dun really give us any help..:( Not only dun help, but they increase the price of road, public transport and GST..Damm.
