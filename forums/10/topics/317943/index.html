              <p>How come Singapore PR does not receieve any gst rebate? they serve NS, pay more for everything (housing, healthcare...), they pay the 7% gst for everything, yet they do not receieve any gst rebate.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Government is really Stingy . Being one of the Richest Government in the world. Even the GST rebate is too little for locals when comparing to other countries. And there is no help for the NS guys out there too from the Government. NS guys nowadays really suffer too much...</p>
              <p>The Government make use of ns guys' life to help in constructions,police, fireman,ambulance... so than they can save more $$ instead of hiring enough full time. When somethings goes wrong, eg, a criminal escape from DB.they punish the NS guys badly. Send them to DB...When NS guy dies, they just pay the parents $100000 for a life.</p>
              <p>Civil servant's pay here is also alot less than other countries. Be Doctors,police,teachers,lawyers...i wonder why is it so when the country is one of the richest in the world...</p>
              <p>My Conclusion is SG government is real Stingy to people, but not to their own salary.Singapore Government should reflect on themselves.</p>

              <p>Singapore Govt donates $200k to China for Earthquake victims !! That's about 5 cents per citizen/resident, I am sure they collect more GST from us in a single purchase. So much generosity from one of the world's richest nations..especially since our stellar GDP growth was made possible by trade with China and 70% of our population share the same ethnicity.</p>
              <p>Even Malaysia donated USD$1.5 million and Thailand $500k despite having poorer coffers. Is it right for Singapore, the richest SEA by a mile and biggest beneficiary of the China trade, to donate a sum that is equivalent to less than a month's pay of their Ministers? Even small countries like Ireland donated $1mil Euro (5-10x our sum!), despite having the same population as Singapore and with less connection to China.</p>
              <p>The Govt can spend billions buying broken banks but would only
              offer a tickle of that amount to help. My Govt has embarrassed me as a
              Singaporean, might as well don't donate..Sometimes, it's good to be prudent with money but being too stingy just makes one look really stupid and uncaring.</p>
              <p>This is probably in line with their nationwide no welfare stance. Hopefully one day when there's a disaster in Singapore, other nations will be more willing to help us than we were to help them! Good luck to us all!</p>

              <p>$2 million <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> $20 million <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"> $200 million <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p>Like <strong>Kramnave</strong> saids..... China don't need our money. They are richer than us in more ways. And that $200K doesn't include the cost of sending our 55 member Dart team over for search &amp; rescue. Or the other supply Govt is sending over......</p>
              <p>Btw..... IF the Govt <strong>did</strong> donate $20million ...... won't there be threads here condamning them for 'Wasting Taxpayer Money'.</p>

              <p>Singapore Govt donates $200k to China for Earthquake victims !!
              That's about 5 cents per citizen/resident, I am sure they collect
              more GST from us in a single purchase. So much generosity from one
              of the world's richest nations..especially since our stellar GDP
              growth was made possible by trade with China and 70% of our
              population share the same ethnicity.</p>
              <p>Even Malaysia donated USD$1.5 million and Thailand $500k despite
              having poorer coffers. Is it right for Singapore, the richest SEA
              by a mile and biggest beneficiary of the China trade, to donate a
              sum that is equivalent to less than a month's pay of their
              Ministers? Even small countries like Ireland donated $1mil Euro
              (5-10x our sum!), despite having the same population as Singapore
              and with less connection to China.</p>
              <p>The Govt can spend billions buying broken banks but would only
              offer a tickle of that amount to help. My Govt has embarrassed me
              as a Singaporean, might as well don't donate..Sometimes, it's good
              to be prudent with money but being too stingy just makes one look
              really stupid and uncaring.</p>
              <p>This is probably in line with their nationwide no welfare
              stance. Hopefully one day when there's a disaster in Singapore,
              other nations will be more willing to help us than we were to help
              them! Good luck to us all!</p>

              <p>China is super rich and dont need our money. Donating is just being politically polite.</p>
              <p>For Singapore if there is a disaster, we have over 300 Billion worth of reserves for us to use. Garmen is accumulating those reserves for this kind of purposes also.</p>

              <p>I thought the government was pretty generous in handling out GST rebate for her citizens to tie over the increment in GST. Well, perhaps the government is taking into consideration on taking care of her citizens as first priority before the PR. At least on my side, the government did fullfill their obligation to Singaporeans.</p>

              Really, SG Gov donated US 0.12 Million is a shame. Comparing with taiwan's US 80 Million and HKG 40Million. Even Tycoon lee Ka Sing donated us 3.5 Million alone, 25 times of the whole SG's donation. One Good thing, or rather smart thing Gov did was to send 55 SCDf members to go there boast up the polictical image of SG, well make use of Oppotunity. 
              And pls do not ask ppl to donate themselves if they want to donate more, Gov already took away so much of our $$ by GST and Taxes. 
              
              Being stingy is not only abt donation issues, looking at the GST rebate that they give us. Do u all not remember who is the one that increase our GST after PAP won the election. It is like borrow $200 from us(long term, mayb more) and then giving us back $100. Pls open ur eyes and think ppl...U guys can do some research on GST and Economic rebate that different countries gives to its ppl. Even some smaller and poorer countries give more than our Gov did.
              
              And one more thing is Civil servant(eg, police,fireman,doctors,lawyers...) Working for the Gov in SG is so un respectful just look at the salary comparing to other countries. I am not againist S'porean but just saying that SG Gov is stingy in many cases being the one of the richest Gov in the world.
              
              Of Cuz u can tell me go other countires if u dun like Gov here, of cuz i am going else where, but i pity those guys here. Girls in SG have good life, no doubt. Guys..i'm sorry
