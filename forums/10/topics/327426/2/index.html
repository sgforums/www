              <p>ya lor.</p>
              <p>i find the idea of increasing the population to compete with cities like HK is stupid.</p>
              <p>being a first class country doesn't mean that you need a big population, nor does it mean that you need more employment. if you want countries with big population with a big working population, look at china and india. clearly, these aren't the defining qualities of first-class countries.</p>
              <p>and no point in creating more low quality manufacturing jobs, when the economy had clearly been shifted to a service dominated one. why do you need to get foreign companies here to set up factories fully staffed by foreigners? i have no idea why.</p>
              <p>regarding FTs, how many of them are real talents? do we need these "talents"? are we short of people with these "talents"? do we need more foreign engineers when our local-produced engineers are left jobless? why are we getting more foreign doctors from universities less prestigious than NUS, and since there is clearly a shortage of doctors, why are we not training more local doctors? we need 500 more doctors a year, while NUS is only producing 200 of them annually. does that make sense? its not that singapore is unable to afford training more doctors, especially when the government is burning money away, treating the people's money like toilet paper, squandering it away.</p>
              <p>GIC had incurred a loss of over US$1bn, 30%-44% of the investment in the US banks (the figures are from Times magazine). and instead of carrying out protective measures to cut down losses, they pump in even more money into these failed banks. is it logical? it is equivilent to you lending money to a bankrupt who have nothing to offer you. and when you know that he is clearly unable to return you any money, you choose to lend him even more money.</p>
              <p>with the government busy burning away taxpayers' money at that rate, i can't see why they can't afford to train more local talents like doctors, which we have a real need for, or to increase public welfare. our elderly have to go coffeeshops to compete for drink cans, earning $10 per week. you may say that it promotes environmental awareness, but seriously, is this the proper way to treat our elderly?</p>
              <p>in other countries, the plate collectors at food courts, the toilet cleaners are all youngster. only in singapore can you see the elderly cleaning public toilets. can anyone here accept the idea of being a cleaner when you are old?</p>
              <p>the government always want to interfere with people's lives, regardless of whether it is proper for them to do so.</p>
              <p>Install ERPs at the heartlands, at chinatown. now those shops in those affected areas are going bankrupt one by one. is that good for the economy, is that good for the people? ERP tax goes straight to the government to be squandered away in dumb investments. when shops can't sustain and go bankrupt, not only does the government loses a source of income (the owner can no longer pay income tax), the owner also becomes unemployed, along with a bunch of other people. aggravating the unemployment rate.</p>
              <p>so to deal with rising unemployment, the government creates more crappy jobs, like cleaners, sweepers etc. which sane person would choose these jobs? the pay is enough for a foreign labourer to feed himself in singapore, with perhaps some money left over to send back home. here, $500 is not enough to feed a family of 4, where all 4 are living in singapore, where the cost of living is very high. so, no wonder 6/10 jobs created goes to foreigners. and what a big help that is.</p>
              <p>rgding organ trading, see that got money involve then want to kah jiao liao. if legalise organ trading, it will become easier for singaporeans to sell their organs, bringing about alot of unnecessary problem. if women can be forced into prostitution by loan sharks, do you think that loan sharks can't force people to sell their organ to repay debts?</p>
              <p>look at the newspaper reports of those third world farmers who sold their kidneys. the money they received was quickly spent, not really helping them. also, they lose 1 kidney <strong>permanently</strong>. in addition, they are weaken with only 1 kidney left, and more prone to illness, e.g. diabetes, kidney failure.</p>
              <p>do we want to see all that happening in singapore? better to keep it offshore, and leave the problem to other countries to handle. if people want to buy organs, and since it is for their survival, the government should close 1 eye.</p>
              <p>there is a limit to the people's tolerance for governmental interference into personal life.</p>

              <p>ya lor.</p>
              <p>i find the idea of increasing the population to compete with cities like HK is stupid.</p>
              <p>being a first class country doesn't mean that you need a big population, nor does it mean that you need more employment. if you want countries with big population with a big working population, look at china and india. clearly, these aren't the defining qualities of first-class countries.</p>
              <p>and no point in creating more low quality manufacturing jobs, when the economy had clearly been shifted to a service dominated one. why do you need to get foreign companies here to set up factories fully staffed by foreigners? i have no idea why.</p>
              <p>regarding FTs, how many of them are real talents? do we need these "talents"? are we short of people with these "talents"? do we need more foreign engineers when our local-produced engineers are left jobless? why are we getting more foreign doctors from universities less prestigious than NUS, and since there is clearly a shortage of doctors, why are we not training more local doctors? we need 500 more doctors a year, while NUS is only producing 200 of them annually. does that make sense? its not that singapore is unable to afford training more doctors, especially when the government is burning money away, treating the people's money like toilet paper, squandering it away.</p>
              <p>GIC had incurred a loss of over US$1bn, 30%-44% of the investment in the US banks (the figures are from Times magazine). and instead of carrying out protective measures to cut down losses, they pump in even more money into these failed banks. is it logical? it is equivilent to you lending money to a bankrupt who have nothing to offer you. and when you know that he is clearly unable to return you any money, you choose to lend him even more money.</p>
              <p>with the government busy burning away taxpayers' money at that rate, i can't see why they can't afford to train more local talents like doctors, which we have a real need for, or to increase public welfare. our elderly have to go coffeeshops to compete for drink cans, earning $10 per week. you may say that it promotes environmental awareness, but seriously, is this the proper way to treat our elderly?</p>
              <p>in other countries, the plate collectors at food courts, the toilet cleaners are all youngster. only in singapore can you see the elderly cleaning public toilets. can anyone here accept the idea of being a cleaner when you are old?</p>
              <p>the government always want to interfere with people's lives, regardless of whether it is proper for them to do so.</p>
              <p>Install ERPs at the heartlands, at chinatown. now those shops in those affected areas are going bankrupt one by one. is that good for the economy, is that good for the people? ERP tax goes straight to the government to be squandered away in dumb investments. when shops can't sustain and go bankrupt, not only does the government loses a source of income (the owner can no longer pay income tax), the owner also becomes unemployed, along with a bunch of other people. aggravating the unemployment rate.</p>
              <p>so to deal with rising unemployment, the government creates more crappy jobs, like cleaners, sweepers etc. which sane person would choose these jobs? the pay is enough for a foreign labourer to feed himself in singapore, with perhaps some money left over to send back home. here, $500 is not enough to feed a family of 4, where all 4 are living in singapore, where the cost of living is very high. so, no wonder 6/10 jobs created goes to foreigners. and what a big help that is.</p>
              <p>rgding organ trading, see that got money involve then want to kah jiao liao. if legalise organ trading, it will become easier for singaporeans to sell their organs, bringing about alot of unnecessary problem. if women can be forced into prostitution by loan sharks, do you think that loan sharks can't force people to sell their organ to repay debts?</p>
              <p>look at the newspaper reports of those third world farmers who sold their kidneys. the money they received was quickly spent, not really helping them. also, they lose 1 kidney <strong>permanently</strong>. in addition, they are weaken with only 1 kidney left, and more prone to illness, e.g. diabetes, kidney failure.</p>
              <p>do we want to see all that happening in singapore? better to keep it offshore, and leave the problem to other countries to handle. if people want to buy organs, and since it is for their survival, the government should close 1 eye.</p>
              <p>there is a limit to the people's tolerance for governmental interference into personal life.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>deathmaster<br><br>I sincerely thank you for bringing the discussion up one notch. You bring many fresh perpectives or old opinions rather but fresh insight into issues we face. <br><br>1) increasing population to compete with mega cities may bring higher income to the govt but it certainly does not bring about the quality of life. On the contrary, I believe deteriorating quality of life will result. Just look at HK will do.</p>
              <p>2) no point creating manufacturing jobs where the bulk of the workers are foreigners. It make no financial or economic sense. In fact I would rather the govt does the right thing. Take adv of the period of economic growth to restructure the whole economy. <br><br>Transform the economy into service industry like the way HK did. Firstly, by setting up 'think-tank's to seek out nich areas. Secondly, by setting up steering committee to plan, implement and nurture those potential areas.    <br><br>3) I agree with you on installing ERP at heartland. Only a brainless govt would do that, not a first class govt.</p>
              <p>The ERP system clearly stands out look a sore thumb for all to see. In fact, I think the ERP system has gone so cancerous that the bloody system needs a total overhaul. <br><br>Tell us that the road are jammed due to our blatant usage while the govt incessantly increases the population holds no water.<br><br>4) kidney trading epitomises the one lesson the PAP never learns. It should not and cannot always interfere into ppl life. Sometimes, the root of the problem is not the problem itself but the interferrer. <br><br>The issue of kidney trading should remain status quo, ie illegal in Singapore. But if the trader is caught - send to an arbitrator to deal with him and not thru' law. There are far too many grey areas, too many scenerios, too many variable factors for a single set of law to deal with it effectively. <br><br>Time to tell the PAP that they need some competition in parliament to make them perform better, else..... </p>
