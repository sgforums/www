              <p>So, Poh, what would you recommend? My rcommendation was that he seek out the best amongst his staff and convince him to take on the task, but with an out of this world pay but something that is not significant in the profits the company makes annually.</p>
              <p>What is your recommendation?</p>

              <p>Your lack of opinion towards my post only shows you don't have a better opinion to offer against mine.</p>
              <p>Trying to pass comments on me based on that is futile. It only exposes your own immaturity and self-enlarged ego like the topic starter.</p>
              <p>Being impolite to a girl anonymously online doesn't makes you a lion, it just makes you nothing more than a hyena.</p>
              <p>You are the answer to why many Singaporeans are displeased with their life, cos you're one of them. You should be able to answer your own questions.</p>
              <p>Your curiousity about me is not a concern of mine and will never be a concern of mine.</p>
              <p>The cause of your curiousity is because it's a fact that I am so much better than you, and very far beyond your reach.</p>
              <p>That's why guys like you will never stand a chance with a girl like me. Taking out your frustrations on me anonymously online will never change the fact about you in your real life.</p>
              <p>Go ahead and hurl your abuses at me if that will make you happier, but they will never reach me.</p>

              <p>Omg you are more dumb than I thought you are. Pathetic.</p>
              <p>Who will be interested in a dumb and spoilt brat like you? Omg you think too highly of yourself. Are you too ashamed of yourself in real life that you dream of someone will be interested in you online?</p>
              <p>Nowadays ladies expect gender equity. Then some of them, like you, still expect priviliges. It works in both ways and I am sorry to tell you that you dun deserved it at all.</p>
              <p>Another thing, I wasnt a one bit interested in you as a person. But your highly-charged egoistic comments do amused quite a few forumers.</p>
              <p><br>"The cause of your curiousity is because it's a fact that I am so much better than you, and very far beyond your reach." This just proven my point. You are nothing but an arrogant and egoistic little child.</p>
              <p>Wake up little girl. What a dumb and spoilt brat. Pathetic. I will stop wasting my time on you.</p>
              <p>Lastly, I din bother to answer your question is simply because I dun think your little brain got the capability to comprehend what I write.</p>

Why are some people tough enough to win over their tough times? These questions have never before been as important as they are today because we are going through some of the toughest times that our country has ever faced. We cannot merely talk about the strategies for success. We have to get down to hardcore principles that will work. And the only principles that we can believe in are principles that are tested, tried, and proven.<br><br>The first step will be to put your problems in proper perspective. Sure, you have problems. They may be the worst you've ever faced. But chances are they are not the worst thing that could possibly have happened. No matter how bad it is, it could always be worse. Be glad it's not. Put your problem in proper perspective. Stop making a mountain out of a mole hill.<br><br>Everybody has problems. No life is problem-free.<br><br>Now you must learn to solve and manage problems. And there <br>is not necessarily a solution for every problem; however every problem can be managed positively. .... To do so, it is necessary to take charge and control of your problems.<br><br>These times we're going through are tough, but if you are going to get through them, it's up to you. You must begin to act.<br><br>I say to you: you can do anything you want to do. You can be anything you want to be. You can go anywhere from where you are ----- if you are willing to dream big and work hard.</strong></span></p>
