              <p>I agree with u on tis statement</p>
              <p>Many years ago in tis forum, there is a different type of debate. It is about the malays complaining about the chinese. The Malays say the chinese "spoil the market" , they cannot compete with them, asking for help to deal with the problem saying they r the native of the land. Do u know how does the chinese singaporean reponse ? They literally say "f^%k u" and go back and work harder and blame them for being "lazy" and supporting anti competition and unfairness.</p>
              <p>Now the retribution had come. People r complaining like the malay do in the past. It is strange how people's point of view change dramatically when they r at the different end of the stick</p>

              <p>Secondly, ARE Lim Chin Siong, Ong Teng Cheong, and all those causeway motorists related to you? IF not, then it's also not your business to bring them out for your quarrels. In fact, people like you aren't even qualified to quote them cos they don't even KNOW you. So don't talk like people knows you when you're just a nobody, acting like somebody is only going to end up making a fool out of yourself.</p>
              <p>There is a reason why there wasn't a re-election in Bukit Batok, and you should get out of your chair once in a while to find out the reason. Nobody will feed you with answers if you do not have the desire to seek them out yourselves.</p>

              <p>I think I know what's your problem here, your parents failed to mate and that's why you were unable to born earlier?</p>
              <p>Why don't you hate your parents then? Should I go start a thread to talk about it?</p>

              <p>No place to run away to and yet still dare to talk so much about your Motherland, as a citizen of Singapore, Do you even have any shame for yourself? Do you even know shame?</p>

              <p>Perhaps u may have been over exposed to the US, Taiwanese and South Korean style of democracy. Look at those of Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg for example. People are happy there. There was a world happiness index done on nations around the world. Chk that out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for Gini coefficient, do a search on wiki pls. And pls look up singstats.gov.sg and see how our middle income class has stagnated the past ten years while the rich become richer. Compare that with other first world nations round the world. Even the US, with all its recession woes, does not fare any poorer than Sg.</p>

              <p>There are good foreigners and bad ones, similar to our human resources among Singaporeans. Can you say all Singaporeans are good employees and talents? You can't cos you know that there are some good employees/talents and plenty of bad, lazy, helpless, useless, expects to be spoon-fed and treated like a talent when they're not.</p>
              <p>Creativity and role learning depends on your own abilities, and you can't learn creativity. However, you can copy and improvise by learning from others' creativity in certain aspects of your work....we called that "experience" don't we?</p>
              <p>Ultimately it all boils down to your own individual abilities as a person in Singapore.</p>
              <p>IT's funny reading so many Singaporeans' complaining that they aren't spoon-fed sufficiently by the government and their educational system. And it seems that they have regarded those spoon-feeding as a normal, and guess what? Nope, it's not a normal, and it's a benefits for you being born and brought up in Singapore. Such behaviour is truly childish, like a child upset because he did not get the toy that he wanted or he felt that he deserved.</p>
              <p>And why do I feel that Singaporeans such as yourselves aren't able to survive outside Singapore on the world stage? It's because you are too dependable on the very government that you hated.</p>
              <p>Are you sure you are hating the correct target?</p>

              <p>I am perplexed and puzzled given that singaporeans made firm decisions not to have any opposition party win the parl for the last nearly 50 years in a row, why people here are believing they can do it the next time?</p>
              <p>Is the majority saying they prefer 1 party state?  Afterall, what is the effect of the 3 representatives from opposition in parl now?  What have they done?</p>
              <p>So, maybe, the next e, the people may really ensure a 1 party state, based on the last nearly 50 years of track record ?</p>
              <p>Wow, 1st world until like dat oso can.</p>
              <p>champions leh.</p>
              <p>maybe ask for second league to form a shadow?  TOC can you tell me? ha ha ha.</p>

              <p>I read tat hong kong had reached 0.525 and tat is in 2001. If u look at the chart, the gini rise especially within the last few years. Wat is the ranking of singapore compared with the whole world ? The later the data is, the more higher the country should rise. If u ask me, the data is not adequate enough to form a conclusion</p>

              <p>Just asking... why do we have to follow western influence and must follow their style of governance ? I just felt tat liberal democracy is over rated and once u r in, u cannot make important decisions and the country start to decline.</p>
