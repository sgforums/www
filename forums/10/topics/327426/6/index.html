              <p>And what exactly is 'the point' am i missing? Or are you alluding that there is more to the disparity in income gaps between the wealthy and the poor?</p>
              <p>This is not something that a statistical indicator can just be pulled out of the thin air and be claimed as an irrefutable fact, without looking deeper in the socia-economic strata of each nation which is vastly different for a homogenous apple to apple comparison.</p>
              <p>You would only get entangled in the numerous pitfalls of never ending debates on each socia-economic issue.</p>
              <p>Rather, if you want to compare our society's income gaps, i would suggest a reading up on our Dept of Statistics for relevant data, to support your thesis that there is indeed an income gap in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But my view on this issue is that:-</p>
              <p>a. ) To narrow the gap, Karl Marx vison is the best, with all drawing the same income with those in positions of responsibility drawing a slightly higher income, national wealth redistributed equally to all - leading to a stable society. </p>
              <p>But we know how it ended up eventually.</p>
              <p>b. ) USA from the 30s to the 60s experimented with high middle class. It suceeded, but after Vietnam war, it became everyman for himself/herself. The income gap grew wider each year till today, it is known as a winner society - winner takes all, the poor left to die on the wayside, to hell with social spending such as health care.</p>
              <p>These are factual realities you have to acknowledge in place of 'statistical indexes'.</p>
              <p>Singapore has chosen the USA of the 60s' path - high middle class. Till date, we had achieved an est.80% middle class drawing salaries between $3k to $5k /mth, with a wealthy class of only est 5% and a small poor group of below $3k a month(excluding commissions).</p>
              <p>This is not an ideal society yet to the vision of Karl Marx, and can be improved further, but still, it is a remarkable achievement for a nation state with NO natural resources except its citizens.</p>

              <p>Hail the Messiah....</p>

              <p>Kindly enlighten why S'pore has chosen this path of the US and not those the likes of Switzerland, Norway or Denmark. (whose citizens are happier, Gini coeff lower and whose policies our govt studies)</p>
              <p> </p>

U have already acknowledge tat the gov is performing better than other countries and r demanding more by comparing with the tip top countries tat even beat US and England. Well if u wanna compare with strictly on GINI, maybe singapore GINI is indeed worse than them. However take note tat singapore is still fundamentally different from these countries in terms of resources and economy and therefore its GINI loses out</p>

Nonono, we do not expect the govt to spoonfeed us...how can this be? We Chinese are an industrious lot. Put Koreans under one kind of system, u get poverty. Put it under the other, u get world brands like Samsung, Kia, Daewoo and Hyundai . The environment matters and it can't be done unless there's more democracy and opening up of the press.</p>

              <p>But by all means, hold on to your gini and see how many adherents you can convince. I am not stopping you. The critical issue and crux of the matter is - is there an income disparity in Singapore, a country of no natural resources except its people, or a self centred perception of envy that you cannot measure up to the wealthy in our society, which fortunately is based on merit - one's own sweat and toil after years. </p>

The critical issue and crux of the matter is - is there an income disparity in Singapore, a country of no natural resources except its people, or a self centred perception of envy that you cannot measure up to the wealthy in our society, which fortunately is based on merit - one's own sweat and toil after years. </p>

              <p>If u are really diligent enough, u would have researched the pay of waiters and pilots both here and in UK to verify my numbers. Plain obvious to me u didn't. I specifically mentioned $8k pounds and S$20k for pilot's pay. And research would have told u that $1k pounds and S$1k are basic waiter's pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pilot v Waiter - Rich-Poor divide....Gini coeff. Straightforward, isn't it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ha and I openly admit my lack of expertise on this matter and asked u what other forms of data besides Gini is good and u use metaphors. It's common knowledge what other forms of energy there are besides oil but can we say the same for Gini alternatives?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U have posted before : "One just can't qoute on the gini coefficient alone, for there are many other factors and quantiles which needs to be accounted for."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since u have proposed before that Gini alone cannot be used, then just plain tell me what other factors and quantiles which need to be accounted for and surely there must be <strong>something else</strong> which can support the evidence of income disparity among countries? I wanna learn too. I'm not even stubbornly holding on to Gini for dear life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is hardly even childish in the remotest sense of the word. I willing to listen and put my hand on my heart that I'm not playing any games with u.</p>

              <p>I love a good story now and then, for in its simplicity, it tells us much on the realities of life itself. None other than Aseop (620-560BC).</p>
              <p>He was a slave from Greece, subsequently freed and lived in the court of Croesus. He used the simplicity of fables to enable hardened hearts change their minds or at least consider the ramifications of their actions.</p>
              <p>His works were said to influence revered ancient philosophers whom much of our present critical thinking and conceptulisation are based upon, such as Socrates and Plato, Aristotle.</p>
              <p>I do believe one of his tales, the Goose that lay the golden eggs, is very much appropriate in these rather self centred times:-</p>
              <p><strong>A man and his wife had the good fortune to possess a goose which laid a golden egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it. Then, they thought, they could obtain the whole store of precious metal at once.but when they cut the goose open, they found it was like any other goose.</strong></p>
              <p><em>Moral:- Those who want too much lose everything</em></p>
              <p><em>Think before you act</em></p>
              <p>I would not force anything down anyone's throat, but hope that one may draw their own intelligent conclusion. We are  no longer as uneducated as the previous generation of post-independence Singapore. </p>

              <p>Poh, i have a problem that perhaps you can solve.</p>
              <p>My friend, Benny, formed a dot.com company in Singapore. He survived the crash of the '90s and was very successful, absolutely unreplaceable by any other software in this world and owned full rights to its use.</p>
              <p>His staff were all given stock options when he started, the only way he could get employers back then.</p>
              <p>Having sacrificed his time and years, he nows want to retire, to get a wife, have kids and enjoy the fruit of his labour, dedicate his time fullest to his progenies whom he love to have.</p>
              <p>Problem is, he couldn't find anyone to take his place. He tried:-</p>
              <p>a.)<strong>Promotion of staff</strong>:- None of the capable ones in his staff want his job, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is hectic, 24/7 daily, critical decisions only he can make, butt kissing</span> aplenty,etc. They are comfortable being system analysts, designers, artisans, etc, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">than to earn that miserable few hundreds more that his pay actually was</span>.</p>
              <p>b.)<strong>Foreign Talent</strong>:- His staff, worry about their own stock options being diluted, nor want to answer to a foriegner and his foreigness culture,  bayed for blood if he dare hires them.</p>
              <p>c.) <strong>Continue working</strong>:- He had enough and his biological urges are too strong to deny. He needs a break or his company will break up.</p>
              <p>d.) <strong>Fold up the company</strong>:- He thought of doing this, selling it away, to hell with what they do to the company and copyrights, then giving each of his staff dividends based on their stock options. Some of the more junior ones loved it, for with the money, they could enjoy a temporary wealth or join another company. But for the older ones, it is not enough to see them through their old age, and would not be hired by any company, not fair to these for they had helped him build up the company.</p>
              <p>So, Poh, what would you recommend? My rcommendation was that he seek out the best amongst his staff and convince him to take on the task, but with an out of this world pay but something that is not significant in the profits the company makes annually.</p>
              <p>What is your recommendation?</p>

              <p>In truth, are you evading the problem as well as the solution, by decry and arguing over texts? Then, be thankful it is me and rather, my friend's problem and not yours. But if you were in my position as a friend, or in a somewhat similiar situation in our society, what would you have done?</p>
