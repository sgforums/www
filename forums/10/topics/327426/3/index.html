You should be thankful of that, cos if you were born in another poorer country, you wouldn't even have the time nor the imagination to even try to picture the image of a better government, most probably you will be worrying about how to obtain your next meal and where to obtain your next water.</p>

              <p>I agree with u on tis statement</p>
              <p>Many years ago in tis forum, there is a different type of debate. It is about the malays complaining about the chinese. The Malays say the chinese "spoil the market" , they cannot compete with them, asking for help to deal with the problem saying they r the native of the land. Do u know how does the chinese singaporean reponse ? They literally say "f^%k u" and go back and work harder and blame them for being "lazy" and supporting anti competition and unfairness.</p>
              <p>Now the retribution had come. People r complaining like the malay do in the past. It is strange how people's point of view change dramatically when they r at the different end of the stick</p>

              <p>If you tried to mix the image of your ideal government with the
              perfectness of GOD, then it means you must had lived a relatively
              comfortable life since then. You should be thankful of that, cos if
              you were born in another poorer country, you wouldn't even have the
              time nor the imagination to even try to picture the image of a
              better government, <strong>most probably you will be worrying about how to
              obtain your next meal and where to obtain your next water.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>At least you don't need to worry about from
              which rubbish bin you are going to dig out your next meal, and
              from which longkang soup you are going to drink for your next
              meal.</strong></p>

              <p>Because, without the almighty GOVERNMENT, Singapore will be nothing but a hunter-gatherer society. <img src="http://www.gifshare.com/uploads/images/20060911/thumb/6751_rolleyes.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"></p>
              <p>You know, you should thank the government for the existence of poorer countries. How else can you stroke your pathetic ego if not for such idiotic comparisons? Go on, down on your bended knees now!</p>

              <p>AT least we have a government that doesn't make <strong>critical

              <p>Haven't you been following up on our country's politics with
                                      Malaysia a few years ago?</p>
              <p>Tell me you want Mahathir to run Singapore or even swap
                                      government with Malaysia.</p>
              <p>I would've imagine you hopping mad like a bunny if you were a

              <p>I don't grovel before my parents and thank them for EVERY SINGLE GOOD THING that has happened to me. Unlike your fellating of the almighty PAP.</p>
              <p>So now it's <strong>critical mistakes</strong> eh? I can probably give you a list of major PAP bloopers, but I'll bet that you, being the asslicker you are, will attempt to explain all of them away as being just <em>honest mistakes</em>.</p>
