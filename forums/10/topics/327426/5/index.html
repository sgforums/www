              <p>Singapore has a total population of 4 million of which 2.16 million are eligible to vote. Of these 2.16million, 1.14 million votes were collected in the last GE... because of electoral boundaries and walk overs.</p>
              <p>The current ruling party won 66.6% (according to their statistics). This translate to less than 18% of votes (total population) and 35.1% of votes (eligible voters). That's hardly a representation of resounding support.</p>
              <p>Of course, we will never know unless the government does away with electoral boundaries and walkovers; and everyone gets a chance to vote.</p>

              <p>If we constantly compare ourselves to people less well off, very soon we will be pulled down to their levels.</p>

              <p>There are good foreigners and bad ones, similar to our human resources among Singaporeans. Can you say all Singaporeans are good employees and talents? You can't cos you know that there are some good employees/talents and plenty of bad, lazy, helpless, useless, expects to be spoon-fed and treated like a talent when they're not.</p>
              <p>Creativity and role learning depends on your own abilities, and you can't learn creativity. However, you can copy and improvise by learning from others' creativity in certain aspects of your work....we called that "experience" don't we?</p>
              <p>Ultimately it all boils down to your own individual abilities as a person in Singapore.</p>
              <p>IT's funny reading so many Singaporeans' complaining that they aren't spoon-fed sufficiently by the government and their educational system. And it seems that they have regarded those spoon-feeding as a normal, and guess what? Nope, it's not a normal, and it's a benefits for you being born and brought up in Singapore. Such behaviour is truly childish, like a child upset because he did not get the toy that he wanted or he felt that he deserved.</p>
              <p>And why do I feel that Singaporeans such as yourselves aren't able to survive outside Singapore on the world stage? It's because you are too dependable on the very government that you hated.</p>
              <p>Are you sure you are hating the correct target?</p>

              <p>I can safely tell u that S'pore's Gini coeff can only worsen. It's not difficult to tell when the govt's policy over the past ten years has been to increase the population with cheap unskilled foreigners. Even skilled foreigners, for eg IT professionals from India and the likes are enough to suppress wage levels and cause a middle class stagnation.</p>

              <p>I can safely tell u that S'pore's Gini coeff can only worsen. It's not difficult to tell when the govt's policy over the past ten years has been to increase the population with cheap unskilled foreigners. Even skilled foreigners, for eg IT professionals from India and the likes are enough to suppress wage levels and cause a middle class stagnation</p>

              <p>As said before, the statistic can be questionable since the time frame is different for all countries. It is true tat singapore appears to be on the high side however 10 years ago it is already on the high side. The fact is, most countries r grappling with the rich poor divide and almost all countries have increased GINI over the years. Tis is a problem with capitalism and there is very real solution to it.</p>

              <p>'hypocrisy' and 'thinly veiled attacks' are merely your perceptions and shows your ungraciousness. Why the need for hostility?  I am not here to debate you, only to seek for better clarity in your rather ambigious rants. I leave you to your delusions.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
              <p>PS: a junior waiter in Spore earns $1000. ( do not forget the tips he would makes more) and would be promoted to senior waiter or annual increments if the establishment is small.  A junior SIA Singapore pilot earns an average $10,000 a month and nowhere near the '$20,000 a month you speak of, unless he has years of experience. And don't forget, it is often market forces that determines salaries.</p>

              <p>And what exactly is 'the point' am i missing? Or are you alluding that there is more to the disparity in income gaps between the wealthy and the poor?</p>
              <p>This is not something that a statistical indicator can just be pulled out of the thin air and be claimed as an irrefutable fact, without looking deeper in the socia-economic strata of each nation which is vastly different for a homogenous apple to apple comparison.</p>
              <p>You would only get entangled in the numerous pitfalls of never ending debates on each socia-economic issue.</p>
              <p>Rather, if you want to compare our society's income gaps, i would suggest a reading up on our Dept of Statistics for relevant data, to support your thesis that there is indeed an income gap in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But my view on this issue is that:-</p>
              <p>a. ) To narrow the gap, Karl Marx vison is the best, with all drawing the same income with those in positions of responsibility drawing a slightly higher income, national wealth redistributed equally to all - leading to a stable society. </p>
              <p>But we know how it ended up eventually.</p>
              <p>b. ) USA from the 30s to the 60s experimented with high middle class. It suceeded, but after Vietnam war, it became everyman for himself/herself. The income gap grew wider each year till today, it is known as a winner society - winner takes all, the poor left to die on the wayside, to hell with social spending such as health care.</p>
              <p>These are factual realities you have to acknowledge in place of 'statistical indexes'.</p>
              <p>Singapore has chosen the USA of the 60s' path - high middle class. Till date, we had achieved an est.80% middle class drawing salaries between $3k to $5k /mth, with a wealthy class of only est 5% and a small poor group of below $3k a month(excluding commissions).</p>
              <p>This is not an ideal society yet to the vision of Karl Marx, and can be improved further, but still, it is a remarkable achievement for a nation state with NO natural resources except its citizens.</p>

              <p>Singapore has a total population of 4 million of which 2.16 million are eligible to vote. Of these 2.16million, 1.14 million votes were collected in the last GE... because of electoral boundaries and walk overs.</p>
              <p>The current ruling party won 66.6% (according to their statistics). This translate to less than 18% of votes (total population) and 35.1% of votes (eligible voters). That's hardly a representation of resounding support.</p>
              <p>Of course, we will never know unless the government does away with electoral boundaries and walkovers; and everyone gets a chance to vote.</p>

              <p>Again an assumption and wild allegation on your part using figures. Just because you or those in walkover constituencies did not get to vote, you blame the ruling party and claim 'no chance to vote'?</p>
              <p>Are the opposition parties so unattractive that they fail to attract citizens to join their cause? Had you, complaining here, do something constructive instead and join them yourself? Opposition parties are supposed to form a new govt, to push their reforms. If they cannot even field candidates, are they then capable of forming govt or even fulfilling citizens' expectations?</p>
              <p>I am only a citizen, not affliated with any political parties, writing this post.</p>

              <p>'hypocrisy' and 'thinly veiled attacks' are merely your perceptions and shows your ungraciousness. Why the need for hostility?  I am not here to debate you, only to seek for better clarity in your rather ambigious rants. I leave you to your delusions.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
              <p>PS: a junior waiter in Spore earns $1000. ( do not forget the tips he would makes more) and would be promoted to senior waiter or annual increments if the establishment is small.  A junior SIA Singapore pilot earns an average $10,000 a month and nowhere near the '$20,000 a month you speak of, unless he has years of experience. And don't forget, it is often market forces that determines salaries.</p>
              <p>An error on your part or a deliberate misrepresentation to support your biased view?</p>

              <p>I am still waiting to be enlightened what other forms of data we may use to determine income gap besides the Gini. Much appreciated.</p>

              <p>And what exactly is 'the point' am i missing? Or are you alluding that there is more to the disparity in income gaps between the wealthy and the poor?</p>
              <p>This is not something that a statistical indicator can just be pulled out of the thin air and be claimed as an irrefutable fact, without looking deeper in the socia-economic strata of each nation which is vastly different for a homogenous apple to apple comparison.</p>
              <p>You would only get entangled in the numerous pitfalls of never ending debates on each socia-economic issue.</p>
              <p>Rather, if you want to compare our society's income gaps, i would suggest a reading up on our Dept of Statistics for relevant data, to support your thesis that there is indeed an income gap in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But my view on this issue is that:-</p>
              <p>a. ) To narrow the gap, Karl Marx vison is the best, with all drawing the same income with those in positions of responsibility drawing a slightly higher income, national wealth redistributed equally to all - leading to a stable society. </p>
              <p>But we know how it ended up eventually.</p>
              <p>b. ) USA from the 30s to the 60s experimented with high middle class. It suceeded, but after Vietnam war, it became everyman for himself/herself. The income gap grew wider each year till today, it is known as a winner society - winner takes all, the poor left to die on the wayside, to hell with social spending such as health care.</p>
              <p>These are factual realities you have to acknowledge in place of 'statistical indexes'.</p>
              <p>Singapore has chosen the USA of the 60s' path - high middle class. Till date, we had achieved an est.80% middle class drawing salaries between $3k to $5k /mth, with a wealthy class of only est 5% and a small poor group of below $3k a month(excluding commissions).</p>
              <p>This is not an ideal society yet to the vision of Karl Marx, and can be improved further, but still, it is a remarkable achievement for a nation state with NO natural resources except its citizens.</p>
