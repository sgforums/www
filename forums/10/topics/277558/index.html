That way we can all progress with the appropriate checks and balances. And the only laws and policies that will pass are those that can convince at least 5% of the opposition parties.<br><br>The opposition aren't interested in taking over the entire goverment as much as they are interested in preventing a single party to do as it pleases with scant regard for the people.<br><br>Generally, people have the misconstrued idea that the opposition is there to oppose all of the PAP's policies. This is not true. If the policies are good and beneficial, why would they even oppose to it? It's about Singapore. Not about the Parties. But to PAP, it's about PAP - PAP is Singapore.<br><br>To answer the topic, if its simply to get rid of PAP, yes they would have allied long ago to get rid of it. But its about the people. And what is good and beneficial for the people. And in that they have differing views, so they aren't in alliance as yet.</div>

Do you think Singapore will be a better place if we dont have a dominant political party like PAP? </div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>Just curious if there is any country in the world where political parties unite to take on bigger players despite having differences.<br><br>In US and UK for example, although two parties instead of one party dominate the politics there, their citizens who do not support either one have no strong channel to go to. And these countries have more than 200 opposition parties excluding the dominant two, compared to 5 - 6 active opposition parties in Singapore.<br><br>In a way, more political parties may mean more diverse choices.<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Jontst78:</div><div class="quote_body">falling out, 2 cases I can remember, tho not in detail<br><br>SDP, Chiam was heading the party. Chee was a I think a more snr member then. Chee wrote a paper or article or something, chaim told him to "self censor" the article, and the disagreement started from there I think. The facts in a blur now, might do some digging later. Anyway, like my earlier post, hence SDA and SDP forming an alliance, not a realistic probability in the near future.<br><br>Low got JBJ ousted from WP, so well JBJs DRP and WP forming an alliance, not a realistic probability in the near future either.<br><br>Stand to be corrected, if anyone has more details information to share on the above incidents. </div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>According to my memory of official records, Chee joined the SDP and rose quickly to become Chiam's assistant SG. He was sacked from NUS for using research funds for his wife's thesis and wanted to protest against this (and not that he wrote a paper or article). Chiam offered him a place in Potong Pasir but he wanted to do it on NUS grounds. Chiam proposed that the SDP CEC censure and stop him but the CEC voted against the proposal. Chiam then resigned as SG, which also excludes him from the CEC. At the next CEC meeting, the CEC appointed Chee as acting SG. Later, Chiam spoke negatively against the party and was expelled from SDP. He fought the decision in court and won and was reinstated as a member.<br><br>For the WP, according to official records, JBJ had wanted WP to raise funds to clear his bankruptcy. Low and the WP CEC then disagreed as raising funds in such a manner was illegal. They also did not agree to using the existing party funds to clear him as they felt it was for the party purpose and not for an individual, whether leader or member. At the following CEC conference / election, JBJ did not attend, meaning that the SG post would be vacated. Low then ran for it unopposed (and not that he ousted or contested against JBJ and won). Later, JBJ resigned from the party altogether citing differences (as opposed to Chiam's resigning only as a leader while remaining as a member).<br><br>The above is subjected to corrections.<br><br>Regards</div>
