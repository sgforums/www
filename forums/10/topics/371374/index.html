              <p>So it seems that Atobe can only twist and turn basic simple English into gibberish. Trading is of course selling products for monetary benefit, so Trading in Humans means selling Humans for money. Of course, any Singaporean above the age of four years old should known that my posting is terms of linguistic irony. Members of Sgforums all know Atobe is just a low-iq son of a bitch who can only bitch in theorectical politics while dreaming of a militant revolution in Singapore. So here's the low-down for you: Atobe can go on sucking CSJ's poor little penis and his theories of civil disobedience, while the rest of the Singaporeans are worrying and planning for Singapore's future in the expanding global inflation of the international market.</p>

              <p>With Singapore having no other natural resources except for

                      - can Singapore redirect the focus on growth by
                      having policies to accelerate economic growth through domestic
                      consumption ?</p>

                      reliance </a>is that Singapore will always be subjected to the
                      swings of economic fortunes from other trading nations.</p>
              <p>Kenneth Jeyaratnam had asked - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.thereformparty.net/?p=179">’Will this be
                      Singapore’s Lost Decade ?’ </a></p>
              <p>In his view -  <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"<span><span style="line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;">As a
                      city-state of 4.5 million people depending heavily on trade in
                      goods and services, Singapore is highly vulnerable to external
                      shocks. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A larger
                      population would enable the country to build domestic demand to
                      help balance fluctuations in external demand</span>. Besides,
                      export-oriented services targeted for expansion such as tourism,
                      entertainment, health care, and education would benefit from a
                      larger domestic market that would help increase scale and thus
                      lower costs. The Government is planning for a substantial increase
                      in population; it has revised its long-term population projection
                      in its planning framework from 5.5 million to 6.5
                      million.</span></span>"</span></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the brilliance of one "swei-siao hog" in this Speaker's
                      Corner - with an IQ of 2 but need 3 to grunt - since
                      human resource is the only natural resource - it will be brilliant
                      to see Singapore indulging in "Human Trading" by bringing in
                      more immigrants to boost the population size in Singapore from 4.5
                      million to 6.5 million.</p>
              <p> Is it impossible for the Singapore Government to
                      <em>"accumulate annual surplus when international inflation rate
                      exceeds local minimum liviable wage"</em> ?</p>
              <p>The Singapore PAP Government has assured that the
                      <a rel="nofollow" href="http://app.mti.gov.sg/default.asp?id=148&amp;amp;articleID=15022">“MAS will adopt a policy of targeting a modest
                      policy to maintain price stability for sustained economic growth.
                      In setting the exchange rate policy, the MAS seeks to strike the
                      right balance between inflation and growth
                      considerations.” </a></p>
              <p>With such an assurance given, will it be impossible for the
                      present modest domestic economic activities to be further

              <p>Has anyone really considered why are the implications of growth
              fueled by consumption? In a world with finite resources, our
              so-called economic growth through consumption is merely short-term
              gratification with production of goods solely for profit with no
              thought for the environmental (See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/">Story of Stuff</a>),
              not to mention psychological impact on society.</p>
              <p>To quote from an article from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17569-consumerism-is-eating-the-future.html">The New Scientist</a>:</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p><em>But there's another, more recent factor that's
              making things even worse, and it's <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>an invention of human culture rather than
              an evolved trait.</strong></span> According to Rees, the change
              took place after the second world war in the US, when factories
              previously producing weapons lay idle, and soldiers were returning
              with no jobs to go to.</em></p>
              <p><em>American economists and the government of the day
              decided to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>revive economic
              activity by creating a culture in which people were encouraged to
              accumulate and show off material wealth, to the point where it
              defined their status in society and their
              self-image.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em>Rees quotes economist Victor Lebow as saying in
              1955: "Our enormously productive economy demands that we make
              consumption our way of life, that <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">we convert the buying and use of goods into
              rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego
              satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up,
              worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing
              rate".</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em>In today's world, such rhetoric seems beyond
              belief. Yet the consumer spree carries on regardless, and few of us
              are aware that we're still willing slaves to a completely
              artificial injunction to consume, and to define ourselves by what
              we consume.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Lebow and his cronies got together to 'create' the
              modern advertising industry, which plays to primitive beliefs,"
              says Rees. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"It makes you feel
              insecure, because the advertising industry turned our sense of
              self-worth into a symbolic presentation of the possessions we
              have," he told me. "We've turned consumption into a necessity, and
              how we define ourselves."</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The result is a world in which rampant consumption
              in rich countries is rapidly outstripping the resources in the
              world needed to satisfy demand.</em></p>
              <p><em>...</em></p>
              <p><em>"Advertising is an instrument for construction of
              people's everyday reality, so we could use the same media to
              construct a cultural paradigm in which conspicuous consumption is
              despised," he says. "We've got to make people ashamed to be seen as
              a 'future eater'."</em></p>
