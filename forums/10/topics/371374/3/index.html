              <p>If all social systems are always in a state of
              evolution due to "change which is a constant in Life" -
              what do you think is the purpose for such changes to be made that
              result in evolution ?</p>
              <p>Has the need for constant change and evolution to occur not been
              a result of society's need to progress and improve - in
              pursuit of betterment in Life ?</p>
              <p>Is it not part of man's idealism for  a perfect world, or
              somewhere closer to it ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been your stated or
              implied position for such a perfect world to exist - where
              human consumption find an equilibrium with the preservation of
              nature's available resources ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the clear detailing of the oxymoron system that
              you had described, what is the next best alternative to resolve the
              status quo ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can anyone in Singapore know what the Singapore Government
              has in mind, when all decisions are made in the cloistered and
              rarefied environment of fhe CEC ?</p>
              <p>The consumerist culture was already spoken as
              early as 1981 - by one of the most intellectual
              of Singapore's founding father - the late S. Rajaratnam,
              who was the longest serving Singapore Foreign Minister - when
              he spoke at a Havard Club Anniversary Dinner in Singapore.</p>
              <p>You may wish to delve into his speech about - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://stars.nhb.gov.sg/stars/tmp/SR19811208s.pdf">“Happy Pigs and Unhappy Men (*1)” </a>- and
              determine for yourself the state of the Singapore Government
              today.</p>
              <p> In his retirement in 1988, he spoke out against the
              materialistic culture in Singapore, when he spoke out at
               <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tamilnation.org/hundredtamils/rajaratnam.htm">‘...the decline of intellectualism and clear thinking,
              and was troubled by the phenomenon – which he attributed the
              decline with its underlying dynamic being a global one and formed
              part of the sweeping tide of history. It is the undesired
              consequences of steady economic growth, technological progress, and
              the burgeoning raw consumer culture which drives societies today
              and has help spawn its attendant shallow materialism’.

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did Karl Marx and-or Lenin attempt to do away
              with the monetary system, or were their underlying philosophy being
              a struggle for a Class-less and Equitable Society ?</p>
              <p>Without a monetary system, can any society develop to a higher
              level based purely on a system of bartering goods and
              services ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regretably, I am amazed at the 'wishy-washy' position that you
              have adopted in this wasteful and supposedly intellectual
              exercise.</p>
              <p>Mankind has evolved over centuries to arrive at the most
              efficient form of transaction of economic exchanges
              between societies, and it is with disbelief to read
              your claim that <em>"<span style="color: #0000ff;">regulating
              the distribution</span></em> [of resources] <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">through money would be ridiculous,
              retarded (impeding social progress) and irrelevant to human
              survival</span>".</em></p>
              <p>Have you ignored that all economic activity
              - and the resources that you recognised to be finite
              - will need to be determined in one form or another in
              terms of priorities ?</p>
              <p>Without the element of "PROFITABILITY" and "MONETARY VALUATION"
              as tools for measurement - how would you propose to allocate
              resources - even if you desire to produce the
              synthetic alternatives for your proposed solution ?</p>
              <p>Did you miss out the part mentioned in my response that
              legislations will have to be effected in parallel with social
              education - to nudge, incentivise, or as punitive measures - to
              have all parties act responsibly to preserve the environment when
              acting in their respective roles as consumers, manufacturers, and
              natural resource producers ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Story of Stuff presents only a narrow central
              theme - can it be the holy grail panacea for the
              reconciliation of man and its environment ?</p>
              <p>Did it offer any workable alternative for societies to
              advance forward towards the ideal standards for mankind in this
              21st Century, and into the future ?</p>
              <p>Questions still remain unanswered as to how to priorities
              and allocate the use of the finite resources as the
              various communities go about their economic activities,
              and to protect the environment at the same time.</p>

              <p>Would it be too much to ask if you could make statements addressing my claims rather than post questions in return? Maybe you're ironically trying to make me think from your perspective, but communication will remain unclear at this rate since I can only imply what're you trying to drive at.</p>
              <p>Let me clarify, there is no such states of society as "utopia" because as I've said, all systems are in a state of evolution. While you may be right that we always strive towards an ideal, it means that society should always keep improving. That being said, no where in this thread did I once refer to "utopia" or "perfect world", only a better world where the human well-being is placed first.</p>
              <p>Having established this, after thousands of years using the monetary system and having access to so much information via the Internet, I do not see how anyone could come to the conclusion that it is the "most efficient form of transaction of economic exchanges
              between societies". Not only is a billion people, and likely more, starving everyday, but 34,000 children are dying each day from preventable causes, which could be solved with present-day technology. Why? Probably because they lack access to the necessities of life due to poverty. Surely its time for Mankind to transcend the monetary system, removing it because abundance through technology makes it unnecessary to regulate distribution that perpetuates suffering round the world.</p>
              <p>I've already presented the alternative, a world without money- a concept presented in<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT-2fenmLnc"> Zeitgeist Addendum</a> Perhaps you cannot even fathom it because of your conditioning. I'll give you a couple of examples in energy. In 2006, MIT reported that present technology then could extract 4,000 years worth of energy. Today, the amount of energy that we receive from the Sun in 6 hours could power the Earth for a year. <a href="http://www.desertec.org/en/">Just by harnassing three thousandths of the world's deserts would give the world an abundance of energy.</a> And that's just two avenues of renewable energy. In a world where energy is so abundant, wouldnt it be inhumane to continue to charge for it? That's just like charging for air or sea water. While our world was based on scarcity, thus requiring a monetary system, circumstances are different today which justifies a need for a different social system in order to drive social evolution. <strong>You have to move away from the mentality that even in a society of abundance, people will still have to work/pay in some form or another, for the necessities of life.</strong></p>
              <p>In addition, when the monetary system is removed, many sub-institutions also vanishes along with it because they largely help to regulate peoples' behaviour in a monetary system, the legal system, the political system, the educational system. It is a redesign of a culture. With that, it is important to understand that the first step to evolution is not some tangible manifestation, some new technology, but first, an evolution in consciousness.</p>
              <p><em>"The old
                        appeals to racial, sexual and religious chauvinism and to rabid
                        nationalism are beginning not to work. <strong>A new consciousness is
                        developing which sees the earth as a single organism and recognizes
                        that an organism at war with itself is doomed. We are one planet.</strong>"</em></p>
              <p>- Carl Sagan, <a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/sagan_cosmos_who_speaks_for_earth.html">Cosmos: Who Speaks for the Earth</a></p>
              <p>I will not bother with claims this is communism; if you took the time to fully understand this concept, its merely about bettering the human well-being with the tools that we have; in your words the "pursuit of betterment in Life"  It has completely no bearing on Marxist/ Leninist or any other label that you want to paste on it, which divides people because of the different associations they have.</p>
              <p>While I agree with Rajaratnam, the reason why people are not well-informed; in fact informed people are considered the exception rather than the norm, is because of our culture created by the monetary system- the perpetuation of a consumeristic society. In that sense, The Story of Stuff reveals the flaws of such a society. But for a solution, Zeitgeist Addendum provides the best that I've seen. How else can you get people to think outside of their frames of reference if they are perpetually bombarded with messages that promote insecurity and are conditioned to remedy it with material objects?</p>
              <p><em>"The average person in the U.S. watches about four hours of television each day. Over the course of a year, we see roughly twenty-five thousand commercials, many of them produced by the world’s highest paid cognitive psychologists. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Their job is to figure out how to grab our attention and make us feel deficient if we don’t own their clients’ products. And these heavily produced advertisements are not merely for products, but for a lifestyle based on a consumer mind-set.</strong> </span>What they’re doing, day in and day out, twenty-five thousand times a year, is <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>hypnotizing us into seeing ourselves as consumers who want to be entertained rather than as citizens who want to be informed and engaged.

              <p>Are you not indulging in fantasy to accept a concept presented in your Zeitgeist Addendum that is at best an adolescent revolt against the established order - towards a system that has been refined through more then a thousand years of evolution in the History of Mankind ?</p>
              <p>Are you not being simplistic to place in a nutshell that poverty is due to a "lack of access to the necessities of Life" - and place the blame on the monetary system ?</p>
              <p>Did you not discern the reasons or causes for such countries facing poverty that remained unable to transcend from their status quo, and have the ingenuity to find those resources to meet the needs of that community suffering poverty ?</p>
              <p>Just look at the poverty suffered in North Korea compared to the wealth and abundance in South Korea - was the poverty in the North due to the failure of the monetary system ? Was there any lack to the access to technology, or was the absence of technology being imposed deliberately by its Political Leadership ?</p>
              <p>There are abundant reasons and causes for poverty to exist, and without being racist in making the following statements - some communities are less developed, less enterprising, less industrious, less energetic, less in everything compared to their more advance cousins in other ethnic communities.</p>
              <p>Could genetics be the cause for the poverty, or was it due largely to God's dealing a sleight of hand in putting some ethnic communities in some God-forsaken place as a test for the "chosen people" to survive in God's carefully chosen ways ?</p>
              <p>Some of these communities are the Australian aboriginese, the African bushmen, and the lost tribes in the jungles in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Irian Jaya, and countless others.</p>
              <p>Do these communities possess any semblance of a monetary system breakdown to cause their present conditions ?</p>
              <p>Can they be considered poor by any standards ?</p>
              <p>These are the special ethnic groups that form basic primitive communities that do not destructively consumed nature's gifts in order to survive.</p>
              <p>Should the 21st Century Homo Sapien accustomed to the evolution in modernity revert back to the Stone Age of these primitive tribesmen ?</p>

              <p>I will not bother with claims this is communism; if you took the time to fully understand this concept, its merely about bettering the human well-being with the tools that we have; in your words the "pursuit of betterment in Life"  It has completely no bearing on Marxist/ Leninist or any other label that you want to paste on it, which divides people because of the different associations they have.</p>

              <p>While I agree with Rajaratnam, the reason why people are not well-informed; in fact informed people are considered the exception rather than the norm, is because of our culture created by the monetary system- the perpetuation of a consumeristic society. In that sense, The Story of Stuff reveals the flaws of such a society. But for a solution, Zeitgeist Addendum provides the best that I've seen. How else can you get people to think outside of their frames of reference if they are perpetually bombarded with messages that promote insecurity and are conditioned to remedy it with material objects?</p>

              <p>If you noticed - I have actually dissected your reply
                  into the relevant paragraphs that had addressed your separated
                  claims, and from which I made my statements through the
                  questions asked that were intended to have your focus on the issues
                  in your reply.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The intelligent and energetic Homo Sapien will always never
                  be satisfied with the status quo, and will always
                  make situations and systems evolve to reach some
                  kind of nirvana or utopic state, and after being bored will strive
                  again to the next level.</p>
              <p>Should it be necessary for you to
                  be explicit in refering to "utopia" or "perfect
                  world" for anyone to discern what you had intended ?</p>
              <p>Can there be a better world where the human well-being is placed
                  first ?</p>
              <p>In the process of evolution through human effort or through the
                  normal passage of time - would that "better world" not be a
                  "perfect world" compared to the present one ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are you not indulging in fantasy to accept
                  a concept presented in your Zeitgeist Addendum that is at best
                  an adolescent revolt against the established order
                  - towards a system that has been refined through
                  more then a thousand years of evolution in the History of Mankind
                  ?</p>
              <p>Are you not being simplistic to place in a nutshell that poverty
                  is due to a "lack of access to the necessities of Life" - and place
                  the blame on the monetary system ?</p>
              <p>Did you not discern the reasons or causes for such
                  countries facing poverty that remained unable
                  to transcend from their status quo, and have the
                  ingenuity to find those resources to meet the needs of that
                  community suffering poverty ?</p>
              <p>Just look at the poverty suffered in North Korea compared to the
                  wealth and abundance in South Korea - was the poverty in the North
                  due to the failure of the monetary system ? Was there
                  any lack to the access to technology, or was the absence
                  of technology being imposed deliberately by its Political
                  Leadership ?</p>
              <p>There are abundant reasons and causes for poverty to
                  exist, and without being racist in making the following statements
                  - some communities are less developed, less enterprising, less
                  industrious, less energetic, less in everything compared to their
                  more advance cousins in other ethnic communities.</p>
              <p>Could genetics be the cause for the poverty,
                  or was it due largely to God's dealing a
                  sleight of hand in putting some ethnic communities in
                  some God-forsaken place as a test for the "chosen people" to
                  survive in God's carefully chosen ways ?</p>
              <p>Some of these communities are the Australian aboriginese, the
                  African bushmen, and the lost tribes in the jungles in Brazil,
                  Papua New Guinea, Irian Jaya, and countless others.</p>
              <p>Do these communities possess any semblance of a monetary system
                  breakdown to cause their present conditions ?</p>
              <p>Can they be considered poor by any standards ?</p>
              <p>These are the special ethnic groups that form basic
                  primitive communities that do not destructively consumed
                  nature's gifts in order to survive.</p>
              <p>Should the 21st Century Homo Sapien accustomed to the
                  evolution in modernity revert back to the Stone Age of
                  these primitive tribesmen ?</p>

              <p>Why dont you answer your own questions yourself and justify them instead of asking me? I believe this will bring your points across more clearly.</p>
              <p>I absolutely agree with your point on the constant evolution of our species, and it is on that note that I say that we have the capability and resources to create a substantially better world than today with the abolishing of the monetary system. That would be a world where the human well-being is placed first, without the constrains of making a profit or struggling to preserve the self.</p>
              <p>If you understood this concept accurately, you wouldnt say that a better world would mean a perfect one. While that would seem perfect from the perspective of the typical, uninformed person, even that so-called perfect world would be improved over time, unlike our own, constrained by the inertia of cost. This remains true of human civilisation throughout history. At any specific point in time, people have considered themselves at the zenith of development, naturally to be dwarfed by future progress.</p>
              <p>Moreover, do you seriously believe that our culture is not the least affected by the billions of dollars and millions of hours spent on advertisements across the spectrum of media available today? What about its effects on society? On how it is moulding the mindsets of millions of people? Making the claim that abolishing money would be extremely idealistic to you; naturally, because you cannot imagine anything outside of that frame of reference in a world where anything outside of earning a livelihood is deemed impractical, but ignoring the vast advertising industry is just plain naive.</p>
              <p>May I know if you have watched The Story of Stuff and Zeitgeist Addendum, more so for Addendum? Because if you haven't, don't say its flawed when its your own understanding about it that is flawed.</p>

              <p>If there was any answer given it was not clearly discernible - what is your answer to this and other questions made in my previous postings ?</p>
              <p>How did you come to the conclusion that "rigid ego association with those same beliefs" will prevent acceptance of the changes as propounded by your "Zeitgeist : Addendum" ? </p>
              <p>From the discussion between Alex Jones and Peter Joseph - it seems that there will be "Zeitgeist : Addendum TWO" to correct some "weaknesses" in the first edition.</p>
              <p>While it has been identified that "money" corrupts - it remains to be the established and most efficient form of exchange between different communities that has been perfected constantly over the entire history of the Homo Sapien on earth.</p>
              <p>While it has been known that "Profit" can prevent more efficient implementation of scientific discoveries - it remains to be the most "optimum arbiter tool" in determining the use of finite resources for the needs of the Homo Sapien.</p>
              <p>As in all things, these are open to abuse - do we "throw out the baby with the dirty bath water from the basin" ?</p>
              <p>As much as there are positive aspects propounded by Peter Joseph in his conviction of the Zeitgeist:Addendum - the danger of his message is that the Social Order or Organisation of Society that we are familiar today will need to be structurally change.</p>
              <p>To replace the current Social Order - Zeitgeist : Addendum propose a new World Structure that features a flat social organisation of equal Homo Sapiens, where decisions are centrally made for the needs of the population of the world, where corporation do not exist but are replaced by commonly owned productive assets.</p>
              <p>How does national assets within sovereign territorial boundaries be renegotiated in a new World Order ?</p>
              <p>Can a unified global flat social organisation of equal Homo Sapiens exist that will surmount national and human instincts ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I had said before - your recommended 'Zeitgeist : Addendum' is "good for empty minds that needs filling - subject to such minds remaining malleable during the process".</p>

              <p>It may interest you to know that I have gone through all 13
                      parts - each averaging 10 minutes plus; and I have even gone

              <p>It is interesting to note that "my" questions were
                      asked by Alex Jones to Peter Joseph, and I remain unconvinced to
                      the viability of The Solution in settling the global problems faced
                      today.</p>
              <p>As much as the ideas are clearly expressed - they remain
                      simplistically idealistic and disconnect with reality in
                      the implementation stage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No, you were not deriding any social system in your
                      statement concerning the people acheiving the zenith of their
                      development at any specific point in time, only to be dwarfed
                      by future progress.  </p>
              <p>Is the desire for a better world and the journey
                      strived not similar to the eargerly hoped
                      for 'Utopia' ?</p>
              <p>Can the Homo Sapien ever be static, ever be satisfied
                      - even with "Utopia" attained ?</p>
              <p>Is the insatiable desire of the Homo Sapien not a reality -
                      even dealing with "Utopia" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If what you claim is true, why is there
                      no community or even national actions taken against
                      Bayer ?</p>
              <p>In 1984, the MNC Union Carbide that
                      manufacture Eveready batteries was hauled to court
                      by the Indian Government, and a parallel Class Action was
                      taken by the victims of the industrial accident in
                      Bhopal, India. The outcome was successful for the claims
                      made.</p>
              <p>It will be unbelieveable if the European and Asian Governments
                      will not take action against Bayer.  </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>'Zeitgeist : Addendum' is advocating a total redesign of
                      society that includes the call for change in present
                      attitudes in the dependence of the use of money, the removal of the
                      profit system in all aspect of human
                      endeavor due to its corrupting influences.</p>
              <p>This will practically require the Human Society as we know it
                      today - to return to the lives of the Lost Tribes that
                      lived without any knowledge of the use of money nor

              <p>Yes, I am familiar with the Jones-Joseph interview. Its a waste that
                      Alex Jones chose to behave in a childish way since both movements have
                      plenty in common.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I apologise for assuming that you did not watch Zeitgeist Addendum since you made it clear you did.</p>
              <p>I
                      believe the usage of the terms "utopia" and "evil" was addressed during
                      the first or second part of the interview. One obstacle to clear
                      communication today is the using of such words which has numerous
                      definitions based on peoples' own associations with them. Not only does
                      this make those words (such as "democracy", "freedom" or "liberty")
                      meaningless, but they are counterproductive in any discussion because
                      of the emotion they stir up. And so I state this again, <strong>there can never be an "utopia" in existence.</strong></p>
              <p>However,
                      if you have to be stubborn about it, I'll put it this way. "When people
                      wish to improve, they strive towards perfection." Although "perfection"
                      doesnt exist, it sums up the process towards progress, though that does
                      not mean there is a final frontier. In the same way, you could state
                      that "Society strives towards utopia in pursuit of a better world". But
                      in reality, society improves as progress is made in the fields of
                      technology, healthcare etc. The "utopia" here refers to <strong>an improved state of a dynamic society</strong>. But even then, using "utopia" would not be using it according to its prevalent definition and is semantically wrong.</p>
              <p>There's no "If its true.." because it really happened. <strong>This
                      comes as a shock to me since this story is at least 2 years old. If
                      your news sources didnt cover this story, definitely more serious than
                      Michael Jackson's death, I suggest you turn to more relevant and
                      informed sources.</strong> Some media sources are propagated to maintain the status quo, others are here to inform. A good place would be <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca">GlobalResearch</a>.
                      And yes, I'm glad you are questioning why nothing is being done and why
                      no one is being held accountable because thats the same question I
                      would like answered in the mainstream media.</p>
              <p>Another such incident took place at least 6 months ago, on a more serious scale when <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/025760_pandemic_avian_flu_flu_virus.html">Baxter
                      International shipped vaccine material contaminated with the live wild
                      type H5N1 virus to 16 different laboratories in 4 European countries</a>.
                      Considering the kind of biosafety regulations in place on potential
                      bioweapons, it certainly is disturbing. And again, if you havent heard
                      of the Bayer incident, I'm almost certain you havent heard of this one.
                      Not only is nothing being done to hold those involved accountable, but
                      Bayer is one of the corporations that the WHO has tasked with
                      developing a H1N1 vaccine. Doesnt that raise questions? I hope these
                      two incidents would allow everyone to re-examine their worldviews.</p>
              <p>Anyway,
                      I sent a letter to the ST about this, as well as, casting doubt on the
                      safety of the soon-to-come swine flu vaccine. Predictably, it didnt get
                      published. It would be heresy for the establishment. Anyway, I'll post
                      it on the forum.</p>
              <p><strong>Does the abolishing of money and the
                      profit system equal to the destruction of our scientific knowledge
                      accumulated for centuries and our technology based on that knowledge?</strong> If so, then yes, I agree such a move would be a return to the Stone Age.</p>
              <p>It
                      is here that you show your lack of understand of the proposal in
                      Zeitgeist Addendum. Perhaps, thats the result of your own conditioning.
                      <strong>Nothing is going to replace money</strong>. It will be a world where the necessities of life are provided without any cost to anyone because of <strong>technologically-created abundance</strong> and also a result of <strong>technological unemployment</strong>-
                      another key concept presented. But in today's consumerist society, that
                      would be overstretching the Earth's resources, which is why a redesign
                      of our culture must also take place. People have to realise the
                      meaninglessness of the work-consume cycle fueled by consumerism.</p>
              <p><em>"For centuries we have been conditioned by nationality, caste, class, tradition, 
                      religion, language, education, literature, art, custom, convention, propaganda 
                      of all kinds, economic pressure, the food we eat, the climate we live in, our 
                      family, our friends, our experiences—every influence you can think of—and, 
                      therefore, our responses to every problem are conditioned. Are you aware that 
                      you are conditioned?</em>"</p>
              <p>-J. Krishnamurti</p>
              <p>Is
                      it the most optimum when at least a billion people are starving
                      everyday and the FAO has been reporting there is more than sufficient
                      food being produced? Is it the most optimum when 7 children die
                      every second from preventable causes? And how do you know if its the most
                      optimum when nothing like this has been tried before? <strong>All that we have known are social systems that have regulated goods through different modes of exchange. </strong>The typical reaction to Zeitgeist Addendum is the result of this conditioning.<strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>You need to think about the impact of removing the monetary system on our world holistically. </strong>If
                      such a world were to exist, concepts of nationality, race, colour,
                      religion would gradually vanish because such differences are
                      superficial. Everything changes. The politics (or the lack of it
                      because there is no more vested interest-money involved), education,
                      law etc.<strong> It is a redesign of our culture.</strong> As Carl Sagan said, "We are one planet."</p>

One obstacle to clear communication today is the using of such words which has numerous definitions based on peoples' own associations with them. Not only does this make those words (such as "democracy", "freedom" or "liberty") meaningless, but they are counterproductive in any discussion because of the emotion they stir up. And so I state this again, <strong>there can never be an "utopia" in existence.</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, even as much as Peter Joseph decline to use the word "utopia" as insisted by Alex Jones - if I understood Peter's position correctly amidst the jockeying pressure from Alex - Peter did concede that if that was how Alex understanding of the ultimate state to be achieved in Zeitgeist solution.</p>
              <p>If you mean it the way that is stated - as in a physical state of real existence, I would agree.</p>
              <p>However, if 'utopia' as generally understood as a form of "a desired state to be", or "an aspiration"  -  then 'utopia' exist in the state of mind where all things are hoped to be perfectly in a state of equilibrium, without friction, and at peace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In such a place in the "land of utopia" - is there a need for democracy, freedom, justice, or liberty ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>However, if you have to be stubborn about it, I'll put it this way. "When people wish to improve, they strive towards perfection." Although "perfection" doesnt exist, it sums up the process towards progress, though that does not mean there is a final frontier. In the same way, you could state that "Society strives towards utopia in pursuit of a better world". But in reality, society improves as progress is made in the fields of technology, healthcare etc. The "utopia" here refers to <strong>an improved state of a dynamic society</strong>. But even then, using "utopia" would not be using it according to its prevalent definition and is semantically wrong.</p>

              <p>Are you not indulging in semantics and being over precise in splitting hairs to seek some definition that remains unclear in your thought process to push your idea as dealt out in Zeitgeist : Addendum ?</p>
              <p>How can "perfection" not exist - when it serves as an end by itself that is measurable by comparison from where one's effort began, or it can be an intermittent point in a journey towards some ultimate point ?</p>
              <p>Dynamism is a state of flux, as in the all human activities that include all kinds of processes in whatever field that you can think of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your own concession that <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"utopia" here refers to <strong>an improved state of a dynamic society </strong></span></em>- brings you back to a position that you had earlier decline to be at.</p>
              <p>Seriously, how many prevailing definitions can you offer for the simple word "utopia" ?</p>

              <p>Another such incident took place at least 6 months ago, on a more serious scale when <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.naturalnews.com/025760_pandemic_avian_flu_flu_virus.html">Baxter International shipped vaccine material contaminated with the live wild type H5N1 virus to 16 different laboratories in 4 European countries</a>. Considering the kind of biosafety regulations in place on potential bioweapons, it certainly is disturbing. And again, if you havent heard of the Bayer incident, I'm almost certain you havent heard of this one. Not only is nothing being done to hold those involved accountable, but Bayer is one of the corporations that the WHO has tasked with developing a H1N1 vaccine. Doesnt that raise questions? I hope these two incidents would allow everyone to re-examine their worldviews.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I sent a letter to the ST about this, as well as, casting doubt on the safety of the soon-to-come swine flu vaccine. Predictably, it didnt get published. It would be heresy for the establishment. Anyway, I'll post it on the forum.</p>

              <p>The vaccine was tested on a live volunteer after FDA approval was received, but somehow the volunteer was allowed to leave the confines of the lab, and he walked out of the facility never to be found despite the best efforts made to track him down. </p>

              emphatically said, is there any need to think about the impact of
              removing the monetary system on our world - whether holistically or
              otherwise ?</p>
              <p>Seriously do you believe that there can be a World where there
              is no concepts of nationality, race, color, religion - and where
              politics, education, law is no longer necessary, - and there are no
              class of rulers and ruled, no castes, no poverty, no wealth, - no
              need to spend on weapons, defenses, as there will be no wars, no
              quarrels, and all things are in total equilibrium ?</p>
              <p>Who makes the decisions to produce what, who gets first
              delivery, who gets what proportions in weight or volume, who gets
              the choiciest or the worst parts ?</p>
              <p>Who is in control ?</p>
              <p>With the Homo Sapiens no longer required to work for money or
              personal profit - as all necessities will be provided, no need to
              learn or to be educated as this will open to new forms of
              conditioning,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are Homo Sapiens to be held to ransom by technology, or held to
              ransom to those who created the technologies that this society
              had to depend on ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a repeat of the Animal Farm in a future settings that

              <p>You are right when you said that "utopia" only exists a state of mind because thats the only place the term can exist. My definition of "an improved state of a dynamic society" refers to a world where money has been abolished as an outdated tool of exchange. I did not equate it as "utopia", as I said in the next sentence that using it in that context would be wrong. Ultimately, "utopia" has no definitions that corresponds to reality. It only exists in the realm of the mind. I only used it so that you might be able to understand it better.</p>
              <p>Again, you are right, this is about semantics. Because of the inaccuracies in our language such as the labelling of unfamiliar issues (communism, socialism, anarchism), we tend to get into various conflicts simply due to unclear communication. When a term like "utopia" or "democracy" has different meanings to different people, how can communication between the two be clear? That was why I initially did not want to use the term "utopia".</p>
              <p>I'm sure if incidents like this are publicised, questions raised about this would lead to more revealing revelations about <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=13588">the origins of Swine Flu</a> and the pharmaceutical industry (Think Who Benefits?) which might led to the erosion of public confidence in taking poison in order to solve health problems. Did you see my unpublished letter to the ST?</p>
              <p>Most articles about the 2006 incident seems to have disappeared down the memory hole. But on Wikipedia, it seems that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products">past cases of HIV-contaminated material have occured before.</a></p>
              <p>The incident you were referring to about the accident in Mexico is different from the one I am talking about.

              <p>Rather than being a wage slave that is forced to enage in repetitive tasks that require less than a billionth of a person's brain power just for the sake of earning money to survive on, a world without money would free the creativity and passions of people round the world. If people did what they really enjoyed doing, without the distorting notion of a supervisor or boss having to ensure things got done, society would be more developed without the conflict-promoting us against them mentality.</p>
              <p>Yes, your apprehensions of a "free lunch" and "What's the catch?" reflects the conditioning of our society. Your argument that people would become idle and indulge in carnal pleasures does not have any bearing on society. How much do we know about the oceans, or about space? What about continual progress in the technology that would improve the state of society? You are trapped in the mentality that this would be "utopia" and that nothing can be improved anymore. I want to make this clear, this is NOT a perfect world, just one substantially better and more humane than the present one.</p>
              <p>While I agree there are <em>genetic tendencies</em> in our behaviour, they are separate from human behaviour which is influenced by our environment. A baby with Arab genetics would behave like a Jew if brought up in a Jewish community. He would speak Hebrew and be inculcated with the traditions and behaviour of his community. In this way, the apathetic way we treat other human beings, the selfishness and uncharitable behaviour of society can only be traced back to the influence of our environment (culture) moulded by the monetary system. Why should someone spend the money that he or she worked so hard to obtain to benefit someone else?</p>
              <p>It is perfectly alright to be hesitant about unfamiliar issues, but another thing to label it as something vaguely similar and reject based on that inaccurate label (just like people mostly label this concept as communism). The key is to maintain an open mind, ready to accept new information when it makes sense, though this would be relatively speaking. <strong>The problem with society, as you have demonstrated, is that being wrong, having to change one's mind is associated with being inferior, having an "empty mind that needs
                                      filling" when in fact being wrong allows an individual to be elevated to a higher level of understanding.</strong> I don't blame you for having this mentality, its the indoctrination of the educational system.</p>
              <p>I agree that the "the imbalance in the
              distribution of talent, intelligence, skills, knowledge, and
              perhaps level of sophistication in the society, in education,
              technology and finance" is causing suffering in many places round the world. But if people like us, living in so-called developed countries are able to enjoy a relatively comfortable life, why shouldnt the means to achieve this be shared with those suffering? Its not that the world lacks the means, as I've said many times, we have the resources and capability to create a better world, just that some groups of people lack MONEY. That is why money has such a paralysing influence on human progress. Moreover, it isnt as simplistic as that. What did you think about the part on the Economic Hitmen in Zeitgeist Addendum? Are those issues being raised in the mainstream media?</p>
              <p>Yes, I believe <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjv2wLpQdqM">such a world is within our grasp</a>, just that you probably think it is "utopia".

              <p>Conflicts can be avoided when the intended meanings of the preferred Words are clearly defined, and even as it is tedious to do so - in some important circumstances, it is imperative for such preliminaries to be performed with diligence.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, there are some key words that some organisations prefer not to breathe nor wish to hear, as it will hinder the serious efforts in building and shaping the opinions to follow certain preferred directions - that any negative connotations or associations will simply derail the ongoing efforts.</p>

              <p>My argument was based on the preceding statements that came from your input as stated :- "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Nothing is going to replace money</strong>. It will be a world where <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the necessities of life are provided without any cost to anyone</span></span> because of <strong>technologically-created abundance</strong> and also a result of <strong>technological unemployment</strong>- another key concept presented</span>".</p>
              <p>My apprehension is based on the premise offered that all necessities of life are provided without any cost to anyone - which is a result of technologically created abundance that will also result in our <em>technological unemployemnt</em> !!</p>
              <p>My concern is <strong>not</strong> that we have too much time, nor of our being unemployed by what your technology can do <strong>to us</strong>.</p>
              <p>There is a big hole from which this "too-good-to-be-true" feeling is flowing from; and it has nothing to do with my present conditioning to be suspicious of all the "too-good-to-be-true deals" - which I prefer to identify as an innate caution in my human genesis.</p>

              <p>The fact that the ideologies propounded by Zeitgeist : Addendum remains incomplete in its offering has lend itself to be viewed with reservations, and even suspicion.</p>
              <p>The veil of caution that has not been lifted is due to the fact that in a New Form of Living - (for want of a better term) - offered by Zeitgeist:Addendum that is without all the human negativitity characterised as hunger, lawlessness, destructions, wars, passions, emotions; due to the fulfillment from the abundance in all the required necessities made available without any human effort as a result of technological advancements and discoveries achieved with the ultimate result of gaining total equilibrium in the finite resources of nature with the needs of the Homo Sapien - one big question remains.</p>
              <p>Who or what form "the Center" over us - The Homo Sapiens ?</p>
              <p>You have offered ideas in how to occupy the time and freedom that have been made possible by all the enticing benefits offered with the successful implementation of the ideologies of Zeitgeist : Addendum - but the nub of the concerns remains without any clarity in :-</p>
              <p>who is the ultimate beneficiary of a total surrender to Zeitgeist : Addendum ?</p>
              <p>Will the community of Homo Sapiens be the ultimate beneficiary, or could the smart holder and creator of technology or technologies be the ultimate beneficiary in gaining total control of the World ?</p>
              <p>It will be easy for a community of intelligent "developers of technologies" to takeover the world, since every known social order has surrendered and subscribed to all the demands as required of Zeitgeist:Addendum .</p>
              <p>This offers itself to a new form of total conquest gained from seducing everyone with the peaceful and soft objectives of total equilibrium of Man and Nature.</p>
              <p>The total conquest can only succeed with every known political, financial, economic, commercial, production, defense systems or mechanism - and all human endeavors that can create negatively influence - to be dropped or dismantled in order for the new ideologies of Zeitgeist : Addendum to succeed.</p>
              <p>It brings us back to the old days of the warring states of China, when for a conquering King to be assured of total success of his rule, he must obtain the total loyalty from the conquered subjects - by ruthlessly demanding total abandonment of the old ways that can only be achieved by executing the old leadership structures and systems, and subjugating the conquered community to be unthinking slaves to a new order.</p>
              <p>Call it conditioning if you like - my view is that looking at the benefits that Zeitgeist : Addendum is like looking at the vast schools of fishes available on the surface of an ocean that offers itself as tempting food resources in abundance.</p>
              <p>However, the unknown parts of Zeitgeist:Addendum is like attempting to peer into the darkest and deepest part of the ocean known to man, and still one cannot fathom the mysteries that lurk deeper in the deepest part of the unknown - as like the Ocean, it will not or is unable to reveal its true depth.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>On reviewing these alarming events, we should not be too surprised to these shocking incidences - as there have been instances even in Singapore where the Blood Bank had inadvertently taken tainted blood from donors who did not know of their medical condition, or that they had wilfully not declared their condition when donating their blood.</p>
              <p>There have also been many conspiracy theories - some of which are real and some remain speculative - we will need diligent investigators such as the investigative news reporters to ferret out the substantive proof to slam the door on the wrongdoers.</p>

              <p>Seriously, I have no problems handling any amount of free time, and will be only too happy for someone to takeover all my work, make all my decisions, bring the food and all necessities to me, think and act for me - while I indulge in pure ecstatic pro-creativity in all artistic and hedonistic forms.</p>
              <p>But is the problem about "what to do with all the Free Time" - when we are no longer the wage slave according to the Zeitgeist : Addendum ?</p>

              <p>My argument was based on the preceding statements that came from your input as stated :- "<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Nothing is going to replace money</strong>. It will be a world where <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the necessities of life are provided without any cost to anyone</span></span> because of <strong>technologically-created abundance</strong> and also a result of <strong>technological unemployment</strong>- another key concept presented</span>".</p>
              <p>My apprehension is based on the premise offered that all necessities of life are provided without any cost to anyone - which is a result of technologically created abundance that will also result in our <em>technological unemployemnt</em> !!</p>
              <p>My concern is <strong>not</strong> that we have too much time, nor of our being unemployed by what your technology can do <strong>to us</strong>.</p>
              <p>There is a big hole from which this "too-good-to-be-true" feeling is flowing from; and it has nothing to do with my present conditioning to be suspicious of all the "too-good-to-be-true deals" - which I prefer to identify as an innate caution in my human genesis.</p>

              <p>Are you not aware of the tremendous outpouring of donations from the community in times of crisis faced by those from within the community, as well as the external communities outside of national borders ?</p>
              <p>While it is correct in your statements that the environment can condition human behaviour to react negatively, there are also the positive influences in the communal and social values that reinforces and encourages the innate human goodness in every Homo Sapien.</p>

              <p>The veil of caution that has not been lifted is due to the fact that in a New Form of Living - (for want of a better term) - offered by Zeitgeist:Addendum that is without all the human negativitity characterised as hunger, lawlessness, destructions, wars, passions, emotions; due to the fulfillment from the abundance in all the required necessities made available without any human effort as a result of technological advancements and discoveries achieved with the ultimate result of gaining total equilibrium in the finite resources of nature with the needs of the Homo Sapien - one big question remains.</p>

              <p>Will the community of Homo Sapiens be the ultimate beneficiary, or could the smart holder and creator of technology or technologies be the ultimate beneficiary in gaining total control of the World ?</p>
              <p>It will be easy for a community of intelligent "developers of technologies" to takeover the world, since every known social order has surrendered and subscribed to all the demands as required of Zeitgeist:Addendum .</p>
              <p>This offers itself to a new form of total conquest gained from seducing everyone with the peaceful and soft objectives of total equilibrium of Man and Nature.</p>
              <p>The total conquest can only succeed with every known political, financial, economic, commercial, production, defense systems or mechanism - and all human endeavors that can create negatively influence - to be dropped or dismantled in order for the new ideologies of Zeitgeist : Addendum to succeed.</p>
              <p>It brings us back to the old days of the warring states of China, when for a conquering King to be assured of total success of his rule, he must obtain the total loyalty from the conquered subjects - by ruthlessly demanding total abandonment of the old ways that can only be achieved by executing the old leadership structures and systems, and subjugating the conquered community to be unthinking slaves to a new order.</p>
              <p>Call it conditioning if you like - my view is that looking at the benefits that Zeitgeist : Addendum is like looking at the vast schools of fishes available on the surface of an ocean that offers itself as tempting food resources in abundance.</p>
              <p>However, the unknown parts of Zeitgeist:Addendum is like attempting to peer into the darkest and deepest part of the ocean known to man, and still one cannot fathom the mysteries that lurk deeper in the deepest part of the unknown - as like the Ocean, it will not or is unable to reveal its true depth.</p>

              because they werent publicised?</p>
              <p>Fifty years ago, scientists were
              talking about how technology would create an age of abundance and how
              it would be the emancipation proclaimation for Humanity. Sadly, that
              never took place because our social system is not designed to do that,
              it is designed to pertetuate the establishment and to promote scarcity.
              It promotes a culture that rewards and idolises the self-centered
              pursuit of profitrather than promoting cooperation and social progress.</p>
              <p>Rather than conclude that people in such a society would idle
              their time away, think about how great scientists like Newton, Tesla
              and Einstein pursued their interests without a thought for monetary
              gain. That would be the purpose for society. Not having to waste lives
              doing meaningless and mundane jobs and having the opportunity to
              maximise the human potential for the betterment of society.</p>
              <p><strong>I
              acknowledge that despite the corruption that the monetary system
              breeds, there is still a relatively strong spirit of volunteerism in
              the world which is helping to alleviate suffering. </strong>However, that
              cannot provide a concrete solution to our problems. After decades of
              so-called globalisation where there is said to be more prosperity,
              poverty, hunger, suffering and unnecessary death still abound.As Bertrand Russell wrote in  <em>The Impact of Science on Society (1952)</em>, <strong>"So long as the rulers are comfortable, what reason have they to improve the lot of their serfs?"</strong></p>
              <p>Its hard to believe that such suffering is intentional, but the
              fact remains that the suffering in the Third World is the result of
              western policies. We are not sharing with the poorer communities. How
              many people would know that their chocolate is made by children who
              cannot go to school or even tasted chocolate in their life? In this
              documentary called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0W5oBYtrog">The Great African Scandle</a>, <strong>what t akes place theoretically is vastly different from the situation on the ground.</strong> In Ghana, subsidies on indigenous rice production are removed by the
              WB/ IMF so that a market can be created for subsidised (up to 72%)
              western rice. We have FairTrade, one might add. But the reality is that
              in Ghana, FairTrade cooperatives only receive the FairTrade price for
              3% of their cocao, which are then mixed in with other cocao which may
              have been harvested with child labourers. While many Third World
              countries may have their political independence,they are still shackled by the double standards of the western-oriented global economy.</p>
              <p>Rather than blame the WB/ IMF or the various corporations, it must be recognised that <strong>it
              is the system that compells individuals to make policies that benefit
              them and causes people to suffer from those same decisions.</strong> Why would corporations genuinely fork out money to develop the same communities whose exploitation is profiting them? <strong>When
              there is money to be made off the marketing of the necessities of life
              such as clean food and water, profits usually take precedence over
              ethics.</strong> Its difficult to mix profits and ethics in the system we are living in.</p>
              <p>I
              agree that it would be almost impossible to implement TVP with the
              notions of sovereignty today. Also, imagine such a city of abundance
              where technology is used to free people from labour, separated (walled
              off) from the present world. Naturally, when crisises hit, there would
              be incursions and attacks on that city to forcefully take food, water
              etc that people outside are deprived off. That is why the key to
              implementation has to be global unification; to become aware of the
              superficial divisions that separate one human race.</p>
              <p>I would say that the only obstacle is <strong>a crisis of ignorance</strong>.
              People are not adequately informed about the current state of
              technology that we have, they are not informed about the ramifications
              of a monetary system because we are mostly living in an affluent and
              developed society that shields us from the suffering elsewhere and we
              do not understand enough about how our world is influenced and works.
              Not to mention that TVP is a radical concept which challenges many
              preconceptions that people have like "thats the way it is", in the
              sense that they arent willing to challenge the status quo as thats how
              they've been brought up.</p>
              <p>As I've stated before, it is <strong>global unification</strong> not global governance. There are no "community of intelligent
              "developers of technologies"". As Newton stated, <strong>"If I have seen further, it is only because I have stood on the shoulders of giants." </strong>There
              is not 1 person or group that can claim credit for any invention or
              concept because all knowledge is accumulated (built on one another) and
              the credit has to go to that field of knowledge and all its pioneers
              and developers. Not only does this awareness removes any excuses for
              any ego association, but it promotes a revolutionary mentality that
              whatever progress should be implemented in a way that preserves and
              promotes the human and environmental well-being.</p>
              <p>There are no
              more concepts of hierarchy and domination in such a world because there
              will not be the incentive for it anymore. Presently, if you are above
              people in terms of organisational hierarchy, there is the motivation of
              money, status etc. You are able to force people to do what they do not
              want to do just so they can survive, which is an extremely barbaric
              form of social interaction.</p>
              <p><strong>You're using a lot of loaded words with many negative connotations like "conquest", "seduce", "takeover" and "dismantled".</strong> Why anyone oppose the intelligent management of the Earth's resources
              in a way that ensures that everyone has abundance through the
              maximisation of our technology? Why would anyone want to preserve a
              system that puts a price tag on another human being? <strong>There is no force involved, its the evolution of our social system.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              basis of the TVP is not coercion in order to attain its goals, but the
              coming together with like-minded people who understand that our present
              social structures are outdated and obsolete and that it needs to be
              replaced with a better one. Who wouldnt want such a world?</p>
              <p>I
              agree with your metaphor of likening TVP to looking into the oceans.
              True, it is totally radical, challenges every established structure
              today and has never been tried. But it offers a much better world and a
              much better method of solving problems and treating human beings and
              the environment than the present system can.</p>
              <p>That aside, what do you mean by "This line of thought continue to develop...."?</p>

              <p>Your last statement maybe disputed by MM LKY - who believed in
                  filling the people's stomach so as to dull their
                  minds. </p>
              <p>Can the spirit of altruism solve all the problems of everyone on
                  this globe ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The World Bank and the IMF is a US creation, and the President
                  of at least one of the organisation has always been a US
                  Citizen, and the other an European from one of the major
                  West European industrialized countries.</p>
              <p>Should we be surprised if such scandalous events should take
                  place ?</p>
              <p>The supply and distribution chain has always put the primary
                  producer at an unfair disadvantage in terms of the
                  scandalous price for the final product sold compared to the
                  price paid for the primary products.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, this is the economic model that the governments
                  have subscribed to for the last few centuries.</p>
              <p>Profit remains the most efficient arbiter in determining where
                  human resources should be applied, until a better form will be
                  created that will be acceptable to everyone.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it a crisis of ignorance, or simply a crisis designed for the
                  benefit of the new technocrats with a more sophisticated model to
                  be sold to the world ?</p>
              <p>With the modern homo sapiens, the status quo cannot
                  exist for too long - its creativity and enterprise cannot
                  allow the modern homo sapien to remain static or idle.</p>

              <p>Can there be no more concepts of hierarchy and domination in
                  your new world as propounded by Zeigeist Addendum ?</p>
              <p>Someone has to take on certain roles that require decisions to
                  be made, another to execute, and some other to assess the
                  effectiveness, surely it is not expected for the entire global
                  population to perform the same tasks ?</p>
              <p>The one who decides, monitor, manages and the other who does the
                  actual works will require some hierarchical structure of
                  responsibilities for the division of labor.</p>
              <p>Can human effort move in any singular co-ordinated direction
                  when there is no structure or system to provide guidance ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact that such words exist is a result of nature's gift for
                  caution.</p>
              <p>In any society - whether it is the human one, or that of the
                  animals, insects, warm or cold blooded mammals - there exist always
                  a domineering alpha-unit.</p>
              <p>The alpha-unit will always seek to dominate, to lead, and to be
                  the <em>numero uno</em> in the order of things in its group.</p>
              <p>It is in nature's order for such an alpha-male or alpha-female
                  to exist, as it serves to protect the continuation and
                  strengthening of its genetic character so as to
                  perpetuate its own breed.</p>
              <p>Can a Zeigeist global community survive such natural instincts
                  in every being, or will Zeigeist global community disintegrate over
                  time ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As outdated as the present social structure is, it cannot be
                  obsolete - as society is always in a state of flux, and the
                  situation turns static only when domination takes place - in which
                  the dominant few will seek to preserve the status quo in its
                  favor.</p>
              <p>Can such status quo last when the homo sapien can never
                  accept a static status quo for too long ?</p>
              <p>With the new altruistic society that Zeigeist Addendum is
                  advocating that has so much still being murky as the depths of the
                  deepest ocean, can anyone accept a new uncertain status quo when
                  the present one is bad ?</p>
              <p>Will we not be fulfilling the proverbial truth of "<em>jumping
                  out of the pan into the fire</em>" ?</p>
              <p>The truism has been to lived with the devil you know, then to
                  deal with a devil that you do not have the slightest knowledge

              <p>With the information control in the US centralised in the hands of 5
                  huge corporations, I consider it extremely rare that such incidents
                  even made the news, even if it was not followed up and subsequently
                  dropped into the memory hole. This is what I would expect in an age of
                  corporate interlock between the various industries.</p>
              <p>Imagine you
                  are a doctor. You diagnose patients according to their symptoms,
                  results of machine analysis and usually treat them with surgury or
                  medication. Medical care is a technical process. Now, suppose a
                  computer which is updated with all the necessary medical patterns to
                  diagnose and treat patients replaces you, but you still get your salary. How would you like such a life? You would be freed from labour.</p>
              <p>Developing on
                  that example, what The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM) advocates is the total
                  removal of money. Free yourself from obsolete principles such as "No
                  such things as free lunches" etc. Technology allows us to automate
                  production to the extent that human labour will not be necessary
                  anymore, and still create an abundance of food, energy and all the
                  amenities of life, eliminating poverty and suffering at no cost because
                  the concept of money is already irrelevant. The question isnt "Who
                  pays?" but "Do we have the resources to do so?"</p>
              <p>To quote from Stuart Chase's <em>The Tyranny of Words</em>:</p>
              <p><strong>"Principles
                  are not tools by which discoveries are made, for they tend to close the
                  mind against free inquiry. When men observe the world in the light of
                  ideals which they consider sacred and timeless, they tend to develop
                  priests rather than scientists...The principles of Washinton's Farewell
                  Address are still considered sources of wisdom; the methods of [his]
                  physician, however, are no longer studied..."</strong></p>
              <p>Although we could create such an advanced world today,
                  the presence of money, creating distortions such as politics,
                  corruption, crime, war- division within one planet, is hindering human
                  progress because of the type of abberant behaviour that such a system
                  promotes. When we live in a world of scarcity and division, there must
                  the type of hierarchy you described. That social system is your frame
                  of reference. It has nothing to do with so-called human 'nature', which
                  is meaningless because the only thing observable is human BEHAVIOUR.
                  While we have space-age technology, our social system and values are
                  still that of the stone-age's. It is this understanding that separates TZM from other social organisations.</p>
              <p>The
                  amount of corruption that is manifested in society is merely a symptom
                  of the problem. When our society promotes and rewards the selfish
                  pursuit of profit and self-interest, how can altruism abound within
                  society, although there are small pockets of it? We are victims of
                  culture. If we want to change the type of behaviour that is displayed,
                  we have to first change the environment that we are in.</p>
              <p>Take a look at this, this is the kind of values our social system promotes:</p>

              <p>TVP is The Venus Project (introduced in Zeitgeist Addendum) abbreviated. TZM is the activist arm of TVP.</p>
              <p>Isn't
                  what we're seeing in society the result of "a crisis designed for the
                  benefit of the new technocrats with a more sophisticated model to
                  be sold to the world"? Its just that the public does not realise the
                  "technocrat" part of such developments. Look at the state of civil
                  liberties today, how technology is being used as a TOOL, reflecting the
                  kind of environment we are living in, to monitor and datamine huge
                  populations. Look at how technology is being used to create automonous
                  killing machines, improving tools to take another human being's life,
                  how to inflict pain and dominate over others. Its not the technology,
                  I'm sure you would have realised, its our social system.</p>
              <p>There
                  will not be any domination or hierarchy in a TVP world. Thats a
                  stone-age mentality. When we could cooperate in a world of abundance,
                  we chose to create a world of scarcity, which introduces an "us against
                  them" mentality creating conflicts born of baseless pride and ego. With
                  the removal of money, politics as we know it would vanish. Instead of
                  the mess that we can politics, we would have a cybernated society. That
                  is not machines ruling over us, not one individual making a decision
                  but decision being arrived at through the Scientific Method with the
                  most advanced tools available. Is there a communist or a capitalistic
                  method to distill water? Is there a democratic or republican method of
                  constructing a building? No, because both examples, just like survival,
                  is a technical process with no need for subjective influences like as
                  politics and ego associations.</p>
              <p><strong>With decision-making clouded by
                  politics, money (vested interest), ego/pride, corruption, it is no
                  wonder that the social sciences, if it can be called a science, has
                  always lagged behind the physical sciences.</strong> Yes, society is always in a
                  state of flux, that is our scientific knowledge and technology, but our
                  social system has largely remained constant and does not allow us to
                  maximise our technology.</p>
              <p>To chose to remain with the
                  unsatisfactory status quo, when an alternative promises a much more
                  fulfilling world, is just closed mindedness. If the present social
                  system is not promoting the human well-being, obviously we should move
                  to a new social structure when we have to do so. The "truism" or
                  "truth" you referred to are meaningless statements for nothing is true
                  (absolutely), what was true a hundred years ago may not be true today. </p>
              <p>Just like our social system, our language has been corrupted and
                  is a reflection of the state of our culture. An example would be the
                  word "propaganda". Originally meaning any effort taken to promote a
                  particular belief or doctrine, it has become a kind of "vulgar word",
                  having many negative connotations attached to it. Its not a defence,
                  but a sign of decadence. When we compare the world we live in and the
                  language we use, both are similar. There is always a war on something,
                  war on cancer, war on poverty, war on terror etc. We describe our world
                  in violent and aggressive terms, creating a war-like, defensive
                  mentality. When someone tries to point out someone else's error, it
                  becomes an attack rather an helping that person to improve. In this
                  way, progress is stiffled.</p>

                  Look at the state of civil liberties today, how technology is being
                  used as a TOOL, reflecting the kind of environment we are living
                  in, to monitor and datamine huge populations. Look at how
                  technology is being used to create automonous killing machines,
                  improving tools to take another human being's life, how to inflict
                  pain and dominate over others. Its not the technology, I'm sure you
                  would have realised, its our social system.</p>
              <p>There will not be any domination or hierarchy in a TVP world.
                  Thats a stone-age mentality. When we could cooperate in a world of
                  abundance, we chose to create a world of scarcity, which introduces
                  an "us against them" mentality creating conflicts born of baseless
                  pride and ego. With the removal of money, politics as we know it
                  would vanish. Instead of the mess that we can politics, we would
                  have a cybernated society. That is not machines ruling over us, not
                  one individual making a decision but decision being arrived at
                  through the Scientific Method with the most advanced tools
                  available. Is there a communist or a capitalistic method to distill
                  water? Is there a democratic or republican method of constructing a
                  building? No, because both examples, just like survival, is a
                  technical process with no need for subjective influences like as
                  politics and ego associations.</p>
              <p><strong>With decision-making clouded by politics, money (vested
                  interest), ego/pride, corruption, it is no wonder that the social
                  sciences, if it can be called a science, has always lagged behind
                  the physical sciences.</strong> Yes, society is always in a state
                  of flux, that is our scientific knowledge and technology, but our
                  social system has largely remained constant and does not allow us
                  to maximise our technology.</p>
              <p>To chose to remain with the unsatisfactory status quo, when an
                  alternative promises a much more fulfilling world, is just closed
                  mindedness. If the present social system is not promoting the human
                  well-being, obviously we should move to a new social structure when
                  we have to do so. The "truism" or "truth" you referred to are
                  meaningless statements for nothing is true (absolutely), what was
                  true a hundred years ago may not be true today. </p>
              <p>Just like our social system, our language has been corrupted and
                  is a reflection of the state of our culture. An example would be
                  the word "propaganda". Originally meaning any effort taken to
                  promote a particular belief or doctrine, it has become a kind of
                  "vulgar word", having many negative connotations attached to it.
                  Its not a defence, but a sign of decadence. When we compare the
                  world we live in and the language we use, both are similar. There
                  is always a war on something, war on cancer, war on poverty, war on
                  terror etc. We describe our world in violent and aggressive terms,
                  creating a war-like, defensive mentality. When someone tries to
                  point out someone else's error, it becomes an attack rather an
                  helping that person to improve. In this way, progress is
                  stiffled.</p>

              <p>So whatever I described matches these tenets of communism as developed by Marx?</p>
              <p>By labelling something as "communism", what are you trying to imply about it? Normally, "communism" implies an undesirable, 'evil' idea. Even if you didnt even investigate it thoroughly, using a negative label already helps you reach a conclusion. Thats Orwellian 'crimestop' isnt it?</p>
