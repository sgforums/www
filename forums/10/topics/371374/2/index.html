              <p>Has anyone really considered why are the implications of growth fueled by consumption? In a world with finite resources, our so-called economic growth through consumption is merely short-term gratification with production of goods solely for profit with no thought for the environmental (See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/">Story of Stuff</a>), not to mention psychological impact on society.</p>
              <p>To quote from an article from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17569-consumerism-is-eating-the-future.html">The New Scientist</a>:</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p><em>But there's another, more recent factor that's making things even worse, and it's <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>an invention of human culture rather than an evolved trait.</strong></span> According to Rees, the change took place after the second world war in the US, when factories previously producing weapons lay idle, and soldiers were returning with no jobs to go to.</em></p>
              <p><em>American economists and the government of the day decided to <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>revive economic activity by creating a culture in which people were encouraged to accumulate and show off material wealth, to the point where it defined their status in society and their self-image.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em>Rees quotes economist Victor Lebow as saying in 1955: "Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate".</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em>In today's world, such rhetoric seems beyond belief. Yet the consumer spree carries on regardless, and few of us are aware that we're still willing slaves to a completely artificial injunction to consume, and to define ourselves by what we consume.</em></p>
              <p><em>"Lebow and his cronies got together to 'create' the modern advertising industry, which plays to primitive beliefs," says Rees. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">"It makes you feel insecure, because the advertising industry turned our sense of self-worth into a symbolic presentation of the possessions we have," he told me. "We've turned consumption into a necessity, and how we define ourselves."</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em>The result is a world in which rampant consumption in rich countries is rapidly outstripping the resources in the world needed to satisfy demand.</em></p>
              <p><em>...</em></p>
              <p><em>"Advertising is an instrument for construction of people's everyday reality, so we could use the same media to construct a cultural paradigm in which conspicuous consumption is despised," he says. "We've got to make people ashamed to be seen as a 'future eater'."</em></p>

              <p><br>It all depends on how you look at 'consumption' - which from the perspective you are looking at is from an environmentalist point of view towards wasteful consumption that strips the earth's resources, contributing to environmental polution in terms of global warming and garbage.</p>
              <p>From the economic point of view, one has to look at the consumption driven economy that is geared towards specific goals that can stimulate the economy at the same time as removing or reducing the contributing effects of wasteful consumption that affects our environment.</p>
              <p>In the present context of this thread, it was started from the points raised by the remarkable "swei-siao hog" in the other thread <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/10/topics/370805">‘Democrats establish 14-member CEC to lead growing party’ </a>- which were referred to in this thread.</p>
              <p>As matters stand, the PAP Government has moved to open the doors to an increase to our population size so as to boost economic activities, which can only have positve effects to the GDP.</p>
              <p>At the end of it all, in the face of a sinking industrial output, the increase in new migrants to boost the GDP can only strain the existing resources available to Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>While the PAP Government pats its own back for a seeming miraculous upturn in statistics, this is done at the expense of the existing 3.5 Million Singaporeans already burden with 1 million over foreigners living as Permanent Residents and on Work Permit or Social Visit Passes.</p>

              <p>Can we depend on the accuracy of your ability to discern the contents in the first post of this thread to form your conclusion ?</p>
              <p>Your brilliance can already be seen in the remark that you made - (in the other thread as the "swei-siao-hog" had made) when you stated <em><span style="color: #3366ff;">"<span>Arguing on the Internet - Is like running in the Special Olympics; Even if you win, you're still a retard"</span></span></em></p>
              <p>Is there any point for you to indulge in any controversies, even as you are controversial with your remarks that insult those who are retarded due to no fault of themselves ?</p>
              <p>Now, should we not begin to wonder who the real retards in society should be ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can we help the retarded to understand how the monopoly of the PAP should be broken, when the PAP insist on making Singaporeans believe that it is natural to be retarded from having freedom, justice and equaility to question the PAP's methods ?</p>
              <p>Is it not pathetic that the innocent who were born retarded should be derided by those who has the opportunity to be better that what they can be, but will prefer to resign to the retarded status quo imposed by the PAP ?</p>

              <p>Please, make sure you are a bloody Malay and not any other race before you cow father cow mother about immigrants coming into Singapore as new citizens. So what even if GDP is increased due to immigrant population, the increase is not sustainable in a long term. The Sinkapore Acrobatics Party isn't the smartest alternative party in Singapore as it can only question about the policies in Singapore while not coming up with any good solutions.  If the GST is removed, who is going to bear the income tax increase? It will be still the people. Jobs are not resources so please do not claim that existing resources are taken up by foreigners. Next, we should create variable pay for MPs and ministers, like the variable bonus. If the GDP screws up for that year, the MPs and ministers recieve pay of the lowest portion of the lowest quanta of the Singapore population and vice versa if the GDP goes up for the year.</p>

              <p>Nope, I'm not saying that people have to give up consumption of goods, just that a consumption-driven economy is a road to destruction.</p>
              <p>A better alternative could be a world where resources are directed toward bettering the human condition rather than to make a profit that we see in today's economy. Not only would this be the beginning of a resource-based economy where consumption is geared towards the carrying capacity of the Earth, but the distortions in our culture created by the pursuit of profit would be eliminated.</p>
              <p>While it is true that the examples you quoted such as the Cash for Clunkers program would reduce pollution relatively, it still does not solve the root of the problem. In a world that is bound by budgets, the most effective solution to problems in our society will only be solved in as much as profits can be reaped by doing so. Even if improved fuel standards reduce pollution, why not go fuel-less? The technology exists for air-powered cars, water-powered cars or electric cars powered totally by renewable sources.</p>
              <p>An economy whose functioning depends on constant consumption can never "protect the environment" because it is not designed to do so.</p>

              <p>"Utopian idealism"?</p>
              <p>First of all, you need to understand what
                  is really relevant for human survival (not to be confused with the
                  perpetuation of the establishment). <strong>There can never be such things as utopia because all social systems are always in a state of evolution.</strong> I'm sure you've heard of the saying that the only constant is change,
                  though its sad our social system doesnt promote that. Its just that
                  progress has been stiffled by the monetary system and the pursuit of
                  profit because problems will never be solved in our world if they don't
                  allow someone to make a profit.</p>
              <p>In our monetary system, I said
                  that our need for perpetual consumption drives our so-called economic
                  growth because there is always a need to buy stuff, allowing companies
                  to pay their workers, who then repeat the cycle by buying more stuff.
                  In a finite world, such a cycle is extremely distorted because the
                  focus is solely on making a profit, not geared to how much resources we
                  have. <em>It has to be</em>, otherwise the whole system will crash due
                  to inadequate economic 'growth'. The human and environmental condition
                  will always remain secondary, if at all, in such a system. As is the
                  case, how can anyone hope for a humane world if we live in this
                  monetary system?</p>
              <p>Whatever the PAP does, how can it hope to
                  successfully wipe out today's consumerist culture? For our economy to
                  be sustained, consumerism has to be sustained as a so-called engine of
                  growth. If people do not feel insecure about themselves or do not
                  attach their self-worth to material objects, then how do we sustain our
                  economic growth when they dont buy unnecessary stuff impulsively? <strong>They are two diametrically opposed courses of action; it just isnt in line with the nature of our monetary system. </strong>But I don't know what the government is doing, perhaps you could provide some information on that.</p>
              <p><strong>You're
                  confusing this idea of abolishing money with a label that has so much
                  negative associations, and of which many people disagree on its
                  definition- communism. That why using labels can distort communication,
                  its better to describe what a particular system does.</strong> You got to
                  know what the communism ideology advocated and did first. It always
                  involved class warfare to get rid of possible opposition, which is why
                  Soviet Russia and China exterminated tens of millions of their middle
                  class. While communism advocated the abolishing of money for an
                  equitable world, it couldnt do this and hence, remained in the
                  paralysing monetary system. Of course there are more, but it would
                  suffice with these two.</p>
              <p>When I say that abolishing money would
                  allow the creation of a better world, I say so under circumstances
                  vastly different from when communism as I've described above. Thats why
                  its inaccurate and dangerous to communication to label something today
                  with yesterday's label. Today, tremendous advances in technology- <strong>something only relevant today</strong>-
                  has allowed us to create an abundance of energy, clean water and food
                  and adequate shelter and clothing necessary for human survival. While I
                  acknowledge that this is still a finite world, resources are only as
                  limited as is the availability of a synthetic substitute once the need
                  for profit or profit enhanced by scarcity is eliminated.</p>
              <p>But
                  this line of reasoning doesnt apply to today's world because it is
                  threatening to the very nature of the monetary system. It wouldnt make
                  sense to charge for energy if it were as plentiful as the water in the
                  oceans. <strong>A world where the necessities of life are abundant,
                  regulating its distribution through money would be ridiculous, retarded
                  (as in impeding social progress) and irrelevant to human survival.</strong> Thats why today, it is in the interest of the human condition, money
                  should be abolished as its no longer needed and at the same time, our
                  technological potential would be able to be used to its maximum, free
                  from the need to generate irrelevant "economic growth".</p>
              <p>The
                  nature of the economy and economic growth today is not only
                  unsustainable, environmentally degrading but it is also perverting our
                  social system. Semantically, it is not even "growth", but stagnation
                  for the establishment to preserve itself. Furthermore, we dont even
                  need it today due to Humanity's advances in technology; it is an
                  outdated system which needs to be replaced with a better one. <strong>You should really take 20 mins to watch <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com">The Story of Stuff</a> in order for you to abandon this self-preserving reaction when the monetary system is questioned.  <br></strong></p>

              <p>First of all, you need to understand what is really relevant for human survival (not to be confused with the perpetuation of the establishment). <strong>There can never be such things as utopia because all social systems are always in a state of evolution.</strong> I'm sure you've heard of the saying that the only constant is change, though its sad our social system doesnt promote that. Its just that progress has been stiffled by the monetary system and the pursuit of profit because problems will never be solved in our world if they don't allow someone to make a profit.</p>

              <p>If all social systems are always in a state of evolution due to "change which is a constant in Life" - what do you think is the purpose for such changes to be made that result in evolution ?</p>
              <p>Has the need for constant change and evolution to occur not been a result of society's need to progress and improve - in pursuit of betterment in Life ?</p>
              <p>Is it not part of man's idealism for  a perfect world, or somewhere closer to it ?</p>
              <p>Has it not been your stated or implied position for such a perfect world to exist - where human consumption find an equilibrium with the preservation of nature's available resources ?</p>

              <p>In our monetary system, I said that our need for perpetual consumption drives our so-called economic growth because there is always a need to buy stuff, allowing companies to pay their workers, who then repeat the cycle by buying more stuff. In a finite world, such a cycle is extremely distorted because the focus is solely on making a profit, not geared to how much resources we have. <em>It has to be</em>, otherwise the whole system will crash due to inadequate economic 'growth'. The human and environmental condition will always remain secondary, if at all, in such a system. As is the case, how can anyone hope for a humane world if we live in this monetary system?</p>

              <p>Whatever the PAP does, how can it hope to successfully wipe out today's consumerist culture? For our economy to be sustained, consumerism has to be sustained as a so-called engine of growth. If people do not feel insecure about themselves or do not attach their self-worth to material objects, then how do we sustain our economic growth when they dont buy unnecessary stuff impulsively? <strong>They are two diametrically opposed courses of action; it just isnt in line with the nature of our monetary system.</strong> But I don't know what the government is doing, perhaps you could provide some information on that.</p>

              <p>Can anyone in Singapore know what the Singapore Government has in mind, when all decisions are made in the cloistered and rarefied environment of fhe CEC ?</p>
              <p>The consumerist culture was already spoken as early as 1981 - by one of the most intellectual of Singapore's founding father - the late S. Rajaratnam, who was the longest serving Singapore Foreign Minister - when he spoke at a Havard Club Anniversary Dinner in Singapore.</p>
              <p>You may wish to delve into his speech about - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://stars.nhb.gov.sg/stars/tmp/SR19811208s.pdf">“Happy Pigs and Unhappy Men (*1)” </a>- and determine for yourself the state of the Singapore Government today.</p>
              <p> In his retirement in 1988, he spoke out against the materialistic culture in Singapore, when he spoke out at  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tamilnation.org/hundredtamils/rajaratnam.htm">‘...the decline of intellectualism and clear thinking, and was troubled by the phenomenon – which he attributed the decline with its underlying dynamic being a global one and formed part of the sweeping tide of history. It is the undesired consequences of steady economic growth, technological progress, and the burgeoning raw consumer culture which drives societies today and has help spawn its attendant shallow materialism’.

              <p><strong>You're confusing this idea of abolishing money with a label that has so much negative associations, and of which many people disagree on its definition- communism. That why using labels can distort communication, its better to describe what a particular system does.</strong> You got to know what the communism ideology advocated and did first. It always involved class warfare to get rid of possible opposition, which is why Soviet Russia and China exterminated tens of millions of their middle class. While communism advocated the abolishing of money for an equitable world, it couldnt do this and hence, remained in the paralysing monetary system. Of course there are more, but it would suffice with these two.</p>

              <p>Did Karl Marx and-or Lenin attempt to do away with the monetary system, or were their underlying philosophy being a struggle for a Class-less and Equitable Society ?</p>
              <p>Without a monetary system, can any society develop to a higher level based purely on a system of bartering goods and services ?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>When I say that abolishing money would allow the creation of a better world, I say so under circumstances vastly different from when communism as I've described above. Thats why its inaccurate and dangerous to communication to label something today with yesterday's label. Today, tremendous advances in technology- <strong>something only relevant today</strong>- has allowed us to create an abundance of energy, clean water and food and adequate shelter and clothing necessary for human survival. While I acknowledge that this is still a finite world, resources are only as limited as is the availability of a synthetic substitute once the need for profit or profit enhanced by scarcity is eliminated.</p>
              <p>But this line of reasoning doesnt apply to today's world because it is threatening to the very nature of the monetary system. It wouldnt make sense to charge for energy if it were as plentiful as the water in the oceans. <strong>A world where the necessities of life are abundant, regulating its distribution through money would be ridiculous, retarded (as in impeding social progress) and irrelevant to human survival.</strong> Thats why today, it is in the interest of the human condition, money should be abolished as its no longer needed and at the same time, our technological potential would be able to be used to its maximum, free from the need to generate irrelevant "economic growth".</p>

              <p>Regretably, I am amazed at the 'wishy-washy' position that you have adopted in this wasteful and supposedly intellectual exercise.</p>
              <p>Mankind has evolved over centuries to arrive at the most efficient form of transaction of economic exchanges between societies, and it is with disbelief to read your claim that <em>"<span style="color: #0000ff;">regulating the distribution</span></em> [of resources] <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">through money would be ridiculous, retarded (impeding social progress) and irrelevant to human survival</span>".</em></p>
              <p>Have you ignored that all economic activity - and the resources that you recognised to be finite - will need to be determined in one form or another in terms of priorities ?</p>
              <p>Without the element of "PROFITABILITY" and "MONETARY VALUATION" as tools for measurement - how would you propose to allocate resources - even if you desire to produce the synthetic alternatives for your proposed solution ?</p>
              <p>Did you miss out the part mentioned in my response that legislations will have to be effected in parallel with social education - to nudge, incentivise, or as punitive measures - to have all parties act responsibly to preserve the environment when acting in their respective roles as consumers, manufacturers, and natural resource producers ?</p>

              <p>The nature of the economy and economic growth today is not only unsustainable, environmentally degrading but it is also perverting our social system.
