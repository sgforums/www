              <p>So whatever I described matches these tenets of communism as developed by Marx?</p>
              <p>By labelling something as "communism", what are you trying to imply about it? Normally, "communism" implies an undesirable, 'evil' idea. Even if you didnt even investigate it thoroughly, using a negative label already helps you reach a conclusion. Thats Orwellian 'crimestop' isnt it?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Actually, angel7030 did not do any label. It was you yourself that made the claim of label implication and went on to derogatise communism as an evil idea.</p>
              <p>Personally, being an idealist, I find that communism is the closest to an Utopian state as any human can ever hope to aspire for. Karl Marx was right, I would unabashedly state.</p>
              <p>BUT, being a pragmatist, and aware of humanity flaws, what Karl Marx envison is nothing more and SHOULD be nothing more than a lofty aspiration meant for novels, and not for pratical use, being that, the People would have to surrender TOO much of their own liberty into the hands of EQUALLY flawed human to control which only leads to subjugation, as seen for 70 odds in USSR and close to a !00 years for China.</p>
              <p>Had communism benefitted both countries? None, if not, worse off than the rest of the world that followed more democratic models. Are you recommending our Singapore People to adopt communism or its tenets for pratical daily use? You gotta be kidding!</p>
              <p>How then are politics to be governed? Is the american model the way to go? Goodness NO! Flawed, but it is as practically best right now, at our human stage of evolution.</p>
              <p>Karl Marx or Plato, their ideas are but a human aspiration for a better civilise world. However, we are far too flawed to be ruled or rule others. To seek enforcement to force ideals is even worse, subject to even more potential abuse as USSR KGB had proven.</p>
              <p>Theological dogmatic potentates had failed. Communism had failed. It would be crazy to repeat such political ideologies for practical usage again. The american model is far from perfection.</p>
              <p>Best acknowledge that we are flawed and power entrusted into anyone's hand, no matter how righteous or upright he is, political left or right, opposition or ruling party, lies a POTENTIAL for disaster of tyranny.</p>
              <p>I have no answers, except faith in further education of every single human on earth, on our developement, history, and with it, our role and responsibilities to each other, and perhaps, a better political model may arise in future, though being a contridictory pragmatist, I have not much faith in powerful humans to become detached emotionless immortals, but rather have the fullest faith in their propensity to behave as clowns instead, including myself should power be entrusted in my hands, impossible as it may be.</p>

              <p>Developing on that example, what The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM) advocates is the total removal of money. Free yourself from obsolete principles such as "No such things as free lunches" etc. Technology allows us to automate production to the extent that human labour will not be necessary anymore, and still create an abundance of food, energy and all the amenities of life, eliminating poverty and suffering at no cost because the concept of money is already irrelevant. The question isnt "Who pays?" but "Do we have the resources to do so?"</p>

              <p><strong>"Principles are not tools by which discoveries are made, for they tend to close the mind against free inquiry. When men observe the world in the light of ideals which they consider sacred and timeless, they tend to develop priests rather than scientists...The principles of Washinton's Farewell Address are still considered sources of wisdom; the methods of [his] physician, however, are no longer studied..."</strong></p>
              <p>Although we could create such an advanced world today, the presence of money, creating distortions such as politics, corruption, crime, war- division within one planet, is hindering human progress because of the type of abberant behaviour that such a system promotes. When we live in a world of scarcity and division, there must the type of hierarchy you described. That social system is your frame of reference. It has nothing to do with so-called human 'nature', which is meaningless because the only thing observable is human BEHAVIOUR. While we have space-age technology, our social system and values are still that of the stone-age's. It is this understanding that separates TZM from other social organisations.</p>

              <p>Isn't what we're seeing in society the result of "a crisis designed for the benefit of the new technocrats with a more sophisticated model to be sold to the world"? Its just that the public does not realise the "technocrat" part of such developments. Look at the state of civil liberties today, how technology is being used as a TOOL, reflecting the kind of environment we are living in, to monitor and datamine huge populations. Look at how technology is being used to create automonous killing machines, improving tools to take another human being's life, how to inflict pain and dominate over others. Its not the technology, I'm sure you would have realised, its our social system.</p>

              <p>If the basic technology found today that is primitive and is already mobilised against the human community - what is there to prevent future and more sophisticated technology from being used against Humans, especailly in the future Z.A. world that require Humans to be devoid of profit urge, moneytheism, labor, political structures, class divisions, thoughts of aggressions, wars, or personal or communal needs ?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>There will not be any domination or hierarchy in a TVP world. Thats a stone-age mentality. When we could cooperate in a world of abundance, we chose to create a world of scarcity, which introduces an "us against them" mentality creating conflicts born of baseless pride and ego. With the removal of money, politics as we know it would vanish. Instead of the mess that we can politics, we would have a cybernated society. That is not machines ruling over us, not one individual making a decision but decision being arrived at through the Scientific Method with the most advanced tools available. Is there a communist or a capitalistic method to distill water? Is there a democratic or republican method of constructing a building? No, because both examples, just like survival, is a technical process with no need for subjective influences like as politics and ego associations.</p>

              <p>The Stone Age does not use natures resources in any profitable ways, how can it threaten or be in conflict to the High Technology Z.A. World of Utopian Equilibrium ?</p>
              <p>In your cybernated society, who controls the cybots that take over the functions of the Homo Sapiens ?</p>
              <p>There may not be a capitalist or communist methods to distill water - but without the standard of valuation - in the form of money - how will the future determine which resource is most effectively or economically resourced or used ?</p>
              <p>Without ego, without pride, without labor, without emotions, without enterprise, without motivations, without greed, without ....... is there any humanity left in the cybot homo sapien ?</p>
              <p>The basis of being a homo sapien is to live.</p>
              <p>While you focus on all the negativity in being a homo sapien to embrace Z.A in its entirety without further questioning - have you forgotten that as a Homo Sapien : Living is to discover, to develop, to create, to be challenged, to feel, to be passionate, to think, to hope, to aspire, to achieve, to indulge, to ........</p>
              <p>Is there any reason to be devoid of such humanities and allow cybots to takeover such human functions ?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>With decision-making clouded by politics, money (vested interest), ego/pride, corruption, it is no wonder that the social sciences, if it can be called a science, has always lagged behind the physical sciences.</strong> Yes, society is always in a state of flux, that is our scientific knowledge and technology, but our social system has largely remained constant and does not allow us to maximise our technology.</p>
              <p>To chose to remain with the unsatisfactory status quo, when an alternative promises a much more fulfilling world, is just closed mindedness. If the present social system is not promoting the human well-being, obviously we should move to a new social structure when we have to do so. The "truism" or "truth" you referred to are meaningless statements for nothing is true (absolutely), what was true a hundred years ago may not be true today. </p>

              <p>Or has it been a fact that technology is too costly under the present circumstances - given all things being equal - and leaving out the selfish corporate interests that prevent such technology to be introduced ?</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Just like our social system, our language has been corrupted and is a reflection of the state of our culture. An example would be the word "propaganda". Originally meaning any effort taken to promote a particular belief or doctrine, it has become a kind of "vulgar word", having many negative connotations attached to it. Its not a defence, but a sign of decadence. When we compare the world we live in and the language we use, both are similar. There is always a war on something, war on cancer, war on poverty, war on terror etc. We describe our world in violent and aggressive terms, creating a war-like, defensive mentality. When someone tries to point out someone else's error, it becomes an attack rather an helping that person to improve. In this way, progress is stiffled.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Can the word "propaganda" be a word of "defense" ?</p>
              <p>Is it not more correct to see this word as an assault on common sense by propagating falsehood repeated till it is seens as the truth ?</p>
              <p>Negativity exist from the subjective reactions of individuals - as in your ability to freely accept the seeming logic as you see while others maybe more circumspect to challenge its concepts to its core.</p>
              <p>If someone is intending to point out someone else's error and it is seen as an attack - it is due largely to the inappropriate approach taken to advance that help.</p>
              <p>Is this not obvious ?</p>
              <p>Can help be extended by identifying one's errors in an aggressive and in some very condescending manner that belittles the person being offered help ?</p>
              <p>The manner in which we describe our world depends on one's experience in this World - can a child in war torn Iraq understand what peace is about ?</p>
              <p>Or vice-versa, can a child in Japan know what war is about when its environment has been insulated from such brutality and horrors of wars ?</p>

              <p>To most people who are not aware of using a higher abstraction such as "communism", the term usually implies something undesirable.</p>
              <p>Labelling some idea as simply "communist", "left-wing" or "socialist" is meaningless <strong>because you're comparing the present with a past system with the same name and the same associations.</strong> When that happens, how can communication take place? In other words, how can you compare the communism in Russia in 1917 with an idea that just recently surfaced? Or how can you compare that same idea with the tenets of communism, which were never practiced, and were written in the 19th Century? If you want to label something as "communism/socialist/left-wing", it would be clearer if you specified what do you mean by "communism", in which country and at which period of history.</p>
              <p>To quote from <em>The Tyranny of Words</em> again:</p>
              <p>"The social 'sciences' look to the past, the physical sciences to the present. <strong>Economists, lawyers, students of government , examine the lessons to be learnt from history, unmindful that the procession of events we call "history" is an irreversible process.</strong> That an event never exactly repeats itself is a cardinal concept of scientists."</p>
              <p>As stated in earlier posts, there are no such things as "utopias". <strong>All social systems are in a state of transition.</strong> Even if we used the most advanced technologies at present to better the human and the environmental well-being (something which money is preventing today), we would only be in the beginning of another phase because technology is always improving.</p>

              <p>In your cybernated society, who controls the cybots that take
              over the functions of the Homo Sapiens ?</p>
              <p>There may not be a capitalist or communist methods to distill
              water - but without the standard of valuation - in the
              form of money - how will the future determine which resource
              is most effectively or economically resourced or used ?</p>
              <p>Without ego, without pride, without labor, without emotions,
              without enterprise, without motivations, without greed, without
              ....... is there any humanity left in the cybot homo sapien ?</p>
              <p>The basis of being a homo sapien is to live.</p>
              <p>While you focus on all the negativity in being a homo sapien to
              embrace Z.A in its entirety without further questioning - have you
              forgotten that as a Homo Sapien : Living is to discover, to
              develop, to create, to be challenged, to feel, to be
              passionate, to think, to hope, to aspire, to achieve, to
              indulge, to ........</p>
              <p>Is there any reason to be devoid of such humanities and allow
              cybots to takeover such human functions ?</p>
              <p>Will pro-creation be left to technology too ?</p>

              <p>Our social system does not allow us to maximise our technology
              ?</p>
              <p>Or has it been a fact that technology is too costly under the
              present circumstances - given all things being equal - and leaving
              out the selfish corporate interests that prevent such technology to
              be introduced ?</p>

              <p>Can the word "propaganda" be a word of "defense" ?</p>
              <p>Is it not more correct to see this word as an assault
              on common sense by propagating falsehood repeated till it is
              seens as the truth ?</p>
              <p>Negativity exist from the subjective reactions of
              individuals - as in your ability to freely accept the seeming
              logic as you see while others maybe more circumspect to
              challenge its concepts to its core.</p>
              <p>If someone is intending to point out someone else's
              error and it is seen as an attack - it is due largely to the
              inappropriate approach taken to advance that help.</p>
              <p>Is this not obvious ?</p>
              <p>Can help be extended by identifying one's errors in an
              aggressive and in some very condescending manner that
              belittles the person being offered help ?</p>
              <p>The manner in which we describe our world depends on one's
              experience in this World - can a child in war torn Iraq understand
              what peace is about ?</p>
              <p>Or vice-versa, can a child in Japan know what war is about when
              its environment has been insulated from such brutality
              and horrors of wars ?</p>

              <p>Do not forget that even diligent reporters have to answer to their
              editors, who are in turn influenced by political and economic
              heavyweights of the corporatocracy. A simple corporation? Again, don't
              forget that <a href="http://www.corporations.org/system/top100.html">of the world's 100 largest economic entities, 51 are corporations and 49 are countries.</a> Granted that was a study conducted in 2000, the situation may or may not be different today.</p>
              <p>I'm not familiar with the full proceedings of Watergate. But chances are it was a deliberate act to oust a president. I'll get back when I find out more about it.</p>
              <p>It
              would be nice to see some real journalism in action, having mainstream
              news cover events like the Bilderberg Meetings instead of the puppets
              at the G-8 or IMF/WB meetings. Other than the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/charlie-skeltons-bilderberg-files">Guardian coverage</a> this year, I have not seen any mainstream agencies reporting such a
              convergence of the world's most influential people at the Bilderberg
              Group.</p>
              <p>I was using the doctor example in order to make it easier for
              people to accept a world without money made possible by technology. Of
              course humans will construct the machines in the initial stage. Peter
              Joseph answered a similar question in a radio address.</p>
              <p><em>"<span class="author-74-36-206-69-1245045895043-39083">Who does it?
              Well, in the end, we will do it until we make the machines to do it.
              Then, the machines will do it. Basically, extracting raw materials from
              the planet is basically done by machines with the aid of humans. It's
              simply the matter of giving the machines that much more intellect to be
              able to do it themselves in a systems approach where you simply require
              someone to oversee it, And in the end, with the adaptation of
              artificial intelligence that can recognize problems, it will be more
              like a person overseeing a set of systems as opposed to someone
              standing next to one computer and one extractor. So, it's really
              contingent on how fast we choose to utilize our scientific knowledge."</span></em></p>
              <p>It seems like you arent really sure what is The Venus Project.</p>
              <p>"<strong>It's useless to criticize the culture without providing
              alternatives.</strong> The Venus Project proposes plans for social change that
              work toward a peaceful and sustainable global civilization. It outlines
              an alternative social design where human rights are not just paper
              proclamations, but a way of life. The Venus Project has a vision of
              what the future can be <strong>if we apply what we already know to achieve a
              sustainable world civilization.</strong> It calls for a scientific redesign of
              our culture in which <strong>war, poverty, hunger, debt, and unnecessary human,
              suffering are viewed as not only avoidable, but unacceptable.</strong> Anything
              less will result in a disastrous continuation of the problems inherent
              in today's world.</p>
              <p>Simply stated, a resource-based economy focuses
              on resources rather than money, and provides an equitable distribution
              thereof in a humane and efficient manner. <strong>It is a system in which goods
              and services are available without the use of money, credit, barter,
              debt, or servitude.</strong>"</p>

              <p>Money
              causes abberant behaviour in that corrupt and selfish acts are rewarded
              in a monetary system. A manager would willingly fire his employees if
              that would allow him to increase company profits and hence his income.
              Corporations would lie, cover up, scheme, cause human and environmental
              damage in order to make more profit.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From the FAQ:</span></p>
              <p>"Our problems cannot be solved in a society based on money, waste,
              and human exploitation. Today, money is used to regulate the economy
              for the benefit of the few who control the financial wealth of nations.
              Unless the underlying causes of planned obsolescence, environmental
              neglect, and outrageous military expenditures are addressed, we are
              bound to fail. Treaties, blockades, boycotts, and the like used in the
              past have not worked.</p>
              <p>Many believe that ethical standards and
              international laws will assure a sustainable global society. Even if
              the most ethical people in the world were elected to political office,
              without sufficient resources, we would still have the same problems.
              What is needed is the intelligent management of Earth's resources for
              the benefit of all and protection of the environment.</p>
              <p>Earth has
              plentiful resources. Rationing resources through monetary control is
              dysfunctional and counter-productive to survival. Today, we have highly
              advanced technologies but our social and economic development has not
              kept up. We could easily create a world of abundance without servitude
              and debt through the creation of a global, resource-based civilization."</p>
              <p>How do do know what <em>The Tyranny of Words</em> is about? Have you read it in its entirety? Otherwise, as Einstein commented, <strong>"Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance."</strong></p>
              <p>I do not understand how can you compare a TVP world, which has to be in the future, if it succeeds, and the Stone Age. <strong>Both are separated by vast differences in time period and technological level, just to name 2 of them.</strong> As I stated in my previous post, using labels tend to convey meaning inaccurately.</p>
              <p>The Venus in TVP refers to a community in Florida.</p>
              <p>What
              do you mean by humanity? Does it involve depriving people of the
              essentials of life in order to make a profit? You're probably
              associating TVP with dystopias like <em>Brave New World</em>, <em>1984</em> etc.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From the FAQ:</span></p>
              <p>"The aim of this new social design is to encourage <strong>an incentive system
              based on human and environmental concerns, and to avoid the shallow and
              self-centered goals of individual wealth, property, and power.</strong> These
              new incentives would help people evolve self-fulfillment and
              creativity, both materially and spiritually."</p>
              <p>Our present values are those that are developed from living in a monetary system. In a TVP, <strong>naturally new values will evolve as the old ones will be obsolete.</strong> Why do you think "values" are absolute? The Aztecs thought it was
              righteous to sacrifice tens of thousands of human beings at one go.
              Would you still think it is righteous?</p>
              <p>When did I ever state the
              introduction of merging humans with technology? At least that's the
              impression I get from your term "cybot" and your fear of losing the
              (human?) tendency to behave abberantly.<strong> Thats transhumanism and has nothing to do with this discussion. </strong>What I stated and what TVP advocates is using technology to help us <strong>arrive at the most efficient decision</strong> and to aid us in tasks like construction and production (just like in automated factories today).
              Have you ever used a calculator? Have you ever worn spectacles? Is that
              not relying on technology? Are you then a cybot and have lost any
              so-called humanity?</p>
              <p>Our social system, based on a monetary
              system, obviously does not allow the maximisation of present
              technology. We have the technology to build 100% efficient solar
              panels. We have the technology to tap geothermal, wave and tidal
              energy. We have the technology for energy-independence. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&amp;sid=aJ529lsdk9HI">Why do we have to wait 30 years for a glimmer of it?</a> If there was a Manhatten Project-scale effort to give us
              energy-independence, it can be done. That's why I said the answer was
              more of "Do we have the resources..." rather than "Do we have the
              money?"</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">From the FAQ:</span></p>
              <p>"At the beginning of World War II, the U.S. had about 600 first-class
              fighting aircraft. We rapidly overcame this short-supply by turning out
              over 90,000 planes per year. The question at the start of World War II
              was: <strong>Do we have enough funds to produce the required implements of war?
              The answer was No, we did not have enough money or gold, but we did
              have more than enough resources. </strong>It was the available resources and
              technical personnel that enabled the U.S. to achieve the production and
              efficiency required to win the war. It appears that the real wealth of
              any nation is in its natural resources and its people who are working
              toward a more humane life-style through the elimination of scarcity."</p>
              <p>Building
              on my example of "propaganda", as I stated earlier, its original
              definition was a technical one, just like the words diffusion or
              osmosis. But when its used today, people have attached so much negative
              connotations to it that it immediately becomes synonymous with
              malicious lies. How can clear communication take place when emotions
              are swayed using such inaccurate labels?</p>
              <p>As demonstrated time and
              time again in this forum, rebutals usually end up being some form of
              personal insult rather than a response to the points discussed. Its no
              one's fault. <strong>Its just that our society conditions us to associate
              being corrected with inferiority. Not only that, but we are conditioned
              to hold such static worldviews that it becomes associated with our
              identity and hence, when our beliefs are challenged, it is perceived as
              some personal attack and there is no chance for civilised discussion.</strong></p>
              <p>Other than that, you have already answered your own question.</p>
              <p><em>Can help be extended by identifying one's errors in an
              aggressive and in some very condescending manner that
              belittles the person being offered help ?</em></p>
              <p>Of course such an "unappropriate approach", in your own words, will only result in argument and I fully agree with you.</p>
