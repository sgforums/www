If there cannot be acceded to, let our leaders tell us their problems or better reasons.<br><br>Don't you think solving our artificially created high costs of living and doing business are long overdue. It is not a better of comparing with the worse examples whenever there is some queries in this regard. Why do our leaders always selectively compare with other governments' performance. Did other countries pay S$100,000 for a COE? Within Singapore, we can solve our long-standing problems without all these selective comparisons to suit arguments when faced with suggestions or criticisms by the people. The constant justifications and presentations should also be done away with if the new leaders want to involve the people in the next lap.
