            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lordofdarkness:</div><div class="quote_body">Dude, I see your point. But don't you think that any change required to achieve something remotely close to what Switzerland or other more developed Western countries have achieved is going to require painful measures in the short- to medium-term? Which could indeed make life more difficult for those already in a tough situation. What would you do if you were in the situation of the government? Do you think the unskilled would be willing to suck up more pain for longer-term benefits? What would be the reaction from businesses set up in Singapore because of the abundance of overly cheap labour? I don't think I have the stomach to endure the (potential) onslaught of criticisms from both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. But that's just me.</div></blockquote>The truth of the matter is - and that's easily attested to by the numerous threads going on around this place about the in influx of unskilled FT - what you see here is hardly the exclusive result of globalisation. If anything, the silly policies put in place by the fascists are every bit as culpabale (if not more so, which is more likely the case) as globalisation.<br><br>Just look around you - there aren't too many countries on the planet who depsite having 42.6% immigrants, expressed as a proportion of state population, are still going out with foolish policies to woo more foreigners, are there? It's not rocket science an average Joe will have little trouble convincing himself that, by the law of probability, there can't possibly be that many "talents" going around, is it? Contrast that with Switzerland's tough immigration policies (ie.minimum wage, stringent requirements on immigrants to acquire Swiss citizenship) which are obviously in place to protect the interests of its nationals. In spite of them having just 20% of its population being immigrants, the Swiss still boasts of a GDP per capita that's almost twice that of Singapore's. That should, at the very least, dispel the notion that having a high proportion of immigrants is an inevitable result of globalisation, not to mention economic development need not necessarily be bolstered by putting silly policies in place to woo foreigners who are hardly talented and in truth, merely doing jobs most locals are capable of doing.<br><br>As I'd already mentioned in an earlier post (and it's hardly a secret to begin with), why wouldn't any commercial entity gladly abet this regime in exploiting the source of cheap labour (both skilled and unskilled) available? Without legislation to protect the interests of unskilled locals, you can't fault investors for plunging for cheaper foreign sources of unskilled labour, can you? Afterall, it'd only be in their business interests to do so. When you further consider the fact there're few countries on the planet (especially in this region) which offer a wide pool of skilled labour at such low wages (just look around other first world countries and see how many of them actually pay their doctors, lawyers, engineers, accountants and other skilled professionals the sort of wage you get in Singapore for the similar profession), it just makes Singapore that much more attractive to investors.<br><br>It's no secret the whole scheme makes this an economically viable proposition for foreign investors and the fascists, even if that comes at the expense of the locals' interests, is it?</div>

Sigh!  Now they treat job seekers as criminals, interrogating them.  I was played out a couple of times.  We are just looking for a decent job with decent pay and why these people are so inhuman.<br><br>Hate to answer those crap questions, why did you leave and so on.  It is a stupid question - for those who just started work yes they may not wanna stay long in a job.  In general, for those who have few years of experience and above will want to stay long in the job.  But bear in mind, not everyone is lucky to stay in the job for many years.  Sometimes it is due to unforeseen circumstances that people leave.  Or it could be the case that when they go for interview, the company is not honest to tell the candidates about the job.  When the employee starts work, discovers that the job is not what really he or she is told during interview.  Other times, people leave the job when the dirty politics affect their rice bowls.  Politics is everywhere but if it gets to the point that it affects or break rice bowl, then the only thing one can do is leave.  So all these points that I just stated are not any crime, but when job seekers go look for jobs they are treated like criminals.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Come on, HR personnel and employers, will you people put yourselves in the shoes of the job seekers and be human enough not to humiliate job seekers.  Job seekers are already stressed!!!  Remember, not everyone is lucky and may be one day you people will end up like the job seekers looking for jobs.  Feng shui lun liu zhuan!!!  OK, be kind!!</div>

It is self-defeating eventually.[/b]</blockquote>What you obviously cannot understand is the demographics of the EU and Europe at large - and the thrash you espoused is hardly an adequate response to the protectionism practised in Switzerland to begin with.<br><br>Switzerland was just one example I used to address <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">lordofdarkness's</span></span> <strong>initial</strong> post. They are not the only living proof bearing testament to the fact practising a limited brand of protectionism actually enhances their economic productivity. Just go over a list of those cities with a higher wage index than Singapore's and it wouldn't be hard to find at least a third of those countries would, despite having a smaller proportion of immigrants (especially unskilled ones) than Singapore, actually have more protectionism in place than what you find in this regime. And we're talking about nations with a higher GDP per capita (in fact, they'd just about beat this regime on most standards of economic productivity) than what this fascist regime churns out...<br><br>While I see you've adequately quoted your master's take that it'd be impossible to "stop businesses from closing their factories and moving their businesses elsewhere", I've yet to see the case being made for the need to be wooing foreigners - despite already having a larger proportion of immigrants than most nations on this planet - for economic development to be completely indispensable. Suffice to say, countries engaging in some form of protectionism - from Canada to the United States, the EU to Switzerland - or other (and doing so without going out of the way to resorting to woo foreigners to an extreme) with a better economic pedigree than this regime's are aplenty and on the basis of that, there's little to suggest you need a substantially large base of immigrants to thrive. So much for the fascist rhetoric then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All over the world, economists point out to the failure of labour protectionism:<br><br>"..Countries with more left-leaning governments tend to enact stricter labor regulations, which yield <strong>adverse efficiency results</strong>. The main reason behind most of the interventions, however, is a perception of reality: the fear of a "race to the bottom." In other words, preventing "social dumping" motivates intervention. Skeptics have long warned that wages and other working conditions will decline in a pure free market. This skepticism has roots in the Marxist notion of capitalism, which retains its appeal even though economic history has hardly been kind to the theory in practice.<br><br>In Western Europe, on average, wages are roughly 10 times higher today than they were a hundred years ago because our productivity today is that much higher.<strong> We produce, per person, 10 times more value, which is why we get more pay.</strong> <strong>If we had not increased productivity, no regulations or trade unions in the world could have created such tenfold wage increases. </strong>Moreover, if wages in a free market are set below productivity, a competitor will benefit from offering the employees a higher wage. Thus, "social dumping" is largely a myth. Those who argue that labor protections are essential for a higher quality of life should ponder this point, as well as the material misery of countries that embrace such policies.<br><br>Why else would the world's highest wages be found in the United States, where the labor market is relatively free and only some 10 percent of the labor force are members of trade unions?4 Why else would multi-national companies voluntarily pay workers in, for example, China 30 percent higher wages on average than old, state-owned, industries do? And why did the average wages rise by three times in foreign-owned companies during the past 10 years?5 The desire to make a profit in a free market benefits not only consumers, but also workers.<br><br>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels pointed out that capitalismÂ—in 1848Â—had created more wealth than had been experienced by all previous human generations combined,6 but they thought that an elite group of capitalists would eventually capture all the wealth and leave workers poor. They were proven totally wrong. The global explosion of living standardsÂ—for all people, not just the richÂ—since that time is breath-taking, and it has happened to the largest extent in countries that followed Marx's and Engels' recommendations the least."<br><br><a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/htm/index2007_chap2.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/chapters/htm/index2007_chap2.cfm</a><br><br>The only way for poor Singaporeans to become richer is to increase productivity. No point competing with the Bangladeshi road sweeper because with a plentiful supply of cheap labour in this region (we are not in Europe), we cannot afford to price our labour above productivity. If a local sweeper can operate a machine that the Bangladeshi cannot and so able to do the job of 10 bangladeshi sweepers, then yes, he deserve to have a higher salary. Or he can leave his job and work in a wafer fab instead. The market value of a computer chip is much higher than a clean road, so he deserves a higher salary.<br><br>Labour protection will not work. The way forward is increasing productivity.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another:<br><br>"The Summer 1997 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives published two articles discussing labor rigidity in Europe.  Horst Siebert emphasized that the concert of<strong> rigid labor institutions in Europe was clearly driving higher unemployment rates </strong>there, emphasizing the tightening of policies during 1960s and 1970s.  While he observed differences among European states, he concluded by focusing on one common feature: Â“Job protection rules can be considered to be at the core of continental EuropeÂ’s policy toward the unemployment problem: protecting those who have a job is reducing the incentives to create new jobs.Â”  A contrasting opinion was provided in Stephen NickellÂ’s econometric overview, which reported, Â“there is no evidence in our data that high labor standards overall have any impact on unemployment whatever.<br><br>To summarize, the old caricature that Â“America is richer but less humane to its lower classesÂ” can be squared with some data up to 1980, when per capita GDP was higher in America but unemployment was too.  However, <strong>post-1980 it is clear that America has continued its productivity leadership (with higher income distribution generally), while European countries suffer high unemployment rates.  The Â“humaneÂ” policies of labor protectionism appear to have backfired, creating a less humane social arrangement.</strong><br><br>Nickell (1997) emphasized the diversity of European unemployment rate experiences (Â“from 1.8 percent in Switzerland to 19.7 percent in SpainÂ”) and policies.  NickellÂ’s approach is a good oneÂ—he assembles macroeconomic performance data for 20 OECD countries, measured over two periods (1983Â–88 and 1989Â–94), and assembles an impressive array of labor policy measures, which he uses as explanatory variables.  Nickell says at one point that Â“roughly speaking, labor market institutions were the sameÂ” in the 1960s and 1990s.  He concludes that unemployment rates are dependent on some policies (e.g., generous unemployment benefits, high taxes, high minimum wages, and weak universal education), but not the conventional culprit: labor market rigidity.<br><br>NickellÂ’s assessment has changed in less than ten years, however, as expressed in his recent paper with Luca Nonziata and Wolfgang Ochel (2005).  The authors find that Â“changes in labor market institutionsÂ” and rigidities since 1960 have indeed occurred, and these are the root causes, with <strong>employment protection accounting for 19 percent of the rise of unemployment.</strong> <strong> I think it is fair to say that the consensus view of economists today has evolved along the same lines.</strong><br><br><strong>A deep new data set published by the World Bank in 2003 and published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics (Djankov et al. 2004) makes a definitive case that the Â“Regulation of LaborÂ” (the title of the paper) can be harmful to macroeconomic outcomes</strong>...."<br><br>(http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&amp;id=4923)</div>

And we're talking about a country whose economic growth is in no way impeded through it not actually engaging in exploiting unskilled immigrants as a form of cheap labour. As a matter of fact, the hiring of unskilled foreigners is a measure meant to address its manpower shortages more than it being an avenue for cheap labour.<br><br>That said, there's just nothing to suggest there's actually a need to be excessively wooing unskilled foreign labour in the manner this regime has embarked on. More pertinently, there's nothing to suggest engaging in some form of protectionism in favour of locals for such positions actually jeopardise economic interests. If anything, through the limited hire of unskilled foreigners to safeguard the interests of its nationals, the Swiss have actually optimised an economic model whose productivity has actually been enhanced.<br><br>Through its brand of limited protectionism, the Swiss have not only managed to sustain a globalization-embracing economy that's the envy of the world (it's easy to forget some gnome heading this regime once aspired this regime to reach the heights of the "Swiss standard of living", although we're probably closer to Malaysia's standard a decade on... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ), but have managed to attain and structure a model whose foundations are self-sufficient and effective without the need to woo an excessive number of unskilled foreigners - which is the main issue addressed by the threadstarter anyway since "common jobs" hardly require a substantial amount of skilled labour - at the expense of compromising its nationals' interests.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If a company offers you a salary of S$1200 (before CPF deduction), will u accept? Most Singaporeans will reject for the following reasons:-<br><br>1)  take home less than 1 k;<br><br>2)  company too far from home;<br><br>3)  cleaners get paid higher<br><br>Malaysians, especially those staying in JB will GRAB the job! S$1200 is agak agak RM2000+ wor.... same job in Malaysia pays only RM900, the most.<br><br>For the company, the main concern is making money. Would you as a Singaporean give 100% if your pay is low? The foreigners will work their hearts out ah.<br><br>That's the difference....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
