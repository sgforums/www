Now they treat job seekers as criminals, interrogating them.  I was played out a couple of times.  We are just looking for a decent job with decent pay and why these people are so inhuman.<br><br>Hate to answer those crap questions, why did you leave and so on.  It is a stupid question - for those who just started work yes they may not wanna stay long in a job.  In general, for those who have few years of experience and above will want to stay long in the job.  But bear in mind, not everyone is lucky to stay in the job for many years.  Sometimes it is due to unforeseen circumstances that people leave.  Or it could be the case that when they go for interview, the company is not honest to tell the candidates about the job.  When the employee starts work, discovers that the job is not what really he or she is told during interview.  Other times, people leave the job when the dirty politics affect their rice bowls.  Politics is everywhere but if it gets to the point that it affects or break rice bowl, then the only thing one can do is leave.  So all these points that I just stated are not any crime, but when job seekers go look for jobs they are treated like criminals.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Come on, HR personnel and employers, will you people put yourselves in the shoes of the job seekers and be human enough not to humiliate job seekers.

Most Singaporeans will reject for the following reasons:-<br><br>1)  take home less than 1 k;<br><br>2)  company too far from home;<br><br>3)  cleaners get paid higher<br><br>Malaysians, especially those staying in JB will GRAB the job! S$1200 is agak agak RM2000+ wor.... same job in Malaysia pays only RM900, the most.<br><br>For the company, the main concern is making money. Would you as a Singaporean give 100% if your pay is low? The foreigners will work their hearts out ah.<br><br>That's the difference....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Exactly. If the government legislates to get rid of foreigners and force employers to pay S$2000 for a worker they can get for S$1200 in JB, the company will begin to seriously think about moving its operations to JB instead. Indeed, if the Iskander Development Region takes off, I am sure a number of businesses will move across the causeway.<br><br>Which is worse? Having the company here in Singapore where the employer is obliged to hire mainly Singaporeans (there is a maximum quota for foreign workers) or have the company move its operation to JB, with loss of all the Singaporean jobs?</div>
