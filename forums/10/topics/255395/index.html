            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time locals were spoiled for choice when finding work. Some sectors with high employee turnover rate, employers are allowed to hire a percentage of  foreigners.<br>This is the beginning of some problems we see today.<br>With too many foreigners in a particular sector, locals donÂ’t feel comfortable working in that sector anymore. Soon, almost all jobs in that sector are taken up by foreigners. Then, payroll dept also outsourced to the country where theses foreigners come from. Certain sectors even have training centers set up in that country where the majority of the workers come from, then followed by managers, GM, managing directors.<br>Now locals aged above 40 have difficulty finding jobs. This issue is still unsolved and<br>MOM  is talking about signing legislation to rehire retirees by 2012. Why not now?<br>Meanwhile, more locals are displeased with the govt employment policies as well as itÂ’s reluctance to change the employent acts which are biased towards employers.<br>We can expect that more people will commit suicides because of financial problems. I wonder what cause the scholar ministers so long to make decision. Or are they scoreless ministers?<br>They canÂ’t blackmail people to re elect the ruling party. In 2011.<br></div>

It is such a big and nice word which benefits the companies and the government of the countries.  It is definitely beneficial and profitable at our expense.  We in turn gotta be in competition with the people from other countries like China, India and so on.  Sigh!!<br><br>The only thing our dear gahmen said is to ask us to upgrade.  So what if we upgrade, they still give the jobs to the foreigners.  Government is also to be blamed as in the case of Singapore where gahmen refuse to protect the rice bowls of their very own locals who were born and bred in Singapore.  Shame on them!!</div>

In most technological-driven industry, acquiring cheaper labour cost benefits the company in the long run. The trade-off is only the routinise task faced by the production workers and may have adverse impact on their performance in the long run.<br><br>Safety matters and quality of workers cannot be lump together if the company has a good safety culture in place and abide by law and regulation in practice.<br><br>Last but not the least have it occured to you that if the most qualified workers in a developed society are willingly to do the job for a minimum sum then there is no need for company to relocate their manufacturing plant to China or India.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
