In most technological-driven industry, acquiring cheaper labour cost benefits the company in the long run. The trade-off is only the routinise task faced by the production workers and may have adverse impact on their performance in the long run.<br><br>Safety matters and quality of workers cannot be lump together if the company has a good safety culture in place and abide by law and regulation in practice.<br><br>Last but not the least have it occured to you that if the most qualified workers in a developed society are willingly to do the job for a minimum sum then there is no need for company to relocate their manufacturing plant to China or India.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>I agree that the wages have to be lowered to compete with cheaper labours elsewhere but the wages must also be realistic so that the bare cost of living can be met. How can a Singaporean sustain the cost of living in Singapore with forerign workersÂ’ wages? Prices of every other essential things are going up. Especially leasing of HDB flats.<br>Safety is definitely compromised when certain risky jobs are outsourced. I remembered a recent mishap where a worker pruning a tree fell and died. The basket at the end of the crane boom was tilted because of the crane operatorÂ’s carelessness.<br>This worker need not die if the employer has issued safety belt to him and ensure that he used it. I also wonder if the crane operator is certified to operate the crane.<br>Some cheapskate employers donÂ’t invest in safety equipment, safety shoes or even issue disposible gloves to the workers.<br>Of cause there are other factors such as time pressure or reduced headcounts which contributed to industrial accidents. All for what? Their bottom line is save costs, increase profits, no budget for the wellbeing of the staff.<br><br></div>

Honestly, it's not the issue of the skilled professionals which many Singaporeans find hard to come to terms with (afterall, there're capable Singaporeans working in other parts of the world too). It is ultimately the latter that's the source of much gripe amongst locals here for it explains why the poorer educated locals (who, in turn, have more limited job options) remain the most marginalised in the process.<br><br>If anything, " globalisation " is nothing more than a smokescreen used to justify the inadequate safeguards this regime has in place for those marginalised Singaporeans who are feeling the effects of such engineered "globalisation" policies...<br></div>

How can a Singaporean sustain the cost of living in Singapore with forerign workersÂ’ wages? Prices of every other essential things are going up. Especially leasing of HDB flats.<br>Safety is definitely compromised when certain risky jobs are outsourced. I remembered a recent mishap where a worker pruning a tree fell and died. The basket at the end of the crane boom was tilted because of the crane operatorÂ’s carelessness.<br>This worker need not die if the employer has issued safety belt to him and ensure that he used it. I also wonder if the crane operator is certified to operate the crane.<br>Some cheapskate employers donÂ’t invest in safety equipment, safety shoes or even issue disposible gloves to the workers.<br>Of cause there are other factors such as time pressure or reduced headcounts which contributed to industrial accidents.

However, I question whether there have been any safety practices inculculated to employers and workers alike prior to the 'risky' jobs they are undertaking. Having said that, I believed the government have already covered most areas of safety regulation and it is entire up to the individual employers' responsibilty to take care of their workers.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

But don't you think that any change required to achieve something remotely close to what Switzerland or other more developed Western countries have achieved is going to require painful measures in the short- to medium-term? Which could indeed make life more difficult for those already in a tough situation. What would you do if you were in the situation of the government? Do you think the unskilled would be willing to suck up more pain for longer-term benefits? What would be the reaction from businesses set up in Singapore because of the abundance of overly cheap labour?

            <div class='col-md body'>Minimum wage does not work. If you impose a minimum wage of $500 a month, that's the maximum that employers will give their workers, so long as there are workers willing to take the job. If you increase the minimum wage way above workers in Malaysia or china, they will move theor businesses there. The results is more unemployment.<br><br>Anger at unskilled foreigners? Why not ask the unskilled locals to take the jobs at the pay foreigners are willing to accept? Oh no, they won't want to live the cramped quarters and eat the poor food these foreign workers put up with and STILL have enough money saved to send home. The chinese worker in a recemt Straits Times report was willing to live on $600 a month and support his wife and child on that salary, work weekends and overtime for extra pay.
