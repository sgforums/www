              <p>Do not be taken in by the current euphoria in property price jump. There are a lot rich millionaires coming into the market from various parts of the world. The two casinos have "alerted" these sharks about Singapore. They have no interest of the well being of Singaporeans. They will take profit when the time is right. Who will have to bear the mess? You guessed it, SINGAPOREANS!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MAJULAH SINGAPURA!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note: Pls check for yourselves the various medias on the internet regarding some of the millionaires n billionaires who is setting up "home" in Singapore. Only then you will understand the true meaning on my warning.</p>

              <p>Singapore is a heaven for the rich and a hell for the poor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They don't tax the rich like other countries to redistribute income to the poor, the poor making little money will have to survive however they could.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Societal problems are caused by government policies, but these problems are not solved by the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like the astronomical increases in HDB prices which was caused by the high level of immigrants from 3rd world countries.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE promotes itself as a model of financial integrity. But, officials in Jakarta say, the wealthy city-state is a haven for some of the most corrupt Indonesians and their ill-gotten gains.</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/TN_money_0421.jpg"></a>Singapore denies that it turns a blind eye to dirty money and says that if sufficient evidence is provided, it is ready to take “swift and necessary action” against corruption suspects.</p>
              <p>But Indonesia’s Deputy Attorney General Darmono said: “Singapore is the most strategic country for corruptors to run away to.</p>
              <p>“It’s geographically the closest to Indonesia and the policy of the Singaporean government enables corruptors to live there,” he told AFP.</p>
              <p>Precise information on the extent of the illegal wealth allegedly smuggled out of Indonesia to Singapore is hard to find due to the small republic’s strict bank secrecy laws and the sensitivity of the subject.</p>
              <p>But a report by Indonesia’s financial intelligence unit in late 2006 said around 200 fugitives from Indonesian state debt were residing there.</p>
              <p>Three years ago extradition requests were lodged with Singapore for 15 corruption suspects, but the process has stalled due to complications surrounding a 2007 extradition treaty, Indonesian officials said.</p>
              <p>In a recent update to lawmakers, Darmono said most of 18 suspects currently subject to extradition requests over corruption were hiding in the city-state.</p>
              <p>Another 10 had fled abroad, mostly to Singapore, but were not subject to extradition requests, he added.</p>
              <p>The suspects include bankers who siphoned off hundreds of millions of dollars in state bailout funds during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, and tycoons of illegal logging, according to official and independent sources.</p>
              <p>“They are living the life there. Their lifestyle in Singapore is above the average,” Indonesia Corruption Watch activist Emerson Yuntho said.</p>
              <p>Arif Havas Oegroseno, director general for law and international treaties at the foreign ministry, said the proceeds from corruption were more than enough to fund lavish lifestyles in Singapore.</p>
              <p>“As they’ve invested huge sums of stolen money, which are increasing in value over time, they no longer need to work,” he said.</p>
              <p>The Indonesian Supreme Court convicted businessman Djoko Sugiarto Tjandra on June 11 last year for embezzling Rp546 billion (US$60 million) of state funds linked to bank bailouts in 1999.</p>
              <p>Like other suspects before him, he fled to Singapore on the eve of his conviction and is now the target of Indonesia’s latest request for extradition, Attorney General Hendarman Supandji said.</p>
              <p>A spokeswoman for Singapore’s Attorney-General’s Chambers did not comment on Tjandra’s case.</p>
              <p>“Requests for mutual legal assistance are confidential,” she said.</p>
              <p>On March 25, Indonesian officials reported that Gayus Tambunan, a 30-year-old tax official wanted in connection with a suspicious Rp25 billion in his bank account, had fled the country for Singapore.</p>
              <p>He was apprehended there a few days later by Indonesian police, prompting questions from officials and journalists in Jakarta about why this suspect was so easy to repatriate when others continued to live freely in Singapore.</p>
              <p>“Businessmen have a wide reach to anywhere; they have no boundaries. Civil servants have limited reach,” explained Attorney General Supandji.</p>
              <p>Another fugitive is Anggoro Widjojo, a businessman who police allege bribed officials to win a forestry ministry contract.</p>
              <p>He initially fled to China but police and graft investigators said that when they wanted to talk to him last year, he was in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Indonesia’s anti-corruption watchdog – the Corruption Eradication Commission – accuses him of launching a long-distance campaign through his Jakarta-based brother, Anggodo, to frame investigators probing his case.</p>
              <p>“Our concern is that Indonesia often makes the list of countries with high corruption levels. But there are other countries with low corruption levels that become the places of residence for Indonesian corruptors,” Oegroseno said.</p>
              <p>Indonesian economist and politician Dradjad Wibowo estimated that up to $120 billion worth of “grey money” from Indonesia had flowed through Singapore, despite that state’s clear laws against money laundering.</p>
              <p>“More than half of that money is funds from corruption, finance-related crime or other crimes such as illegal logging,” he said.</p>
              <p>“We hope Singapore will show goodwill but it can’t claim to be one of the world’s cleanest and best governed countries while still existing as a bolthole for Indonesian corruptors.”</p>
              <p>The situation has stoked frustration among senior Indonesian officials for years, but they appear to be reluctant to speak out about it for fear of riling Singapore’s leadership.</p>
              <p>When the frustration does boil over, they accuse Singapore of undermining an Asian neighbour’s fight against corruption – deemed vital to Indonesia’s economic and democratic development – in order to enrich its banking sector.</p>
              <p>“The country’s income comes mainly from selling (financial) services, and with more money floating around it has the opportunity to strengthen its economy,” said Darmono, the deputy attorney general.</p>
              <p>“It tries to gather as much foreign capital as possible. Unfortunately, the incoming funds include ‘illegal funds.’”</p>
              <p>Then-vice-president Jusuf Kalla was blunt in a 2007 interview with the Financial Times. “They’re thinking on the business side… That’s all it is. It strengthens Singapore’s economy,” he said.</p>
              <p>Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa avoids such stridency, but told AFP he planned to hold “informal talks” with Singaporean leaders about the issue later this year.</p>
              <p>“What we want to be focusing on is not necessarily the legal instrument but more the political commitment,” he said, referring to the long-delayed extradition treaty.</p>
              <p>He added that Indonesia believed Singapore recognised “the importance of dealing with these cases” and helping its neighbour to “enforce its core positions” against corruption.</p>
              <p>Singaporean officials bristle at the suggestion the regional financial hub’s integrity is being muddied by illegal loggers, dodgy tax officials and shady businessmen from across the Malacca Strait.</p>
              <p>“Singapore takes a serious view of crimes committed in Singapore and will not tolerate any criminal or illicit activities being conducted through Singapore,” the spokeswoman for the state’s Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau said.</p>
              <p>“In regard to foreign corruption fugitives, as long as sufficient evidence is provided to show that money laundering or any other offence has been committed in Singapore, the law enforcement authorities will take swift and necessary action to investigate and/or seize assets.”</p>
              <p>Indeed, Transparency International ranks Singapore as one of the cleanest countries in the world – and Indonesia as one of the grubbiest.</p>
              <p>Singapore was the world’s third cleanest country on Transparency’s corruption perceptions index for 2009, the only Asian nation in the top 10. Indonesia was a lowly 111th.</p>
              <p>Under Singapore’s Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, any person who knows or suspects that property may have come from criminal conduct is obliged to report this information.</p>
              <p>But a 2008 report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body tasked with developing international policies to fight money laundering and terrorist financing, rated Singapore as only “partially compliant” with its recommendations.</p>
              <p>It said “no enforceable powers have been exercised to require financial institutions to apply stringent or additional … counter-measures” in relation to money from countries that do not abide by FATF standards.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s money-laundering laws were “not effectively implemented” and there was a focus on domestic cases, leaving foreigners largely unmolested, it said.</p>
              <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore said the report “affirmed the high standards” of Singapore’s anti-money laundering regime and rated the state on a par with Britain and the United States.</p>
              <p>“In particular, the integrity of Singapore’s financial system is safeguarded by our rigorous customer due diligence measures as well as clear and efficient process for mutual legal assistance,” a spokeswoman said.</p>
              <p>“These procedures are applied to both local as well as foreign customers.”</p>
              <p>But in a study released in December on illegal logging in Indonesia, Human Rights Watch described Singapore as a “safe haven” for cashed-up Indonesian corruption fugitives.</p>
              <p>It said that while Jakarta bore the main responsibility for requesting assistance and pursuing cases, Singapore had to “ensure that its own banking and anti-money laundering regulations are rigorously enforced”.</p>
              <p>Human Rights Watch added that Singapore had an international duty to ensure it did not allow its banking system – the cornerstone of Southeast Asian finance – to be used to wash dirty money.</p>
              <p>“Although proud of its strong ratings on fighting corruption domestically, Singapore in particular is often used as a safe haven by business tycoons fleeing law enforcement in Indonesia,” said the report, entitled “Wild Money”.</p>
              <p>“Corrupt fugitives from justice continue to reside peacefully and house their assets unmolested in Singapore.”</p>
              <p>Indonesia’s parliament has not ratified the extradition treaty because of Singapore’s insistence on linking it to defence ties, officials in Jakarta said.</p>
              <p>Foreign Minister Natalegawa said the pact was in “abeyance” due to “complications in the way it was presented and the way the discussions developed”.</p>
              <p>“That notwithstanding, there is still room for cooperation between our two governments,” he added.</p>

              <p></p>
              <div class="entry">
              <p><strong>Shelley Thio</strong> -</p>
              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/js320240.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-25851" title="js320240" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/js320240.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"></a>Sally’s and Jacob’s only wish was to have their own home to raise their family.  When we met up with Sally, she told us they were facing eviction from their temporary home at a block of HDB flats managed by EM Services (HDB owns 75 per cent of the company).</p>
              <p>EM Services had given the family of 5 up to 4 June to settle their outstanding arrears of S$1,891.41 or Sally, Jacob and their children will be forced out of their home.</p>
              <p>Both Sally and Jacob are in ill health.  We noticed that Jacob’s ankles were swollen.  Jacob told us that he had an operation last year because he was suffering from slipped disc, a degenerative disease of the spine. Sally has difficulty swallowing and digesting her food.  She cannot stand for too long and suffers from fainting spells and has difficulty breathing.  Sally is unemployed and does not think she would be able to hold down a full-time job because of her health problems.  Jacob does not want her to work as she is too ill. The family is now living on Jacob’s salary, which is approximately $600 per month (net salary).</p>
              <p>On her doctor’s advice, Sally underwent an MRI scan that about S$300, which was subsequently deducted from Jacob’s salary.  For that particular month, Jacob’s take home pay was S$165.  Sally stopped going to the hospital because they could not afford the expensive medical tests and her medical bills.</p>
              <p>Their son was recently enlisted into National Service and will be receiving approximately $400 per month. They have a 22-year old daughter who has been unemployed for six months.  Their daughter, when employed, would be assigned to a part-time job or contract work.  The lack of job security and the benefits that come with full time employment – no CPF, no paid sick leave and annual leave, no medical benefits, to name just a few.  As Sally put it to me, “How can our young Singaporeans with low qualifications, like my daughter, going to ever afford a HDB flat when the jobs out there for them are only part-time jobs and also on contract?  No CPF, how to buy a flat?”  And when the CDC sent her daughter for an interview with Certis Cisco, the HR officer told her daughter to “lose some weight and then come back to us.”</p>
              <p>HDB had rejected Sally and Jacob’s appeals to be eligible for the HDB Public Rental Scheme and also, to make a direct purchase from HDB because both Sally and Jacob had $110,000 in their CPF and so they applied for a loan of $60,000 from HDB.   After several months, HDB finally replied only to approve a loan to them for the amount of $45,000 which by that time was insufficient for them to purchase a flat in the open market because of the recent price hike in COVs in recent years.</p>
              <p>When they were newly married, Sally and Jacob bought a resale 3 room flat from a direct loan from HDB.  They sold the flat and made S$70,000 from the sale.  With their new family, both Sally and Jacob purchased a 4 room HDB flat.</p>
              <p>In 2005, Sally lost her job at MOE.  MOE did not renew her contract.  At that time, her kids were still in secondary school.  Sally and Jacob met with their MP at Woodlands to write an appeal letter to HDB to approve their request to downgrade from a 4 room flat to a 3 room flat.  As they did not hear from their MP, they went to see him again only to be told that “he was not in Singapore”.  So, they went to HDB to request for the downgrade and as they received no reply from HDB, Sally and Jacob sold their 4 room flat.  They made $29,000 from the sale of their 4 room flat.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, they made several appeals to HDB to purchase a 3 room flat. They were informed by HDB that they had to pay a levy of $40,000 before they could purchase a flat directly from HDB. They could not afford to pay the levy and ended up renting from the open market, which consequently exhausted their savings.</p>
              <p>Eventually they were referred to EM Services and were given temporary housing.</p>
              <p>On 14 May 2010, EM Services locked the main door to their rental flat.  A notice was pasted on the door and they were given a letter informing them that their tenancy was up.  Sally went to speak to EM Services to let them into their flat.  EM Services agreed but gave them 2 days after which they would have to move out of the flat.</p>
              <p>When they were told by EM Services that they had to move out, Sally refused to budge and would stay in the house for fear that they would be locked out if they went out.  A maintenance man came by the flat and asked her when they were going to leave the flat.  Sally simply replied that they had no place and nowhere else to go and she won’t be leaving the flat.</p>
              <p>Jacob and Sally went to see EM Services and asked to be allowed to stay on.  EM Services finally agreed only on the basis that they paid their outstanding rent of $1,891.41 (3 months rental, outstanding utilities and penalties) by 4 June and their lease will be extended until August 2010.  After which there will be no further extensions to their lease and they will have to leave the flat.  They were told “to move out and stay with your relatives.”</p>
              <p>Subsequently EM Services sent them a letter informing them that their rent will be increased to $480.</p>
              <p>Jacob and Sally felt it was also unfair of EM Services to charge them $50 for late payment when Jacob informed EM Services that his salary was only paid to him on the 12th day of each month.  This meant that they could only pay their rent to EM Services thereafter.  The rental payment date is from the 1st to the 9th of each month.  After which there will be a late payment charge of $50 (even if the payment was paid one day late).</p>
              <p>Sally continues to tell us about the frustrations she is facing when she approaches the officers of HDB and CDC for assistance and guidance.  An officer at HDB had told Sally that both Sally and her daughter “should go out to work”.  Sally said, “These people don’t seem to care that we are sick and that my daughter has been trying to look for work for six months.  The HDB officer even asked me to borrow money from our Church!”.  We told him, “We go to Church for worship. Our problem we keep in prayers.”</p>
              <p>There seems to be too much focus on leaving families to being self-reliant and the Government’s inflexible and stringent policies do not go far enough to address the problems and obstacles that families in similar predicament as Sally and Jacob are facing.  The Government does not take into consideration that these families require more time to get back on their feet again.</p>
