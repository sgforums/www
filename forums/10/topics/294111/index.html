Say the minimum for part-timers to qualify is 1000 Hours a year. 1 of 2 things can happen. The staff will stop working when he hits 1k hours, or work for 2 companies with 1k hr requirement to get bonus.<br><br>Or staff a works 1100 hours that year, another staff works 2200 hours that year. You pay the same amount, you risk having dissatisfaction within the ranks.<br><br>Many other scenarios also. Like logistics parttimers who are paid per delivery made etc.. which essentially in same cases, are private sub-contractors of the logistics firm. that again is another can of worms.<br><br>Not saying it can't be done tho. Just that is going to take considerable effort on the part of the paying employer. Especially companies with many different types of part-timers.</div>
