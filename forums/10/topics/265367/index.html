            <div class='col-md body'>NZ-trained teacher rejected due to his age?<br><br>Jul 02, 2007<br>The Straits Times<br>I READ with interest the letter 'Is there a shortage of school teachers?' by Madam Jenny Sim Siew Hwa (ST, June 21).<br><br>I moved to New Zealand in 2000 and trained as a secondary teacher there to teach physics, science and mathematics.<br><br>While in New Zealand, I taught physics and science in an all-boys school as well as a co-ed school.<br><br>Recently, I decided to return to Singapore and applied for a teaching position with the Ministry of Education (MOE).<br><br>An interview was arranged and I returned to Singapore during my term break last April. I was surprised the interview panel did not even realise I was teaching overseas and as such had an overseas address.<br><br>Later, I received a letter telling me I was unsuccessful in my application as 'the crop of applicants were of a very high standard'. Looking at my teaching qualifications, teaching experience and testimonials from principals and heads of department I worked with in New Zealand, I was disappointed.<br><br>In New Zealand, I would be snapped up as I teach a specialist subject - but not in Singapore. On the one hand, I hear there is a shortage of teachers but my experience is that MOE does not seem to realise that.<br><br>It makes me wonder if overseas teacher training qualifications are recognised.<br><br>Or is age a barrier? Incidentally, I am 50 years old. I have read about how Singapore wants to encourage the elderly to remain in the workforce and thought my work experience would be an advantage to my teaching as I can bring relevance into my lessons.<br><br>On its website, MOE encourages mid-stream career change. Could it make its criteria clear?<br><br>The teaching profession has been undervalued and MOE is not helping to improve its image. In general, the mindset of employers in Singapore has to change to realise that middle-aged employees bring in more skills than are taught in theory.<br><br><strong>As part of the workforce that has contributed to what Singapore is today, I am disappointed and may return to New Zealand where I am better appreciated.</strong><br><br>Cheong Kam Seng</div>

Older means having more experience, which may be a plus factor when it comes to job searching.<br><br>I agree with TS that in Singapore, once your age group reach the 'Old' group, the chances of getting empolyed again is considered as low as even Zero.<br><br>Now the industries need people who are young, creative, and dynamic. As a result of rapid aging population, more and more old people have lose their job because of their age.<br><br>TS's case doesn't seem surprise to me because this is the world, the cruel world. You'll be disposed once you reaches your 'expiry' date!<br><br>Yes, you have made the right by going back to New Zealand. They at least will appreciated your myriad experience in specialize teaching field.<br><br>Yes, Now I am in an environment where my talent are not regconize, and I am getting out of here as soon as possible, maybe next year.<br><br></div></blockquote>This Age Discrimination problem is not about the World or the Cruel World...<br><br>It is about this Singapore, its government and their policies that created an EMployment Market that is biased towards hiring younger people only...<br><br>Just imagine, all these young whom are now employed, will soon some day become old and unwanted... and there are lots of them... where do they turn to??<br><br>Next, our ever decreasing Birth Rate is going to promise lesser local youngs in future, and therefore, our "Ever Wise" government will all the more promote the use of Foreign Everything to bridge the gaps of Birth Rates, Younger Labour Market, and Replacement of Lost Local Talents and Citizens due to migration to other countries...<br><br>This one, is PURELY caused by the "Ever Wise" government - whom many many of us could not choose to vote OUT due to 'WalkOver'....<br>So far, their  (the government's) talents are only used for keeping themselves In Power, and enriching themselves....<br><br>Do you think we should let them STAY in power much longer???<br><br></div>
