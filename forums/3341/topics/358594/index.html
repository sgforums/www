This will take form slowly.</p>
              <p>I have experience in Logistic &amp; Procurement however lack the knowledge in some areas. I need information on afew other things so that I can improve my business plan. I would also like to have a business partner to share the shop with. A business partner of operating bubble tea, if there is no one then I might take it upon myself.</p>
              <p>These are the following things I require.</p>
              <p>1. Capital for starting a bubble tea shop. (Franchise terms &amp; conditions, costs of equipments, etc - not including renovation, manpower)</p>
              <p>2. The market rate of rental at East Coast Park. Property agents may drop their contacts or offers.</p>
              <p>3. I need more partners to form this consortium. I have with me a Graphic Designer, A programmer, multi media designer, photograher.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't say bubble tea is completely out of fashion, but you need to work on branding and brand management to differentiate yourself from any old bubble tea seller out there.</p>
              <p>Don't just sell generic bubble tea, give it a twist. It's a beach, maybe you can start with the beach theme? If I were you, I'd hire several ITE girls and have them dress up in bikini' and mini shorts and call my bubble tea store the Mini Bikini Bubble Tea Inn. That's an idea. Sex sells. But no sleaze, just tease.</p>

              <p>bubble tea at east coast sounds like a great idea but why give ur plan away in a public forum? lol.</p>

              <p>Bubble tea is still fairly popular but not as widespread and crazy as in the past.</p>

              <p>since ur really eager and sincere, ill let you in my plan which I harbored 4 years back..I even conducted surveys at ECP over 4 weekends..</p>
              <p>Rent a small shop or shack or beach area..rent out portable bbq pits and peripherals, tents and other stuff..some sort like a haberdasher only the beach kind..coz right now, 7-11 remains the stronghold as the only 24/7 store and those out of reach from that area how? Make one where it's kinda out of reach from the 7-11 walking vicinity..coz when it's late at night, they can look for you..you can operate from evening to, let's say, 3-5am?</p>
              <p>when you reaped dividends, u can either make another shop at the other end or make it mobile..like a ninja van..just buy an advert space with ur number..hire someone or rope in a friend to deliver the items maybe via van or bicycle...</p>

              <p>OK people,</p>
              <p>I think you are missing the point. I am setting up a shop on recreation/Sports (I mentioned this beginning of this thread). It's just that there is extra space and I thought it would be a good idea to provide refreshments (other than soft drinks) like Ice Blended drinks on a hot sunny day at the beach. I do not have my own receipe or menu so the next option for me is franchise of bubble tea. this is just to cover some of the cost when business is slow. Since I will be employing staff, it is good they have something else to do if my primary business is slow. you can say I am fully utilising the resources (space and manpower). :D</p>
              <p>And to those who have not drank any bubble tea in YEARS!!!   The shop is at the beach, families goes to the beach. children and women. Take a good look at the Bubble Tea (e.g. Sweet Talk). Look at those situated at bus interchange, Shopping centres, those at the correct location have been busy.</p>
              <p>Master-_-, you are quite right that u did not start yr business, business will be very slow. Since alot of pple will order on-line from BBQ wholesale. If you are renting out portable BBQ pits, sooner or later National Parks will be talking to you about alot of rubbish your customer leaves behind.</p>
              <p>I just need some information on the start up cost of bubble tea. Just information, I may or may not take it up.</p>
