Logic is only that branch of philosophy that deals with reasoning.  It does not deal with all types of thinking such as remembering (Recalling past life included), dreaming (Dream Yoga), day dreaming, neurosis,  learning..etc.  These other types of thinking are the job of psychology and parapsychology.<br><br>Although evidence is needed to serve as a base for inductive and deductive reasoning, full proof evidence to arrive at a certain conclusion is not necessary in logical analysis.   In daily life, not all reasoning attempts to provide conclusive evidence for the truth of a given conclusion and more often than not, conclusive evidence cannot be produced.  For pragmatic ground,  we merely want the evidence we arrived at be 'well founded'.<br><br>As human, sleeping and dreaming took up pretty much percentage of our life.  We are not just a rational being, to understand human, we have to deal with all these matters with spiritual issues included.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote></div>
