              <p>I think govt is stuck on issue of handling religion issue in singapore and its constant belief that singapore is a multi religious country.</p>
              <p>It cannot get itself into a proper understanding on the fundamental effects of religions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly, atheism rejects religions' truth. Its a straighforward concept.</p>
              <p>Politics, on the other hand, dare not dare to take a stance. Instead politics calls for tolerance and respect, and in the end, totally avoids answering the main question, is religion telling truths or not? atheism does not call for religious people to be prosecuted, so why cannot we just educate people? No one is going to be punished for believing, but truth have a responsiblity towards these religious people in educating, not punishing them, why religion has no truth in basis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>atheism, has a clear answer. and it believe falsehood leads to more problems for society, so we need to educate people.</p>
              <p>Politics though, seems play the hide and seek game when it comes to religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Failed. If i am politican , i would do things differently from govt... I wonder what is in their mind. The govt is going to get more problems from their current policy because they do not understand the nature of the whatever problem enough.</p>

A secular state also treats all its citizens equally regardless of religion, and does not give preferential treatment for a citizen from a particular religion over other religions. Most often it has no </span><a title="State religion" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/State_religion"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">state religion</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> or equivalent.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A secular state is defined as protecting <em><a title="Freedom of religion" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Freedom_of_religion"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">freedom of religion</span></a></em> as pursued in </span><a title="Secularism" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Secularism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">state secularism</span></span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. It is also described to be a state that prevents religion from interfering with state affairs, and prevents religion from controlling government or exercising political power. Laws protect each individual including religious minorities from discrimination on the basis of religion.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact" style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since November 2008">[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="http://www.sgforums.com/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">citation needed</span></a></em>]</sup></span></p>

              <p>after reding about secular state concept... my conclusion is that</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>countries who adopt secular state concept are still going to get themselves in trouble with religion.... secularism is not a good policy... its a fact... trust me...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>secular state is better than religious state, i admit... but its neutrality stance is its weakness also...and it hell going to cause a lot of problems.. many many..</p>

              <p>i think its wrong to suppress religions from atheists concept....</p>
              <p>atheists should convince, persuade by non violent means like dialogue, debate, and conference....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, believers should not in anyway be punished or bullied. its atheists responsibility to educate and find ways to communicate with them.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Some of you here have very short memories how an independent Singapore came into being. It was not by choice, nor ideology and certainly not for religious reason.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Singapore's existence always hangs in a balance and many of us know seems to either forget, and ignore. This is attitude is dangerous to say the least, especially so after 9/11.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">We know there will always be under-laying tensions between different races, religion and different segments this crowded island. This applies to any other countries and societies. However, that similarity ends. So what is the difference?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Race/Religion tensions and violence are usually historical in-nature and gets infected from generations to the next. It is an endless cycle this is very difficult to break. Israel/Palestein, Pakistan/India. This are all God-fearing nations contantly at war for over 50 years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Singapore had been very lucky. VERY Very lucky, IMO, for the last 4 decades that race/religion is kept seperated from state &amp; politics and managed at a grass-root level.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">We see JI attempt to radicalise the general Muslim population.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">We see foreign religious groups doing aggressive works in Asia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">We see our neighbouring countries having to deal with constant threat by ultras who create tensions and instability within and with-out their borders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">And now we see AWARE saga a manisfestation of religion
              activism in action. This event is not simple exercise about moral rights or
              wrongs on sexual orientation nor about women's right. These issues have become tools for certain quarter's larger agenda.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Sometimes, you have to ask yourself to whom you seek truth with?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Your families? Your loved ones? Your inherent human sense of harmony? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Of some "holy spirit" which you believe that others of difference belief should subscribed to?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">If you seek the later, you are on your way back to the vicious cycle of hell-on-Earth that many today are trying to avoid or get out of.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Today's Singapore exist not by just prayer alone. It was the work of our forefathers sweat (minus the blood) who put their differences aside and work for their childrens future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">We are those very fortunate children.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Don't EVER forget that.</span></p>

              had missed an important classification of modern secularism which is
              defined as Hard and Soft secularism. The former regards any religious
              propositions as illegitimate, while the later allows tolerance when
              science and religion clashed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">Singapore system and ,in fact more of the today's Western
              political system, are regarded as soft-secularism. Meaning the
              religious institution (church) is separated from state and policy
              making.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;"><br>However, that does not mean total removal like what is done
              under hard-secularism. Religious bodies still have voice and view
              heard by the State.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800000;">If the Singapore secular system had been trying to hid the
              "Truth", as you had pointed out, then why is the SAF crest
              being blessed by several major Religions that are practiced and
              recognized under the Republic law?</span></p>

              <p>Not much use for atheism in a multi-religious country. Just remember to respect each others' beliefs.</p>

              <p><br>I beg to differ when you say it is not much use of atheism in a multi-religious country.</p>
              <p>Spreading atheism and succesfully convincing people in a multi religious country will definietly and greatly improve many aspects of the country, with catching terrorists only one of the many lists of benefits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A country who remain mutli religious will not progress so much in terms of science, discovery, economy, solving crimes, happiness level, creativity and good characters of people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The reason is because and based on the simple premise of truth brings real knowledge so that more knowledge can truly be built and expanded while falsehood build imaginary knowledge which nothing substantial can be discovered and expanded upon.</p>
