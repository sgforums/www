"It's difficult what happened, you know, but what can we do?

Two co-workers standing nearby were unhurt.<br><br>CBS Miami Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli said 'dry lightning', which can strike even when the sky is clear, can be very dangerous because victims are not expecting it and don't prepare as they might with a storm threatening.<br><br>Measurement of lightning strikes in the area Sunday showed only a few bolts compared to the last few days, making Marian especially unlucky to be struck by one of them.<br><br>Nobody else was injured when the bolt flew from the sky.</div>
