Newtonian physics is incredibly successful as long as you are trying to predict the motion of things that are not moving very fast.<br><br>It's like saying the earth is flat is not wrong if you are looking at a small scale.

But it's still not considered dogma because it can still be cast away should a better theory arise through overwhelming evidence and reasoning. One example is the origins of the universe. Initially, the prevailing scientific opinion was that the universe exists in a steady-state but as more evidences pile up, the best theory we have regarding the origins of the universe is the Big Bang theory while the Steady-state theory was shed.<br><br>Another example is the theory of evolution which still stands strong due to overwhelming evidence. If there is a theory which can explain the origins of species better than evolution, then evolution will be cast aside.<br><br>But in religion, scientific theories are discarded based on accordance with religious beliefs, and accepted if it fits. How convenient don't you think?</div>
