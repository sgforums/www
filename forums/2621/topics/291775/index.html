            <div class='col-md body'>This is why the word "f*cktard" was created. The court in the eastern town of Al-Qatif is apparently staffed by f*cktards.<br><br><strong>Saudi punishes gang rape victim with 200 lashes</strong><br>Nov 15 10:51 AM US/Eastern<br><br>A court in the ultra-conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia is punishing a female victim of gang rape with 200 lashes and six months in jail, a newspaper reported on Thursday.<br><br>The 19-year-old woman -- whose six armed attackers have been sentenced to jail terms -- was initially ordered to undergo 90 lashes for "being in the car of an unrelated male at the time of the rape," the Arab News reported.<br><br>But in a new verdict issued after Saudi Arabia's Higher Judicial Council ordered a retrial, the court in the eastern town of Al-Qatif more than doubled the number of lashes to 200.<br><br>A court source told the English-language Arab News that the judges had decided to punish the woman further for "her attempt to aggravate and influence the judiciary through the media."<br><br>Saudi Arabia enforces a strict Islamic doctrine known as Wahhabism and forbids unrelated men and women from associating with each other, bans women from driving and forces them to cover head-to-toe in public.<br><br>Last year, the court sentenced six Saudi men to between one and five years in jail for the rape as well as ordering lashes for the victim, a member of the minority Shiite community.<br><br>But the woman's lawyer Abdul Rahman al-Lahem appealed, arguing that the punishments were too lenient in a country where the offence can carry the death penalty.<br><br>In the new verdict issued on Wednesday, the Al-Qatif court also toughened the sentences against the six men to between two and nine years in prison.<br><br>The case has angered members of Saudi Arabia's Shiite community. The convicted men are Sunni Muslims, the dominant community in the oil-rich Gulf state.<br><br>Lahem, also a human rights activist, told AFP on Wednesday that the court had banned him from handling the rape case and withdrew his licence to practise law because he challenged the verdict.<br><br>He said he has also been summoned by the ministry of justice to appear before a disciplinary committee in December.<br><br>Lahem said the move might be due to his criticism of some judicial institutions, and "contradicts King Abdullah's quest to introduce reform, especially in the justice system."<br><br>King Abdullah last month approved a new body of laws regulating the judicial system in Saudi Arabia, which rules on the basis of sharia, or Islamic law.</div>

But i think there is a fluid interaction between these factors that you cannot address one without the other. Could you operationalize these terms further?<br><br>If not, about conscience, i believe like you do, that it is inherent and "naturally given" and of course, i would subscribe the giver as God, since we've been made in His image.<br><br>From the atheist POV, how would that conscience come about, since we're supposedly animals (or very closely related to them)? It is this conscience which made me ask the question in the 1st place, how do we differentiate good and bad? How do we determine the "ought tos" and the "should nots" in life? Why is there even a conscience in us in the 1st place?<br><br>For me, Christianity cannot be defined without the person of Jesus, whom He said he was the way to God, and if you know him, you would know how God is like. As such, I dont think that upon careful study, the bible would make anyone a bigot or male chauvinist. Modern christianity likes to posit the faith as something based upon love, good feelings and subtle humanism, but i take the view that true christianity cannot do without a God who hates sin, and a God who loves. That said, i've read the bible since young, and i don't think i'm "damaged" in any sense. But really, i've seen people who have grown up with the bible and richer because of it, people who have grown up without it and lead great lives too, but i think this issue far transcends our personal experience of it.<br><br>Another reason why i asked this was that atheists often suggested that since there was evil in the world, then God cannot exist, because he is supposedly good.<br><br>But if good and evil are subjective, then the problem of evil doesnt exist in an atheistic universe. Since everything is relative, there is no God, then there is absolute moral standard and nothing is wrong. The torture of little children is also not wrong, it might be painful, but it is not wrong (or as you mentioned earlier, the eating of human beings is amoral). It is morally wrong in a theistic universe, and therefore, there is a problem of evil of perhaps the psychological or emotional sort, but philosophically, the answer to the problem of evil is you don't have an absolute standard of good by which to measure evil in an atheist's universe. You can only have that in a theistic universe.<br></div>
