            <div class='col-md body'>just share with u guys how she turned from atheist to christian...<br><br>she was a very arrogant atheist, who scored A1 in bible knowledge for her o lveles and ripped apart the beliefs of her christian friends when debating religion with them. then at age of 19, she converted to christainity.<br><br>Having just entered oxford to study jurisprudence, she attended a christian union talk at a friend's invitation. wanting to leave halfway, she was "stopped" by a voice. "i basically had a sense that God was talking to me, " she recounts. ................. "And then i just had the sense that I had encountered God, that he knew my name and I was shocked."<br><br>i think she is a weak atheist, that is why she turned to god just because of this single occurence. Her atheist foundation could not make her overcome the "someone spoke to her event" Perhaps she did not know that sometimes, in depressed people or normal people, it is normal for them to hear voice speaking to them even when there is no one around. This has been reported in science.<br><br>I wonder whether i myself will become god believer if i experienced such things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christians love to claim that they were atheists but were convinced either by evidence or personal revelation.<br><br>Examples are Lee Strobel and Kirk Cameron.<br><br>And it's probably true. After all, we are all born atheists. We need to be indoctrinated in order to become religious.<br><br>But she was probably an atheist without any understanding. Kent Hovnid likes to use the word "purposefully ignorant" to describe atheists. I think it's a far better description for the religious.<br><br>Prof Thio simply trots out the tired old arguments constantly pushed by religious bigots.<br><br>Her argument that "atheism influences morality" as well is more nonsense. The difference is atheists have no dogmatic beliefs. Atheism is a lack of belief, not a belief in itself.<br><br>I fail to see why she should be concerned with the private lives of consenting adults.<br><br>I propose we start a religion where Prof Thio is the equivalent of the anti-Christ. Then we lobby for a law that exiles Prof Thio from Singapore and makes the name "Thio" illegal so no one can use that name.<br><br>Am I serious about this? Of course not. This law makes as much sense to me as a law against homosexuality.<br><br>But this is the kind of thing that Prof Thio and Christian nutjobs like her advocate.<br><br>But don't worry. The tide is slowly shifting. The god of the gaps is slowly shrinking. Hopefully, one day, we can talk about the Christian god the same way we talk about Zeus, Thor and the Flying Spaggetti Monster.</div>

Why can't she have a live and let live attitude towards homosexuals?<br><br>I really hope that one day Christianity, and all religions, will be outlawed.  And on that day, our Prime Minister will go address the nation and say, "We appreciate Christians and their contributions to our society. Singapore would not be where we are today without them.

(note: there is a distinction between the lack of evidence and evidence to the contrary, atheists often take the former as the latter)<br><br>The Buddha is a historical as well as religious figure, as is Jesus Christ, they both inspire and touch the lives of a lot of people ... am I influenced by both ? yes, I think so, at the highest level their messages of love and compassion has a lot of parallels ... and there are life messages that are not mutually exclusive to each "doctrine" as you like to call it ...<br><br>I used to take sanctimonious pride in being irreligious, until I realized the limitations of logic ... if you're a thinking man, you'd realized that logic only satisfying up to a point ... science as we know it explains the process of natural phenomena very well, but it fares poorly at explaining the mechanism of nature ... take evolution for example, I devoured books from the likes of darwin and leaky when I was younger, but I realized that while science has explained the "process" very well, it doesn't explain the mechanism, the driving force behind evolution, in natural selection for example, what decides which design is propagated in a species, which design evolves and came about (think flight) ... and of course, what people often fail to note is that science as we know it is not some unbending, absolute truth, but a changing set of theories that people come to accept as the "truth" ... until they are superseded by newer, better theories ... thus you can "know" all about the beginnings of the universe, atomic physics, evolutionary biology, but you would never be able to explain the mechanics of these, the "what made them so" ...<br><br>the catholic church, I'd be the first to admit, as certain sectors of the church would also, is not perfect, I know that much from my university european history classes, else we wouldn't have first martin luther and the assorted denominations that sprouted out later. The church of these early ages were also a political force, but I think it's missing the point when people point out the failings of men as the failings of the religion, of the message (so don't bother bringing up paedophilic priests ) ... religion is about the relationship between you and God, not about the temporal relationship between you and the clergy ...<br><br>My personal journey started off somewhat like Professor Thio's ... I can only describe it as a combination of "out of body" experience and a hallucination ... you can accept it, deride it, or write it off as an anomaly of the brain ... but I can guess that if it happens to you, you wouldn't be much changed afterwards anyways ....<br><br>the message is free, the gift is free .... you can choose to accept it, or not ... you can bring a sheep to water, but you can never make it drink ... perhaps one day you'd want to .... and I hope it'd come to you too ... you'd probably look back at this sanctimonious folly and laugh ....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Just as you, as an atheists, have this need for constant affirmation of your belief system (I guess that's the reason for this forum), so do "believers" ... some of us need not seek this affirmation, because we were already touched in different ways, some of us seek affirmation in the message, the doctrine, of the belief system if you will ... thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal, these are messages that all men can embrace ... more importantly, religion also acts as a moral yardstick with which we use to measure the conduct of our daily lives ... yes, the human mind is truly capable of believing in anything, but to do that without measuring it against the yardstick of your soul, is simply to be foolish .... which religion asks you to kill yourselves ? mine doesn't .... logically, of course, a belief system like that cult you mentioned above would not be sustainable, cos there would be no avenue of propagation ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>so you wouldn't say you believe in nothing, what do you believe in ? since I've shown you in my previous reply that logic, grounded in science as we know it today, is essentially wanting ? ... I could not quite decide if you were truly open minded, since you stated that you do not believe in the supernatural, it seems to me that by this statement, aren't you limiting yourself to the experiences your mind are willing to admit ... skeptic, free-thinker, atheist, agnostic ? ... pick a label ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
