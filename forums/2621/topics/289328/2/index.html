Hopefully, one day, we can talk about the Christian god the same way we talk about Zeus, Thor and the Flying Spaggetti Monster.</div></blockquote>Well, to be honest, I dislike the methods of conversion as well. I came to believe in God not because some guy convinced me to go to church, or because I want to meet more people or girls. Christians have to re-examine their position in this world, and not take history for granted. That, I believe, is the effort we all must make.<br><br>You make interesting points. However, I believe this is the point which we diverge, because I find that religion, or God for that matter, is impossible to erase. Short of a meteor strike which wipes out all human archives, no man-made methods or movements will ever be able to eradicate the presence of God. Ever. Why? Well, you could say humans need something to believe in. Humans also have this annoying habit of doing exactly what the opposition doesn't want. So be it.<br><br>People can ridicule faith; it's their opinion, but that doesn't mean it has to be right. It's like video games (I just finished that topic for PW). Those who don't play them will never understand what video games are like.<br><br>[This part is off-topic]<br>I spent my primary school years in a Presbyterian school. Even then, I did not become Christian per se; I just acknowledged that what those people said could be right. Maybe there is a God. Maybe this guy named Jesus Christ really did rise from the dead. I would never know, because I chose not to know. I shut myself off during Chapel service, pretended to sing along during those horribly off-tune singing sessions. I was... quite an agnostic.<br><br>Then came secondary school. I studied in River Valley High. A totally secular environment with strict Chinese policies. No place for religion there. Moreover, I was terribly busy with all my work. And, I met some of the most "devout" atheists there, most of them Christian-bashers. Yet, whenever I had time, I spent it in the library, reading books on religion and non-religion (books no one who strived to be ueber-cool would ever touch).<br><br>It was then I had this... drawing towards God. Honestly speaking, I could have chosen any other religion, given the variety in Singapore. Yet for some reason, I didn't. Now, this is the cruncher, some of you would probably start saying how those books must have influenced me and all, how I'm so stupid. Whatever. And it was really from then which I started to experience... things. Not say supernatural, but a very real presence. A very reassuring presence that gives me a nudge and says "Everything's all right, I've got your back." It's not my own voice which tells me that, it's not even a voice. I just know.<br>[End off-topic]<br><br>So, that leads me to my faith.<br><br>Still, it doesn't mean I can't use my brain to think through in the sciences or mathematics. Using your brain to comprehend God, I think no human brain can ever do that, because He is on a much higher level. Sure, you could say it's avoiding the question, and thus not answering it. But did any sensible, thinking Christian ever said he/she could answer it?</div>

Just as you, as an atheists, have this need for constant affirmation of your belief system (I guess that's the reason for this forum), so do "believers" ... some of us need not seek this affirmation, because we were already touched in different ways, some of us seek affirmation in the message, the doctrine, of the belief system if you will ... thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal, these are messages that all men can embrace ... more importantly, religion also acts as a moral yardstick with which we use to measure the conduct of our daily lives ... yes, the human mind is truly capable of believing in anything, but to do that without measuring it against the yardstick of your soul, is simply to be foolish .... which religion asks you to kill yourselves ? mine doesn't .... logically, of course, a belief system like that cult you mentioned above would not be sustainable, cos there would be no avenue of propagation ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>so you wouldn't say you believe in nothing, what do you believe in ? since I've shown you in my previous reply that logic, grounded in science as we know it today, is essentially wanting ? ...

Faith is essentially belief without evidence. Is not all religious faith blind? I see little distinction between the belief that your soul will go up to a spaceship and a belief that your soul will go to heaven/hell.<br><br>With regards to morality, I do not know where our sense of morality comes from, but it's certainly not from religion. The reason why there appears to be parallels between our morality and religious morality is because man creates god in his own image. The moral rules, the 'yardstick' as you call it, were created thousands of years by an ancient civilization based on their understanding and culture at the time. Our civilization and culture have advance far since those days.<br><br>I made the point before that the morality of most Christians does not come from their religion. Sure, religion does influence it but the Christians by and large use what's in the bible to support their own sense of morals and ignore the rest.<br><br>We no longer feel it is right to keep slaves. We now accept that one 'race' of people is not inherently better than another. We are now even beginning to question the concept of race. We by and large do not feel it's acceptable to slaughter people just because their beliefs are different from ours. We no longer feel it's right to offer our daughters to rapists in order to appease them. We value women much more highly now and believe they are the equal of men. We no longer believe it is right to offer our children as a burnt offering to appease god.<br><br>And we are the better for it.<br><br>I think you have a very misguided view of the atheist/skeptic world view. I don't come here for affirmation of my belief system. I get my affirmation through evidence.<br><br>I also don't see how 'logic, grounded in science' is wanting'? The scientific method is essentially about observing the world around us. True, science cannot explain everything... yet. But that doesn't mean religion has the answer. Making up an answer doesn't solve anything. Human intuition is a powerful thing, but it is often wrong. Human intuition often allows us to make great hypothesis but it is the scientific method that allows us to determine if that hypothesis is correct.<br><br>So what do I believe in? I believe in rational thought and I believe in evidence. It's about being open minded but not so open minded that your brains fall out.<br><br>There is one 'accusation' I never quite understood that we just refuse to acknowledge the evidence around us. It goes something like "you just refuse to acknowledge god's existence because you don't want to face up to him" or "this works, you just don't want to admit it."<br><br>Why would I, or anyone else, refuse to acknowledge such evidence. If intercessionary prayer really worked, would we be overjoyed that we can cure more people? Wouldn't pray be automatically part of any medical procedure? If magic was real, wouldn't we be thrilled to have another means to get stuff done? We could use magic to perhaps reduce fuel consumption and improve the efficiency of cars. But there's just no evidence.<br><br>Finally I'm not limiting my self to any experience. I experience what I experience. But I accept them for what they are. I don't make up some story to explain it.<br><br></div>

The statements "God exists" and "God does not exist" are both unfalsifiable, since they're not scientific statements which can be subject to scientific methods of dealing with natural phenomena.

Those terms are not scientific statements because God has been defined in a way that makes the concept unfalsifiable.<br><br>You are absolutely correct that science cannot make any claims about God itself. However, where God is claimed to interact with the physical world, that is falsifiable. And time and time again, studies have shown there is no supernatural being who interacts with the world.<br><br>Of course, you could bring up the argument that God intends to be hidden.
