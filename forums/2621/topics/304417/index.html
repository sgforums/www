Which particular Religion do you refer to?<br><br>FYI, Christianity talks about living live to the fullest, it talks about being propserous, rich and being healthy. It talks about treasuring every little relationship on earth, be it kinship, or Love with your spouse. It also talks about honoring your parents.<br><br>It is also not appropriate to post this thread here in Chit-chat thread because you are denying "these religious zealots" a chance to correct your mis-conception.<br><br>Post it in all the religious threads in SGforum to better make your point.</div>
