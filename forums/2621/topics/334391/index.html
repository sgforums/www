              <p>If yes, tell me about his meaningful life as in how meaningful can it be? Or can it be by believing in god till the end of life itself is something meaningful?</p>

              <p>Comes back to my starting point. If there is a supreme being who created you, he must have done it for a purpose. And if there is no purpose, you fall into an existence of nothingness. Where you try to create your own purpose which does'nt allign to the grander scheme of things.

              <p><br>Depends on your ideology. Different religions have different beliefs.  I am an agnostic theist. I believe in a supreme being based on intelligent design after studying a very paradoxical microscopic single celled organism that had a flagella when it had no reason to have one <em>based on darwinian theory of evolution. </em>And all of life on earth today sprouted out of that flaw. I belive in evolution not creationism. But I believe that the first paticles fit to be called life was put on earth by God.</p>
              <p>I am not talking about fear in terms of fear of God, like the fear the Israelites had after Moses destroyed the Tablets and God punished them.</p>
              <p>I am talking about the fear that is the emotion after realising that there is purpose in life.</p>
