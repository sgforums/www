I cannot prove god exists and I cannot prove god doesn't exist also, therefore I do not bother with others' theist or atheist beliefs.</blockquote>Take a look at these videos, imo by a very smart guy - his arguements are very strong.<br><br>Agnosticism is Silly: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POWCpqTplXc<br>Why agnosticism is not a relevant answer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9wnV1AReSo<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The agnostic position is very important in the search for any truths. It is being able to respect what-is-now-considered-true while not refusing to realize that that knowledge may be superseded with new information and experience.</div>
