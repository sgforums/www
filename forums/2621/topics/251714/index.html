Many things still cannot be done...<br><br>as for religion and "hard atheism"... they tend to hold on to "positions"<br><br>if you are a "hard" agnostic and since you are only "swinging" towards it, I guess you are not.. you will be as "certain" as both atheists and religious people...<br><br>that is to indulge in logical "fallacy".... for in reality... everything is changing constantly... there is, as Buddhism calls it, "no inherent existence"....<br><br>for me to continue from here on would be complicated...</div>

Means there are other realms of existence according to Buddhism... which we usually never see, including ghosts, animals (we usually see them), and others.. including devas which you may say they are 'gods' in celestial places but we do not worship them. We do not worship anyone at all even the Buddha let alone someone still trapped in samsara and fundamental ignorance, not yet enlightened.<br><br>Therefore since Buddhism is not a divine-centered religion or we rely on the divine for some intervention or some better future lifetime, but rather it is about transforming every single person and to lead everyone to realisation of our true nature, and it is about liberation from all sufferings and attaining the unconditioned lasting bliss of Nirvana, those existence of unseen beings are not so important or relevant to our practice (which suggests that if you insists on not believing in their existence you can of course, still practise Buddhism and gain insights).. but we cant say they don't exist just because most of us can't see them... we can't say there are no extra-terrestrials either. Anyway, many people, including I, have undoubtedly witnessed paranormal beings like ghosts before. There are others who through their practise have also seen even further varieties of beings... But anyway already besides the point.</div>

Classical science will not be able to explain this because classical science is limited to time-space relativity. But if you take a look at Quantum Physics, you can actually find many insights that corresponds well to Buddhism and can really explain quite some stuff as well. I am confident that as these scientific studies develope more and more findings will prove Buddhist teachings. In fact there are so many things that Buddhism already knew for a long time, that are only now discovered by scientists.<br><br>Now these paranormal happenings -- they are not supernatural, but they are non local activities of the nature of our universe. They are just as it is. You may want to look at how due to the non-local nature of our universe electrons can communicate each other at absolutely no time at all, regardless of the distance: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=178391" rel="nofollow">The Universe as a Hologram - Holographic Reality</a> (btw this is a very very good article, it is not about supernatural abilities about how science can link to the teachings of Emptiness and non-local consciousness, but the book does have many examples of how supernatural activities were possible in the light of the holographic universe.. a v good book):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Aspect and his team discovered that under certain circumstances subatomic particles such as electrons are able to instantaneously communicate with each other regardless of the distance separating them. It doesn't matter whether they are 10 feet or 10 billion miles apart.<br><br>Somehow each particle always seems to know what the other is doing. The problem with this feat is that it violates Einstein's long-held tenet that no communication can travel faster than the speed of light. Since traveling faster than the speed of light is tantamount to breaking the time barrier, this daunting prospect has caused some physicists to try to come up with elaborate ways to explain away Aspect's findings. But it has inspired others to offer even more radical explanations... (pls cont reading from URL)</span><br><br>The article really explains very well so do read the whole thing. And you know what... Buddhism has always already knew that the nature of reality as Emptiness and Non-Locality. Emptiness is not a void, it means interdependent origination and that everything lack solid separate inherent existence -- they are dependently arisen out of conditions, only conditions are needed.<br><br>The principle of conditionality in Buddhism:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When there is this, that is.<br>With the arising of this, that arises.<br>When this is not, neither is that.<br>With the cessation of this, that ceases.</span><br><br>Another great example of Dependent Origination is also found in the Net of Indra teachings:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=129929" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=129929</a><br><br><img src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y199/xabir/indras_net.jpg"><br><br>The metaphor of Indra's Jeweled Net is attributed to an ancient Buddhist named Tu-Shun (557-640 B.C.E.) who asks us to envision a vast net that:<br><br>* at each juncture there lies a jewel;<br>* each jewel reflects all the other jewels in this cosmic matrix.<br>* Every jewel represents an individual life form, atom, cell or unit of consciousness.<br>* Each jewel, in turn, is intrinsically and intimately connected to all the others;<br>* thus, a change in one gem is reflected in all the others.<br><br>This last aspect of the jeweled net is explored in a question/answer dialog of teacher and student in the Avatamsaka Sutra. In answer to the question: "how can all these jewels be considered one jewel?" it is replied: "If you don't believe that one jewel...is all the jewels...just put a dot on the jewel [in question]. When one jewel is dotted, there are dots on all the jewels...Since there are dots on all the jewels...We know that all the jewels are one jewel" ...".</blockquote>And in Buddhism, it is completely possible to wake up to our own true nature as Non-local and Empty luminosity - means non local consciousness. When we wake up to that, we attain enlightenment, and though I am not yet enlightened many others are even today.. some even post in my forum.<br><br>To be continued in the next post...</div>

He is looking forward to getting the book 'The End of Suffering', which contains many Buddhist teachings as well. Here's an interview with him, it doesnt answer your questions you asked, but anyway thought you might be interested... <a href="http://www.consciousmedianetwork.com/members/rtarg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.consciousmedianetwork.com/members/rtarg.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>The End of Suffering<br>(Running time = 36 mins)</strong><br><br>Regina first interviewed Russell Targ almost 21 years ago just before he was leaving for the Soviet Union to take part in an experiment with Brezhnev's psychic healer, in what was to become a well known documentation on the efficacy of remote viewing for military purposes.<br><br>Russell Targ is a physicist and author who has devoted much of his professional career to the research of the human capacity for psychic ability. In 1972, he co-founded the Stanford Research Institute's federally-funded program that investigated psychic abilities in humans. The program provided invaluable information and techniques to various government intelligence agencies, including the DIA, the CIA, NASA, and Army Intelligence. In his ten years with the program, Targ co-published his findings in some of the most prestigious scientific journals. He is the co-author, with Jane Katra, of five books about psychic abilities, two of which are: Miracles of Mind: Exploring Non-local Consciousness &amp; Spiritual Healing, and The Heart of the Mind: How to Experience God Without Belief.<br><br>Russell was also quite active in the development of the laser and its various applications, having written over fifty articles on advanced laser research. He is a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers and has received two NASA awards for inventions and contributions in laser and laser communications. Recently retiring from his position as senior staff scientist at Lockheed Martin, Russell now devotes his time to ESP research and offering workshops on remote viewing and spiritual healing.<br><br>In an abstract from a research paper, Russell said, "Since ancient times spiritual teachers have described paths and practices that a person could follow to achieve health, happiness, and peace of mind. A considerable body of recent research indicates that any kind of spiritual practice is likely to improve ones prognosis for recovering from a serious illness. Many of these approaches to spirituality involve learning to quiet the mind, rather than adhering to a prescribed religious belief. These meditative practices are inherent aspects of Buddhism, Hinduism, mystical Christianity, Kabalistic Judaism, Sufism, and other mystic paths. What is indicated in the subtext of these teachings is that as one learns to quiet his or her mind, one is likely to encounter psychic-like experiences or perceptions. For example, in The Sutras of Patanjali, the Hindu master tells us that on the way to transcendence we may experience many kinds of amazing visions, such as the ability to see into the distance, or into the future; and to diagnose illnesses, and also to cure them. However, we are admonished not to become attached to these abilities - that they are mere phenomena standing as stumbling blocks on the path to enlightenment. In this paper, I will describe my recent experience in teaching remote viewing at three workshops in Italy, in which we emphasize expanded awareness of who we are, rather than an ability to find car keys and parking spaces. Our spiritual approach, did not interfere with all three of these groups demonstrating highly significant remote viewing in a double-blind setting."</span></blockquote>p.s.
