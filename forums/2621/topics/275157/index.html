Moreover, these claims that "Science OWNZORZ Religion" usually have the underlying thoughts of "Religion is anti-science".</strong></blockquote><strong>I wouldn't exactly say that science is the one universal truth. However, I would say that the scientific method, which is basically how we define what science is, is the only way to determine what the truth is. This of course brings us to the discussion we have had many times before on the nature of truth.<br><br><blockquote>Before I embark on any long anecdotes or analysis, let me say that being religious does not automatically condemn one to the ghetto of the anti-science. I'm currently a JC1 Science student and have a great appreciation for the sciences (especially Chemistry) and what they have done for me today. Science is good, yes. </blockquote>But what happens when science comes in conflict with religion? Do you accept scientific evidence, or follow religious dogma. If you adapt your religious views to agree with scientific evidence, I might argue that those religious views are superfluous.<br><br><blockquote>However, the point in which many of you would probably disagree with me is that I feel that Science is a tool. Yes, you read that right, a tool. It's the sharp machete that helps us cut through the overgrown vegetation of the unknown.

Science, sadly, is not perfect, because it is a human by-product.</blockquote>Well I think everyone would agree that science <span style="font-style: italic;">IS</span> is tool. It's a tool for us the overcome our limitations and biases to determine the truth. I would argue also that the scientific ideal is perfect, but in the practical sense, we can attempt to achieve the scientific ideal, but physical limitations prevent us from reaching it. Thus, there will always be some level of uncertainty.<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand religion would probably be the human gut instinct which tells us what to cut down with the machete and what to leave standing. Sometimes it's wrong. Sometimes what we thought was dangerous turned out to be fine after all, like how the Church dismissed Copernicus' claim of a heliocentric Solar System.

(Note that I didn't say God is unreliable. Don't get into semantics.)</blockquote>I'm glad you mentioned this point. Religion is also man-made.<br><br><blockquote>So you see, to destroy that gut feeling isn't exactly a wise thing to do. Things don't always turn out as we expect them to in reality. One might think, "If I cut down that tree at this angle, it would miss me. So let's get chopping!". But the guy might end up as strawberry jam anyway, because he ignored the gut feeling that told him there might be vines and branches of other trees that might shift the angle of the tree.</blockquote>Erm... you are starting to lose me. The gut instinct is as often wrong as it is right. When rock climbing, your gut tells you to press yourself against the rock face as closely as possible. However, through training and evidence, you learn that it's actually better to push your butt out so that your feet can get leverage against the rock face.<br><br>When your car skids out of control, your instinct is to slam on the brakes. Again, it's through training and education where you learn that the best way to regain traction is to feather the brakes.<br><br><blockquote>Finding a balance should be key. Best yet, have the two consult each other. Sure, the process may be slow, but this way, you will end up satisfying both, and what is better than having the best of both worlds?</blockquote>Your gut allows you to form hypothesis. You use your gut to generate SWAGs (Scientific Wild Assed Guesses). However, the scientific method is the only way where you can determine if your SWAG is correct. At the end of the day, where your gut and science comes into conflict, you must let the evidence obtained by science win.<br><br><blockquote>One thing to ponder: Does the system exist because there is no other system that can fulfill its role? Does the system exist because the other systems are unsatisfactory? Or does the system exist because people want it to exist? Think about it.</blockquote>I think religion exists because people want explanations. Our science cannot explain everything and in fact, there may be some things that are inherently unknowable. However, if we don't know something, we should just admit that we don't and continue working to learn more about it. We shouldn't make up an explanation.<br><br>Peace.</strong></div>
