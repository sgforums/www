              <p>its fair to say that religion and their leaders do try to promote good morals and teachings to younger generation generally speaking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>morals like honesty and peace is being preached. However, religion is inefficiency means to achieve the correct morals and stuff. good morals are hard to decide anyway, in our dog eat dog world. Like i say, to use a god as a guide is nonsenscial, because there is simply no truth in it. Therefore, it is unwise to promote peace and progress of humanity using a false idea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lets use more practical ways that people are using in the world. Its time for religion to expire its existence gradually.</p>

              brother. do u even know what u talking about? lol . . its okay if u dun believe in the existence of God. but once u start to try to bullshit ur way out with some smart talk . i just felt compelled to bust ur balls. 
              
              things like morality n law has existed side by side with religion. hell if u did thorough study u will notice that many of these are based on the teachings of religions. ur great contributors of mankinds development was in part the belief that a greater being existed. while thr age of enlightenment gave us the power of science, when arguably science anf religion cannot stand side by side has been proven that it is not so. now i am not arguing whether god exist or not. just that do u even know why thr world is a dog eat dog world now? atheism did not come about after the age of enlightenment. that is when preople like darwin , marx ,come about with these thoery. the age of classification during the age of enlightenment.
              
              As the world becomes more complex only those tha believe in nothing n only themselves foster thr dog eat dog world. as the persuit of more material rather then immaterial salvation of eternal happiness at the pearly gates. we become what it is. china n russia for example is a country with no religion. well. . at least allowing the practice of religion.

              <p>I last time army everyweek also have to pass cemetery...</p>
              <p>anyway.. whatever my reasons are..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the truth is only that there is no god or ghost. the conclusion comes from a process of reasoning, mathematics and other science knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the part about freethinkers who allow others to practice their religions, what they are doing is that they allow them to continue to have an uncritical mind. Therefore, the society will progress slower than possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believed, we should not co-erce people to disbelieve. However, we can encourage and convince them. That being said, I seldom spend time on atheism or promoting it frequently anyway. I only use this atheism forum once a while.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My explanation is simple. If the world is filled with people who are supertitious, then the world and its people will progress slowly. That is a fact. Another fact is this. The rich poor gap of the world can also be partly explained by the fact that majority of the world citizens are mostly concerned with their own lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, i am concerned with my own live also. However, I know others will also affect my lives. therefore, sometimes I have to do things outside my own lives and interfere with others. I am selfish person actually.</p>

              <p>Ha. This is a common argument used by believers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what am I supposed to believed then? God is a flying dog wearing nike shirt all the time. Humans do not have all the knowledge, so the correct actions is not to make superficial claims, like what religions do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so who are we supposed to pray to. A key? A dog? A sacred stone? Maybe these things are god because the god embedded in these things cannot be detected by human measurements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So start kneeling down whenever you guys encounter a dog today and pray for your allegience to gods. If scientist ask you why you are praying to the dog, you just reply," well, its something that is beyond our dimension and something beyond science, therefore, these dogs are not just animals. They are actually god hidden in dogs bodies and checking out the world to gather information.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We cannot perceive what lies in the higher dimensions, just like how an animated sentient object in a 2 spatial dimensions world (think a hypothetical neurologically conscious and intelligent individual drawn on a cardboard trying to visualize our world) would not see/interact with our world and ultimately, us.  "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what are you waiting for, starting praying to dogs now. To add on, we can add the pascal wager. If I pray to dog and go to heaven, i win. If I pray to dog and get it wrong, its ok, i dun lose much."</p>

              <p>I last time army everyweek also have to pass cemetery...</p>
              <p>anyway.. whatever my reasons are..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the truth is only that there is no god or ghost. the conclusion comes from a process of reasoning, mathematics and other science knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the part about freethinkers who allow others to practice their religions, what they are doing is that they allow them to continue to have an uncritical mind. Therefore, the society will progress slower than possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believed, we should not co-erce people to disbelieve. However, we can encourage and convince them. That being said, I seldom spend time on atheism or promoting it frequently anyway. I only use this atheism forum once a while.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My explanation is simple. If the world is filled with people who are supertitious, then the world and its people will progress slowly. That is a fact. Another fact is this. The rich poor gap of the world can also be partly explained by the fact that majority of the world citizens are mostly concerned with their own lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, i am concerned with my own live also. However, I know others will also affect my lives. therefore, sometimes I have to do things outside my own lives and interfere with others. I am selfish person actually.</p>

Its very different from the President who making a daring challenge to s0-called black magic master infront of public. It was facetoface challenge. But what this TS do ? Writing cocks here hoping any ghost or god would appear then claim theres not god or ghost when they dont appear. Sure he never learn science in school on how to conduct an experiment lol.</p>

              <p>Ya. i have seen "sin tua" before also, on internet i think.</p>
              <p>SO what... what real workdone does all these gods, demi gods and ghost do to our world???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ALl these things are just elaborate cultural and religious ceremony ... which claims to bring peace and posperity to people....</p>
              <p>ya. SOme much to achieving peace and prosperity in our world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look. everywhere there are cermonies where god possessed and they spread peace and safety to people in many many countries.... centuries and centuries... we have been doing that...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So much for the power of these gods and ghost.......</p>
              <p>I think i better place my bet organising a real think tank or social group comprise of humans being meeting weekly to draft out real steps of how to do and what to do in our lives....</p>

              <p>Natural disaster like cyclones, tsunamis and earthquakes are natual processes of physical earth.

              <p>Ha! You think if we all carry out ceremonies and let god/ghost possess us. Then what? All the cyclones, vocalnoes, tsunamis will are 'zun zun' miss humans beings and their properties issit?
