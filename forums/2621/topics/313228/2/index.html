              <p>Yes, something largely untestable and unreliable shouldn't be depended upon to run the world and no amount of beliefs is going to change the basic facts of the world. What is more sensible is to do the best extent that you can, and leave the rest to providence, god, luck or whatever, if you happen to believe in them.</p>

              <p>Anyway, five minutes have passed and i have seen a single ghost or acts of god. So quiet. Perhaps they are busy and did not see this message. Busy? did not see? I wonder what happen to their super power . Also, I thought that they are many ghosts in the world.</p>

              <p>I am been thinking about those chinese /taoist religion where they house dead people tablets in temples(I think its not call temple). Each tablet cost few thousands dollars. What the heck. I go there to pray my deceased kins and damn, they have quite many tablets there. anyway, its quite nosensical stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Due to lack of space, they have to used the tablet because it is simply just a piece of wood which allow them to put many pieces in the hall where people offer incense. Then they have the priest chanting stuff to transfer the spirit from one place to another and as usual these services cost money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We still have to pay annual memberships, though not alot. Maybe those premium one need to pay more. ANyway, during chinese festivals, the hall will be filled with people and families payin respect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I certainly commend people for their virtue of respect. However, I think all these things is really stupid. People are believing all these wooden tablets housing souls and such.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On one hand, government is pushing for the development of science and technology, and asking its people to be intelligent. On the other hands, we are promoting respect for religions, giving people freedom to choose religions. When people burn all the papers in the furnace, those money papers, those that have gone to these chinese 'temples' will know. Its so full of smoke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poor trees and humans suffering from the total smoke out. Not to mention heat stress. I really hope that people can pay respect to dead in another way. Like starbucks can organise a pay a respect to your dead kins day where relatives all gather in starbucks and drink coffee in aircon room. The dead will then join the gathering and see the families again. Oh my gosh, am i really living in what they called an intellectual age??</p>

              <p>ghost can fly, they probably can teleport, so its better for them to look for me, then for me to look for them. I have work to do and money to earn. I guess they are quite free , unless they have to "work" also.</p>

              <p>My opinion is you failed horribly for Science. If this is a scientific experiment... this is an utter failure. If this is just an experiment of opinions, you have lost.</p>
              <p>While I know no atheism, your attempt to prove or disprove something has definitely humoured me a lot.</p>

              <p><br>Okay, lets discuss this as scientifically as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a young man who criticised god and ghost on the internet. Three weeks later, he was found dead in his room with his computer still on. When this news get out, what will you all think. This guy must have been possessed and killed by ghosts as it could not be such an coincidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, lets look at such stories more closely. For each guy who have challenged and got killed soon after, there are lets say 49 guys who also challenged but did not get killed. Looking from this statistics (Of course my ratio of 1:49 is just an example, it could be other ratio) , would you then think that the guy death is caused by the swearing of god, or would you think that these 2 events are unrelated and merely happen by chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In maths, it would look something like this.</p>
              <p>P( swearing at ghost AND dying shortly after) = 1/50</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What causes this probability??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A possible situation is that ghost may have killed the guy, but his killing rate is only at the rate of 1 guy for every 50 guy that sweared at ghost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another reason may be unrelated to ghost at only. For every 5000 persons who used internet  frequently, there is a chance of 1/100 that these people are atheist and who critiscised ghost/god. Therefore, out of these sample size of 5000 people, 50 will criticise god.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, the chance of dying due to heart attack or sitting prolongly in front of computer, lets say is 2%. Therefore, out of this 50 people who criticised ghost, one of them will die because of prolong sitting, and not because it is caused by ghost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In maths, for people , who study higher level. Casuality is different from correlation. Correlation does not mean casuality.</p>
              <p>However, laymen usually do not know such knowledge.</p>

              <p>Does not mean that a person criticised ghost and died shortly afterword means that ghost has caused his death. You have to look at other people who have done the same things but were not killed or being possessed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To test whether a person have been disturbed or killed by ghost due to his swearing, there has to be a systematic and rigous testing, not by saying he peed in the cemetery without saying excuse me, he had diahorrea and vomit ==&gt; therefore he is haunted by ghost</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as with god or ghost, the burden of proof lies in those who says that they exist. Disbelievers dun believe because there is lack of evidence. We live in evidence based world. Judicial system, government and working society lives on evidence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since there is no clear proof presented, the disbelievers will have to remain as they are, until clear proof is presented.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Disbelievers are truth seekers who follow reasons and evidence. Note that these are terms of philosohy. They follow where evidence and careful experiment points them to. If evidence and careful experiment points them to the conclusion that ghost and god exist with certain characteristics and definitions, then they will accept the existence of them and be able to further explaore them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The current knowledge of ghost and god known in this world, is divergent. Everyone is creating newer and more things about ghost and gods.</p>

              <p>I am been thinking about those chinese /taoist religion where
              they house dead people tablets in temples(I think its not call
              temple). Each tablet cost few thousands dollars. What the heck. I
              go there to pray my deceased kins and damn, they have quite many
              tablets there. anyway, its quite nosensical stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Due to lack of space, they have to used the tablet because it is
              simply just a piece of wood which allow them to put many pieces in
              the hall where people offer incense. Then they have the priest
              chanting stuff to transfer the spirit from one place to another and
              as usual these services cost money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We still have to pay annual memberships, though not alot. Maybe
              those premium one need to pay more. ANyway, during chinese
              festivals, the hall will be filled with people and families payin
              respect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I certainly commend people for their virtue of respect. However,
              I think all these things is really stupid. People are believing all
              these wooden tablets housing souls and such.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On one hand, government is pushing for the development of
              science and technology, and asking its people to be intelligent. On
              the other hands, we are promoting respect for religions, giving
              people freedom to choose religions. When people burn all the papers
              in the furnace, those money papers, those that have gone to these
              chinese 'temples' will know. Its so full of smoke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Poor trees and humans suffering from the total smoke out. Not to
              mention heat stress. I really hope that people can pay respect to
              dead in another way. Like starbucks can organise a pay a respect to
              your dead kins day where relatives all gather in starbucks and
              drink coffee in aircon room. The dead will then join the gathering
              and see the families again. Oh my gosh, am i really living in what
              they called an intellectual age??</p>

              <p>don't compare religion with other aspects of life. Religion, real or fake, it's there to cultivate good emotional well being of people. to instill fear and deter people from doing wrongs. So Religion has always been subjective to whoever and whatever beliefs you hold.</p>
              <p>the living cannot let go of their loved ones after death, so in order to keep their minds at peace, they could only do is offer things, burn incense, in the hope that it helps in one way or another. In some religion, the dead will not require such offerings but they will pray for their loved ones in heavens.</p>
              <p>It's not a matter of can prove or cannot. You're talking about the hope and the beliefs of mankind. the truth will shatter believers or non believers be it positive or negative. so if you proved there is hell, or 18 levels of torture or whatever, those people who have done bad things before would be too guilty to even repent or change for the better. IF you prove otherwise, people will have no fear of any higher beings and crimes and such will escalate.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm a freethinker. I respect everybody's religion. If people based on their religion, will say freethinkers go to hell etc.. I won't take it personal because it is their beliefs. Whatever it is, since you know life goes on with or without such supernaturals, why bother? have you got nothing better to do?</p>
