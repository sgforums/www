              <p>If god or ghost exist, pls come out now and kill me now. If I am able to type and put up post , that means i am still alive, which means that no ghost or god has existed.</p>

              <p>Lets see if you are able to continue typing in sgF, that means you are alive,that means  no ghost or god existed. You make me laugh.</p>
              <p>You expect to be killed, by God and ghosts, for posts in sgF. You really take the cake.</p>
              <p>Fruitcake.</p>
              <p>Please get of your butt and do more than just type. Follow the likes of Saddam, Osama, Stalin, Hitler. These guys are not armchair atheist like you.</p>

              <p>I can see u are trully not a believer. I am the same as you, I dun really believe 100%, but sometime something is "to be safe than sorry". My personal view.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will not worship god still i become totally crazy that i believe god will drop money for me. It jus a culture.</p>
              <p>As for u mention tablet in temple, this is another form of culture/traditional act. Even if u feel it "stupid" u should not voice out, as it showing dis-respectful to deceased, including ur own deceased ancestor. U have ur own view, maybe u find it stupid to spend few thousand buy a tablet, n annual membership fee.  But by saying this out, u are not showinig any respect to you ancestor.  Without them, there won be u here today talking crap here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so no matter how u feel, it best to show them some respect. Even u feel it stupid, no need to vocie out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I talk very direct, hope dun offend this person</p>
              <p>but i think he will confirm argue. haha</p>
              <p>(this confirm is a stubborn character, more stubbron than me, haha)</p>

              <p><br>actually.... i just want to explain this cause and effect process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>first.. its a no brainer.. there is no god or ghost.. there nothing to 'better be safe than sorry' when in comes to challenging their existence..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its like.. going out of the house wait get killed by gangster.. because 'better safe than sorry'</p>
              <p>there is a small chance that this maybe happen.. but everyone just take the risk and do it everyday. Right???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For ghost/god, there is no chance, because they do not exist. gangster exists, so there is a small chance. Therefore, I will not be killed by ghost or god in anyway, however, i may be killed by the following - car, poison, human being, animals, toxic chemical, and crashing plane, just like our unlucky singaporean army personnel killed in taiwan...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, the real danger of posting this thread will not come from ghost or god. However, the danger may come from human beings who after seeing this thread, they decide to come and beat me up. That , is the only danger, those human beings who want to beat me up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>finally, i stated repeatedly that there are no ghost or god. its like a student who answers the question, what is 2 +3 = ?</p>
              <p>if he puts 5, what are you as a marker going to assess him. Right or wrong for his answer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every person will put right is not it? however , consider the alternative argument.. how can you be so sure that 2 + 3 = 5??? because the truth is.. we may be wrong 2 + 3 is actually another answer... if i explain in this way... will readers think i am mad.. ? yes!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is the same for god. there is no evidence for god, then there is therefore no god. that is the understanding for me. BUt.... people still want to say.. what if? what if... dardardar??? the world is so big....? how can i be so sure....?  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its just like me telling the student.. what if 2 +3 in the process of adding.. something happen so 5 may not occur... the universe is so big.. how can this rule works all the time..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2 +3 =5. that is the truth. end of story.. dun talk circles... similarly, there is no single obvious evidence of god. so. no god. end of story.</p>
              <p>If i ask god to make me die, i will no die by god will because there is no god.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i ask god to make me die, i may still be killed tomolo by a driver whose car hit me, but still.. it is not because of god...</p>
              <p>that is all i want to say.. good night.</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>ok.. let me say again why god does not exist.. just now.. my reason is there is no single obvious evidence that god exist, therefore there is no god.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So people often ask this question to challenge me? where do you think everything in the universe so complex comes from? god must have made all these things possible...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if science explains the process from big bang to now, people will still say.. but science still cannot explain what create the big bang.. god must have started the beginning...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well.. my argument to that is. First, the big bang is actually being studied and many things have to discovered about the nature of it, the nature of time, space and some events before the bang in the subject of physics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, time, space, or the 'beginning' of universe(note that i put '' on beginning) is issue that physicists are still scientifically and mathematically studying. In these study, its all hard science workings, and it really has no place for god to fit into the questions at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So another famous question.. God must have created all these physics law.. and maths law... Another pet argument of god believers.... its irritating , is not it.. that they can always link things to god creations.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OKay.. regarding this maths law, physics law, entropy, mass, which are important laws and key terms this are issues that human beings have discovered and defined based on all the accumulated knowledge from ancestor human  beings and knowledge from our world that we have observed from microscope, our eye and telescope and all other detecting instrument like infra red detector.. and of course our human brains....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so these laws.. are just what we humans have found out is true in accordance to observsations of universe using Hubble telescope, for example. Now, i will attempt to answer this questions.. where does law comes from...? The answer is still not clear yet.. but i can tell you what is the misconception.. people like to think that god must have created these laws.. BUT.. actually.. its a convinent answer for people.. only god can have the power to set this universal law, is the common mistake of laymen thinkers...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>therefore, we MUST not say god created this law because there is no evidence or good reasoning why he is the one who created it. People have the wrong assumptions that god is powerful, therefore he must be the one who created these laws.. People have assumed that god exists in the first place.. and people also have naturally accepted that if god exists, he must be powerful, hence these laws must be have made by him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is the origin of the mistake. People simplyassume that god exist. Assumption, is indeed that mother of all idiots..</p>

              <p>ya.. i still think its a waste of money to buy a tablet to be put on a place in temple. People buy it because they believe and want to 'play safe'  However their beliefs and 'play safe' reasoning will fail because there is simply no heaven, no afterlife. the afterlife and heaven which is described by whatever religion will never be close to the study of higher dimensions which physicists are studying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i respect my ancestor... but i cannot agree with them on everything.. if my grandmother says she is going to buy a tablet.. i will definitely think inside myself.. its a waste of money.. does that mean that i am disrespect to think that way...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is respectful agreeing with ancestors everything he says.. or should we speak of the truth which will means telling them their idea is wrong.</p>

              <p>if i am a grandfather one day.. I will save all the money i spend on my funeral and tablet and give it to others... I rather buy a dog its food for few years... at least i have make another dog no need to go hungry instead of giving money to priests, people working in the religion because there is no what they pray.. then i will reach the heaven safely thingy... This is the stance i am taking and the reason why i say that buying a dog food is more life enhancing thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am no scolding them now.. i am just saying that since there is no heaven or whatever.. all the rituals they do is thus empty.. nothing is being done.. which is thus wasting money, time and effort. It may apper to soothe at least the minds of the dead person kins.. but actually.. its does more damage than good in the long run to the family, and to the society.</p>

              <p>Hi january, not all religion believe that when a person die, he goes to heaven. Only 2 religions believe that their followers are going to heaven in their afterlife.  Judaism believe that when a person dies, he sleep. Being an atheist do u also believe that when a person dies he sleep or RIP?.</p>

              <p>sleeping and dying is 2 different things. From medical point, they are hugely different. From our human viewpoint, there are some similarities...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the thing about dying is that there is no waking up. i agree that it is similar in some sense in that usually when you are asleep and not dreaming, you practically is unconscious... so its like death.. whether you have no more conscious anymore...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the thing about death is that you have no more conscious whatsoever anymore.. and nothing can wake you are.. u simply dun exist already... you will not even feel sad or scared when you are death... from this perspective.. its a good thing.. and perhaps that is the reason why so many intuitively try to commit suicide.</p>
