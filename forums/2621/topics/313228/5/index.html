              <p>hello january, i am a partial aetist. i have some questions, who do you think created the universe? the begining of time, the big bang all that, i believe it happened but i just cant justify how matter can spontaneously appear from nothing.

              <p>hello baby... at least a thread down here where i can answer something instead of arguing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, why dun you read up on quantum physics, and astronomy physics. Those physicists talks about existence, matter and time in a professional way unlike we general public, aka the laymen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sentences like "how can something appear from nothing" is a laymen logic which i have gone through myself last time when i am thinking of such questions.... Basically, from my little knowledge, the 2 word ... 'something' and 'nothing' are english words that is not so useful when we talk about physics....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>big bang is a very smal big, before which could be some situations. one situation is that our universe are born from another universe, you gotta to read more about this thing, through the big bang. and big band are actually common stuff in multi universe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Point is this. I will refrain from saying ' this is beyond the scope of human understanding ' . i will encourage people to continue discussing. OKay. First, you have to read about one thing. which is called anti-matter... it has been found that anti matter is much more than matter in our universe, so such stuff actually is more detailed than our concept of something and nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is vaccum nothing? such is the question you have to ask, think and research. Some people will delve into saying that everything is form from energy. However, even if it is the case, there are actually many detailed scientific analysis. oh ya... some say that energy creates the 'something' which you mention. any way .. there is much science behind all these theories...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Philosophy will lead you to question like.. what is before big bang then.. or the thing that causes big bang.... it leads to a situation called infinite regression.. which is a logic issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, I have some knwoledge of what is the answer of this questions... or what is error in the way human understand certain english words... but i will stop here. good luck on your journey of intelligence.</p>

              <p>thank you for reopening my interests in physics beyond what is thought in school. I do have basic understanding of particle physics and some of einsteins theories, limited but much more that my friends call me crazy. I find your points helpfull in answering my questions and ill do some reading on these. thing is, all the while i thought of science purely as science and never would have thought it could be fully utilised to explain god. haha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i personally have thought of many things like how some people persistently try to attack the validity of darwinism and hold on relentlessly to what the scientists have tried to disprove, also things like how when you look deep at cellular level or even deeper at molecular level, you just cant find your consciousness physically in any part of your brain.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>seeing whats going on here, seems like the aethist community is rather small and unwelcomed generally and i feel that its good actually to have at least some people thinking beyond what their parents have thought them, people who learn to think for themselves and think beyond their comfort zone, i no longer feel like im the only one thinking too much, hehe. I will check out the online scientific comunities soon for more brain food.</p>
              <p>so my search for god continues, thanks for your points on this matter.</p>

              <p>atheists .. they are not like religious people... religious people seem very good at forming assoications and meeting up regularly and creating events....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>atheists basically just believe there is no god or ghost..we humans just evolve and earth is a super small thing in universe that is likely to dissappear or get burn off some billions or millions years later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there is really no strong motivation for atheists to meet because there is no strong cause... and i guess atheists are generally intellectuals who are lazy</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>secondly... there atheism is minority issue in singapore as compared to religious groups... there is a perceived potential threat to religion and hence atheist would rather remained mum about being too expressive. HAHA.. cos govt always say be religious sensitive...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>imagine atheist speaking on national television that there is no god ... it would probably lead to public outcry ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly.. perhaps atheist would form assoications only when they settle their own bread and butter issue first... as the saying goes...</p>
              <p>"no money no talking"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe most atheists are earning money religiously now... haha....</p>

              <p>by the way, i read that if one travel faster and faster, his time becomes slower for him. this theory, states that actually, spacetime is a together entity just like eletromagnetic.</p>

              <p>when we dun move in space, being stationary, our motion in time is 100 percent... if we move lets say in fast speed, we will experience time slower.. but out speed in daily life does not reduce our time differences alot...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you move in speed of light, you will not move in time at all.. cos you have use all the spacetime motion for space.</p>

              <p>This theory is real.. though i have not relaly grapsed it alot. its found in the book called fabric of the cosmo...</p>

              <p>Hmm... no matter what religion you believe in or dun believe in, you have to come into terms with the fact that the universe did at one point did appear out of nothing... Same as ur gods, there mus be a precursor of god, therefore something must come from nothing, and it cant be explained away using God. Even for a cyclic universe, where time is a cycle instead of a straight line, there has to be a point where everything is initiated. <br><br>I guess this is the ultimate answer to be answered, how did we get from nothing to something.</p>

              <p>I think you are talking about string theory here.. where there is 11 dimensions.... These theory maybe very elegant on mathematical formula, but in real world you are not able to observe it... so we should read it with a grain of salt.<br><br>Yes talking about physics... some of u guys here might be interested in <a href="http://www.lhcountdown.com/">this</a>[http://www.lhcountdown.com/] in a few days time, we could get a peek of the subtle "glue" that holds the universe together.</p>

              <p><br>actually.. i was thinking about this question and so called paradox of few of this questions recently.. and i have mostly solved it ... what i mean is that i have solved the paradox and its not that i know what is the beginning of time or universe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, i shall not reveal the insights for private reasons. there is nothing illogical at all, although humans seems to find that there is a illogical point about nothing to something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all i can say its that the problem lies in human logic. the logic is wrong. well, you all can read up on logical fallacy. it will give you some hints.</p>

              <p>Believe what you want. I don't really care. However, those who have met the supernatural can vouch for its truth. Maybe you are not sensitive to the spiritual world. And that is a blessing. It is not good to see ghosts.</p>

              <p>I hope your reason serves you well. I may not have reason but I do not find all ways and means to prove myself right. In such a place as the internet, how do I know if you are telling the truth? You say you went to a graveyard. Can you prove that part?</p>
