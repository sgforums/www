              <p>why not we ask singapore judge whether ghost exist.</p>
              <p>We human, always form opinions, and make claims about what is true what is false.

              <p>IN the singapore ghost stories... those people state their stories and experiences and claim that these are the evidence of their ghost. People listen and also realize that it makes sense, it has to be ghost. Therefore, the conclusion is ghost exist.</p>

              <p>SO you mean the reasons or evidence provided by god believers are sensible? Finally, the rule of proving actually lies with believers. If they cannot show any good reasons, then it means god does not exist. If they can show good reasons, people will then accept it as a fact.</p>

              <p>I could also put it to you that if someone in ancient Egypt had believed that the air that he was breathing was actually made of countless particles too small to be seen, many would have thought him nuts and even ridiculed him. Could he have proven it in any meaningful way, statistics, logic and all ? No. But was he right ? Yes.</p>
              <p>Certain things are easier to prove/disprove than others. If you want to find out whether the month in which a person is born in affects his personality, you can do a massive correlation study and find that out. But how do you set-up an experiment to prove/disprove the existence of God ? Your initial experiment is certainly not going to do it. All it proves (at best) is that invoking a supernatural curse on oneself does not always result in harm.</p>

              <p>And I suppose there is strong evidence that God does not exist ? And in case you are thinking of doing it, being able to explain phenomena through Science does not disprove the existence of God.</p>
              <p>I believe that it is reasonable for someone to be skeptical about the existence of God, or to decide that based on current knowledge/experiences, he does not believe there to be a God. But to declare this as 'fact' and ridicule anyone who does not share this view is not reasonable, to put it mildly.</p>

              <p>Hi january, i beleive u are a perfect candidate for conversion to Judaism.  u believe in science? Many renown scientists are Jewish. u are also a moral person, right?  Also, non-jewish believers in Judaism also dun need to cut their kkb or kkj or whatever u call that little thingy, when they believe.  u only need to believe in these 7 law of Noah.</p>
              <p>The 7 laws are.</p>
              <p>1. Prohibition of idolatry.  Since u dun believe in gods, u would not anyhow worship idols. Right?</p>
              <p>2. Prohibition of Blasphemy.  Since u dun believe in gods, u would not misuse the bible or other holy books to collect tithes and  $$$ from people who shared your believe.</p>
              <p>3. Prohibition of Theft.  Even thieves know that stealing is wrong and against the law.</p>
              <p>4. Prohibition of sexual immorality.  The Torah, or jewish bible, allows a man to have more than 1 wife, for men are unsatisfied, OK.  Adultery is out, of course u would not want to walk around town wearing a green hat, get what i mean?</p>
              <p>5. Prohibition against murder. No need to explain this one.</p>
              <p>6. Be kind to animal. No explanation needed on this one also.</p>
              <p>7. Fair court of Justice. Every logical or moral person wants a fair system of justice in the courts. u are a logical n moral person, right?</p>
              <p>u can see now, that it is very easy to beleive in only real God, found only in Judaism. He is Adonai Elohin aka Blessed King of the Universe.</p>
