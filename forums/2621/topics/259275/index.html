            <div class='col-md body'>gotten from eternal hope forum:<br><br>In the months of November and December of 2006, there was a spate of posts in sgForums that were religious inflammatory. A few sgForums members made snide and degrading remarks about religions.<br><br>During these events, a complain was lodged with the police. This complain was against an individual who had posted remarks such as "using the bible as toilet paper", "Christians are worse than MLM agents", "Muslims are terrorists". I do not have a full list of the remarks he made, but these include remarks made in all the religion-based forums in sgForums.<br><br>I have been asked by the police to assist in this investigation.<br><br>This post is to remind everyone to be thoughtful in their remarks made in an open forum such as sgForums. Remarks regarding religions is always a sensitive issue. We do not want to allow any individual to prey on our faith to cause any unrest.<br><br>At atheism forum, we want to have a environment which the discussion and arguemnts are carried out with insultive content.</div>
