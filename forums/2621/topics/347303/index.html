              <p>Lets look at cancer and people who thinks that prayer has caused cancer to be cured.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless you take the time to intelligently analyze this situation, it looks ambiguous. God might have miraculously cured your disease, as many Christians <a href="/forums/2621/topics/need-a-miracle.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">believe</span></span></a>. But God might also be imaginary, and the chemotherapy drugs and surgery are the things that cured you. Or your body's immune system might have cured the cancer itself.</p>
              <p>When your tumor disappeared, in other words, it might simply have been a complete <strong>coincidence</strong> that you happened to pray. Your prayer may have had <a href="/forums/2621/topics/superstition.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">zero effect</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How can we determine whether it is God or coincidence that worked the cure? One way is to eliminate the ambiguity. In a non-ambiguous situation, there is no potential for coincidence. Because there is no ambiguity, we can actually <em>know</em> whether God is answering the prayer or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is what we are doing when we look at amputees.</p>
              <p>Think about it this way. The Bible clearly promises that God answers prayers. For example, in Mark 11:24 Jesus says, "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." And billions of Christians <a href="/forums/2621/topics/need-a-miracle.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">believe these promises</span></span></a>. You can find thousands of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/104-7317319-3967121?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=stripbooks%3Arelevance-above&amp;field-keywords=prayer"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">books</span></span></a>, magazine <a href="/forums/2621/topics/need-a-miracle.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">articles</span></span></a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=god+prayer+healing"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Web sites</span></span></a> talking about the power of prayer. According to believers, God is answering millions of their prayers every day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what should happen if we pray to God to restore amputated limbs? Clearly, if God is real, limbs should regenerate through prayer. In reality, they do not.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p><br>You <strong>assumed</strong> that there has been no limbs grown out of prayer. I've read a limb grew out of prayer no to the perfect shape but it grew nonetheless, the women who prayed for the limb thought that it was her fault that the limb didn't grow to its perfect shape because she opened her eyes before God had finished doing His work but said that finally she accepted that it was meant that the limb not to grow into a perfect shape to entice people to ask questions. Questions which answers ultimately serve God's glory.</p>
              <p>I've also read a crippled girl whose half side of her limbs were cured by three and a half year prayer to Jesus. Her limbs grew but also not to a perfect shape again she finally concluded that it was to entice questions from people which answer will ultimately glorify God. The limbs not only grew but became usable while they weren't usable before. She was a Muslim. Her name is sister Gulshan Esther. Hear her testimony in youtube.</p>
              <p>As for other people who thought they had been healed by God there are many of them which didn't subscribed to any treatment due to whatever reasons. Monetary or financial is one. Again you <strong>assumed </strong>every people who thought they had been miraculously healed by God had had medical treatment in parallel to their prayers.</p>
              <p>There was a story of a lady in China who was very ill. She was brought to the local hospital. The doctor gave up on her immediately upon seeing her condition and thought she was sure going to die soon so the doctor had her moved to the hospital mortuary so that she could die there as she was about to die anyway. In the mortuary she cried out to God which answered her. She walked away out of the mortuary completely healthy.</p>
              <p>There are testimonies everywhere. from being freed miraculously from maximum security jail to being raised from death after more than half a day to earthquake enticed by prayer to appirition and prophesying to walking on water(raging river in Korea) and many more. All in God's name. I suggest reading Christian testimonial books. Not too many of them but they are there. In recent times testimonies from China are becoming popular.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Miracles&amp;Prophecies:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br> You <strong>assumed</strong> that there has been no limbs grown out
              of prayer. I've read a limb grew out of prayer no to the perfect
              shape but it grew nonetheless, the women who prayed for the limb
              thought that it was her fault that the limb didn't grow to its
              perfect shape because she opened her eyes before God had finished
              doing His work but said that finally she accepted that it was meant
              that the limb not to grow into a perfect shape to entice people to
              ask questions. Questions which answers ultimately serve
              God's glory.</p>
              <p>I've also read a crippled girl whose half side of her limbs were
              cured by three and a half year prayer to Jesus. Her limbs grew
              but also not to a perfect shape again she finally concluded that it
              was to entice questions from people which answer will ultimately
              glorify God. The limbs not only grew but became usable
              while they weren't usable before. She was a Muslim. Her name
              is sister Gulshan Esther. Hear her testimony in youtube.</p>
              <p>As for other people who thought they had been healed by God
              there are many of them which didn't subscribed to any treatment due
              to whatever reasons. Monetary or financial is one. Again you
              <strong>assumed</strong> every people who thought they had been
              miraculously healed by God had had medical treatment in
              parallel to their prayers.</p>
              <p>There was a story of a lady in China who was very ill. She was
              brought to the local hospital. The doctor gave up on her
              immediately upon seeing her condition and thought
              she was sure going to die soon so the doctor had her moved to
              the hospital mortuary so that she could die there as she was about
              to die anyway. In the mortuary she cried out to God
              which answered her. She walked away out of the
              mortuary completely healthy.</p>
              <p>There are testimonies everywhere. from being freed
              miraculously from maximum security jail to being raised from
              death after more than half a day to earthquake enticed by prayer to
              appirition and prophesying to walking on water(raging river in
              Korea) and many more. All in God's name. I suggest reading
              Christian testimonial books. Not too many of them but they are
              there. In recent times testimonies from China are becoming
              popular.</p>
