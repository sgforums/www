THe wisdom and knowledge gained from these things will then bring benefits to the person.<br><br>past memories, power to time travel, power to fly, power to produce web like spiderman, power to become wolverine. all this is possible if you want to be that creative but i think its still far fetched. lets leave it for the movie industry to come up wtih such scripts.<br></div>

The topic is discussed at http://www.csicop.org/si/9903/ten-percent-myth.html<br><br>And I completely agree with what you said about hearsay reports. Evidence from personal testimony is usually very unreliable. That is why you need to have research with the proper methodology.<br><br>I don't think I need to come across an example first hand. I've never been to moon but I accept that the moon exists and that man has landed on the moon. What I do require is evidence that is testable and repeatable.<br><br>Obviously, we use our mind to find all answers. But we need to use our minds to come up with experiments that allow us to gather evidence. Human intuition is often wrong and is not reliable when used by itself.<br><br>The universe is stranger than we know. Some would argue that it's stranger than we <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> know. That is why we need science and the scientific method to help us describe and understand our universe.</div>

You accuse me of being stubborn headed and wanting to remain ignorant?<br><br>This is an argument from the kindergarten playground.

You believe that consiousness can exist without a physical host?<br><br>I skimmed through the 3 links earlier and while they were interesting, I did not find the arguments compelling. Research into past lives is interesting, though there have been criticisms as to possible flaws in the studies. I've already mentioned that I'm not dismissing the possibility of reincarnation offhand. I just felt that the probability was low and more research is needed. I refrained from commenting because I feel I do not have the necessary expertise. Having said that, I will attempt a rebuttal. I hope you will not be "stubborn head" and consider the points fairly.</div>
