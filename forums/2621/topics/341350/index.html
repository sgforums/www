              <p>after reading the reports of his supertitious past, i find that he is quite stupid, for an adult. That is the problem of being supertitious, religious.</p>

              <p>ANyway, he now is probably a firm christian, after he found strength in god. To me, this is bad because he will get nowhere following this pathHe will probably be happier if he adopt atheism beliefs.</p>

              <p>atheism teach you that life is not about 'you, you and more you'. Hence, when crisis happens to you, you will not ask the stupid question</p>

              <p>Well, I am not disrespecting chew chow meng or laughing at him. I admit hisncurable illness is a bad thing. To me, as an atheist, one must be prepared for bad things in life, and one must be knowledgable about what is happening in the world, including those bad things. When one is open minded, he will become more mature. Then he will understand why such bad things happen. By natural causes, not god testing you kinda of reasongs.</p>

              <p>that is ur own belief la. religion does help pple who have difficulties in life to be more at peace. in fact, an impt question tt social workers and psychologists ask when they approach someone wif a problem is: do you have any spiritual beliefs?</p>
              <p>it's proven tt having a spiritual outlook in life (no matter what religion) helps a person to be more at peace with himself and to be more satisfied and contented with their lives. contrary to what u said, religion can also help chew chor meng to avoid bemoaning his fate and wondering "why is this happening to me?"</p>
              <p>as a christian, he can avoid the "why" question if he believes tt his fate is in the hands of god. and it's similar for other religions as well. for instance, a buddhist who has difficulties can also avoid the "why" question, if he believes tt what happens to him in his life is but a part of his own karma accumulated from past lives.</p>
              <p>i feel tt maybe u need to find out more abt the various religions before u discredit them and advocate atheism.. of course, u are free to share ur views on an internet forum. however, if u really were not "disrespecting" chew chor meng's choice as u claim, then why did u say "i think he is quite stupid" in ur first post? do u tink calling someone stupid is respectful? :/</p>

              <p>I personally do not believe in god since I never met one anyway + I don't really give a damn about it, but I neither promote Atheist/Agnostic nor diss religion. It's your right to believe in whatever you want after all.</p>
              <p>But one interesting thing is when you ask them why do they believe in god, most of them wouldn't be able to answer. Some start quoting from the bible, some would say it give them strength or something and some would keep repeating what they have said but in a different manner.</p>

              <p>after reading the reports of his supertitious past, i<strong> find that he is quite stupid</strong>, for an adult. That is the problem of being supertitious, religious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ANyway, he now is probably a firm christian, after he found strength in god. To me, this is bad because he will get nowhere following this pathHe will probably be happier if he adopt atheism beliefs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>atheism teach you that life is not about 'you, you and more you'. Hence, when crisis happens to you, <strong>you will not ask the stupid question</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>"why is this happening to me?"</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, I am not disrespecting chew chow meng or laughing at him. I admit hisncurable illness is a bad thing. To me, as an atheist, one must be prepared for bad things in life, and one must be knowledgable about what is happening in the world, including those bad things. When one is open minded, he will become more mature. Then he will understand why such bad things happen. By natural causes, not god testing you kinda of reasongs.</p>

              <p><br><strong> find that he is quite stupid -</strong> u already call him stupid that mean u already disagreed with him in the way he seeking help</p>
              <p><strong>you will not ask the stupid question</strong><strong>"why is this happening to me?"</strong></p>
              <p>my mum ask the same question when she was diagnosis with late stage cancer</p>
              <p>so u mean my mum is stupid also ???</p>
              <p>most of the terminal illness patient wil ask the same thing <strong>"why is this happening to me?"</strong></p>
              <p>i dare u to look up to the sky and say to the sky, those ppl that ask<strong> "why is this happening to me?"</strong> is stupid.</p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>Y not u tio cancer or some major illness and maybe then u will understand how a person feel when u know u receive yr death sentence.</p>
              <p>according to medical report Chow ming will be paralyse slowly which in 10 to 20 years time he will became totally paralyse but horrible part is this illness is different from old man illness where they lose their sensibility thus resulting they themselves dont know wat is happening</p>
              <p>but for Chow Ming case he different</p>
              <p>he will lose his ability to walk, talk , move in the end but he still mantain his sensibility</p>
              <p>that mean he still know wat is going around him but he unable to control his movement or anything at all.</p>
              <p>u have no ideal how horrible his furture is going to be.</p>

              almost every believe is a religion, even atheism, given how some would go all the way just to defend there is no god.....
              
              i was a christian but that was donkeys years ago..i now subscribe to universality....but that's a story for another day...
              
              folks turn to religion primarily to seek comfort or are influenced to turn away from the vices they previously succumbed to....
              
              the actor was probably devastated when he discover his illness and perhaps chose to seek comfort in the christian faith...so be it.....there's no need to belittle it... 
              
              the word satan was originally to describe non-conforming believes during the time when christianity was the accepted faith in europe during the days of old...it wasn't about the person of evil....it was later conveniently used to illustrate as the devil personified....  
              
              those with religion or those without should just live their own lives, do good and let live....

              <p>I don't know what you are talking about? How is the challenge contradictory?</p>
              <p>I'm referring to January who claims to be an atheist but yet studied physics where most theorums were discovered by scientists who were also Christians.  The bible is not a text book about physics  but there's harmony between science and the bible. Otherwise those Christian scientists would had renounced their religion.</p>
              <p>No God also means no devil. January's claim to be an atheist is none of my business but he taunts Christians as though his belief is superior.</p>
              <p>If he accepts the challenge to sign the pact, he can prove once and for all his steadfastness in his belief and also convince us that there's no God, no devil. If the devil exists, his life will change. Mere words will not conjure the devil. It requires some form of rituals.</p>
