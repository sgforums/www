              <p><br>well, from I am reading from the papers, Chor Meng is certainly NOT being superstitious. I think he has already said that he will let God do what He sees fit.</p>

              <p>I am just stating my opinions about chew meng and stating my argument.</p>
              <p>surely in  a civilised world, you all can counter my argument and i will argue back. you mean even in internet forum, i cannot say that chew chow meng is superstitious. What kind of freedom is that. Morever, i got explain abit why i think he is superstitious, in a well presented manner too. Not as if i am cursing and laughing at him.</p>

              <p>True, January might be taunting atheism as superior, but aren't you doing the same thing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hello furb, just a correction i felt i need to make.</p>
              <p>Atheism is not something i see as superior. Atheism is just a reasoned conclusion. No ghost and no god is because claims for their existence were scattered, anedotcal and illogical. Atheism is not a religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>religious people like to twist our reasoning when they lump our argument like saying atheism is just another religion. or argument saying that you cannot convince others change their beliefs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I attempt to convince others because religious beliefs have negative consequences. Its as simple as that.</p>
              <p>I recently read about the middle ages where religions rule human and human have very little free will. we are here today with so much power because the we broke free from the shackles of religion, which was known as the Renassiance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not for the brave forefathers who started the movement of reasons, i would not be here with todays resources. I must continue to educate the public here.</p>

              <p>yes, but our medical health industries is not doing it parts</p>
              <p>just by making sick people more sick, earn those sick people money,</p>
              <p>e.g. recently, one friend uncle attended NUH, dynos kidney failure/weak prepare to undergo kidney dalysis, since it is from NUH, therefore bring him along during one of my physio session.</p>
              <p>my chinese physio, assisted him, explain the reason of his possible kidney failure is due to the "x" reason, he treated him, and advise him to return back to NUH to further medical review,</p>
              <p>surprise, he is not require to underdo kidney dialysis any more, his kidney is working normally.</p>
              <p>yes, NUH dianos his kidney is not working normal condition, but NUH did not treat the root cause of the problem, just refer him to undergo kidney dialysis, just to safe his life.</p>

              <p>January, there is freedom of speech on the internet, but when you come online solely to rant about your so-called atheist beliefs and take a swipe at the beliefs of others, you're asking for it. Your original post reads not as a comment on Chew Chow Meng's current plight but more as an outlet for your pent-up frustrations against the very existence of religions, which to you equates superstition.</p>
              <p>By saying that religious people are immature you've already offended the vast majority of people living on this planet. Your very callous remarks make you the most immature person on this thread, possibly the entire internet.</p>
              <p>Let's put things in perspective. There are thousands of things you believe in by pure blind faith. Faith in your science textbooks, faith in television, faith in wikipedia. Do you have absolute prove for anything you take as fact? Does the fact that the sun rises every day prove that it will do so tomorrow?</p>
              <p>Please, think about it a moment, everything you believe in, you do so by pure faith, so please don't go around saying anyone is more superstitious than yourself.</p>

              <p>You can talk all you want but I dare say you are just apprehensive to sign the pact. What if there's the devil? So, save your breath to try and reason like some intellectual. If you claim to be an atheist, you must show that you are really an atheist. Show the believers that there's no such thing as the devil.</p>
              <p>Like I've said, convince the believers, prove them wrong. Afterall, if the devil does exists and you've signed the pact, only your life will change.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>You probably don't understand January's logic. It's not the definition. We all know what atheism means.</p>
              <p>After spending some years studying physics, he concluded that there's no God.</p>
              <p>There is a reason for every action. What makes you become an atheist? Follow January's footsteps without thinking through? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Am I a believer of Christ? I can become a born again Christian right this moment.  I can also renounce Christianity right away. I know not what I'm doing...hehehehe...that's the beauty of Christianity.</p>
              <p>The challenge to January to sign a pact with Satan is still valid, in fact, there's no deadline. You are also invited. Take your time. Think it through. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>There's no scientific basis in January's taunts and mockings. Forget about it.</p>
              <p><strong>Prayers can help the sick is a scientific fact:</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.mindpub.com/art031.htm"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica; font-size: large;"><strong>Studies Find
                      that </strong></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica; font-size: large;"><strong>Prayer Can Help
                      the Sick</strong></span></a></p>
              <p><em>Vijai P. Sharma, Ph.D</em></p>
               
              <p>A study
                      on prayer fascinated me and I want to share it with
                      you. </p>
              <p>This study was conducted by Dr. Randolph Byrd, a heart
                      specialist at the San Francisco General Hospital. This is
                      how it went. </p>
              <p>Dr. Byrd took four hundred patients who were admitted
                      to the Hospital's Cardiac Intensive-Care Unit. He divided
                      them in to two groups: one group received regular medical
                      care of the hospital, called the "control group,
                      "; the second group received not only regular
                      medical care but also prayers, called the "prayer
                      group." </p>
              <p>To eliminate any selection bias, he let the computer
                      randomly assign patients to one of the two groups. People
                      who met to pray for the prayer group were given just the
                      names of the patients and a very preliminary information
                      on their medical condition. All patients, belonging to
                      either of the groups, signed a consent form, informing
                      them of the possibility that they might or might not get
                      prayed for. So none of the patients knew whether he or
                      she actually got prayed for and at the same time, every
                      one stood an equal chance. </p>
              <p>Needless to say that all patients, their friends and
                      relatives were free to pray on their own if they wanted
                      to. No suggestion was made about self initiated prayers
                      one way or the other. </p>
              <p>The point I am making is that these being such large
                      groups, all chance factors would equal out to make a
                      strict comparison between the prayer group and the
                      control group. This enabled the researchers to
                      objectively study the effect of the additional prayers
                      that were organized by the hospital. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, neither the staff, nor the patient knew
                      who was being prayed for. This is really important in a
                      scientific study because if the patients know or find out
                      about such differences, then, arguably, they may improve
                      or get worse due to the placebo effect. </p>
              <p>For instance, the one who is prayed for, may get an
                      additional psychological booster and the other who knows
                      he is not being prayed, may feel deprived of something
                      that may have a potential for improvement. </p>
              <p>By the same token, it is important that the treatment
                      staff not know which patient is participating in which
                      group. Understandably, if a member of the treatment team
                      knows about the composition of the groups, they may give
                      certain patients preferential treatment, give them more
                      attention, or pass" on, unintentionally, their hope
                      and enthusiasm to the patient.  All told, as
                      concerns the standards of  unbiased and objective
                      study, it met all the requirements. </p>
              <p>Now for <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the results of the study</strong></span>. </p>
              <p>Dr. Byrd found that the prayed for group did much
                      better than the group that was not prayed for. 
                      Several benefits were noted for the group that was prayed
                      for, they were much less likely to develop congestive
                      heart failure and pulmonary edema in which the lungs fill
                      with fluid; they were five times less likely to require
                      antibiotics; fewer needed to be put on ventilators and
                      receive artificial respiration; fewer developed pneumonia
                      or had cardiac arrests.  All the benefits mentioned
                      above were statistically significant. </p>
              <p>Studies following respectable scientific standards
                      have also been conducted comparing the effectiveness of
                      the various types of prayer.  One such study comes
                      from the Spindrift Foundation in Salem, Oregon, which
                      specializes in prayer studies. </p>
              <p>For the purpose of this study, prayers are classified
                      in two types; the "directed prayer" and the
                      "undirected prayer."  Let us see how they
                      define the two types. </p>
              <p>A directed prayer has a specific wish and a specific
                      outcome in mind. </p>
              <p>Nondirected prayer is just the consciousness of who is
                      being prayed for.  The prayer is simply for the best
                      potential of the individual to manifest or the best
                      outcome to happen for that person.  So nondirected
                      prayer is "thy will be done" type of
                      prayer. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>This study was also done on the germination of
                      seeds</strong></span>.  The seeds that were prayed for always
                      germinated more than the seeds that were not prayed for,
                      and the seeds that received nondirected prayers
                      germinated more than the ones that received directed
                      prayers. </p>
              <p>Spindrift Foundation concluded that both types of
                      prayers were beneficial, but the nondirected prayers were
                      three to four times more effective. </p>
              <p>My personal bias, which is not based on any scientific
                      study, is that a prayer for changing oneself into a
                      better person is more desirable than the prayers for some
                      material benefits.  I am aware that my bias may have
                      been determined by the fact that I am a psychologist and
                      I am in the business of personal change. </p>

              <p>Hello furb, just a correction i felt i need to make.</p>
              <p>Atheism is not something i see as superior. Atheism is just a reasoned conclusion. No ghost and no god is because claims for their existence were scattered, anedotcal and illogical. Atheism is not a religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>religious people like to twist our reasoning when they lump our argument like saying atheism is just another religion. or argument saying that you cannot convince others change their beliefs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I attempt to convince others because religious beliefs have negative consequences. Its as simple as that.</p>
              <p>I recently read about the middle ages where religions rule human and human have very little free will. we are here today with so much power because the we broke free from the shackles of religion, and the period where our ancestors broke free from dogmatic era was  known as the Renassiance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not for the brave forefathers who started the movement of reasons, i would not be here with todays resources. I must continue to educate the public here.</p>

              <p>January, there is freedom of speech on the internet, but when you come online solely to rant about your so-called atheist beliefs and take a swipe at the beliefs of others, you're asking for it. Your original post reads not as a comment on Chew Chow Meng's current plight but more as an outlet for your pent-up frustrations against the very existence of religions, which to you equates superstition.</p>
              <p>By saying that religious people are immature you've already offended the vast majority of people living on this planet. Your very callous remarks make you the most immature person on this thread, possibly the entire internet.</p>
              <p>Let's put things in perspective. There are thousands of things you believe in by pure blind faith. Faith in your science textbooks, faith in television, faith in wikipedia. Do you have absolute prove for anything you take as fact? Does the fact that the sun rises every day prove that it will do so tomorrow?</p>
              <p>Please, think about it a moment, everything you believe in, you do so by pure faith, so please don't go around saying anyone is more superstitious than yourself.</p>

              <p><br>fine i will reply your thread and clear my intention. here it goes.</p>
              <p>Firstly, i not desperate about spreading atheism. To me it just a once in a while dabbling. Secondly, science is not hocus pocus, it is rigious and time consuming effort of the obervations and verificaiton of our realities. Therefore, dun link faith and science together. this is twisting and meshing the two words, science and faith together, and thus tainting our argument.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, faith is the the following defintions, not exhaustive, which i picked from internet dictionary... so dun lump science with faith</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, haha, I would like to educate people and clarify at the same time certain things about religious people. Religious people, some of them, do really are very nice people and do really great things for the society than most armchair atheists. I dun deny that. Of course, there are atheist who do good as well, just think bill gates and his gates melinda foundation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i am against really is that when these very loving good people do good things to the society and they happen to be a deovted religious people at the same time, they are creating a double edge sword effect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On one hand, poor and unfortunate people get helped. On the other bad end, the belief in god also caused public to think that yah.. god is true because this great people are so caring to the world and they believe in god too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a results, the numble of believers increased. This is where the problem begins. In our reality, wrong beliefs, illogical beliefs will have negative effects. Therefore, even if they create help down here, they are also causing harm in this other area, which i know that they will not intentionally cause harm. i respect this people for their good intentions and the achievements they make in other aspects of their life, but i also want to educate them as well as readers to this particular error they make which is spreading to other people. Therefore, i am not attacking these people wholesale, i am only highlighting the certain aspects of their beliefs which is causing negative effects. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point is this. as an atheist, i will tell you this, if you believe in god, you will not go to hell . neither will atheist try to beat you up for believing like that. Atheist will mostly do talking to you. most atheist dun even bother to change other people. Trust me, most atheist is not bothered about changing other people beliefs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally, i dabble in atheism talk because its feels nice to hold a debate and because its feel right to argue what is right in the world.</p>

              <p><br> fine i will reply your thread and clear my intention. here it
                  goes.</p>
              <p>Firstly, i not desperate about spreading atheism. To me it just
                  a once in a while dabbling. Secondly, science is not hocus pocus,
                  it is rigious and time consuming effort of the obervations and
                  verificaiton of our realities. Therefore, dun link faith and
                  science together. this is twisting and meshing the two words,
                  science and faith together, and thus tainting our argument.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, faith is the the following defintions, not
                  exhaustive, which i picked from internet dictionary... so dun
                  lump science with faith</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. confidence or trust in a person or thing: <span><em>faith in another's ability.</em></span> 2. belief that is
                  not based on proof: <span><em>He had faith that the
                  hypothesis would be substantiated by fact.</em></span> 3. belief in
                  God or in the doctrines or teachings of religion: <span><em>the firm faith of the Pilgrims.</em></span></p>
              <p>Thirdly, i say chow meng was immature, not the whole world,
                  because, because of the supersitious act he did last time when he
                  tried those spiritual acts, which he himself said he was foolish.
                  so, please dun malign me and twist my words. I feel just like those
                  celebrities who is always trying to clarify with the media but only
                  end up being distorted. Now i know how they feel like, except that
                  my is a milder case, much milder one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, your arugments , i have heard many times this kind of
