Bookstores stock books that people want to buy. They don't really care about the content of the books they carry.<br><br>The government does regulate what books can be sold. For example, you can't buy the Jehovah Witness' version of the Bible. Books about politics in Singapore are also carefully regulated.<br><br>I think some bookstores may give Lee Kuan Yew's book more prominent placing on shelves, but in general, a bookstore is just a retail business and retail businesses stock what sells.</div>

He's the Minister turned Atheist that was mentioned in another post.<br><br>The letter to something something is Sam Harris' Letter to a Christian Nation. It's a short book and it's quite militant. Probably Christians will find this offensive.<br><br>The God Delusion is of course by Richard Dawkins. Dawkins is very eloquent and I think he makes good arguments though of cousre some people find him offensive as well. I'm a big fan of Dawkins. He also has a nice british accent that makes him very easy to listen to.</div>
