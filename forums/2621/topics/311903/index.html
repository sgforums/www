              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">:<span>  </span>The Bible is a compilation of trashy, incoherent, confabulated, incredible tales, poems, sagas, and pieces of<span>  </span>dramas. It is full<span>  </span>of hatred, murder greed falsehoods, lust, sado-masochism, absurdities, contradictions, stupidities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">T:<span>   </span>Don't you know that the Bible was written by God and that every word in it is inspired and divine?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Times New Roman;">A:" Since there is not now and never has been a god, it world be rather<span>  </span>difficult for him to write a book. Incidentally, every religion in the world has claimed a sacred book. Your Bible is one one of these. Some of the other great<span>  </span>sacred books are the Veda, the Koran the Torah, the Upanishads, the Oahspe. Each one of them was "written by a god " too.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>   </span>Actually no one wrote any book at any time. That's obvious when one sees<span>  </span>the conflicting claims of all these god books.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>    </span>In respect to the Bible, your Judeo-Christian book, no one knows who wrote<span>  </span>what, or where, or when. It is particularly difficult with the New Testament. There was no Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John. It looks now as if there never was even a Paul. ff there was, there is much debate over whether he did or did not write any of the letters ascribed to him.</span></p>

Christians deny the divinity of all bibles but their own. We deny the divinity of only one more than they do.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>   </span>Out of 250 Jewish-Christian writings, sixty-six have arbitrarily been declared cannonical by Protestants. The rejected books are of the same general character as those now published together as The Holy Bible. Circumstances rather than merit determined selection.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>    </span>For 150 years the Christian Bible consisted of the sacred books of the Jews. The New Testament was not <span> </span>formed until the later half of the second century, when Irenaeus selected twenty books from among forty or<span>  </span>more gospels, nearly as many acts of apostles, a score of revelations, and a hundred epistles. Why were these particular books chosen? Why four gospels instead of one? lreneaus: "There are four quarters of the earth in which we live and four universal winds." The Gospels were unknown to Peter, Paul, and the early Church Fathers. They were forged later.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>    </span>The Bible did not assume anything like its present form until the fourth century. The Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Protestant canons were not adopted until modern times. The Bible was recognized as a collection of independent writings. The Council of Trent (1563) determined the Roman Catholic canon, consisting of seventy-two books. The Romanists anathemize the Protestant Bible, and the Protestants denounce the Catholic Bible as a "popish imposture." The Greek Catholics at the Council<span>  </span>of Jerusalem in<span>  </span>1647 approved the list of sixty-six book, composing the Authorized Version, the one most used in America. Our Bible, therefore, is less than three hundred years old. Adoption was by majority vote.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>    </span>None of the men contributing most to form the canon accepted all these books. Chrysostom (347?. -4077, Patriarch of Constantinople), who named the Bible, rejected six of the sixty-six -- Esther, Jonah, Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation. Calvin ( 1509-1564, French theologian and reformer in Switzerland ) excluded Revelation as unintelligible. Thomas Jefferson: "It is between fifty and sixty years since I read the Apocalypse (Revelation), and I then considered it merely the ravings of a maniac... What has not meaning admits of no explanation."</span></span></p>

Their language did not exist in his age. They<span>  </span>record his death and burial (Deut. 34:5-6) and refer to persons of a later date (Gen. 36:31-39). A life of<span>  </span>Washington naming Lincoln cannot be by Washington. For forty-two proofs that Moses did not write these five books, see "The Bible" by Ramsburg. They were produced centuries later, and are of a composite character, being compiled after the Babylonian captivity, from four sources. The internal evidence of later origin is<span>  </span>irrefutable. Tell-tale phrases and thoughts occur throughout<span>  </span>Hilkiah's "findings" of these books ( 2 Kings 22:8) was a pious fraud.</span></span></p>

George Smith of the British Museum unearthed <span> </span>Assyrian terra-cotta tablets older than the Books of Moses, which give accounts of the Creation, the Temptation, the Tower of Babel, and the Flood virtually identical with the Genesis accounts. The Babylonian first man was named Adami. Adam and Eve are not referred to again in the Old Testament. </span></span></p>

              Can We Believe the Bible?
              
              Contradictions
              
                   Satan provokes David to number Israel (1 Chron. 21: 1), God moves him to number them (2 Sam. 24: 1). If  both accounts are true, God and Satan are the same person. The Bible God punishes neither Satan nor David, but slays 70,000 Israelites for being counted - at his own instigation, according to one version.David  justly remonstrates with his diety (2 Sam24:17) "Lo, I have sinned... But these sheep,what have they done:"
                  " Thou shalt not steal"( Ex.20:15.) "Ye shalt spoil the Egyptains" Ex.3:22
                  " The wicked prosper( Job.21:7.) Not so Ec.8:13.
                   With God all things are possible."(Matt.19:26.) He 'could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.' (Jud. 1:19)
                 " There is no respect of persons with God." (Ram. 2:11) He authorizes selling diseased meat to aliens. (Deut. 14:21)
                    Image making forbidden. (Ex. 20:4) Commanded. (Ex. 25:18)
                  Paul and James clash over justification. Paul: "A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law." (Ram 3:28) James: "by works a man is justified, and not by faith only." (James 2:24)
                  Martin Luther (1483 - 1546, German theologian) Table Talk: "He that says the gospel requires works for  salvation, I say flat and plain he is a liar. If men only believe enough in Christ they can commit adultery and murder a thousand times a day without periling their salvation.' Luther denounced James for teaching  salvation by works.Christians, whom do you follow, Paul and Luther or James?
                   The Bible contains 2,000 contradictions.
              
              Doctored Passages
              (Bible Societies, please note)
              
                 The Bible begins with a forgery. " In the beginning God" should read " In the beginning the gods." The Hebrew word Elohim is plural. In 1 Sam. 26:19 - " Go,serve other gods' - is correctly translated.
              The following are a few of the many deliberately mistranslated passages:
                 Isa. 7:14 "Virgin." should read "young woman." The tense also has been changed. A  manufactured 
              prophecy.
                   Luke 2:33: " Joseph and his mother marvelled." Should read " his father and his mother marvelled."
                  Job. 13:15: " Though he slay me,yet will I trust him" should read " He will slay me: I have no hope. What a  fraud! Job is not a Jewish book.
                  Job. 19:25: " I know that my redeemer liveth" should read " I know that my avenger liveth." The translators preferred prophecy to truth.
                 The  differences between the Catholic and Protestant Bibles are numerous. Matt.3:2 is translated by the Protestants, " Repent ye, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand." The Catholic renders it " Do penance...." The  controverted word occurs fifty times in the New Testament.
                 The doctrine of the Trinity was smuggled into the First Epistle of St.John: "For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father; the Word and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one." The Revised Version  omits the Trinity doctrine , but the King James Version, which the Bible societies and the Gideons so  industriously distribute, contains the falsehood. Thomas Jefferson: " The incomprehensible jargon of  Trinitarian arithmetic, that three are one and one is three. " The ignorant and the hypocritical clergy still  preach the Trinity.
                   Fraud begot the Bible and sustain it.
              
              Puzzles for the Pious
              
                  On what day did the merciful Heavenly Father create the germs of infantile paralysis, cholera marbus, syphilis, bubonic plague, diptheria, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and scarlet fever? Did he do well to create them? Did all these creatures of God live on Adam and Eve? O ye Bible Societies and Institutes, and ye Daughters of the American Revolution and ye Gideons, what say ye?
                  Who was the father of Joseph -- Jacob (Matt 1: 16) or Hell (Luke 3:23)?
              
              Believe it or Not!
              
                 God instructs Moses how to make a perfume, with death for those who imitate it. (Ex. 30: 34- 8)
                  To build a temple, David gives more gold and silver than England and America possess today.
                  (1 Chron. 22:14)
                   Foxes become firebrands. (Jud. 15:4)
                   Day and night before the sun. (Gen. 1)
                   Aaron, by stretching out hand covers Egypt with frogs. The magicians produce another layer of frogs.  (Ex. 8: 6- 7)
              
              Absurdities
              
                  The sun obligingly backs ten degrees to guarantee a fig poultice for Hezekiah. (2 Kings 20:7-11)
                "Sons of God" cohabit with daughters of men, producing giants. (Gen. 6:4) Who believes it? Illiterate 
              hillbillies, but no educated person. "Sons of God" should read "Sons of the gods."
                Jesus curses a fig tree for not bearing figs out of season. (Mark 11:12-22)
                " To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth forever." (Ps.136: 10)
                  A human body disappears into the sky (Luke 24:51). Ask an astronomer or aviator where it went.
                 A ghost begets a baby. (Matt 1:18) The mother is a virgin. (Matt 1:22-3) Thomas Jefferson: "The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as his father in the womb of a virgin, will  be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter." (Mere., Cor., &amp; Misc. ed. by T.J. Randolph, v. 4, p. 365) That day has come.
              
               Impossibilities
              
                  All the livestock of the Egyptians are killed with murrain (Ex. 9:3-6), and then afflicted with boils and blains (8-10), after which most of them perish again in a hailstorm (19-25), and finally are wiped out once more by the destroying angel (13:15). That's too much, by a great deal. The horses, however, suffer still another death (14:9, 27-8). Why harm animals for their owners deeds?
                  At Gettysburg, the greatest battle in the Civil War, the defeated army lost fewer that 5,000 men. In the tribal wars among the primitive Jews, the dead on one side reached 500,000. (2 Chron. 13:17) The Jews never lost one one-hundredth of that number in one battle.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Prophecies They were generally written after the fact. When the bible compliers were not doing that they were making prophecies so broad that they were bound to be interpreted as having come to pass earlier. Prophecies are often vague in expression and can be interpreted in any sense to suit any purpose. Fulfillments of prophecies can also be arranged and engineered, such as the formation of the state of Israel (2Chron:9-8,2Samuel 7:10) by the Christian countries in 1948. We can prophesy to. "There will be wars and rumours of wars." That's our prophecy, and it is just as true now when we prophesy it as when if prophesied in Matthew 24:6 and in Mark13:7. Adam to die on the day he ate the apple. (Gen.2:16,17) .Adam and Eve did not die in the day on which they ate the forbidden fruit but they lived to the ripe old age of nine hundred and thirty years. (Gen.5:5) Cain was to be a wanderer. Gen.4:9-12. And the Lord said unto Cain...., " A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. " But in Gen. 16,17, Cain lived a settled life. He dwelt "in the land of Nod and builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch." Damascus to be destroyed. "Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. (Isa. 17:10) Damascus has been fortunate rather than otherwise. It is still in a fairly prosperous condition. Egypt to be utterly desolate (Ezek. 29:9-14)....."And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste..." Egypt is still flourising in this century. Jesus to be enthroned as King of the Jews. Luke 1:32,33. " The Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever." As Jesus never received the throne of David, nor reigned over the House of Jacob, who indeed rejected him, it is still unfulfilled, for the Jews still reject the Gospel. Jesus predicted his return within the lifetime of some of his hearers (Matt. 16: 28).` This passage show clearly that Christ's coming in power and glory to judge the quick and the dead was to take place during the time of then-existing persons. Most of the true prophecies were written after the event. The Bible ends with an unfulfilled prophecy. Second-hand revelation is hearsay. Christianity is based on falsehood. Two Cosmogonies Genesis contains two accounts of creation. The first includes chapter 1 and the first three verses of chapter 2; the second account comprises the remainder of chapter 2. They contradict each other. In the first, trees are created before man. In one, man and woman are made at the same time; in the other, woman is an afterthought. The break in the story between verses three and four of the second chapter is obvious. For eighteen contradictions in the two accounts of creation, see "The Bible." The aim of the first is to make the Sabbath a holy day; of the second, to establish the doctrines of the Fall of Man and the Subjection of Woman. Sabbath observance is as superstitious as observance of Friday the thirteenth. The Sabbath and the word "Sabbath" were borrowed from the Babylonians. That the Fall of Man is fiction is tacitly taught in nearly every American high school by teaching Evolution. Civilizations rose and fell before the Jews ever heard of the Creation myth given in Genesis. "Evolutionist" Christian, did man fall before or after becoming an ape? Also, with which man does the Bible genealogy going back to Adam become fictitious? Evolution ousts the Bible from the schools. Two Flood Stories Two contradictory reports of the Flood are intermingled in Chs. 6, 7, and 8 of Genesis. According to one (7:2), clean beasts went into the Ark by sevens; the other, by twos (7:8-9). Flooding the world to destroy men is like burning a barn to kill rats; and the third, Deut. 5. they are contradictory. A ship 150yds. long, 25 wide, and 15 high (Gen.6:15) holds pairs, or sevens, fourteen, of every living thing. The Ark has three stories, but only one 27 in. window for ventilation (16). The Black Hole of Calcutta was nothing compared to the Ark. The water was five and one-half miles high over the earth. Gen.7:20.Where did it go ? Eight persons handled the world's greatest menagerie. The carnivorous animals required tons of flesh daily. The Flood story was copied from an old Babylonian myth. Bishop Colenso, translating the Bible for savages, was jolted out of Orthodoxy by the honest questions of his native assistant. This limerick immortalizes the event: " To the heretic Bishop of Natal, Whose doubts of the Deluge were fatal, Said an Infidel Zulu, "Do you believe that, you fool, you ?' ' No, I don't, said the Bishop of Natal." Confess, O Priests, the Flood is fiction. The Ten Commandments The first Ten Commandments is in Ex.20; the second, Ex 34; and the third, Deut.5. They are contradictory. As a moral code, the Commandments are defective. The first four have no moral value. The first three deal with relations to God, not Man. The Bible God commanded the breaking of all the commandments, except those involving himself. He gave orders to steal (Ex. 3:21-2), kill (Ex. 32:27), commit adultery (Hosea 1:2), and incited the Jews to appropriate the property of their neighbors (Deut. 20:10-17). The first commandment reflects upon God as conceited; the second prohibits the arts of painting, sculpture, and photography; the third says that God is jealous (jealousy is a vice) and that he visits the iniquity of the fathers upon children - a manifest injustice; the fourth, establishing the Sabbath, because God rested on the seventh day ( first Ten Commandments) or because "he delivered his people on that day" ( the third Ten Commandments), is broken by all but a few Jews; the fifth gives a selfish and false reason for honoring parents; and the tenth classes wives with asses and other chattels, and recognizes slavery. The Hebrew word translated "servant" means "slave." The Ten Commandments do not restrain wife,child,and slave beaters, religious persecutors, liars ( except in court ), or tyrants. The Decalogue needs debunking. Disharmony of the Gospels (Modernists, please note) What did Judas do with the thirty pieces of silver? Returned them to the chief priest (Matt. 27:3 -5). Bought a field with them (Acts 1: 18). For more than five hundred contradictions in the four gospels, see "The Christ" by Remsberg and also "the Bible Handbook" published by the American Atheist Press, Austin, Texas. Address is available from the Internet. Yahoo – “American Atheist Press” If four witnesses in court contradicted each other as the evangelists do, they would be prosecuted for perjury, and convicted. Thomas Jefferson found in the gospel history of Jesus "a groundwork of vulgar ignorance, of things impossible, of superstitions, fanaticisms, and fabrications," (Mere., Cot., &amp; Misc., ed. by T.J. Randolph, vol. 4, p. 325). Christianity evolved from paganism. Christmas is a Pagan festival, celebrating the sun's return Northward. Easter is of Pagan origin. Its movable date disproves its commemorating the resurrection of anyone. Sermon on the Mount The Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 5,6,7) consists largely of romantic nonsense. Its good doctrines were not original and were copied and modified from the Buddhist Scripture called the Dharpamada.. Non-resistance to evil (5:39-42), improvidence (6: 19-34) and dependence on prayer (6:6) are antisocial. Jesus-thinking ignores reality. It doesn't work. This sermon is a literary composition. It was never preached. Reason Condemned (Sunday School Teachers, please note) "Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it" (Gen. 2: 17). "The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God." (1 Cor. 3:19) "We are fools for Christ's sake." (1 Cor. 4:10) "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy." (Col. 2:8) "Not many wise men . . . not many noble are called." (1 Cor. 1:26) Martin Luther: "Reason should be destroyed in all Christians." Henry Buckle ( 1821-1862, English historian): "The Clergy, with a few honorable exceptions, have in all modern countries been the avowed enemies of the diffusion of knowledge." Robert Green Ingersoll ( 1833-1899,America's greatest Agnostic and Orator ):" It is claimed that every member of the church has solemnly agreed never to outgrow the creed; that he has pledged himself to remain an intellectual dwarf. Upon this condition the church agrees to save his soul, and he hands over his brains to bind the bargain.....with scraps of dogma and crumbs of doctrine, he agrees that his soul shall be satisfied forever... Growth is heresy. "<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p></div>

              Is the Bible a Safe Moral Guide?
              
              Slavery
              
                    God establishes slavery (Lev. 25:44-6, Ex. 21:2-6). A man may sell his daughter (Ex. 21:7).
                    God orders slave-capturing expeditions (Deut. 20:10-15).
                    God directs slave branding (Ex. 21:6).
                  Jesus saw nothing wrong with slavery. As I. E. Levine says in his book," The Many Faces of Slavery, " 
              Christ accepted the practice of slavery. He  believed that a slave  was duty bound to serve his master well." 
              This is not realized by many people as the Greek word "doulos" is wrongly  translated in the new testament as "servant.â€� That those he referred to in his  parables were slaves is shown by the way in which they are treated.  People  who can be tortured, cut in two, and beaten, are obviously  not just servants.
                  The New Testament sanctions slavery ( 1 Tim. 6: 1, Titus 2:9, Eph. 6:5, 1 Pet. 2:18).
                 Jesus sanctioned slavery: " And that servant which knew his god's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his lord's will, shall be beaten with many stripes" (Luke,12:47)
                 Rejecting the Bible, the French Revolutionists abolished slavery in the colonies. Regaining control, the 
              church reintroduced the Bible and slavery.
                  The most Christian king, George 111, abhorred abolition; the Infidels, Paine and Jefferson, favored it, but were frustrated by Christian slave owners. The Declaration of Independence, as drafted by Jefferson, 
              condemned slavery.
                  The most zealous defenders of slavery in America were Bible moralists.
                  The Rev. Alexander Campbell: "There is not one verse in the Bible inhibiting slavery, but many regulating it. If [slavery] is not then, we conclude, immoral."
                The Abolitionists were Infidels. Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation nullified "God's law." The Civil War was a contest between Bible morality and social morality. Jefferson Davis was a Christian. Lincoln was not.
              
              Witchcraft
              
                  "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." (Ex. 22:18)
                  Three hundred thousand persons have been killed because of that text. The soil of the Republic is stained 
              with innocent blood because of that text. There is not a more terrible text in the Bible, except the words of 
              Jesus damning disbelievers. For three centuries, witch fires were burned in nearly every town of Europe, 
              lighted by that text. Four hundred persons were burned at Toulouse, France in one day.
                  Other texts supporting belief in witchcraft include 2 Chron. 33:6, lsa. 8:19, 1 Sam 15:23, Micah 5:12, 
              Nahum 3:4, Lev 20:27, and Gal. 5:20.
                  Joan of Arc was put to death as a witch. The church kills, then canonizes.
                 John Wesley (1703 - 1791; English theologian &amp; evangelist): "Giving up witchcraft is at once flatly to 
              contradict the revealed word of God in various passages both of the Old and New Testaments." Journal 1768
                 Martin Luther: "I should have no compassion on these witches: I would burn them all."
              
              Polygamy
              
                 The Patriarchs of the Old Testament were polygamists. the New Testament nowhere prohibits a plurality of  wives, notwithstanding polygamy flourished in Palestine. Monogamy came from pagan  Rome, not Jerusalem.
                Martin Luther approved polygamy and advised Henry VIII to adopt it, but by divorcing two wives and 
              murdering two more, the founder of the Episcopal church avoided embarrassment.
              
              Improper Literature
              (Society for the Suppression of Vice, please note)
              
                  The Bible contains baser matter than that for which men and women have been imprisoned. Chapters 19 and 38 of Genesis are the worst. Read them. If they please you, look up these chapters: Gen 16,19-35,20:12, 26, 29, 30, 34, and 39; Num. 31; 1 Sam. 25, 2 Sam 11 and 13, 2 Sam 13:2, 14 ,2 Sam 15:16; 16:21-23 and Judges 19. Ruth, Esther, and the Songs of Solomon are more entertaining than moral. Christians would denounce these chapters and books, if outside the Bible. You might also read: Lev. 15:16-33; Isa. 36:12; Ezek. 4:12-15, Ezek.23. 1-49, Isa. 23:17-18., Hos. 1:2-3-, 4-14 , Amos 2:7 and 1 Corinth. 5:1.

                  " The  word of the LORD came to me " Son of man, there  were  two women, daughters of  the   same   mother. They  became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their  breasts were  fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed. The older was named  Oholah, and her sister                 was Oholibah. .She did not give  up the prostitution  she began in Egypt, when during  her youth  men              slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her . There  she  lusted  after                    her  lovers, whose  genitals  were like  those of  donkeys  and whose  emission was like that of horses.
                 So you  longed  for the  lewdness of your youth, when  in Egypt  your bosom was  caressed and  your                 young breasts fondled....'

                   " And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for  he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. And the firstborn said unto the younger" Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the   manner of  all the earth:  " Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our  father. " And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay  with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to  pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, " Behold, I lay yesternight with father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve  seed of our father.. " And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger sister arose  also, and lay with him; and he perceive not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both  the daughters of Lot with child by their father. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab:  the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same s the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day. "

And  Onan knew that the  seed (sperm) should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went  in unto  his brother's  wife, that he spilled it (sperm) on the ground, lest that he should  give seed to his  brother.

                    " The most dangerous book ( the Bible) on earth. Keep it under lock and key .-  George Bernard Shaw. -
                   "  Keep the Bible out of your reach especially children before they emulate those  sex-maniac characters  in  the Holy Bible. If bad books are to be  burned the largest amount should consist of Bibles. Burn  the  Bible before they poison the  minds of your children." --- United World Atheist ---
              
              Intolerance
              
                 Liberty of thought is alien to the Bible. A father must slay his own daughter, wife, son, or friend for a 
              difference of religion (Deut. 13:6-10). The New Testament is no better. "I would they were even cut off which trouble you." (Gal. 5:12) The Inquisition carried out the spirit of the text. Death for heresy (Ex. 22:20).
                 Death for adultery (Lev. 20:10). Death for eating fat (Lev 7:25). For 23 capital offences for trivialities, see "The Bible." The penal code is barbarous.
                  Elijah slays 450 priests for differing from him in religion (1 Kings 18: 40).
                  Jefferson: "In every country and in every age the priest has been hostile to liberty."
              
              Cruelty
                   Elisha causes bears to tear children for laughing at his bald head (2 Kings 2: 23- 4).
                   Children should be beaten with rods (Prov. 23: 14).
                   Robbing bird nests ordered to lengthen life (Deut. 22:6- 7).
              
              Tyranny
                   The Bible contradicts the Declaration of Independence. It enjoins the unquestioning obedience to rulers -- "the powers that be are ordained by God... they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation." (Rom. 13: 1-2) Slavish submission is also taught in 1 Pet. 2:13-4. Declaration of Independence: "The just powers of  government are derived from the consent of the governed."
                  Washington, Jefferson, Paine, and Franklin are burning in hell, if the Bible is true.
              
              The Patriarchs
                    Abraham debauches his maidservant (Gen. 16:4) and turns her and his child which she bore out into the  wilderness (21: 14).
                    Lot offers his daughters to a mob (Gen. 19:8).
                    Jacob cheats his brother (Gen. 27:19)
                   Gideon has "many wives." (Judges 8:30). He was more skeptical than we, demanding two signs (Judges 6:36-40), whereas one would convince us.
                   Moses orders innocent women and children killed, and commands his officers "... all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves." (Num. 31:17-8).
                   Joshua was a butcher, with no more mercy in his nature than an Apache Indian. Massacres many people. Josh. Chs. 6,10, and 11.
                   Samuel hews Agag in pieces before the Lord. 1 Sam. 15:33.
                  David was God's favourite. Read his record: " And he brought out the people... And cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon." 1 Chron.20:3. Tortures prisoners in a brickkiln. 2 Sam. 12-31. Slays and mutilates 200 Philistines and buys a  wife with their foreskins. 1 Sam. 18:27. David was on a cultural level with scalping savages. Lives by massacre and robbery, 1 Sam. 27:8-9; blackmails, 25:8, maintains a harem, 2 Sam. 5:13, locks up ten concubines for life, 2 Sam. 20:3; kills two thirds of the Moabites prisoners and maims the captured horses, 2 Sam. 8:2, 4; murders Uriah and takes his wife, 2 Sam. 11. He was the Jesse James of his time. 1 Sam. 22:2; Died demanding  the blood of two men.  1 Kings 2:5-9. He was indeed a man after God's own heart.
              
               Barbarities and Atrocities
                  Jacob's sons killed the Schechemites and stole their wives (Gen. 34). This fiendish act went unpunished, though Jehovah frequently killed for trivialities. He granted the Jews special privileges.
                   A whole nation massacred (Deut. 2:34).
                   Men, women, and children slain (Deut. 3:6).
                   Peaceful citizens killed (judges 18:27).
              
              Cannibalism and Vampirism
                  A strain of cannibalism  and vampirism appears in the Bible. See Jet. 19:9, Deut 28:53-7, Lam 4:10, and 2 Kings 6:28-9.
                 "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." (John 6:53). 
              Catholics take that literally. Protestants perpetuate the idea, if not the practice.
                  The drinking of wine which symbolizes 'the blood of Jesus' to have 'grace' with God is reminiscent of Bram Stoker's horror-story of "DRACULA THE VAMPIRE"  where he has to suck the blood of innocent victims in order to rejuvenate his life. The Christian's ritual of the Eucharist was a pre-Christian institution, a celebration  of the Sun-God Mithras, and as a deification of the drink orgy of the God Dionysos. "The Lord's Supper" is a  pagan ritual  and a representation of the Mystery Drama of the suffering and dying gods and goddess -- the rite of the annual human sacrifice. It is Primitive Totemism, when in a Sacramental Cannibalism the  worshipper becomes a god himself by killing and eating the God. By eating 'bread' which symbolizes the FLESH of Jesus Christ and drinking his Blood, they are re-enacting the primitive ritual of Vampirism and  Cannibalism - but disguising  it in a more 'modern' way in this modern era.
              
              The Diabolism of God
              (Clergymen, please note )
              
                  Assassinates the first born of every Egyptian family (Ex. 12:29-30).
                  Kills a baby to punish its father for murder (2 Sam 12:14-9)
                  Kills men for not worshipping him (Ex. 22:20)
                 1 Sam. 15:2-3, God speaking, "Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling." Why this cruelty? Because the Amalekites had wronged the Israelites four hundred  years before. Confess, O Christians, that a god who gives such a command is unworthy of worship.
                 Authorizes trial by ordeal (Num. 5: 12-27). A jealous husband may force his wife to drink "bitter" water to test her virtue. If her belly swells and her thigh rots, she is guilty. God neglected to set up a similar test for husbands suspected of unfaithfulness.Do the genitals of men shrink or swell if they are infilial ?
                 "Because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people, 50,700 men." (1 Sam 6:19) 
              God has no sense of proportion. A reprimand would have been adequate. Curiosity is no crime.
                 "And the Lord met him (Moses) and sought to kill him," but is appeased by the offering of a foreskin (Ex. 4:24-6). Christian males who circumcised should do well to preserve their foreskins of their penis and offer them to their God Jehovah.
                Threatens the Israelites with pestilence, but on Moses' pointing out that the Egytians might mock him, 
              decides to let them live.
                  Condemns all men for the sins of one in acquiring knowledge (Rom. 5: 12).
                  Orders wholesale slaughter (Deut 20: 17).
                 Slays Uzzah for steadying the Ark (1 Chron. 12:910). A man so acting would land in the electric chair.
                 Thomas Jefferson pronounces the Bible God "a being of terrific character -- cruel, vindictive, capricious and unjust." ("Memoir, Cor. &amp; Misc." ed. by T.J. Randolph, v. 4, p. 326), and the Jewish priests "a bloodthirsty race" (Ibid, p. 327)
              
              The New Testament sanctifies and upholds unnumerable atrocities of the Old Testaments:
              
                 " If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. Luke 16:31
                  Jesus: " Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am come not to destroy, but to fulfil. 
              For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fullfilled. ." Matt. 5-17-19
                 " It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. Luke 16:17.
              
              Oddities Of God
                 " Behold, I will corrupt you seed, and spread dung upon your faces".... Mal. 2:3
                " And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.Ezek. 4:12-15 ( God commanded Ezekiel to cook publicly his bread with "dung which cometh out of  man. " Ezekiel revolted against this, on ceremonial grounds apparently, and cow's dung ws graciously substituted.)
               " Five golden emerods (hemorrhoids) and five golden mice according to the numbers of the lords of  Philistines. Wherefore ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel. "-- 1 Sam. 6-4. Christians who have their hemorrhoids operated should preserve them and offer them to their God. That would have pleased him.
                " And the Lord said, " Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a  rock : and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cliff  of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by : and I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts; but my face shall not be seen." Exod.33:21-23.
                 " The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man... He shall cry, yea, roar (Isa.42:13). (A roaring god )
                 " The Lord shall roar from on high... He shall mightily roar upon his habitation. Jer.25:30
                 " And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth.
                 Isa.  5:26. ( A hissing god )
                 " I will hiss for them." Zech, 10:8. ( A hissing god )
                " The Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for  the bee 
               that is in the land of Assyria. And they shall come." Isa. 7:18,19.
                  " Then  the earth  shook  and  trembled;  the  foundations   also  of  the  hills  moved  and  were  shaken, because  there  was  warth. There went up  a  smoke  out  of his nostrils, and  fire out  .of  his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it....And he rode upon a  cherub  and  did  fly."  Psalm 18:7-10
                   " Blessed  be the Lord, my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight." Ps.144:1
                   " I will not pity, nor spare,  nor have mercy, but destroy them." Jer. 13:14
               Satan and God on friendly terms. " Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them. And the Lord saith unto Satan, ' Whence comest thou ? 
              And Satan answered the Lord, and said, ' From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. " Job 1:6,7. Was there an inspired conspiracy to deceive mankind ? 
               "And thou shalt kill the bullock before the Lord, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And  thou  shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of altar.. But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with  fire without the camp :  it is a sin offering....." Ex. 29:11-16, 22-27. Christians ridicule the Pagans of offering animal sacrifices to their gods  but who is practising Voodoo ?
