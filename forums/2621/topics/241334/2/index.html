            <div class='col-md body'>Let me give you an example of how difficult "rationality" can be.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sgquitter:</div><div class="quote_body">its not really as 'harmless' as u perceive it to be.</div></blockquote>This statement is fraught with problems. "harmless" and "harmful" are not absolutes. Once you take a position, you are in error. Nothing in this world is intrinsically harmful or harmless.<br><br>Whether or not something is harmful or harmless is dependent on a host of other things. Furthermore, whether something is harmful or harmless is a judgment call.<br><br>Where do you draw the line? Who makes the decisions? What about those that indulge in harmful behavior knowing full well the possible "harms" but took a risk anyway, hoping to escape the possible "harms".<br><br>The average Joe in my observations, do not bother to think through issues. I doubt if "you" would even bother to think through what I have written on harm and harmlessness.<br><br>If you do not bother to think through "harm" and "harmless" and yet you make decisions everyday on the assumption that you "know" harm and harmless; and you call yourself a "rationalist"; what do you think will be the position of the majority of humans?<br><br>If you have not considered "harm" and "harmless" in your everyday dealings in a rational way, how are you not living life in an illusionary and delusional manner, a kettle calling the pot black?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now before I write this I'd just like to say that although I'm Christian, I believe in the need for logic and reasoning; not all Christians are irrational and pious. To say that would be equivalent to saying all Muslims are terrorists, which they <strong>definitely</strong> aren't.<br><br><blockquote>look at this.... some good people die horribly.....<br><br>bad people some of them live ripe old age....<br><br>so i dun see how GOD can be benevolent when these things happen...<br></blockquote>It's not up to us to decide whether God wants to take our lives or not. If the Bible is any indicator of this, all things come in His time, not ours. It's not up to us to fathom why such things happen.<br>Besides, what you define as benevolence is the human aspect of benevolence, where like you said, good people ought to live longer and the bad guys ought to be stillborn. God is on a higher level than humans, and naturally, such titles can't be applied to Him. Attempts to humanize Him will most likely result in us becoming confused and consequently angry that He doesn't behave like we want Him to.<br><br><blockquote><br>what will u all say...<br>must have faith in GOD...<br>GOD must have reason why he does all these<br>good people go to heaven and bad people to hell<br>Satan is responsible for this problem<br></blockquote>Exactly. God has reasons, but it's not up to us to know what these reasons are. He's on a much higher level than us. An analogy would be us and bacteria. If they had the same level of sentience as us, and us a proportinally adjusted level of sentience, we would seem like gods to them, no? Since we perform so many experiments on them; we kill them, we test them on other creatures, we rip them apart to determine their internal workings, wouldn't they be screaming "Why are the gods doing this to us?!" They wouldn't be able to know, right? It's the same with people and God.<br><br><blockquote><br>all this are just talk. there is no proof at all.

There are still so many faraway things that scientists have said to have proven like black holes and quasars. How would we know they really exist? How would we know they're not just anomalies in the system? Science, which most atheists seem to advocate, also requires some amount of faith.

GO to heaven? well, people just talk about heaven all the time</blockquote>Again, all things happen in His time. We lament God's seeming cruelty, God's seeming absence, God's seeming "uncaring"-ness because we cannot know what He is thinking. Besides, this hasn't proved there isn't a God. You can't exactly prove a negative unless you disprove it absolutely.</div>

Sorry. =P<br>The thing is, that proof is really hard to find now, and I think that might be the very thing that is causing the growth of atheism.

You have to believe in them first. It's just like the Laws of Physics. We know of Newton's Three Laws of Motion, but why do we accept them in the first place? There has to be some faith in it for the entire scientific community to accept them as true.</div>
