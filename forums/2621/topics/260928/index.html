            <div class='col-md body'><br><strong>An Urgent 72-Hour Request to Help Keep This Is Your Day on the Air</strong><br><br>My beloved and faithful partner,<br><br>Our precious Lord Jesus is so wonderful! He has never failed this ministry yet.<br><br>And because of my absolute trust in the mighty hand of our precious Lord, I am writing to you with an urgent and very serious need so that, together, we will see a mountain moved for His glory.<br><br>Because of the enormous cost of our massive worldwide crusadesÂ—coupled with the high cost of television airtime that has reached an all-time highÂ—my airtime bill with TBN has mounted to a critical level that must be paid immediately.<br><br>As of June 1, my airtime charges due to TBN, averaging approximately $450,000 a month, are four months past due. This need of approximately $1.8 million dollars is immediate and pressing, and it requires your most urgent attention. In fact, unless I raise a substantial amount of money in the next 72 hours, This Is Your Day! could be taken off one of its airings on TBN.<br><br>As you know, I rarely come to you with a message of such an urgent nature; and frankly, I had hoped to avoid coming to you in this way until I saw no other choice. But I felt you would WANT and NEED to know how the incredible cost of our international crusades has affected our ministry and the enormous strain these expenses have created, bringing about this deficit. So now I must turn to you for helpÂ—absolutely certain that you will come through.<br><br>My wonderful friends Paul and Jan Crouch have supported me and this ministry in ways I cannot express. Because of their undying love for the Gospel and the kindred spirit we share to reach the world for Jesus, they have been unspeakably generous and kind to this ministry and to This Is Your Day! And although they have been more patient than any friends could ever be, our airtime bills have continued to mount, and I cannotÂ—will notÂ—allow our bill with TBN to go unpaid.<br><br>Because of the unprecedented move of God throughout the whole earth, we have traveled to the furthest corners of the world and seen hundreds and hundreds of thousands accept our wonderful Jesus as their personal Savior. From Cyprus to Singapore, Africa to the Dominican Republic, countless lives have been saved, healed, and delivered in 2007 alone. But as wonderful as these victories are, they have come at a very high cost and have created substantial financial challenges that must be met.<br><br>My dearest friend, imagine the harm that could befall this ministry if we were to lose even one of our time slots on the worldÂ’s most-watched Christian networkÂ—TBN. If This Is Your Day! were to be taken off TBN, we would lose coverage in most of the major regions of the worldÂ—causing crusades to be cancelled and souls to be lost. The loss for the sake of the Gospel would be immense and irreversible. The very thought of this is frightening and unthinkable; for the desperate cry of a waiting world beckons me to the unmet needs of hungry souls around the globe!<br><br>So my message to you is simple and clear: I need you to help me TODAY with the most generous and sacrificial gift you can give to help keep This Is Your Day! on the air on your TBN station. Your gift, regardless of its size, will make a difference and will be put to use immediately to keep This Is Your Day! strong on TBN.<br><br>So I ask you not to waitÂ—but to click the Â“Donate NowÂ” button on your screen. IÂ’d like to present a sizeable payment on our airtime bill to Paul and Jan Crouch in the next 72 hours, but I cannot do it without your help.<br><br>These are unprecedented moments in history. The world is crying for the only message that can keep the souls of men from eternal destruction. The doors that are open today may not be open tomorrow. O, how our enemy would love to defeat us, but he will not, for we are more than conquerors in the mighty name of Jesus.<br><br>Thank you for your love for our wonderful Master, Jesus. I want you to know that I love you very much and thank Him every day for the partnership we have. LetÂ’s move this mountain in HIS mighty name and for the sake of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, our wonderful Lord.<br><br>Winning the lost at any cost,</div>
