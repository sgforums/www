              <h1>Mother who defied the killers is gunned down</h1>
              <p id="stand-first"><em>Five
              weeks ago Leila Hussein told The Observer the chilling story of how her
              husband had killed their 17-year-old daughter over her friendship with
              a British soldier in Basra. Now Leila, who had been in hiding, has been
              murdered - gunned down in cold blood. Afif Sarhan in Basra and Caroline
              Davies report on the final act.</em></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Leila
              Hussein lived her last few weeks in terror. Moving constantly from safe
              house to safe house, she dared to stay no longer than four days at
              each. It was the price she was forced to pay after denouncing and
              divorcing her husband - the man she witnessed suffocate, stamp on, then
              stab their young daughter Rand in a brutal 'honour' killing for which
              he has shown no remorse.</p>
              <p>Though she feared reprisals for speaking
              out, she really believed that she would soon be safe. Arrangements were
              well under way to smuggle her to the Jordanian capital, Amman. In fact,
              she was on her way to meet the person who would help her escape when a
              car drew up alongside her and two other women who were walking her to a
              taxi. Five bullets were fired: three of them hit Leila, 41. She died in
              hospital after futile attempts to save her.</p>
              <p>Her death, on 17
              May, is the shocking denouement to a tragedy which had its origins in
              an innocent friendship between her student daughter, Rand Abdel-Qader,
              17, and a blond, 22-year-old British soldier known only as Paul.</p>
              <p>The
              two had met while Rand, an English student at Basra University, was
              working as a volunteer helping displaced families and he was
              distributing water. Although their friendship appears to have involved
              just brief, snatched conversations over four months, Rand had confided
              her romantic feelings for Paul to her best friend, Zeinab, 19.</p>
              <p>She
              died, still a virgin, four months after she had last seen him when her
              father, Abdel-Qader Ali, 46, discovered that she had been seen talking
              'to the enemy' in public. She had brought shame on his honour, was his
              defence, and he had to cleanse his family name. Despite openly
              admitting the murder, he has received no punishment.</p>
              <p>It was two
              weeks after Rand's death on 16 March that a grief-stricken Leila,
              unable to bear living under the same roof as her husband, found the
              strength to leave him. She had been beaten and had had her arm broken.
              It was a courageous move. Few women in Iraq would contemplate such a
              step. Leila told The Observer in April: 'No man can accept being left
              by a woman in Iraq. But I would prefer to be killed than sleep in the
              same bed as a man who was able to do what he did to his own daughter.'</p>
              <p>Her
              words were to prove prescient. Leila turned to the only place she
              could, a small organisation in Basra campaigning for the rights of
              women and against 'honour' killings. Almost immediately she began
              receiving threats - notes calling her a 'prostitute' and saying she
              deserved to die like her daughter.</p>
              <p>Even her sons Hassan, 23,
              and Haydar, 21, whom she claimed aided their father in their sister's
              killing, disowned her. Meanwhile, her husband, a former government
              employee, escaped any charges, and even told The Observer that police
              had congratulated him on what he had done.</p>
              <p>It is not known who
              killed Leila. All that is known is that she was staying at the house of
              'Mariam', one of the women's rights campaigners, whose identity The
              Observer has agreed not to reveal. On the morning of 17 May, they were
              joined by another volunteer worker and set off to meet 'a contact' who
              was to help Leila travel to Amman, where she would be taken in by an
              Iraqi family.</p>
              <p>'Leila was anxious, but she was also happy at
              having the chance to leave Iraq,' said Mariam. 'Since the death of her
              daughter, her own life was at serious risk. And this was a great
              opportunity for her to leave the country and to fight for Iraqi women's
              rights.</p>
              <p>'She had not been able to sleep the night before. I
              stayed up talking to her about her plans after she arrived in Amman. I
              gave her some clothes to take with her and she was packing the only bag
              she had. She was too excited to sleep.'</p>
              <p>Mariam said that when she
              awoke Leila had already prepared breakfast, cleaned her house and even
              baked a date cake as a thank-you for the help she had been given. After
              the arrival of 'Faisal', the volunteer (whose identity is also being
              protected), the three left the house at 10.30am and started walking to
              the end of the street to get a taxi. They had walked less than 50
              metres when they heard a car drive up fast and then gunshots rang out.
              The attack, said by witnesses to have been carried out by three men,
              was over in minutes. Leila was hit by three bullets. Mariam was hit in
              her left arm and Faisal in her left leg. 'I didn't realise I had been
              shot for a few seconds, because as I heard the gunfire I saw Leila
              falling to the ground and saw blood pouring from her head,' said
              Mariam. 'I was so shocked, I didn't immediately feel the pain.'</p>
              <p>Two
              men ran from their homes to help. They rushed Leila to hospital and a
              passing taxi took the other two. But Leila died at 3.20pm, despite
              several operations to save her. As she lay in her own hospital bed
              receiving treatment, Mariam said that she heard someone saying that
              Leila had been shot in the head. But there were other mutterings that
              were clearly audible. 'I could hear people talking on the corridors and
              the only thing that they had to say was that Leila was wrong for
              defending her daughter's mistakes and that her death was God's
              punishment.</p>
              <p>'In that minute I just had complete hatred in my heart for those who had killed her.'</p>
              <p>Police
              said the incident was a sectarian attack and that there was nothing to
              link Leila's death to her family. 'Her ex-husband was not in Basra when
              it happened. We found out he was visiting relatives in Nassiriya with
              his two sons,' said Hassan Alaa, a senior officer at the local police
              station in Basra. 'We believe the target was the women activists,
              rather than Mrs Hussein, and that she was unlucky to be in that place
              at that time.'</p>
              <p>It is plausible. Campaigners for women's' rights
              are not acceptable to many sections of Iraqi society, especially in
              Basra where militias have partial control in some districts and impose
              strict laws on locals, including what clothing they should wear and
              what religious practice they should follow.</p>
              <p>Since February 2006,
              two other activists from the same women's organisation have been killed
              in the city. One of them was reportedly raped before being shot. The
              other, the only man working for the non-governmental organisation
              (NGO), and a father of five who was responsible for the organisation's
              finances, was shot five months ago.</p>
              <p>There could be many with a
              grudge against such organisations. However, Mariam believes Leila was
              targeted, pointing out she had been hit by three bullets. 'When we were
              shot, they focused on Leila, not us,' she said.</p>
              <p>Since the
              attack the NGO has stopped its work in Basra. 'We daren't answer the
              phones because we have received so many threats since we gave our
              support to Leila's case,' said Mariam. 'Most of our members are
              preparing to leave the city and even Iraq if they can raise the money.'</p>
              <p>A
              single mother since her husband was killed for refusing to join a
              militia, she too intends to move when she can. Faisal, who also
              survived her injuries, is still suffering post-surgical infection. She
              preferred not to speak, but her mother, who wished to remain anonymous,
              said: 'My daughter is very shocked at what happened, and my two
              grandsons can't stop crying since they saw her in hospital.'</p>
              <p>Leila's burial was arranged within hours of her death by the husband of one of her cousins and Mariam's father.</p>
              <p>The
              Observer visited Rand's father and two brothers at their Basra home,
              but they refused to talk beyond Hassan proclaiming his father's
              innocence. When asked if he would be visiting his mother's grave, he
              shrugged: 'Maybe in the future.'</p>
              <p>Leila was an orphan, raised by
              an uncle who died in the Shia uprising against Saddam Hussein in the
              early 1990s. Hamida Alaa, 68, a friend of the uncle, said: 'The poor
              woman was killed and now her name and history is buried with her. No
              one wants to speak about it. She is just one more woman killed in our
              country who has already been forgotten by the local society.'</p>
              <p>In
              the last days of her life, Leila was suffering from the pressure of
              having gone against her husband. 'She was sleeping with the help of
              sedatives,' said Mariam. 'She would wake up at night with terrible
              nightmares, even dreaming of being suffocated as her daughter was. She
              had been threatened so many times and that's why she was so scared. Her
              indignation over Rand's death is what led her to her own coffin. Their
              history ends here. But Leila was a hero. A woman who was strong enough
              to say no to Iraqi men's bad attitudes. Sadly most Iraqi women do not
              have the same strength and they will stay in their homes.'</p>
              <p>Mariam
              has moved out of her home. But within hours of speaking to The Observer
              a close friend went to her new address to deliver a message that had
              been left for her at her front door. It read: 'Death to betrayers of
              Islam who don't deserve God's forgiveness. Speaking less you will live
              more.' She believes it was sent by Leila's killers.</p>
              <p>'They want this story to be buried with Leila,' she said. 'But I cannot close my eyes to all this.'</p>

              <p>Agreed, Muhammad <strong>was not</strong> a Pedophile but Muhammad married a 9 year old is not a myth. </p>
              <p>A muslim who says Muhammad did not marry a 9 year old do not know his own faith very well. The hadith specifically says muhammad have sex with aishah when she is nine. By aishah own account in the hadith, muhammad had sex with her when she is nine.</p>
              <p>ask any islamic scholar and they will agree that muhammad had sex with aishah when she is nine but this is one aspect of the islamic faith that they do not really wish to talk about.</p>
              <p>Islamic laws considers any male who can produce sperm or female who have periods to be no longer a minor.</p>
              <p>aishah already have her periods when muhammad had sex with her so muhammad <strong>is not</strong> a pedophile as he did not have sex with a minor (according to islamic laws) but do not dispute that muhannad had sex with a nine year old.</p>
              <p>to those who still want to debate this issue, go read the hadith first.</p>

              <p>Note that the previous are in original Arabic, but were not in the English translation. However, the English translator at the front wrote the following under #18.</p>
              <p>"When Hadrat 'A'isha passed nine years of married life, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell in mortal sickness. On the 9th or the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal 11 A.H., he left this mortal world…Hadrat 'A'isha was eighteen years of age at the time when the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed away and she remained a widow for forty-eight years till she died at the age of sixty-seven." <em>Sunan Nasa’i</em> vol.1 #18 p.108-109 (English material at the front)</p>
              <p>Note that she had nine years of married life with Mohammed, and since he died when she was eighteen, she was nine years old when she started her married life with Mohammed.</p>
              <p>Conclusion on Sunan Nasa'i: Not counting English translation notes, the Arabic has 5 references and no counter-references to affirm that A’isha was nine.</p>

              A’isha was married at seven, went to Mohammed’s house at nine, and was 18 when Mohammed died. According to al-Zawa’id, its isnad is sahih according to the condition of Bukhari. However Abu ‘Ubaida did not hear from his father, so it is munqata (has a gap) <em><span style="font-size: small;">Ibn-i-Majah </span></em>vol.3 book 9 ch.13 no.1877 p.134.<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">

              Aisha died in June-July 678 A.D. (A.H. 58) at the age of 66.

              <p>I am from Brunei where study of the Quran and Hadith is compulsory even if I am a non-muslim. If the hadith is erroneous, why get people to study it?</p>
              <p>what point did Faroukalhadad provide? other than linking his argument to</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.justjihad.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18">http://www.justjihad.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18</a> ?</p>
              <p>Lets study the information in the link</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">1. According to several authentic narratives, Aisha accompanied the Muslims in the Battles of Bad’r and Uhud. It is a well known fact in Islamic history that Muhammad disallowed anyone below the age of 15 to participate in his war entourage. Taking time references from these battles and her marriage, she could not be only 9 years old at the time of wedding.</span></p>
              <p>A’isha, being a girl, never fought in any battles. The age of 15 "is the limit between childhood and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manhood</span>". So what would a girl be there for?</p>
              <p>A 10/11-year old, besides keeping Mohammed company at night, had many things to do. The women and young children went on the battlefield after the battle and gave water to the wounded Muslims and finished off the enemy wounded. <em>al-Tabari</em> vol.12 p.127,146. During the days of the battle, the women and children were there to dig graves for the dead. <em>al-Tabari</em> vol.12 p.107</p>
              <p>Finally, young A’isha was considered an adult, for Muslims called a girl an adult when she first started her period according to the English translator's note in <em>Bukhari</em> vol.3 book 48 ch.18 prior to no.832 p.513</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">2. The youngest daughter from Muhammad’s first marriage, Fatimah, was five years older than Aisha. This is as reported by Ibn Hajjar. Fatimah is reported to have been born when Muhammad was 35 years old. Therefore by simple mathematical calculations, it is impossible for Aisha to be only 9 when she got married to Muhammad.</span></p>
              <p><em>Sunan Nasa’i</em> vol.1 #29 p.115-116 (English material at the front) actually says that Fatima was 29 years old when she died (six months after Mohammed), which makes her ten years older than A’isha. So either Ibn Hajar, or else everybody else made a mistake. The authoritative hadiths would be trusted by most Sunni Muslims more than Ibn Hajar. Regardless though, A’isha was younger.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3. Aisha had an elder sister by the name of Asma who was 10 years older than her. Asma died at the ripe old age of 100 years old in the year 73 Hijrah. This means that she would be about 27 years old at the time of Hijrah – a good reference timing for Muhammad’s wedding to Aisha. This clearly illustrates that Aisha was already a teenager when she got married to Muhammad.</span></p>
              <p>Assuming these books are reliable on this point, people can report the age of someone incorrectly after they died.</p>
              <p>For example, if you trust ibn Hajar on the previous slide on when ‘Asma died, you should trust him ibn Hajar’s <em>Isabah</em> IV, p.359-360 when he shows A’isha was married by the time she was 9 years old. (footnote in <em>al-Tabari</em> vol.11 p.141 footnote 766)</p>
              <p>What about the dolls? Contrary to Objection 6, a writer reported that many Muslim sources refer to A’isha still playing with her dolls when she was married. (<em>Sahih Muslim</em> vol.2 book 8 ch.548 no.3310,3311 p.716; <em>Sahih Muslim</em> vol.4 book 29 ch.1005 no.5981-5982 p.1299; <em>Sunan Abu Dawud</em> vol.3 book 36 ch.1769 no.4913 p.1373, ibn Hanbal.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4. Prominent Muslim scholars argue that the particular Hadith, which claim that Aisha’s age at marriage was 9, have only been conveyed from one source- Hisham ibn `Urwah. No other credible sources from his time have related the same thing. For a Hadith to be largely credible, often more than one source has to be cited to ensure its authenticity. </span></p>

If he was mistaken, then all the people who accurately quoted him would have wrong information too. <em>Mizanu'l-ai`tidal</em>, a book on the [life sketches of the] narrators of the traditions of the Prophet (pbuh) reports that when he was old, <em>Hisham's</em> memory suffered quite badly. (v.4, p.301-302)</span></p>
              <span style="color: #000000;">, one of the most well known books on the life and reliability of the narrators of the traditions of the Prophet (pbuh) reports that according to <em>Yaqub ibn Shaibah</em>: "narratives reported by <em>Hisham</em> are reliable except those that are reported through the people of Iraq". It further states that <em>Malik ibn Anas</em> objected on those narratives of <em>Hisham</em> which were reported through people of Iraq. (vol.11, p. 48 - 51) </span><p></p>

              <p>Do you know who is Imam Shafi’i? If you do, please understand you own Islamic teachings and Imam Shafi'i teachings.</p>
              <p>According to Imam Shafi’i, marriage in childhood is not something appreciable. It was under some exceptional circumstances that Hadrat ‘A’isha was married to the Prophet (may peace be upon him). The second point to be noted is that Islam has laid down no age limit for puberty for it varies with countries and races due to climate, hereditary, physical and social conditions. Those who live in cold regions attain puberty at a much later age as compared with those living in hot regions where both male and female attain it at a quite early age. All of this was quoted from <em>Sahih Muslim</em> vol.2 footnote 1958 p.715.</p>

              <p> I am from Brunei where study of the Quran and Hadith is
              compulsory even if I am a non-muslim. If the hadith is erroneous,
              why get people to study it?</p>

              <p>There continues to be a great internal discussion on that. Personally, I think the reason for collecting and following these hearsay of narrations is because of the desire to be a carbon copy of the 7th century people in Hijaz, Arabia.</p>

              <p>Studying is one thing, copying and pasting from a website that declares on its front page to save muslims through the blood of Jesus (by Christian Debater™ no less), is without the touch and counter response of a muslim expert and Ill have to try getting in touch with them before I can get back here.</p>

              <p>We do not throw the baby out of the bathwater, saying Imam Shafi'i or whichever esteemed Imam is somehow wrong and should not be followed anymore. We also don't participate in takfir - declaring muslims non-muslims because they don't seem to be muslim enough, that is the weapon of the Kharijites and the extremists.</p>
              <p>We only say Islam is more than a personality, more than the beaten track of some madhabs, more than a certain religious course of mind.</p>
