            <div class='col-md body'>http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/deja-vu-0607.html<br><br><strong>Research deciphers 'dÃ©jÃ -vu' brain mechanics</strong><br><br>Deborah Halber, News Office Correspondent<br>June 7, 2007<br><br>Neuroscientists at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT report in the June 7 early online edition of Science that they have identified for the first time a neuronal mechanism that helps us rapidly distinguish similar, yet distinct, places. The discovery helps explain the sensation of dÃ©jÃ  vu.<br><br>The work could lead to treatments for memory-related disorders, as well as for the confusion and disorientation that plague elderly individuals who have trouble distinguishing between separate but similar places and experiences.<br><br>Forming memories of places and contexts in which episodes occur engages a part of the brain called the hippocampus. Study co-author Susumu Tonegawa, Picower Professor of Biology and Neuroscience, and colleagues have been exploring how each of the three hippocampal subregions--the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3--contribute to different aspects of learning and memory.<br><br>Tonegawa, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and a frequent world traveler, described his own occasional experience of finding the airport in a new city uncannily familiar. This occurs, he said, because of the similarity of the modules--gates, chairs, ticket counters--that comprise airports worldwide. It is only by seeking out unique cues that the specific airport can be identified, he said. "In this study, we have revealed that learning in the dentate gyrus is crucial in rapidly recognizing and amplifying the small differences that make each place unique," Tonegawa said.<br><br>In addition to Tonegawa, authors include Picower Institute research scientist Thomas J. McHugh; former MIT postdoctoral associate Matthew W. Jones; Matthew A. Wilson, Picower Scholar and Professor; and colleagues from the University of California at Los Angeles and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.<br>Overlapping blueprints<br><br>In this study, the researchers used a genetically altered mouse to pinpoint how the dentate gyrus contributes to the kind of pattern separation involved in telling the difference between new and old spaces.<br><br>Researchers believe that a set of neurons called place cells fire to provide a sort of blueprint for any new space we encounter. The next time we see the space, those same neurons fire. Thus we know when we've been somewhere before and don't have to relearn our way around familiar turf.<br><br>But if we enter a space very similar to one we have seen before, a new but overlapping set of neurons creates the blueprint. When there is enough overlap between the two sets, we experience an eerie feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vu--a French phrase that literally means, "already seen."<br><br>As we age, or as neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's advances, it becomes difficult to form unique memories for similar yet distinct places and experiences, leading to the confusion that afflicts some elderly individuals.<br>Forgetting fear<br><br>In experiments with mice genetically engineered to lack a certain gene in the dentate gyrus, Tonegawa and colleagues pinpointed the signaling pathway underlying the recall of specific places.<br><br>Different sets of mice were placed in two similar chambers, one of which gave them a mild foot shock. After three days, the mice began to freeze in fear in both chambers, even the one in which they had never been harmed.<br><br>Within two weeks, the normal mice learned to associate only one chamber with the foot shocks while recognizing the second as safe. The genetically engineered mice "had a significant but transient deficit in their ability to distinguish similar contexts," McHugh said. "This study shows that plasticity--the ability to change in response to experience--in the dentate gyrus contributes to spatial learning and fine-tuning pattern separation."<br><br>This work was supported by the National Institute for Mental Health and the National Institutes of Health.</div>

Didn't you just ask me that 5 mins ago?"<br><br>It's like that scene in the matrix where Neo sees the cat walking by the staircase, and moments later, he sees the same scene again.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The term "dÃ©jÃ  vu" (IPA:/deʒa vy/) (French for "already seen", also called paramnesia from the Greek word para (παρα<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> for parallel and mnimi (μνήμη<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> for memory) describes the experience of feeling that one has witnessed or experienced a new situation previously. The term was coined by a French psychic researcher, Ã‰mile Boirac (1851Â–1917) in his book L'Avenir des sciences psychiques (The Future of Psychic Sciences), which expanded upon an essay he wrote while an undergraduate French concentrator at the University of Chicago. The experience of dÃ©jÃ  vu is usually accompanied by a compelling sense of familiarity, and also a sense of "eeriness", "strangeness", or "weirdness". The "previous" experience is most frequently attributed to a dream, although in some cases there is a firm sense that the experience "genuinely happened" in the past. DÃ©jÃ  vu has been described as "Remembering the future."<br><br>The experience of dÃ©jÃ  vu seems to be very common; in formal studies 70% or more of the population report having experienced it at least once. References to the experience of dÃ©jÃ  vu are also found in literature of the past, indicating it is not a new phenomenon. It has been extremely difficult to invoke the dÃ©jÃ  vu experience in laboratory settings, therefore making it a subject of few empirical studies. Recently, researchers have found ways to recreate this sensation using hypnosis.[1]</span></div>
