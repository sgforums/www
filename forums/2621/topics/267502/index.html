            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">"Much of our modern difficulty, in religion and other things, arises merely from this: that we confuse the word "indefinable" with the word "vague." If some one speaks of a spiritual fact as "indefinable" we promptly picture something misty, a cloud with indeterminate edges. But this is an error even in commonplace logic. The thing that cannot be defined is the first thing; the primary fact. It is our arms and legs, our pots and pans, that are indefinable. The indefinable is the indisputable. The man next door is indefinable, because he is too actual to be defined. And there are some to whom spiritual things have the same fierce and practical proximity; some to whom God is too actual to be defined. "</span></div>

What if the rescuers found him earlier?<br><br>When news that Kim and his family were missing spread across the internet, there were many calls for prayer.

Some argue that perhaps he did not have enough faith. Other argue that it was god's plan. All the reasons take away from the dignity of James Kim.<br><br>James Kim was simply a man who did what he thought was the best way to ensure the safety of his family.

There are some atheists who are so strong in their lack of belief that  even if He were to appear to them, they will deny His appearance.</div></blockquote>As I mentioned earlier, God appearing in front of me is very poor evidence.<br><br>I know my senses can be fooled. I know that certain illnesses like cancer can spontaneously go into remission. Personal experience or personal 'revelation' is one of the worst possible reasons to believe something because we are so fallible.<br><br>That's why we have science. The scientific method helps us to overcome our limitations when it comes to observing the world around us. The scientific methods helps us to overcome our personal biases and come up with objective observations.<br><br>I am totally open to the idea of the existence of God. All I require is evidence. For an omnipotent god, any standard of evidence is laughably trivial. But let's make it clear, because extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence, it also makes the claims very easily falsifiable.<br><br>If god, or any other person wanted to prove to me that god exists, it's not too hard. All we need is a genuine miracle that cannot be explained with natural reasons. But "wait!" the religious cry out. "We keep giving you evidence but you reject it. Basically no evidence fits your requirements."<br><br>That's total nonsense. And one of the most irritating thing about religious people is that they keep using straw man arguments.<br><br>Some examples of genuine miracles that would convince me, and I believe most other rational people.<br><br>1. The documented healing of an amputee. If a person went to a doctor on monday without a leg, then went back on tuesday or wednesday with a leg, THAT would be quite convincing. Furthermore, when the doctors examine the new leg, there should be evidence consistent with a miraculous event. Professional magicians should be involved to make sure there is no trickery.<br><br>2. Evidence that prayer works. The religious keep coming up with silly studies and try to pass it off as evidence (which shows how dishonest they are). A double blind study, under proper experimental conditions is what is required.<br><br>3. Genuine supernatural revelation. We cannot accept vague statements that can be interpreted in 1001 ways. What is required is a specific statement of something that we cannot possibly know at this time. It also cannot be a prophecy that someone can make true. For example, the prophecy "There will be a blackout in Singapore on xxx date and it will last for 4 hours" doesn't work because someone can work to make it happen.<br><br>Imagine if the following statement was in the bible.<br><br>"I, the Lord thy God, reveal this to you. One day, machines will allow you to calculate the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter to levels of precision beyond what you can imagine. When you calculate up to the 17,387,594,880th digit of that ratio after the 3, you will find the following number sequence 0123456789. Thus will you know your God exists. I, the Lord thy God, hath spoken!"<br><br>Wow. Now THAT is evidence.</div>
