            <div class='col-md body'>This is something along the lines of Xenophilius Lovegood's "Prove that it is not" theory. Some people claim there is a God, and other people ask for evidence. The original group shows minimal concrete evidence, but asks the opposition to prove that God doesn't exist. Go figure. Anyway, check <strong><a href="http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/comic.php?d=20070613" rel="nofollow">this</a></strong> out. Its pretty amusing.<br><br>Anyway, I figure that as long as you don't kill, maim, burn, rape, rob, steal, lust etc etc beyond what is considered a reasonable amount (there is NO reasonable amount for the first 5 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ), and attempt to do good deeds out of compassion, there shouldn't be any problems with God if you do pass into the afterlife and find that he does exist.<br><br>There are a lot of religious people who only pay their religious teachings lip service. Given a choice between a "religious" mortal sinner who is and an atheist who has lived life well, who do you think would be more likely to gain admittance into whatever paradise lies beyond death?</div>

Maybe the person is Wolverine with mutant regenerative powers. :p<br><br>That aside, if someone happened to regrow a limb (something that we believe is impossible right now), we would still have to seek more plausible answers that automatically assuming a supernatural being was the cause. If for example, one person regrew a limb, you would have to ask why god would only restore one limb out of the many tens of thousands of believers that pray for the same healing.<br><br>If a limb just grew back over a period of a few years, I wouldn't find that so convincing.<br><br>If someone stood over a person and said, "By the Grace of God, be healed" and before our very eyes, the limb regrew in a matter of minutes or hours, and it's verified to a reasonable degree that it's not trickery.

I mean c'mon, people are already convinced that god exists with no evidence.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Or if someone discovered an old scroll in the Judean desert with all the inscriptions as suggested by Phaze predicting a mathematical formula, I'm sure you'll decry it as a fraud even if it was carbon dated - perhaps the fraudster used real old ink on real old parchment, etc etc etc.</strong></blockquote>And we should be skeptical. We know that tons of fraud occurs. And it may be that old civilization was just very advanced mathematically. In any case, in the example I used, I was talking about revealed knowledge. Note I didn't say the description should be about the formula for calculating Pi. It should be the digits of Pi far far beyond the ability of people to calculate in those days. Even if ancients discovered the formula for calculating the value of Pi, there's no reason for them to calculate it to 10 million decimal places for example. We only do it now because we have so much computational power available.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Bottomline is that with a closed mind, no evidence, however extraordinary, will ever convince you and like minded atheists that there is a God, contrary to what Phaze might like to believe in the other post.<br></strong></blockquote>I have problems with this argument. You use examples of imaginary evidence and claim that we won't accept it even if it existed. The fact is, it doesn't exist. Give us a real example, please.</div>
