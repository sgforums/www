            <div class='col-md body'>...going out when they are having their period and after they have given birth for 14 days?<br><br>Recently, someone pointed out a bible passage that condemns homosexuality.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leviticus 18:22 - Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.</span><br><br>He appealed for understand and said even if others did not accept the bible as a source of moral guidance, we should understand his perspective - which I presume is the perspective of someone who accepts the bible as god's instructions on morality.<br><br>Now Prof Thio has made it clear that she supports 377A because of her religion - which is weird because if we follow what the bible says, she probably couldn't be involved in politics.<br><br>In 1 Timothy 2:11-12, "Let a woman learn in peace, fully submitted; but I do not permit a woman to teach a man or exercise authority over him; rather, she is to remain at peace."<br><br>So I don't really understand why she is trying to exercise authority over male homosexuals. But it's alright, as a male, I will give Prof Thio the opportunity to submit to my teachings.<br><br>Anyway, I hope that Prof Thio will be consistent with her beliefs and propose a law banning women from leaving their homes when they are having their period.<br><br>First of all, I hope she appreciates my effort because as a woman, she's twice as unclean under the eyes of god than I am.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leviticus 12:2<br>2Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.</span><br><br>So a male child being born results in 7 days of uncleanliness. Dang. No wonder our birth rate is dropping.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leviticus 12:5<br>5But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.</span><br><br>Holy crap! If a female child is born, the mother is unclean for 14 days! TWICE the uncleanliness of male children. So scary. Lucky I don't have any sisters. And continuing in the "blood of her purifying for 66 days?!<br><br>Now in Leviticus 15:19-23 we are told that when a woman is having her period, not only is she unclean for 7 days, but everything she touches, sits on, or lies on becomes unclean as well.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leviticus 15:19-23<br>19And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.<br>20And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.<br>21And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.<br>22And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.<br>23And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.</span><br><br><strong>So if Prof Thio is consistent with her beliefs, she should propose and fight to pass a law that makes it illegal for women to go out for 7 days after their period to prevent them from spreading their uncleanliness. I mean, what if a woman having her period sits on a bus seat! It will be unclean! And if she holds and MRT handrail? Horrors! I might end up touching unclean things!<br><br>This law of course, is unenforceable. We can't have police doing upskirt checks to see if women are having their periods. But we just need the law so people will know that women are unclean during that period. But we won't prosecute women who go out.</strong><br><br>Once this law passes, we can fight for the law that makes it illegal for men to have sex with women who are having their periods. But that's another story.</div>
