              <p>Atheists
              are heavily concentrated in economically developed countries,
              particularly the social democracies of Europe. In underdeveloped
              countries, there are virtually no atheists. <a class="pt-basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Religion" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/religion">Atheism</a> is thus a peculiarly modern phenomenon. Why do modern conditions produce atheism?</p>
              <p>First,
              as to the distribution of atheism in the world, a clear pattern can be
              discerned. In sub-Saharan Africa there is almost no atheism (Zuckerman,
              2007). Belief in God declines in more developed countries and is
              concentrated in Europe in countries such as Sweden (64% nonbelievers),
              Denmark (48%), France (44%) and Germany (42%). In contrast, the
              incidence of atheism in most sub-Saharan countries is below 1%.</p>
              <p>The
              question of why economically developed countries turn to atheism has
              been batted around by anthropologists for about eighty years.
              Anthropologist James Fraser proposed that scientific prediction and
              control of nature supplants religion as a means of controlling
              uncertainty in our lives. This hunch is supported by data showing that
              the more educated countries have higher levels of non belief and there
              are strong correlations between atheism and <a class="pt-basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Intelligence" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/intelligence">intelligence</a> (see my <a title="earlier post" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/the-real-reason-atheists-have-higher-iqs">earlier post</a> on this).</p>
              </div>
              <p>Atheists are more likely to be college-educated people who live in
              cities and they are highly concentrated in the social democracies of
              Europe. Atheism thus blossoms amid affluence where most people feel
              economically secure. But why?</p>
              <p>It seems that people turn to
              religion as a salve for the difficulties and uncertainties of their
              lives. In social democracies, there is less <a class="pt-basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Fear" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/fear">fear</a> and uncertainty about the future because social welfare programs
              provide a safety net and better health care means that fewer people can
              expect to die young. People who are less vulnerable to the hostile
              forces of nature feel more in control of their lives and less in need
              of religion.</p>
              <p>In addition to being the opium of the people (as
              Karl Marx contemptuously phrased it), religion may also promote
              fertility, particularly by promoting <a class="pt-basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Marriage" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/marriage">marriage</a>,
              according to copious data reviewed by Sanderson (2008). Large families
              are preferred in agricultural countries as a source of free labor. In
              developed "atheist" countries, women have exceptionally small families
              and do not need religion helping them to raise large families.</p>
              <p>Even the psychological functions of religion face stiff <a class="pt-basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Sport and Competition" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/sport-and-competition">competition</a> today. In modern societies, when people experience psychological
              difficulties they turn to their doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist.
              They want a scientific fix and prefer the real psychotropic medicines
              dished out by physicians to the metaphorical opiates offered by
              religion.</p>
              <p>Moreover, sport psychologists find that sports spectatorship provides much the same kind of social, and <a class="pt-basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Spirituality" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/spirituality">spiritual</a>, benefits as people obtain from church membership. In a previous post, I made the case that <a title="sports is replacing religion" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/200911/is-sport-religion">sports is replacing religion</a>.
              Precisely the same argument can be made for other forms of
              entertainment with which spectators become deeply involved. Indeed,
              religion is striking back by trying to compete in popular media, such
              as televangelism and Christian rock and by hosting live secular
              entertainment in church.</p>
              <p>The reasons that churches lose ground
              in developed countries can be summarized in market terms. First, with
              better science, and with government safety nets, and smaller families,
              there is less fear and uncertainty in people's daily lives and hence
              less of a market for religion. At the same time many alternative
              products are being offered, such as psychotropic medicines and
              electronic entertainment that have fewer strings attached and that do
              not require slavish <a class="pt-basics-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Conformity" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/conformity">conformity</a> to unscientific beliefs.</p>

              <p> i think this should be in one of the religion forums. Atheism <strong>will never</strong> replace religion unless the ''god'' thing is proved. And if there is a slight chance in proving god existance, it will not be in your era or my era. Maybe few hundred years in the future. Furthermore, even if there is prove, it can be argued in a way that it is false. So no matter what the case, atheism will never replace religion.</p>

              <p>In major cities especially in coastal region urban areas, people lack religious fervour. However, in inner hinterland and rural areas (what they call MidWest and also Bible Belt region), there exist a stronger religious fervour.</p>

Urban residents tend to be busier, more individualistic, materialistic, and consumeristic, and most importantly, due to the highly transactional relationships they engage in daily, and lack of bond or glue with the surrounding environment, this condition results in the gradual weakening and finally dispersal of the center of community in the form of church, mosque, and temple.

              <p>I see people and "experts" who proposed ridiculous theories such as the one in the article quoted above, as misguided ideologues and radicals. They have an aversion towards religion because they focus too much on the mythicism aspect and irrationality aspect of it. Therefore, they have a deep-seated prejudice and academic bias and tendency towards condeming religion. They see it as something backward and antithetical to science, and they want to ditch it and confine it to history, and make another leap towards a progress in European enlightenment. However, this excessive motivation brings to a surface their ridiculousness when they go searching for justifying factors or reasons. This is quite regrettable because thruthfully they are being dishonest to themselves, and also not to mention, I'm tired at looking at factionalist / ideological arguments.</p>

              <p>But what if World War 3 happens, when overpopulation happens and the scarce of natural resources, and "hopefully" killed half of the world's population. (Hey, in animal / insect kingdom, that happens when the climate is not right and overpopulation happens). In this case, most likely 1/3 of the muslims might be killed due to heaviest war hit zone is in the Middle East, while 1/3 ~ 1/2 of the chrisitans might be killed due to the wide spread of christanity (Probably heaviest at Korea) etc...... Oh yeah, that is unlikely by 2020, but 2050 or 2100? I think it is possible.</p>
