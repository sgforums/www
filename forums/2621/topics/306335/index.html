              <p>The documents, which a California court released as part of a $16.65
                  million settlement of civil lawsuits in that state, paint more than
                  just another graphic story of a priest who sexually abused children:
                  They could be a harbinger of things to come for the church here as
                  victims of abuse press their cases in the courts and the Legislature.</p>
              <p>The archdiocese fought to keep sealed the documents, which focus on
                  Franklyn Becker, an archdiocesan priest who has been accused of
                  sexually abusing nine teenage boys in Wisconsin and one in California,
                  the first case dating to just two years after his ordination.</p>
              <p>The records indicate that as early as 1983, church officials sought
                  the advice of E. Michael McCann, then Milwaukee County district
                  attorney, about a priest's record of sex abuse, without identifying
                  Becker by name. The documents say McCann, a Catholic, advised the
                  church to take the priest out of ministry "for about five years, and if
                  no complaints come forth in that time perhaps he can be given another
                  chance."</p>
              <p>McCann said Thursday that at the time, he was not told of any criminal activity involving Becker.</p>
              <p>He said the conversation about Becker, referred to in a 1983
                  document, involved a phone call from an archdiocesan official who spoke
                  of concerns about a priest who was "spending way too much time with a
                  particular boy." McCann recalled being told that the boy's mother
                  supported her son's relationship with the priest. The boy had made no
                  allegations of inappropriate conduct, and there were no allegations of
                  criminal misconduct, McCann said.</p>
              <p>"Do you think, for God's sake, if they told me he committed a crime
                  that I would say keep him away (from the boy) for five years? . . . If
                  they told me he had committed a crime, I would have acted on it,"
                  McCann said.</p>
              <p>But a log entry made by Father Joseph Janicki, vicar for the
                  archdiocese at the time, indicates McCann told him the priest "has been
                  given adequate warnings and enough chances and that he should not be
                  assigned anywhere where he could come in contact with youngsters."</p>
              <p>Michael Finnegan, an attorney working for the victims, said McCann's
                  recollection that he had been told of only one boy, and that no one
                  chose to make a complaint, seemed inconsistent with the document.</p>
              <p>"That sounds to me like they told him about a lot more than one kid whose mother said it was no big deal," Finnegan said.</p>
              <p>McCann said information in the documents lacked context, asking, "Why don't you have the whole diocesan file?"</p>
              <p>Finnegan said that if the former district attorney was correct and
                  there was more detail in Becker's file on the conversation, then the
                  church did not produce the entire file as the California court ordered,
                  and that his firm would seek contempt charges against the archdiocese.</p>
              <h3>Incident at seminary</h3>
              <p>Becker, now 70 and a defrocked priest
                  living in Mayville, was described in documents dating to at least 1970
                  as abusive. Church records show that the archdiocese had received at
                  least nine credible reports of abuse involving children. In 1983, a
                  psychological report described Becker as a pedophile who was in denial.</p>
              <p>Signs of trouble go back to his days at St. Francis Seminary, where
                  shortly before his ordination in 1964, Becker entered the bed of a
                  sleeping classmate and was accused of attempting to initiate sex. The
                  matter was forwarded to Archbishop William Cousins, who considered
                  kicking Becker out of the seminary.</p>
              <p>Becker met briefly with the archbishop, who asked a few questions
                  and then concluded there was no reason Becker should not become a
                  priest. "I recall his parting words, which were 'Don't muddy the
                  waters,' " Becker said in a separate statement that the Journal
                  Sentinel obtained.</p>
              <p>Becker began abusing children, according to the complaints, at his first assignment at Holy Assumption Parish in West Allis.</p>
              <p>After several parish assignments, Becker asked to be assigned to
                  college campus ministry and was removed from one because of his
                  involvement with Dignity, a gay Catholic group.</p>
              <p>Becker received permission to take an assignment in San Diego in
                  1977, and he was involved with at least one teenage boy who later sued.
                  The Milwaukee Archdiocese was made aware that Becker was asked to leave
                  his San Diego assignment, but the record does not show details of sex
                  abuse.</p>
              <p>Back in Milwaukee in 1979, he had a number of short assignments at parishes before he went on a nine-month sick leave in 1983.</p>
              <p>A psychological report suggested that he be assigned to an all-girls
                  high school, a college for women, a nursing home or, last on the list,
                  a college. It was noted that although a college would present
                  temptations, at least those involved would be adults.</p>
              <p>Becker then was moved into hospital ministry - something in which he had earlier said he had no interest.</p>
              <p>Archbishop Rembert Weakland wrote to Becker in 1983, wishing him
                  success in his assignment as a chaplain at St. Joseph Hospital but also
                  warning him that if there were a recurrence of his "past personal
                  problems," Weakland would take steps to remove him from the priesthood.
                  Weakland's letter came just months after a therapist's warning that
                  Becker was a pedophile who did not have the "mechanism" to stop abusing
                  boys and that "parish ministry is out of the question."</p>
              <p>After a second hospital chaplaincy, Becker was given no formal
                  assignment from 1990 onward. He was placed on a "restricted" ministry
                  in 1993, but he was still allowed to help out in parishes until 2002.
                  Parishioners were never told of his misdeeds.</p>
              <p>In 1995, a three-person team of psychological and criminal experts interviewed Becker regarding nine allegations.</p>
              <p>"The accused (Becker) admitted not only some of the alleged
                  incidents but also factually described and admitted to multiple
                  others," according to an investigative report. "These admissions were
                  supported by various letters and entries in his personnel file."</p>
              <p>Reached at his Mayville home this week, Becker said he believed that
                  his rights - both the constitutional rights afforded every citizen and
                  church law protections for a priest - have been violated.</p>
              <p>He said he has been "through the mill" and added: "There is a gospel
                  of forgiveness and redemption, but that apparently doesn't apply to me.
                  I pray every day that the Lord will take me."</p>
              <h3>Financial repercussions</h3>
              <p>Becker's misconduct and that of the
                  late Siegfried Widera, another archdiocesan priest who served for a
                  time in California, cost the archdiocese millions in out-of-court
                  settlements in California, as well as legal fees and payments for
                  psychological treatment for both the victims and the abusive priests.</p>
              <p>The archdiocese has acknowledged that it knows of more than 40
                  priests who have been credibly accused of sexual misconduct, but it has
                  refused to release clergy personnel files - such as those released in
                  California.</p>
              <p>Last year, the Wisconsin Supreme Court opened a door to lawsuits by
                  victims of sex abuse by priests, saying the church could be sued for
                  fraud for not telling the public about abusive priests before placing
                  them in public ministry. At least seven people have already filed suit.</p>
              <p>Further, a bill is pending in the Legislature that would allow
                  lawsuits to be brought despite the age of the allegations - a step that
                  would remove what has been a principal roadblock for victims.</p>
              <p>The archdiocese said this week that it faced a $3 million deficit in
                  the current fiscal year and that further cases could push it toward
                  bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>Jeff Anderson, a lawyer from St. Paul, Minn., who represents victims
                  here, called the release of that news a "shameful public relations
                  tactic, timed to the release of these documents."</p>
