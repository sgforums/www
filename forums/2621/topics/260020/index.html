            <div class='col-md body'>Book title: The aims of of argument  by Timothy W. Crusius and Carolyn E. Channell<br><br>Quoted:<br><br>One way to understand argument as mature reasoning is to contrast it with debate. In debate, opponents take a predetermined, usually assigned side and attempt to defend it, in much the same way an army or a football team must hold its ground. The point is to win, to best one's opponent. In contrast, rather than starting with a position to defend , mature reasoners think it through and evaluate it rather than rush to its defense. To win is not to defeat an opponent but rather to gain insight to the topic at hand. The struggle is with the problem, question, or issue we confront. Rather than seeking the favorable decision of the judges, as in debate, we are after a sound opinion in which we can believe - an opinion consistent with the facts and that other people will respect and take seriously.<br><br>Of course, having arrive at an opinion that seems sound to us, we still must make out case- argue in the sense of providing good reasons and adequate evidence in support of them. But whereas debaters must hold their positions at all costs, mature reasoners may not. The very process of making a case will often show us that what we thought was sound really isn't. We try to defend our opinion until and find that we can't - or at least try, not very well. And so we rethink our position until we arrive at one for which we can make a good case. From beginning to end, therefore, mature reasoning is a process of discovery.<br><br>Author information:<br>Quoted:<br>Timothy W. Crusius is profesor of English at Southern Methodist University, where he teaches beginning and advanced composition. He's the author of books on discourse theory, philosophical hermeneutics, and Kenneth Burker.<br><br>PS: took fifteen minutes to type it out from the book i have.<br><br></div>
