              <p>Whenever i come across people talking and making sense of the religious teachings, i feel abit sorry for them. ITs like seeing them running in circles, and teaching their followers to run in circles too because as a rationalists, i wonder how on earth are you going to live this real human life with that kind of false knowledge, and get happiness out of this kind of basic belief.</p>
              <p>But then, of course, it not of my business because as long as i am clear about what human life and reality is, i am happy for myself. Just feel that the world is really running at, including singapore, such low efficiency of raising world standards if we have this kind of irrational logic system.</p>
              <p>As a rationalists, i have a second question? DO we have a right to oppose such phenomenon on the basis that it is false knowledge? Or is it religion is still have its golden armor of 'respect other religion' ? SO in the end, the society and govt is telling us that we should 'mind our own business?'</p>
              <p>However, if the message is 'mind our own business', then i will tell the society and govt, whichever govt in the world, that i will really mind my own business in other areas of my life and be a selfish guy.</p>
              <p>I think we need a engine overhaul in our society. A paradigm shift. Otherwise, we are stuck in the mud.</p>

              <p>oh ya, looking at today paper on the rise of mega churches.. i can feel that christianity is rising in singapore it seems. Their marketing skills are really very powerful. My appeal again.</p>
              <p>Non theists, which atheist is, should also have buidlings like religions. Its unfair not to have for us. I proposed whoever brave minister to fight for building to be built for non-theists, as education or as hobbists, or as a so called 'religion' Otherwise, the world will go into a tailspin.</p>
              <p>WHoever minister who create this thing, will win my next election vote. =p</p>

              <p>personally....i think parental love and sacrifices are the most direct love that needs most sympathy. between religious love and parental love, i would rather choose parents as my greatest religion...and my greatest sympathies...</p>
              <p>i found many exalt the very best to cults and so called religions...but nonetheless our own parental love remains invisible and so painfully taken for granted..some even blamed, mocked and criticized them for bringing them into the world to suffer....</p>
              <p>Parents deserve to be exalted as the greatest figures of love for all times</p>

              Religionists are indeed protected by the law in S'pore. No level playing field for atheists. Have u heard of religious bigots being hauled up by the authorities 4 labeling atheists as angels of Satan? As such, atheists've to thread this minefield with extra caution.
              
              Yes, atheists should've a say in the inter faith committee or whatever u call that. Atheists've an interest in religion and it's a crime to keep a large chunk of the population out of the dialogue.
              
              As for a building 4 atheists, I think it's a little far fetched 4 now. It's putting the horse before the cart. Get the recognition first. The freedom of expression first.
              
              That having said, atheists shouldn't turn militant and start disparaging or denigrating religions. Armed yourself with knowledge with the scriptures and point to them the illogical and discrepancies. You may finally be branded as Satan and your rejoinder should be "So u win liao lor....... Beautiful back door exit."
