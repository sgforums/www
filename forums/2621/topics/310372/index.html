              <p>Commentary by Ann Woolner</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>March 7 (Bloomberg) -- As a heterosexual engaged to be
              married, I listened closely this week as California lawyers
              argued over whether same-sex couples should be allowed to wed.</p>
              <p>What happens to me if a court as powerful as the California
              Supreme Court says that would be just fine?</p>
              <p>``It would undermine opposite-sex marriage,'' <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Mathew%0AStaver&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Mathew
              Staver</a>, a lawyer for <a href="http://www.savecalifornia.com/">Campaign</a> for California Families, told the
              justices.</p>
              <p>Well, that's just great. I'm old enough to be a mother of a
              bride, and just as I'm about to get a marriage license for the
              first -- and only -- time in my life, its status is poised to
              plunge.</p>
              <p>So, should I call off the engagement?</p>
              <p>I mean, how special can marriage licenses be if courts let
              homosexuals have them?</p>
              <p>Famous heteros have already battered the institution. <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Zsa%0AZsa+Gabor&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Zsa
              Zsa Gabor</a> pledged lifelong partnership nine times, and <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Britney%0ASpears&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Britney
              Spears</a> did so for a marriage annulled two days later.</p>
              <p>Some folks among the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/59/6/givemeyourti.html">huddled masses</a> longing to breathe free
              snag phony marriages to get U.S. <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/types/types_1315.html">citizenship</a>. In Las Vegas, you
              can book a Graveyard Wedding featuring black roses, haunting
              music and ``gruesome video.''</p>
              <p>One chapel alone offers nine kinds of Elvis-themed
              <a href="http://www.vivalasvegasweddings.com/elvis_wedding_packages.htm">weddings</a>.</p>
              <p>Remind me again, please, why gay people get blamed for
              trashing traditional marriage.</p>
              <p>I'm wondering how <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Elizabeth+Taylor&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Elizabeth Taylor</a>'s eight marriages each
              won a government stamp of approval denied the 55-year
              <a href="http://www.jebmedia.com/">partnership</a> between the two women, both in their 80s, who are
              lead plaintiffs in the California case.</p>
              <p>Longer Commitment</p>
              <p>Their commitment has already lasted longer than most
              marriages. Given my age and that of my groom's, surely death
              will do us part, too, long before 55 years pass.</p>
              <p>So how did government get involved in regulating this most-
              intimate aspect of American life? It's all about protecting
              babies, according to lawyers for religious conservatives
              defending the state's same-sex marriage ban.</p>
              <p>``This court as early as 1850 was talking about the primary
              purpose of marriage being procreation and the raising of the
              children of the marriage,'' said Glen Lavy, a lawyer for the
              Alliance Defense Fund.</p>
              <p>Every adult knows it takes a man and a woman, or parts
              thereof, to make a baby. It also takes two bodies physically
              able to accomplish the job.</p>
              <p>Having Children</p>
              <p>``Should we have marriage laws that say you can't marry
              unless you are prepared to have children or are capable of
              having children,'' Justice <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Carol+Corrigan&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Carol Corrigan</a> of the California
              Supreme Court asked.</p>
              <p>(Hello, pastry chef? Hold that wedding cake.)</p>
              <p>But that can't be right. If child-rearing were the most-
              important aspect of marriage, then my sure-to-be childless
              relationship wouldn't qualify, heterosexuality notwithstanding.
              Plaintiff Karen Shain's lesbian union would qualify as marriage,
              on the other hand, because she has raised a child with her
              partner.</p>
              <p>The law doesn't read that way. If the state were indeed
              concerned about children, it would give the children of gay
              couples the stability conveyed by a stamp of legitimacy on their
              parents' unions.</p>
              <p>``The name `marriage' matters,'' argued <a href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Therese+Stewart&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1">Therese Stewart</a>, a
              lawyer for the city of San Francisco, which supports same-sex
              unions. ``It communicates something everyone can understand. It
              communicates loyalty and intimacy and commitment.''</p>
              <p>Domestic Partnership</p>
              <p>She didn't buy the state's argument that California's
              domestic partnership law puts gay couples on equal footing with
              straight, married couples.</p>
              <p>Perhaps what is needed is an upgrade in status for domestic
              partnership so that it reaches equality with the declining
              prestige of marriage.</p>
              <p>Maybe I can help by calling off the marriage and becoming
              domestically partnered instead, thus elevating the status of
              those poor souls who fell in love with someone of their own sex.</p>
              <p>If more heterosexuals did that, wouldn't the standing of
              all domestic partners rise?</p>
              <p>(Hello, honey. About that marriage license?)</p>
              <p>Or here's another idea. Let religions carry the burden of
              deciding who can marry whom. Some rabbis won't marry Jew to
              Christian. Catholic and Episcopalian priests, in the main, say
              no to the previously married, or at least make it very difficult
              to try again.</p>
              <p>Proper Role</p>
              <p>This is a proper role for religion, which you can take or
              leave. But the state has no business setting those boundaries.
              This is why even the most-conservative states in the buckle of
              the Bible belt grant marriage to interfaith couples, even to
              divorced men and women.</p>
              <p>In the same way, the state has no business denying marriage
              to same-sex couples, no matter how committed, while granting it
              to hetero couples, even if they are taking a boozy break from
              the Reno slot machines.</p>
              <p>Let religion marry people in whatever manner honors the
              faith. Let atheists and anyone else write their own vows, design
              their own ceremonies and deny marriage to whomever they wish.</p>
              <p>The state's only role is granting legal status to couples,
              making sure that both parties are of age and otherwise
              unmarried. Call it a civil union or a domestic partnership. But
              grant it to interfaith couples, the previously married, to same-
              sex couples, just as it is granted to first-timers of the
              opposite sex and same religion. Or no religion.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, I'll marry a man that some religions say I
              shouldn't, fully licensed by the state.</p>
              <p>When I do, I will wish that those now barred from marrying
              the partners they love will be allowed one day to honor
              matrimony by joining it.</p>
