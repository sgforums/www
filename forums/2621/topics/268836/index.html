            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jews help Muslims fight county council</strong><br>By Tim Townsend<br>ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH<br>Monday, Jul. 16 2007<br><br>When Rick Isserman found out last month that St. Louis County wouldn't allow a<br>group of Muslims to build a new mosque in south St. Louis County, the story<br>sounded too familiar.<br><br>Forty-eight years earlier, Isserman's grandfather, Rabbi Ferdinand Isserman,<br>fought to move his congregation, Temple Israel, from the city to the county,<br>where the Jewish population had been relocating for some years. The city of<br>Creve Coeur cited zoning problems and tried to block the move, but the rabbi<br>and his flock took the case to the Missouri Supreme Court and prevailed.<br><br>The case, Congregation Temple Israel v. City of Creve Coeur, produced what is<br>considered a landmark religious-freedom decision that says Missouri<br>municipalities can invoke only health or safety issues in denying a religious<br>group the zoning required to build houses of worship.<br><br>In the spring, the St. Louis County Council refused the Islamic Community<br>Center's request to rezone a 4.7-acre parcel it bought a year before for $1.25<br>million. The Muslims Â— mostly Bosnian immigrants Â— planned to build a second<br>mosque and community center in addition to the current mosque and center off<br>South Kingshighway in St. Louis.<br><br>When Khalid Shah, a member of the mosque and a friend of Isserman's, told him<br>about the council's decision, the 53-year-old Department of Agriculture<br>employee began making the connection to his family's legal legacy.<br><br>"I'm fighting the same battle as my grandfather 50 years ago," Isserman said.<br>"It's a different community and a different place, but it's the same issue."<br><br>A county attorney brushed off notions that the dispute is rooted in dramatic<br>constitutional questions of religious freedom. Robert Grant said the council<br>took up a more mundane question of municipal pragmatism in choosing to reject<br>the county planning commission's unanimous support.<br><br>"They didn't think it was appropriate zoning," he said.<br><br>But for many in the Bosnian community Â— at 50,000 strong and thought to be the<br>country's largest Â— the council's 4-3 vote represents an effort to hinder the<br>traditional American immigrant march toward assimilation. Imam Muhamed Hasic,<br>the spiritual leader and president of the Islamic Community Center, also called<br>Madina Masjid, said about half of St. Louis's Bosnian population has moved from<br>the city to south St. Louis County.<br><br>"That's where the Bosnians are moving," Isserman said. "It's only natural to<br>make a religious institution accessible to its congregants."<br><br>BIAS OR NOT?<br><br>After prayers at Madina Masjid, Omer Durakoiec, 44, said the council's vote was<br>unfair to Muslims.<br><br>"Freedom of religion, if it's for a church or for a mosque, is the same thing,"<br>he said.<br><br>But the charge of discrimination is contentious, even among Bosnians.<br><br>"In my opinion this was not religious discrimination," said Sukrija Dzidzovic,<br>publisher and editor of Sabah, a Bosnian-American weekly newspaper based in St.<br>Louis. "This was a mistake on Imam Hasic's part. He should not have bought land<br>that was zoned for commercial use, hoping that he could change the zoning."<br><br>An existing south St. Louis County mosque, the Bosnian Islamic Center of St.<br>Louis, bought a building on Lemay Ferry Road just a couple of miles from the<br>site in question. Imam Enver Kunic, the spiritual leader of the Bosnian Islamic<br>Center of St. Louis, said that he has no problems with the County Council and<br>that services at the building-turned-mosque will begin in the fall.<br><br>County Councilman John Campisi, who represents the area where the mosque and<br>community center would be built, opposes the rezoning. He said the council's<br>vote did not reflect religious discrimination.<br><br>"There's one just like it in Lemay, so it's not like the county is against<br>these going in," he said. "But there were so many people calling in who were<br>against it."<br><br>Campisi said his office received about 60 phone calls from constituents<br>complaining of potential traffic issues.<br><br>"This was going to be a day-care center, a youth center Â— it was going to be<br>around the clock," he said.<br><br>high legal bar<br><br>The case exemplifies the frustrations of many new immigrants, especially<br>Muslims, who come to the United States with high expectations for religious<br>freedom and then run into the realities of local politics and what many<br>perceive as the prejudices of their new neighbors.<br><br>Charles Haynes, a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center, said local<br>governments that take on religious groups in court are often surprised by how<br>much protection those groups are afforded.<br><br>"A lot of government officials don't believe it's as tough as it is, then they<br>go to court and find out," he said. "It doesn't sound like the county has much<br>of a chance prevailing here."<br><br>A 2000 federal law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act,<br>has given religious groups more legal power, Haynes said.<br><br>"It forces governments to work harder before they say no," he said. "Many local<br>governments don't realize there's a higher bar when a religious group is<br>involved."<br><br>After a failed attempt at mediation in May, the Islamic Community Center sued<br>the council. Because of pending litigation, Campisi said he would not answer<br>questions about his reasons for rejecting the rezoning request.<br><br>When Campisi voted against the rezoning on April 24, he persuaded his two<br>Republican colleagues on the council to join him. Council Chairman Mark O'Mara,<br>a Democrat who voted with the three Republicans, provided the swing vote to<br>defeat the rezoning. O'Mara did not return several phone calls.<br><br>Gregory Quinn, another councilman who voted against the rezoning, also cited<br>the litigation and declined to comment. Colleen Wasinger, the third Republican<br>on the council, did not return phone calls seeking comment.<br><br>The three Democrats on the council said there was little discussion about the<br>issue before the vote and said they were surprised by the final outcome. The<br>minutes of the meeting indicate there was no public debate before the vote.<br><br>Temple Israel's rabbi, Mark Shook, who has worked with Hasic to try and get the<br>council to reverse its decision, said Campisi might be wary of rezoning a piece<br>of property that had guaranteed tax income.<br><br>"When someone takes a piece of commercial property out of the tax rolls, he is<br>striking at the county's bottom line," he said. "But the underlying philosophy<br>in giving tax breaks to religious institutions is that they better the<br>community. That's the price you pay."<br><br>For the Bosnian Muslim community, the issue began in February with a victory.<br>That's when the county's planning commission voted 8-0 to approve rezoning of<br>the land that would be used for the 25,000-square-foot mosque and community<br>center. The parcel is directly across from Lemay Plaza, a 160,000-square-foot<br>strip mall anchored by a 70,000-square-foot Dierbergs grocery. To the west, the<br>land abuts a residential neighborhood of single-family homes.<br><br>The Muslims' property had been approved for a 60,000-square-foot motorcycle<br>dealership and a 5,000-square-foot fast-food restaurant. The owners of the<br>dealership sold the land to the Muslim group last year.<br><br>In its report, the county's planning commission said rezoning the property from<br>commercial to residential to accommodate the mosque made sense for the area.<br><br>"The proposed community center will also be less intense, and therefore more<br>compatible with the adjacent single-family residences, than the uses currently<br>authorized on this site," the report says.<br><br>Three weeks earlier, a public hearing drew seven neighbors; only one objected<br>to the plans.<br><br>"You can understand when there are objections to a plot of land going from<br>residential to commercial," Shook said. "But when someone wants to upgrade the<br>zoning from commercial to residential and the council objects to that, people<br>start wrinkling their noses."<br><br>Grant said the vote against the mosque simply reflects a disagreement.<br><br>"The planning commission made (its) recommendation, and the County Council<br>didn't follow it," he said.<br><br>Gail Choate, the county manager for planning, said it's rare for the council to<br>disregard the recommendations of the planning commission. The commission has<br>issued an average of about 100 zoning petitions a year since 2005, and the<br>council followed all but a couple of recommendations each year.<br><br>JOINT EFFORT<br><br>Shah and Isserman spoke in June about the case at a monthly study group they<br>started, in which about a dozen area Muslims and a dozen members of Temple<br>Israel read and discuss the Quran and the Torah. Isserman enlisted Shook's<br>help, as well as congregation president David Weinstein's, and the three men<br>began mobilizing support for the Bosnian Islamic Community Center.<br><br>Hasic said he was moved when he heard that Temple Israel was going to bat for<br>the mosque.<br><br>"They kept asking what they could do to help," he said. "They wrote letters,<br>they met with the council, they said we needed to stick together."<br><br>Shook, a former chairman of the Interfaith Partnership, sent a letter to County<br>Council members asking them to reconsider the mosque's rezoning request and<br>citing the Missouri Supreme Court ruling that bears his congregation's name.<br><br>In May 1954, Temple Israel bought 24 acres in Creve Coeur, but two months<br>later, the city amended its zoning to make it impossible for the synagogue to<br>secure the necessary permits to build. Temple Israel, led by Rabbi Ferdinand<br>Isserman, sued the city, and five years later the state Supreme Court said<br>Creve Coeur's zoning amendment was unconstitutional.<br><br>Haynes, the scholar at the First Amendment Center, said the mosque's fight is<br>similar to many around the country.<br><br>"It's usually masked as something else Â— a zoning issue or parking," he said.<br>"No one wants to come out and say they don't want people of a particular faith<br>in their neighborhood."<br><br>But on Banister Road, immediately adjacent to the Bosnians' land, only one of a<br>dozen homeowners expressed any concern at the prospect of Muslim neighbors.<br><br>"It wouldn't bother me," said Mamie King, who had a statue of the Virgin Mary<br>in her front yard.<br><br>Grace Green, a Pentecostal who described herself as "a holy roller," said she<br>would like to know more about the group, "but you have to love your neighbors."</div>
