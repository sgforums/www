Asha Devi, 63, carried the pal kudam and thee chatti to the temple.<br><br>Two devotees balancing milk pots as they enter the temple at Pandamaran last Saturday.<br>This was followed by a chariot procession in the evening with Pandamaran assemblyman Datuk Dr Teh Kim Poo as the eventÂ’s special guest.<br><br>Asha Devi said preparations for the celebrations began several months ago, as arrangements had to be made to accommodate the devotees.<br><br>Â“Devotees also prepare themselves by fasting for at least three months before carrying the pal kudam and thee chatti,Â” said Asha Devi, who runs a food outlet in Kuala Lumpur.<br><br>According to her, a flag bearing the GoddessÂ’ emblem was raised on the first day followed by an ubayam (special prayers) on the second day.<br><br>Â“The fourth day was also observed with prayers for Mataji. On the final day, which is today, we have special prayers for a male deity known as Veera Vetai Karar Muniandy followed by anathanam (feeding of the masses),Â” she added.<br><br>Meanwhile, S. Komathi, 50, who cooked for the devotees, said this yearÂ’s event was special as they were praying hard to obtain a piece of land from the state government to build a proper temple.<br><br>Â“The temple is currently situated in the home of one of our membersÂ’ grandmothers. Due to space constraints we cannot do any renovation,Â” said Komathi who owns a flower shop in Klang.<br><br>Komathi said the community badly needed a bigger temple to accommodate the crowd.<br><br>Â“In the past, it was only our community which prayed here but now others are also coming to the temple.Â”<br><br>For K. Janani, 27, who came all the way from Singapore to carry the pal kudam, the event was both fun and colourful.<br><br>Â“I like the festive atmosphere. I have been coming here for the past two years to offer prayers as our community does not have a dedicated temple in Singapore,Â” Janani added.</div>
