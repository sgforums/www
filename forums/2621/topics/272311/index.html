For example, you remember her physically taking care of you when you were sick, etc. In this case, we won't need to call it faith, and can replace it with the word trust. But faith in God is based on what exactly?<br><br><blockquote><strong>The more correct term would be "misplaced trust".

And let's say, one is able to perceive through some experience a feeling of God 'talking' to you. How sure can one be that God is speaking? There has been an experiment conducted where if a certain portion of the brain is excited, will induce a feeling of being in the presence of God, or oneness with the universe, etc. Results vary according to religiosity.<br><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2003/godonbrain.shtml" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">God on the Brain</span></a><br><br>I applaud your decision to not let your life be guided by so-called leaders.

I have faith in my reasoning that God in most likelihood doesn't exist. Why? Mainly because there is not a shred of evidence in favor of God's existence. Reason can be proved by laying out the facts and evidence. And the good thing is that reason can be subjected to change should more convincing evidence appear. No need to stick to old ideas that are cumbersome and no longer accurate.<br><br></div>

It is easy to overlook the things faith can bring when one does not have a good experience of it. One possible reason why so many people dislike religion is due to the sensationalist stands the media and certain religious people take.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>the proof of reason is the things that is able to produce.<br>law of gravity, law of electromagnetism<br>look at those cute invention of touch light where you can shake the torch light or press the button to convert the energy into light.<br><br>Man did not get into the moon by hoping only.

I was merely suggesting that there has to be faith in usage of reasoning, since reasoning itself, in all essence, is unable to be proved. To say one does not have faith in intangible constructs would be equivalent to saying one does not believe in anything at all.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Another thing is the sematics of the word faith.

Not all religious people are shallow and pious. I think daily about philosophy and religion; in fact, I'm reading a book right now entitled "The Christian Faith and the Problem of Evil". It is interesting to see how humans try to make sense of all that is around them. There is no need to say religious people are uneducated, or that faith is wrong. We just see things differently after all. In fact, one of the only areas of study in this world, where there is only right and wrong is Mathematics.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>its does not seem appealing to think about whether there is god or not and why atheist say what they say.</strong></blockquote>Perhaps. But you have to realize that there are plenty of self-proclaimed "atheists" who try to attack religion at the slightest whim, for dubious reasons. Religious people who react strongly do so, because they see what they have expected to see from what they term 'non-believers'. Is there no room for moderation even among the religion-less?</div>

I mean trying to engage in meaningful discussions with these people about their obviously wrong beliefs is more tiring than just ridiculing them. I mean you can throw all 1000GB of the world's knowledge at them and they'll still tell you, "Doesn't matter, I still believe every single bit of it". At least by making fun of (or attacking, if you like) them I still get to have a laugh, instead of say, ripping my hair out.<br><br>I wouldn't expect the holy book writers to know, let alone appreciate Fred and Wilma but creationists do mention about man and dinosaurs existing at the same time. <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/dinosaurs.asp" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dinosaurs Q&amp;A</span></a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SturmDerSchatten:</div><div class="quote_body">Maybe "moderation" isn't the right word to use. "Tact" would fit better. I think it's much harder to get the religious to do that first, because there are many who do not take the responsibility of faith upon themselves and to think deep into their faith. As such, they usually react very strongly when anyone, religious or not, challenges the dogma they ingest so often. Sorry, but methinks atheists are going to have to take the first step on this one.

I save that only for nice believers like you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
