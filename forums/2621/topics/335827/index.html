              <p>From my knowledge, its seems that our govt is afraid to take stand on the issue of religion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, if I am singapore leader, or world leader, I would straight away promote atheism simply because it is plain obvious truth. The govt always tell us the importance of honesty, fairness, justice, hardworking and also tell us to be more and more intelligent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, when it comes to religion, it becomes a taboo subject, better to be swept under the carpet. We are being told to learn and appreciate other religions and create interfaith groups that focus on peace towards society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This method, to me, is inefficient. I shall say these, religion, are false, and as human being, i really cannot stand false ideals and concept. They just lead to more trouble to our world. I cannot believe that our world today is still stuck in the rut and that no people of power, which are the state leaders from any countries, are not really telling the truth to its people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you know which state in the world, where the govt takes an strong stance towards the issue of religion? LIke they will say,</p>
              <p>" we, the country of so-and-so, do not believe in religion, and we seriously urge our fellow people to do likewise too, although, you all have a final say in what you want to believe, because we dun wanna to take away your freedom of choice."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Nevertheless, atheism is damn important, so we hope you people are all atheists, really"</p>

              <p>Our govt has always tell people to upgrade our skills in today's world? Why are they telling us to upgrade our logic skills, and thus challenging our beliefs, in the hope of creating the right beliefs in our lives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why is religion so sensitive a subject? Is true that no politician or leader would really take a stand on it? Does atheism belong only to scientists, or professionals , who are usually the people who promote atheism as much as they can, like Richard Darkwin?</p>

              <p>SO you mean, if your kid tell you that its alright to jump off the building because it is his belief that he will reach the ground safely, then you will say, ok because you should not force your own belief onto him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ignorance lead to bad things. Wrong knowledge leads to bad consequences. Can a society works if everyone can do what they want because its their personal belief. WHy the govt and society are creating so many rules for people to adhere to then? Because they believe in right and wrong things, and they will go all out to enforce the rules.</p>

              <p>it remains, a personal choice. everyone knows that athiesm is an option of belief available among many options. it's up to the individual to choose for himself what to believe?</p>
              <p>of course, i suppose athiests are free to promote whatever they believe in, just as other religious groups</p>

              <p>actually, the govt is worrying too much. Our govt usually gets what they want and still win the election anyway. They are just paranoidal about it. They cost of not telling its citizens the truth about life is too costly liao.</p>

              <p>A god which creates the world then does not interfere will mean that we do not need to bother about him because all we need is to study the science he created and out it into good use. Since he does not interfere, we cannot ask him for free knowledge then.</p>

              <p>Anyway, saying that god create the world is a baseless guess. Its the same as me saying that my hamsters are then really the creator of the universe and they return onto earth recently to become my pet when someone gave them to me. Therefore, god is now my pet.</p>

              <p>Days of rioting among rival Christians and Muslims on the devastated Indonesian island of Ambon has claimed at least 50 lives. Among those killed is a soldier who was stabbed to death by rioters after they refused to hand over weapons. One of the latest batches of victims was five Muslim men who had been dragged from a truck at a Christian roadblock, hacked to death and their bodies set alight, with an outnumbered military patrol standing helplessly by. The unofficial death toll in the religious violence was put at more than 100.</p>

              <p>If we are going to have a proper discussion about topics as sensitive as this, explain your thoughts or ideas and, if possible, throw in some quotations or links to sources to support your theories. I am sure everyone will appreciate that as much as I would. :)</p>

              In my opinion, discussion about Atheism or any topic for that matter should not spark any kind of violence. It is only because of insensitive, immature participants that cause misunderstandings and tension. Honestly, it is not that big a deal. It is just blown so far out of proportion.
