            <div class='col-md body'><p>If the govt were to promote atheism and denounce religion, it would put Singapore in alot of danger as all religions are treated as "sacred" worldwide and given excessive respect. &gt;Most&lt; first-world countries shun the subject of religion because people get touchy or agitated when their faith is challenged.<br><br>Sadly, more than half of the world's population conform to one of the three Abrahamic religions, and imagine if they were to revolt against a certain government, it would most surely be crushed, it's members assasinated or killed brutally by outright bombings.<br><br>Religion serves a purpose, to give hope and motivate people. Even if we intellectuals understand the implausibility of most religions, many don't. These people will live happily, in their fantasy world, equipped with false knowledge yet they contribute to the country by working and paying taxes. When they get retrenched, they are still delusively joyful, thinking its part of someone's plan to improve themselves, and strive to find another job asap.<br><br>I understand your concern, and I personally think religion creates a breeding ground for fanatical and extremist belief. Religions people are much more likely to be cheated or brainwashed by probably a high-ranking person of their religion, if he was an extremist himself.<br><br>It's nowhere within the government's powers to stop such events, and even if they tried, the controversy will lead to their certain demise. Thus, it is up to us, civilians to spread knowledge and promote rationale thinking. Our friend, january sets a fine example for the rest of the Singapore population.<br><br>PS: I don't think we should spread Atheism, because Atheism denies the existance of god irregardless of w/e religion. We should not assert what we do not know. Nobody knows the truth behind existance, nobody knows why we exist. (only people delude themselves with a false answer).</p></div>

              Nope. I am an atheist, indeed, but I respect the beliefs of others to keep my own to myself. I do not care to go around spreading "word" or trying to "convert" people, unlike Christians. I find that rude and insensitive, not to mention downright annoying. I live my own life the way I chose and so should everyone else. Nobody should be forced into anything. :)

              <p><br>There are all kinds of religious movements in Singapore and they represent themselves in many social or national events, like Chingay and NDP. If I remember correctly in 2003, there was a atheist group that tried to enter but was asked to join with the PA group and the group name will only be PA.</p>

              <p><br>i kinda find it unacceptable to allow people to choose what they want to believe, especially when i find that their beliefs are unjustified and wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its not like people like purple and i tell them that they should not like purple you know. Conversion is a common thing in life. christian to muslim, atheist to muslim, buddhism to christian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We cannot say that we should not convert people. My advice and argument is... go ahead and convert other people, provided your reasoning is right and you do it peacefully.</p>

              <p><br>actually.. atheist who try to educate and spread our arguments do it for the following reasons..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-human civilisations would be better if we have more atheists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, some atheists are those that are contended about status quo and think it is not good to change others..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is where the difference lies. Those who think that the world is not so good now because too many people are religious so these atheists will then try to talk about the issue of religion VS those who dun think in such terms and prefer to let religious people have their freedom.</p>

These people will live happily, in their fantasy world, equipped with false knowledge yet they contribute to the country by working and paying taxes. When they get retrenched, they are still delusively joyful, thinking its part of someone's plan to improve themselves, and strive to find another job asap.<br><br>I understand your concern, and I personally think religion creates a breeding ground for fanatical and extremist belief. Religions people are much more likely to be cheated or brainwashed by probably a high-ranking person of their religion, if he was an extremist himself.<br><br>It's nowhere within the government's powers to stop such events, and even if they tried, the controversy will lead to their certain demise. Thus, it is up to us, civilians to spread knowledge and promote rationale thinking. Our friend, january sets a fine example for the rest of the Singapore population.<br><br>PS: I don't think we should spread Atheism, because Atheism denies the existance of god irregardless of w/e religion. We should not assert what we do not know. Nobody knows the truth behind existance, nobody knows why we exist. (only people delude themselves with a false answer).</p>

              <p><br>thanks for your post, seems good...</p>
              <p>i agree with the part that promoting atheism may create backlash from international countries which may affect our economy and political relationships...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>secondly, it not only religion that create terrorists that i see as the problem.. terrorism may not be solely caused by existence of religion and the buidling. its just that false beliefs create many problems in life to well being of human beings... it impedes progress of humanity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>perhaps atheism should be spread through civil groups... until many people are atheists are...finally.. then will govt step out of its closeted atheists stance.</p>

              <p>telling people the truth is a form of respect, is not it?</p>
              <p>when people says why SOME atheists keep bugging at them, is not perseverance at telling people that they are holding onto things that has no truth a form of love?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from this point, atheists who talks about atheism is actually respectful and lovely humans.</p>

              <p>No government should take sides. However, being secular is a very important characteristic for a country to move forward.</p>
              <p>Just compare the technological and society advances between secular countries and religious countries.</p>
              <p>Keep religion out of politics, let people have the freedom of religion and freedom from religion.</p>
