              <p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">THE PSYCHOPATH - The Mask of Sanity</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Special Research Project of the Quantum Future School </span></p>
              <hr>
              <div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Imagine - if you can - not having a conscience, none at all, no feelings of guilt or remorse no matter what you do, no limiting sense of concern for the well-being of strangers, friends, or even family members. Imagine no struggles with shame, not a single one in your whole life, no matter what kind of selfish, lazy, harmful, or immoral action you had taken. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">And pretend that the concept of responsibility is unknown to you, except as a burden others seem to accept without question, like gullible fools. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now add to this strange fantasy the ability to conceal from other people that your psychological makeup is radically different from theirs. Since everyone simply assumes that conscience is universal among human beings, hiding the fact that you are conscience-free is nearly effortless. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You are not held back from any of your desires by guilt or shame, and you are never confronted by others for your cold-bloodedness. The ice water in your veins is so bizarre, so completely outside of their personal experience, that they seldom even guess at your condition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In other words, you are completely free of internal restraints, and your unhampered liberty to do just as you please, with no pangs of conscience, is conveniently invisible to the world. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You can do anything at all, and still your strange advantage over the majority of people, who are kept in line by their consciences will most likely remain undiscovered.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">How will you live your life? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What will you do with your huge and secret advantage, and with the corresponding handicap of other people (conscience)? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The answer will depend largely on just what your desires happen to be, because people are not all the same. Even the profoundly unscrupulous are not all the same. Some people - whether they have a conscience or not - favor the ease of inertia, while others are filled with dreams and wild ambitions. Some human beings are brilliant and talented, some are dull-witted, and most, conscience or not, are somewhere in between. There are violent people and nonviolent ones, individuals who are motivated by blood lust and those who have no such appetites. [...]</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Provided you are not forcibly stopped, you can do anything at all. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you are born at the right time, with some access to family fortune, and you have a special talent for whipping up other people's hatred and sense of deprivation, you can arrange to kill large numbers of unsuspecting people. With enough money, you can accomplish this from far away, and you can sit back safely and watch in satisfaction. [...]</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Crazy and frightening - and real, in about 4 percent of the population....</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The prevalence rate for anorexic eating disorders is estimated a 3.43 percent, deemed to be nearly epidemic, and yet this figure is a fraction lower than the rate for antisocial personality. The high-profile disorders classed as schizophrenia occur in only about 1 percent of [the population] - a mere quarter of the rate of antisocial personality - and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the rate of colon cancer in the United States, considered "alarmingly high," is about 40 per 100,000 - one hundred times lower than the rate of antisocial personality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The high incidence of sociopathy in human society has a profound effect on the rest of us who must live on this planet, too, even those of us who have not been clinically traumatized. The individuals who constitute this 4 percent drain our relationships, our bank accounts, our accomplishments, our self-esteem, our very peace on earth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Yet surprisingly, many people know nothing about this disorder, or if they do, they think only in terms of violent psychopathy - murderers, serial killers, mass murderers - people who have conspicuously broken the law many times over, and who, if caught, will be imprisoned, maybe even put to death by our legal system. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">We are not commonly aware of, nor do we usually identify, the larger number of nonviolent sociopaths among us, people who often are not blatant lawbreakers, and against whom our formal legal system provides little defense.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Most of us would not imagine any correspondence between conceiving an ethnic genocide and, say, guiltlessly lying to one's boss about a coworker. But the psychological correspondence is not only there; it is chilling. Simple and profound, the link is the absence of the inner mechanism that beats up on us, emotionally speaking, when we make a choice we view as immoral, unethical, neglectful, or selfish. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Most of us feel mildly guilty if we eat the last piece of cake in the kitchen, let alone what we would feel if we intentionally and methodically set about to hurt another person. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Those who have no conscience at all are a group unto themselves, whether they be homicidal tyrants or merely ruthless social snipers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The presence or absence of conscience is a deep human division, arguably more significant than intelligence, race, or even gender. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What differentiates a sociopath who lives off the labors of others from one who occasionally robs convenience stores, or from one who is a contemporary robber baron - or what makes the difference betwen an ordinary bully and a sociopathic murderer - is nothing more than social status, drive, intellect, blood lust, or simple opportunity. </span></p>

              <p>I think Adolf Hitler still care for his wife and his children.  A perfect psychopath does not.  Perhaps psychopath-ism is different degree in human being, from "no conscience", to "lack of conscience", to "selective conscience"...   Perhaps truly understanding and eradicating psychopath-ism will bring about true world peace.  We always been defined by the notation of Sin or Ignorance as root cause of the evil in the world.  Perhaps it is not... perhaps it is the psychopath-ism is the root cause of the continual evil.  World can advance by science, technology, religion and watever...  but we will always fail to rectify evil.  Some say everyone is born with good nature.. if someone can be a perfect psychopath, then this saying is wrong..  It brings about questions like when we do start to build up our moral compass..  and end and end, people have always been mindful of one another ... so being mindful does not resolve this issue...  We look at dog, and we say so cutteeeee... but we see cockroach, we say dieeeee...</p>
