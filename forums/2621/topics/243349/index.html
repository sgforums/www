            <div class='col-md body'>we natural law believers adopt natural law because we see that almost everything is lawful in action. they are guided by reasons and causality.<br><br>from why your mother scold you, to why you father think you lie to him, to why the tree does not walk around. even the phenomenon why religion happens, and why are the terrorist in the world, there are cause and effect and lawfulness leading to their happening.<br><br>in case you don't know there is a philosohy branch called the philosophy of religion and i think they are trying to study why people adopt religion and what are the various religions.<br><br></div>
