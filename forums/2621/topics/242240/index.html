            <div class='col-md body'>Atheism doesn't involve faith. (Unless you argue that all knowledge depends on faith which is a different argument and not very useful for the purpose of this discussion.)<br><br>This view was popularized in the book "I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist" by Norman L. Geisler and Frank Turek. It's a Christian book that argues that the existence of God is the most obvious conclusion.<br><br>The following is a blurb from the product description:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All worldviews---including atheism---require faith. But some belief systems are more reasonable than others! Geisler and Turek make the case that Christianity requires the least faith of all because so much evidence points toward the existence of God and the reliability of Scripture. An engaging, easy-to-follow defense for Christians and skeptics.</span><br><br>It's another kindergarten defense that goes "you say my belief is based on faith. Yours is too. Nyah nyah!"<br><br>I really dislike arguments that break down to definitions but this really boils down to standards of evidence.<br><br>Atheism is not the lack of belief without evidence, but is the natural result. I've covered what the standard of evidence is in other posts and I won't repeat it here. I accept that other people may not have the same standards of evidence. I believe that my personal standard of evidence is the best method for me to understand the world around me.<br><br>Atheism is simply the lack of belief in a god or the supernatural. Saying atheism requires faith is like saying 'not posting on forums' is a hobby.<br><br>If your standard of evidence is too low, you fall prey to pseudo-religions like Scientology that teaches about 'thetans' and the 'reactive mind'. They have all kinds of 'evidence' that 'proves' their so-called religion is real.<br><br>Every religion, every pseudoscience, every faith healer has their own 'evidence' of why their belief is true and why it works. The scientific method is how you address those claims critically.<br><br>A further exposition on atheism can be found at http://www.thenewhumanist.com/George%20Felis2.htm<br><br></div>
