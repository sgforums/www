            <div class='col-md body'>Carl sagan is the one the greatest teachers and scientific minds to have lived on our planet . He will be missed.<br><br>He makes me proud to be an atheist. He taught me that we have a great responsibilty to try and rescue a world torn apart by mysticism and religion.<br><br>heres a list of quotes from dr. Sagan on atheism :<br><br>The method of science is tried and true. It is not perfect, it's just the best we have. And to abandon it with its skeptical protocols is the pathway to a dark age.<br>-- Carl Sagan, sound clip from CSICOP<br><br>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.<br>-- Carl Sagan (unknown: possibly from his Cosmos TV series, but we are curcrently unable to personally verify or refute either a claim that it is from the Cosmos TV show or another claim that it is from the Billions and Billions book)<br><br>The cure for a fallacious argument is a better argument, not the supression of ideas.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon Haunted World, p. 429 Â†Â†<br><br>If you want to save your child from polio, you can pray or you can inoculate.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World, p. 30<br><br>If we crave some cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal.<br>-- Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot<br><br>If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us, that we are the reason there is a Universe, does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits?<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World<br><br>Modern science has been a voyage into the unknown, with a lesson in humility waiting at every stop. Many passengers would rather have stayed home.<br>-- Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot<br><br>We live on a hunk of rock and metal that circles a humdrum star that is one of 400 billion other stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy which is one of billions of other galaxies which make up a universe which may be one of a very large number, perhaps an infinite number, of other universes. That is a perspective on human life and our culture that is well worth pondering.<br>-- Carl Sagan, quoted in Dan Lewandowski and John Stear, "A Tribute To Carl Sagan"<br><br>The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics, but it is not the path to knowledge, and there's no place for it in the endeavor of science. We do not know beforehand where fundamental insights will arise from about our mysterious and lovely solar system. The history of our study of our solar system shows us clearly that accepted and conventional ideas are often wrong, and that fundamental insights can arise from the most unexpected sources.<br>-- Carl Sagan, Cosmos television series, quoted from The Carl Sagan Electronic Monument<br><br>In science it often happens that scientists say, "You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken," and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time someting like that happened in politics or religion.<br>-- Carl Sagan, 1987 CSICOP keynote address<br><br>If some good evidence for life after death were announced, I'd be eager to examine it; but it would have to be real scientific data, not mere anecdote.... Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting fantasy.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World, p. 204<br><br>If we can't think for ourselves, if we're unwilling to question authority, then we're just putty in the hands of those in power. But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions, then those in power work for us. In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World<br><br>I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But as much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon Haunted World<br><br>You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence, it's based on a deep seated need to believe.<br>-- Carl Sagan (attributed: source unknown)<br><br>Think of how many religions attempt to validate themselves with prophecy. Think of how many people rely on these prophecies, however vague, however unfulfilled, to support or prop up their beliefs. Yet has there ever been a religion with the prophetic accuracy and reliability of science? ... No other human institution comes close.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World, p. 30<br><br>In Italy, the Inquisition was condemning people to death until the end of the eighteenth century, and inquisitional torture was not abolished in the Catholic Church until 1816. The last bastion of support for the reality of witchcraft and the necessity of punishment has been the Christian churches.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World, p. 413<br><br>A religion that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by traditional faiths. Sooner or later, such a religion will emerge.<br>-- Carl Sagan, quoted from the United Universists front page Â†Â†<br><br>Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.<br>-- Carl Sagan, quoted from John Stear, No Answers in Genesis<br><br>There are many hypotheses in science which are wrong. That's perfectly all right; they're the aperture to finding out what's right. Science is a self-correcting process. To be accepted, new ideas must survive the most rigorous standards of evidence and scrutiny.<br>-- Carl Sagan, Cosmos television series, quoted from The Carl Sagan Electronic Monument<br><br>It is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World<br><br>We wish to find the truth, no matter where it lies. But to find the truth we need imagination and skepticism both. We will not be afraid to speculate, but we will be careful to distinguish speculation from fact.<br>-- Carl Sagan, Cosmos television series, quoted from The Carl Sagan Electronic Monument<br><br>But amid much elegance and precision, the details of life and the Universe also exhibit haphazard, jury-rigged arrangements and much poor planning. What shall we make of this: an edifice abandoned early in construction by the architect?<br>-- Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot<br><br>The evidence, so far at least and laws of Nature aside, does not require a Designer. Maybe there is one hiding, maddeningly unwilling to be revealed.<br>-- Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot<br><br>The world is so exquisite, with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better, it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look Death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.<br>-- Carl Sagan, Billions and Billions p. 215<br><br>When you make the finding yourself -- even if you're the last person on Earth to see the light -- you never forget it.<br>-- Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World, p. 413<br><br>"Contrary to the fantasies of the fundamentalists, there was no deathbed conversion, no last minute refuge taken in a comforting vision of a heaven or an afterlife. For Carl, what mattered most was what was true, not merely what would make us feel better. Even at this moment when anyone would be forgiven for turning away from the reality of our situation, Carl was unflinching. As we looked deeply into each other's eyes, it was with a shared conviction that our wondrous life together was ending forever."<br>-- Ann Druyan(widow of Carl Sagan), Epilogue to Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium<br><br></div>
