              <p><strong>Up to 150 dead in India temple stampede</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As many as 150 Hindu worshippers, many of them women, children and the elderly, were crushed to death Sunday in a stampede at a hill temple in northern India, police said.</p>
              <p>Tens of thousands of pilgrims were thronging the Naina Devi temple in the hill state of Himachal Pradesh when rumours of a landslide caused by heavy rains sparked a colossal rush down a narrow, fenced-in stairway. <br><br>"A lot of the dead are women and children and elderly people. People thought there would be a landslide and the stampede started, and that was when people were crushed to death," a local police spokesman said.</p>

              <p>hey i normally dun respond to threads that questions the existence of God but just here to add my cents worth since i am bored.</p>
              <p>In this kind of cases where we say that just because people go to a church/temple/mosque or any religious building and die there, we say that God does not exist. Or we say that God is useless. Because God is suppose to ensure that everyone lives happily ever after and no one dies.</p>
              <p>So can I say that because my father died under the hands of the surgeon in Changi Hospital, that surgeon is useless and Changi Hospital is useless? That surgeon is merciless and useless and we should not trust him anymore?</p>
              <p>think abt that. ITs up to you to draw your conclusions. And yeah I dun need an answer from anyone here. Just a thought.</p>

              <p>ya.. they died mainly because of poor traffic control and also their fervant religion. if they are not so desperate to pray to god, then this accident would have been avoided...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so its partly their fault and also the organiser fault. we all know the advice of dun-be-greedy and have-common sense... in this case.. these people really are stupid in a sense...</p>

              <p>however. i know that its not their fault that they are ignorant or stupid. they are likely to be living in poor villages so their brain are not so smart. i dun laugh at them... although i admit my title seems to be laughing at them( see?? the feature of self correcting and admitting mistakes is at work)</p>

              <p>the point is this. there is no god. if you want to be safe and sound in life, you need knowledge. if you want to be healthy , you need to have health knowledge and practise them. There is no god to help you. only you can help yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you want to be safe and sound, then you must have the knoweldge that such situation of overcrowdedness is dangerous. this knowledge, not god, is the key to ensure that will be safer in life.</p>

              <p><br>this sentence is very intimitating indeed. it is very good at bringing out the fear in people and make them remain as passive atheists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i shall not let my fear overcome me. instead i have a word of him. i really pity those people and you who choose not to lambast the idea of god existence simply because they fear of meeting him in case he really exists and the wrath they may face from him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>these people are then truly pitiful because they chose cowardice over valor.</p>

              <p>Hundred over people killed in a stampede. Thats all there is to it.</p>
              <p>The human body is quite frail, and when subjected to forces greater than it could bear, it will break, leading to injuries or death.</p>
              <p>Temple pilgrimage, or Toto mayhem, a stampede is a stampede. A force is a force. No diff. The results will be accordingly.</p>
