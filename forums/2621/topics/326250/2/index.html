              <p>whatever happened in that stampede shows the stupidity of herds, it has nothing to do with God whatsoever.</p>

              <p>your 2nd reasoning is flawed. Since when is it God's sole responsibility and obligation to ensure believers' safety? HOWEVER, what you do see in the bible is that,</p>
              <p>Jeremiah 11:17, "The <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal.” (ESV)</p>
              <p>God can choose to keep us from harm or not. Either way, it is just, because as echoed in :</p>
              <p>Romans 9:20-21, "But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?” <span id="v45009021-1" class="verse-num"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></strong></span>Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?"</p>
              <p>Either way, we know it remains in God's sovereignty, because</p>
              <p>Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good"</p>
              <p>I am of the view that God allowed all things to happen, but the question is not “Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people” but rather, “Why would a good God allow bad people to live?”. In fact, is there anyone "good" to begin with?</p>
              <p>If you have read this far, including the bible verses, take a look at <a href="http://www.rbc.org/questionsDetail.aspx?id=45864">this</a>.</p>
              <p>Depending on which culture and country you come from, but when i was growing up, my parents warned me a lot about having a good behaviour, but i still chose to take a different route and did a lot of wrong things and put myself in harm's way. By my choice. By my wilful decisions. Can i still blame them?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>some funny statments found</p>
              <p>"God uses even the most wicked and evil exploits of this world to bring about His glory and divine purposes. That is what is so awesome about God. Only He can take the most wicked, evil, and self-serving intentions and make good come out of them"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p>Rather, God created man in His image with the freedom to choose. With this freedom came the opportunity to rebel against Him. Man did rebel ( <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage?search=Genesis+3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Genesis 3</span></span></a> ), and the rest is history. The annals of human history chronicle how God uses everything -- even the chaos of this world -- to bring about His glory and purposes. Those purposes include our growth in becoming more Christlike.</p>
              <p>What's the point of Isaiah 45:7? God reveals His almighty and awesome character to us so we can relax with the confidence that comes from knowing, even in the most dark, desperate, and discouraging times in our lives, God is up to something good for us all the time."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This kind of reasoning can also be qualified to be called reasoning. wth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If God exist, he must be suffering from hallucinations with the kind of logic he is implenmenting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My questions to believers are this</p>
              <p>"why do you all believe in what the books says"</p>
              <p>"is the god of your this book the same god found in all other books?"</p>

              <p>A man of reason will give believers of a religion the benefit of the doubt.</p>
              <p>How can you reason that God and spirits do not exist? Have you played with a Ouija board? People who have played with Ouija boards are convinced that they are communicating with spirits from another realm.</p>
              <p>The scientific explanation <strong>ideomotor effect</strong> is unsatisfactory so not many people will believe it.</p>
              <p>TS, try and use your proofs or reasoning to convince others that spirits do not exist.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>i will counter this argument. Your argument is errornous. Our
              house is built first by early cavemen and later modified and
              improved with new knowledge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody says universe and our things in modern life is a lego box
              with million of things at first and after shaking, these things pop
              out. As you can see , our the things in the universe has a history
              of how they have evolved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You analogy is misleading and also unreasonable in comparing
              with universe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>secondly, if god is not obligated to save his believers, then
              that ,means that being a believer cannot ensure safety of
              oneself.</p>
              <p>i will come up with this statment contradiction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When people manage to survive an accident, they can attribute it
              to god and say that he saves them.</p>
              <p>When people failed to survive, you then say the god is not
              obligated to save them. Isn't there some kind of favortism
              reasoning down here. god get credited if people survives but he is
              not responsible when people dies.</p>

              <p>If God exist, well he is some form of supreme ruler am I right? And if that is so, he thinks that he is ALWAYS right. So, dead and life, he will grant... whenever he feels like it.</p>
              <p>So, I should say, God isn't stupid(since he's always right), the believers arn't stupid either(well, their God is always right, so they have to be right). Either that or humans evolved to their disadvantage(too much imagination)</p>
