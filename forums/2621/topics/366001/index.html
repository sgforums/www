              Primitive ancient people that time were living in caves, hills and mountains, they do not know that natural phenomena like lighting, thunders, earthquakes, floods etc are not acts of god. their thinking was hunting, eating, protecting their tribes and procreation.
              
              so they begun to think that there must be a god, if not who are creating all these natural diasters. so they begun praying to Sun, Moon, rivers, sky because to seek their protection and create less disasters. they thought that by praying and worshipping, the Sun/moon god will be appeased and will bless their tribe.
              
              as people evolved and the worshipping progressed, some even took it to sacrifising animals and later humans to appease the god.
              
              Here the concept of god was based on fear, as they are unable to understand these are not acts of god, but natural phenomenon.

              <p>Don't you think it's exciting? Once we are rid of this ridiculus notion of needing to believe in some transcendental power imposing limits on the human race we can be free to do whatever we want.</p>
              <p>There will be no good or evil, and everything will just be dependent on the amount of will to power we have to bring our personal desires into futition. There will be no need to bother with this thing called ethics and morality and we can live for our maximum self-interest.</p>
              <p>Imagine a world where we can do whatever we want, no matter how deviant. There is no such thing as being deviant. No doubt many people would still believe in being "good" or "ethical" but they are just the sheep who have been sucked into the evolutionary system that soceity has evolved to maintain stability. Free minds who see all human behavior as just the illusion it is can truly be the supermen who have the will to power. It is this supermen who will reign over the rest of the sheep, and nothing will be objectionable to them, they and they alone will decide what is best for them.</p>
              <p>Science will not just decide the fate of religion, we must apply it to other irrationalities such as this collectivist morality that we inherited from religion and be totally free of it.</p>
