            <div class='col-md body'>I have no question that atheism is right belief.<br><br>In the past, when i child and JC boy, i pray to chinese god during exams and religious days.<br><br>when in the army days, i still pray to god for family safety<br><br>in between army to university transition, while reading internet stuff, i was awed and surprised and nervous of having to change and believe in atheism of facing certain truths of life like what it means and feel like to be not existing after death.<br><br>i realize that not existing means not been able to feel and see as if u are spirit floating around. In fact, i would not be able to think even.in fact there is not 'i' anymore. How good it will be if i can be a spirit floating around. would definitey go to hollywood to watch celebrities and asian celebrities and their lives.<br><br>In uni first year, i still pray for good marks during exam day.<br><br>at around yr 2, i realized praying and stuff are psychological reactions of fear of getting bad marks and the convinence of praying and kiasu-ism, kiasee-ism all mixed together and so i trained myself to condition myself that it seriously does not make a difference at all whether u pray to anything.<br><br>from yr 2 onwards, i seldom pray to anything liao.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I was about 4 years old, my mom brought me to a temple. I kept sneezing because of the smoke from joss sticks. After our third visit, I was pretty sure I didn't want to go anymore.<br><br>"Why do we have to go temple?" I asked my mom.<br><br>"You have to have a religion," she replied.<br><br>Suddenly I had a brillant idea. "Is there any religion where they don't burn joss sticks?" I asked.<br><br>"Yes. Christianity. "<br><br>Thus began my journey in to Christianity. I attended Sunday school, and as I got older, church service. I also went to a christian school, and was a member of the Boy's Brigade. I still remember the song:<br><br>And we will march on<br>In the power of His Glory<br>We'll be Sure and Steadfast<br>In the power of His Name<br><br>We'll be one in vision one in Christ<br>Together as a family<br>One in vision one in Christ<br>For all the world to see<br><br>I loved the bible stories about Moses, David and Goliath. They were full of action and excitement. The moral lessons, I was not so sure of. When I was young, I didn't really question them. As I got older, things didn't seem quite right. I began to question but the answer I got was usually, "God is beyond our understanding." Or, "do you know better than God? Trust in Him."<br><br>I did not find that a satisfactory answer.<br><br>The turning point came when my Church ran a campaign to encourage members to read the bible. The bible was promoted as the "bestselling book of all time" and "the greatest book every written". A book that was "clearly inspired by God" and the source of the greatest lessons ever taught.<br><br>So I resolved to read the bible from cover to cover. From "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth..." to "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."<br><br>With that first reading, I began to find troubling things. There was much I did not understand. At the time, I was too young to understand why I felt troubled. I just felt that a lot was wrong. Throughout my primary school days, I read the bible 3 about 3-5 more times cover to cover. Each time, I found more inconsistencies. Of course, I still read individual passages here and there, and certain chapters when I went for bible study.<br><br>As I grew older, I began to understand logical fallacies. I started to understand the reason why I felt things were not right. I started to study apologetic arguments, as well as examined how contradictions in the bible might be resolved.<br><br>When I got to college, exposure to the internet gave me access to an almost limitless amount of information. I was able to do tons of research about the origins of the bible, the history of Christianity. I also studied evidence for miracles and how the Church handled claims of miracles. I researched into texts like the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi library.<br><br>My Christian friends were horrified and saddened that I had fallen away. They began to come up with all kinds of rationalizations. Perhaps God has a plan for me, they suggested. Perhaps God has led you down this path so that when you return to Christ, you will be even stronger in your faith. They also argued that God gave me the ability to reason, and would supply a reason to believe.<br><br>To help show me the reason to believe, they started giving me tons of books. With each book, they felt that the arguments presented were so convincing, that once I read them I would return to God.<br><br>I read every single book because they were my friends and I knew they cared about me. They spent their own money to get books for me, spent time with me, paid for me to attend seminars. When they felt they couldn't give good enough answers, they went and looked for others whom they felt could give better answers. My friends were never push or rude. They just cared about me and wanted me to find salvation through Jesus Christ.<br><br>But with every book my lack of belief became stronger. 5 years ago, I would have described myself as agnostic. Perhaps there is a god, I thought. I just don't know anything about it. Now I describe myself as an atheist. Although one cannot prove there is no God, I'm satisfied that there is enough evidence to show that the probability of God existing is so low, that it really doesn't matter.<br><br>So that's where I am today. An atheist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you must be lucky person then to change from christian to atheist.<br><br>i have never study any religious books before personally. phew.<br>Some Chinese are not very literate people that is why fortunately for us, we dun really study type of people. like my parents, they dun really study and read books one.<br><br>therefore they turn out to be those go to temple, listen to ghost stories and god stories type once in a while, and probably spend most of their time working bah. No time to go church and pray and donate 10%. where got money? Fortune in disguise..<br><br>I was generally  god believer in this kind of environment when young but i dun touch god stuff either. i just concern with girls, playing and studies mainly as child or young adult. Internet probably play a pivotal role in my exposure which i start reading mainly at 20 years old and i begin to see different types of funny things existing in the world.<br><br>Being a singaporean is also a factor because we happen to be a wired computer addict country. if you born in not so wired country, you might be more intuned with local beliefs.</div>
