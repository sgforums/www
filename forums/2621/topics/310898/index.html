              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Atheism is an abject failure.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As atheists we are in a unique situation. While we are ostracized, marginalized, persecuted, prosecuted, abused and generally deprived of our rights by unsympathetic regimes and autocratic systems in the real world, it is in cyberspace where we can express ourselves freely to some substantial degree. It is in this virtual realm that we dare challenge theists and other proponents of illogicality and come away truly victorious. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">However, these victories, impressive as they are, cannot but feel hollow. For all the reasoning and logic which made us, dare I say it, <em>ubermensch</em>, we are unable to demonstrate our superiority where it really matters. Dawkins and Hitchens might have made the world stand up in recognition of the fallacies of religion, but is this proliferation of truth and rationality changing the way people really behave?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Sadly, the answer is no. Superstition still holds sway. To many, atheism is a passing fad. People remain attached to their cherished beliefs. After all, knowing the truth does not equate its acceptance. Not only do people want to believe in something, they need to feel wanted. Religion provides a very strong support in satisfying this emotional need, as evident by the number of support groups, cell groups, social and community structures the religious have put together to bind its adherents. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It must be intoxicating knowing that ‘Someone’ will always love you. That ‘Someone’ will look after you in every situation and never falter in His efforts. To have this preposterous notion ‘validated’ by your fellow humans who <strong>actually </strong>help you in times of difficulties while the ‘Someone’ never makes an appearance must seem an affirmation to the desperate. What religion does so effectively is to make each and everyone of its followers feel special. Logic goes out of the window in the face of this compelling emotional assault. It is an irony, considering that rationality is painted over by a very real human need which in turn is satisfied by an illusion instead.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is where atheism fails so miserably. Atheists do not help each other just because they believe in the same creed. The theists, however, do so because their doctrine specifically wills it. For all our arguments and justifications we do not deign to help one another because we take the point of ‘not giving a damn about God’ one step further to include ourselves. I see friends who are Christians support each other within their own church and cell groups. What do I see when I look upon my fellow atheists?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Theist : 1 Atheist : 0.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our endless debates with theists achieve little. We are wasting precious time trying to convince people who do not want to be convinced. People would rather live a happier life believing in a lie than accept things as they really are and being less happy as a result. Reading about the articles atheists post on the Internet makes me think that all these well-meaning writers want are to amass as many hits for their sites and to comment favorably on each other’s writings in the hope that the praised party, overjoyed at being appreciated, would return the favor. We hide behind monikers like ‘infidel’ and ‘heretic’, perhaps to impart some perceived quality in our cause, but we do not back our words with concrete action. I have more respect for the religious folk (the non-violent ones) who preach their gospel and live their life accordingly than for self-proclaimed atheists who cannot even be bothered to scrap their addled brains off the computer screen to think: <em>I am an atheist. What does this mean? What do I do?</em></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;  "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Atheism is on precarious ground in this respect. And it is time to stop the rot. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We must acknowledge that we are on our own. We have no god(s), no temples, no institutions and nothing to rely upon. Social structure and cultural norms, influenced to some extent by religion does not give the atheist credence. In many parts of the world, atheism is punishable by stoning. In more <em>civilized</em> climates, a priest who incites violence against non-believers is at the most given a slap on the wrist – he might even be lauded for his <em>sense of justice</em>. But an atheist who gives credible reasons for his rejection of religion, and quotes from reliable sources – he is making ‘seditious’ remarks and persecuted for being ‘anti-religion’. It is obscene. You can say that people are treated equally in these modern times, but you cannot deny that some are more <em>equal</em> than others.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In view of the many difficulties atheists face, I propose we take care of our own. And we can do this through support groups.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A support group need not have a club-house or a fixed physical location where members can convene. We can host a bulletin board (forum) in cyberspace, much like what Atheisthaven is doing. However, instead of ‘ghost members’ and people who pack only rhetoric and little else, such a group must consist of dedicated individuals who genuinely want to make a difference. While we do not restrict the membership to atheists (the non-religious, freethinkers, agnostics, even Buddhists -<span>  </span>especially those leaning towards a philosophical bent may join), members must be committed. As this commitment takes the form of certain obligations, we want positive individuals who truly believe in improving themselves and others. Atheism by its own nature, promotes self-reliance and an internal locus of control. All efforts should have an egalitarian spirit in its core, mutual aid as its strength, and self-actualization its ultimate goal. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span>                                                             </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is strictly an informal group. No membership fee is required. We only ask that members make an effort to know each other and to interact, preferably face-to-face. This fosters cohesiveness which is very important because people tend to help their own friends than relative strangers. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What form should this aid take? At the most basic level, information exchange. People who have questions can post them on the group site, and those with the answers can promptly reply. Questions can range from anything – potential job openings, which university to choose, even where to get the best bargains! At a deeper level, members can work on some task together or maybe enjoy a little <em>soiree</em>. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; "><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While we encourage members to look after each other’s interests, we do not look kindly to people who join for ulterior motives. This is not a MLM (multi-level-marketing) scam, nor is it a dating agency. Promoting any political agenda is also a no-no. In a nutshell, the group is similar to a normal theist cell group, minus the praying and speaking in tongues. Think of it as a secular social network, where normal people (without a faith) make friends and chill out.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We must succeed in this endeavor. If sodden theists can organize themselves, it would be a crying shame if intelligent atheists cannot even produce a similar response. The time has passed for talking. Let us show people that we are capable of doing great things, even without divine edicts… because in Humanity we trust.</span></span></p>
