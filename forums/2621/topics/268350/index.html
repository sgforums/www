            <div class='col-md body'>"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light." - Carl Sagan<br><br>We fight over promised lands. We tell ourselves we must face in the direction of a holy place everyday. We even work on trying to determine how to face the holy place from space.<br><br>If the universe was designed for us, there sure is a lot of it that wasn't.<br><br>The photo was taken from the edge of our solar system. Even on the galactic scale, the entire solar system is tiny and insignificant. Yet, the edge of our solar system is, on the astronomical scale, right next to the Earth. On the scale of our Universe, even our galaxy is insignificant.<br><br>How is it that we can all look at the same thing as see different things? We all look at this and are struck with awe. We are humbled by our insignificance. Yet atheists see in this a godless universe where the only meaning is what we make of it; the religious see this as proof of the power of god.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"There is more information in one thimble of reality than could be understood by a galaxy of human<br>brains. It is beyond the human brain to understand the world and its environment, so the brain<br>compensates by creating illusions that act as replacement for understanding. When the illusions<br>work well and the human who subscribes to the illusions survives, those illusions are passed to<br>new generations. The human brain is an illusion generator."<br><br>"The human brain is a delusion generator. The delusions are fueled by arrogance Â– the arrogance that humans are the center of the world, that we alone are endowed with the magical properties of souls and morality and free will and love. We assume that an omnipotent God has a unique interest in our progress and activities while providing all the rest of creation for our playground. We believe that god Â– because he thinks the same way we do Â– must be more interested in our lives then in the rocks and trees and plants and animals. 34"<br><br>-Scott Adams, from "God's Debris"<br><br>p.s.
