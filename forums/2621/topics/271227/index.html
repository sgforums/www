So the problem is not religion, but lack of common sense when evaluating religious claims?<br><br>Also, I feel that your example is not very good. You could you use that argument to claim nothing is bad - though perhaps I think I would agree with that viewpoint. I do feel there is nothing inherently bad in any thing or action. 'Good' and 'bad' are human judgments and not absolute values.<br><br>For example, if someone gambles away all his money because he can't control himself, is gambling bad?<br><br>If someone gets lung cancer because he cannot control his smoking, is smoking bad?<br><br>Finally, driving is a dangerous activity. That is why we require people to take driving lessons and obtain driving licenses. We also constantly remind people that driving IS dangerous and that they need to drive responsibly.<br><br>Perhaps then we should remind people before every religious service that there is no evidence for the religion, and one should examine every claim critically, lest he spend sleepless nights worrying about eternal damnation because he decided to jack the beanstalk.</div>

I can't feel the Earth rotating under my feet.<br><br>I believe my mother loves me, but she can't exactly write it out and say "I love you, my child.". That will only result in loving me being an obligation and requiring proof.<br><br>I believe in the need for intelligent and responsible use of reason, logic and civility in arguments, but there's no conclusive evidence to say that reason and logic are not fictional constructs, much like the idea of a "individual-serving society".<br><br>I believed I could speak German in the span of four years, even if there wasn't any conclusive evidence to show that I could learn German quickly enough to use it proficiently. By the way, I'm taking H2 German right now, and we're doing German Philosophy.<br><br>Before you can really do something, you're going to have to believe in it, even if there's no evidence to show you can.</div>
