              <p> </p>
              <p>books says abortion is immoral --&gt; mad people believe it to great extent --&gt; kill doctors who provide abortion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the question is .. is abortion really immoral or not? On what context shall we say it is more acceptable to abort.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, what does the religious books really say about abortion and how people should deal with abortion issue?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope people who knows about religious books says what does books says about abortion issue.. Perhaps it can help us understand why some mad people jus follow what the books says...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to my knowledge... religious books does contain stories of violence, torture and bad stuff by characters...</p>
              <p>How are we suppose to educate our children and citizens on how much to read into the books so that they can know which part of the book is right and which part of the book is wrong.... if the books is so huge and full of confusing messages and stories...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you cannot say.. religion is about peace and harmony but when you read the full text of those books.. its also about blood and violence and full of conflicting advices....</p>

              <p>Religion doesn't cause death; humans do. We'll find any damn reason to kill each other and try to justify it.</p>
              <p>There is nothing inherently moral or immoral about abortion. We just place labels on it, like we do with every other aspect of life. It's completely subjective.</p>
