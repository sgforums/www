              <p><br>Yes, it does depend on what you mean by respect. And I believe you know my meaning. If a person wants to take it to the extreme and expect respect to mean bowing and giving reverence, then it's totally a different meaning altogether.</p>

              <p>I don't believe in Islam, but I do not go around speaking ill of their faith or their followers.To not believe in it is one thing, but to go overboard and start being insulting about it just for the sake of it is a different thing. This doesn't just apply to just Christianity but also to Buddhism, Islam or any other religion.</p>

              <p>I think your example is still different from what I was talking about, I'm only addressing one's right to religious choice, be it a choice of with a religion or without. But to just comment on your example, doing good is not always about rewards. There is really such thng as doing good because that's what you want for the other person.</p>

              <p>I completely agree with you. Just pointing out there are different levels of respect.  :)</p>
              <p><br>Also, what is considered "going overboard" and "insulting" is largely cultural. You have an idea of what would be considered "going overboard" and "insulting" which is "speaking ill of their faith and their followers". Other people and cultures might be much more sensitive. So to what level should one accomodate?</p>
              <p>If someone tells me that to leave my head uncovered is insulting to their faith, am I obligated to wear a hat?</p>
              <p>In Singapore, we make some accomodations in the workplace. We don't eat pork to the office for example. I think most people consider this a reasonable accomdation, but this is how we were brought up. It's an accomodation we are used to. Let's say, however, someone else has a religion where pork needs brought throughout the office while cooking so that the smell can spread around and please the gods?</p>
              <p>I used to think that a live and let live attitude is the best. However, I realise that it is impossible for most people to ignore the actions of others. On one hand, I accept that honor killing is a tradition in other cultures. On the other hand, I find it impossible to accept it. I could accept it perhaps if a person had a choice in what culture they choose to participate in but in many cases, people have no choice.</p>
              <p>We are very lucky that we do have a choice.</p>

              Thanks Phaze,
              
              Yes 'going overboard' and being 'insulting' is subjective even within Singapore itself, let alone across cultures and across countries. But at the very least, I believe there are those like you who at least spare a thought and try.
              
              There is no hard and fast rule on such things, but at least there are those who make it an effort not to hurt others.
              
              I am very thankful for the amount of religious/racial tolerance we have in Singapore, but having seen events in the media over the years, as well as comments in online forums (some of which are in sgforums and include posts by a moderator), this cannot be taken for granted. And though we have it better than even some of the more developed countries, we are not perfect when it comes to racial or religious tolerance.
