              <p>Hi fellow atheists,</p>
              <p>It cross my mind what is bad atheism and good atheism.  Bad atheism is people who make use of the truth that God does not exist, therefore think they at liberty to do whatever bad things as long they are in the power to do so and as long they themselves enjoy them. </p>
              <p>Good atheism is just the absence of the belief of God or gods, which is not the rejection or denial of God or gods.  It is grounded on facts, rational and correct logic, thus understanding that evolution is the best describe the universe.  Often good atheism are made of people who left their religions becos they unlearn and discover they are wrong.  People always choose a religion as a crutch becos of the choice to seek to do right and good.  But when they discover the clutch is wrong, they rejected them.  But those who continue in such religions are becos of having a religion to appease themselves and begin to use their religion clutch to whack other ppl. Science can never superseded religion, because religion will evolve and serve the need of these ppl to appease themselves.</p>
              <p>Good atheism does not tell u this and that, like communism, that force ideas into you.  We always suggest good moral values to pick up from various sources. </p>
              <p>Modern christians nowsdays believe in churchtainity, not the religion of love and true God-consciousness once perhaps exhibted in the person of Jesus.  What we have left are manipulated distorted scriptures that people form their wooha theology.  Similarly like modern buddhists, most of them do not have karma-conscious.  They do what they think is right.. but what is right.. they severly lack of karma-consciousness, that is sign of a true buddhist follower.</p>
              <p>Atheism should have the same playing ground.  But I don't think should make it to be like "Church"..   it should not be telling ppl what is atheism...  because it is not a religion ... but we should have greater connectivity with each other in helping one another, etc..</p>
              <p>what is your opinion?</p>

              <p>Trueppuzzan,</p>
              <p>Those who do evil will get their own punishment, regardless of their belief, even if it means someone who is willing to sacrifice for you</p>
              <p>Atheism be it good or bad, yes, it is an absence of god</p>
              <p>Religion only serves to calm oneself psychologically, that there is <strong>something worth holding onto......... </strong></p>
              <p>Science on the other hand, due to it being based on facts, shatters a person's long held belief and it is this shattering effect that may cause certain people to go crazy</p>
              <p>Thus, science cannot supersede religion</p>
              <p>As for religion will evolve, it is very subjective and may cause widespread unhappiness because it will mean what the ancestors taught are crap.....</p>
              <p>Atheism is an individual choice</p>
              <p>Conclusion: Evil begets evil..........this is a tried &amp; proven theory</p>

              <p>Haha.. i meant the topic for atheists.. my question is this? If religions can be problematic, why won't atheism be problematic if it becomes an "organized religion"?  This is in reference to the topics mentioned by January.</p>
              <p>Be it atheism, christianity or buddhism, if it helps the person to do good and be good, then it is okay..</p>
              <p>We should build a community, a family, a brotherhood, not a religion, for people who don't believe Divine God is watching over us and who don't also believe in recarnation.  In this way, our numbers will grow.  And with ideals, embrace one another and reach out to the world in humanism.  Facts and truths will one day shake off the religion assumptions, but where he/she will go. </p>

              <p>atheism as an organised religion is oxymoronic</p>
