You can only be athiest after you are sure that there is no god, it is the exact opposite of thiest. <br><br>Agnostic: The question on the exisitence of god cannot be known to men. IT is an unknown. The question is beyond us. We may find out later on, but now, there is no prove either way. You are not a believer of conventional gods.<br><br>Free thinker: Very lazy bunch of people... dun bother to think about god. simply jus dun care. <br><br>P.s the above is my interpretation of the differences between the 3 terms... not academic definitions.</p></div>

              <p>Of course it is not wrong to move on with life without caring about belifs. <br><br>But for others who are curious about the subjects of creation, if there is a supreme being that created us. For you to come into this forum, i have to assume that you are interested in this subject too, if nt you will not be bothered to be in here. |</p>
              <p>There are quite a number of people who call themselves free-thinker, and they does go to the temple and church sometime or another.<br> In Singapore now at least, those of us who are not mainstream believers are classified as freethinkers. The problem, this is such a blanket labels which consist of athiests, agnostics and people who cant make up their mind all lumped together...In short, it is too general a term.</p>
              <p>When someone tell me they are a freethinker, I will be thinking, "do u go to temple?" or "are u an athiest" or "have u though about it, or is it written in your IC so it must be" . <br>It is not precise to say you are jus a freethinker. <br><br>For me personally, I still are unsure about the question of god. It will be unhonest if I say that I am an athiest, I am an agnostic now, till I am convinced otherwise.  <br><br></p>

              <p>To whisker, you are unsure about god.</p>
              <p>Let me try to convince you that god is pointless entity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So they say GOd create universe. But they never explain with logic how, hence that is why they are so many versions of stories. Thus, in conclusions, 'god create universe' is a false theory because its does not say anything concrete except assuming that god create universe is true.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We must start from what we know scientifically about universe. From science, we are lead into astro-physics as well as quantum mechanics. From these few fields, we have many facts, equations and also many methods of verifications which people can study and research further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is how we know about our universe and how we are going to know more about our universe. The science way. Correctly speaking,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GOD is called "Don't know".</p>
              <p>Those that we have not consistently agree about the nature of our universe ... we science will say "don't know". There are still many things, many knowledge about our universe and also new knowledge that we have not found out yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For science, the general term is this undiscovered knowledge is called "don't know". But mythical people don't like the name "don't know". They reject this name, and its concept. Instead, they like to called it "God".</p>

              <p>I consider myself as a free-thinker.</p>
              <p>Part-time Buddhist, part-time Christian. But I am more towards Buddhsim as it sounds more logical to me.</p>
              <p>To me "God" obviously exists, it is just that different people has different interpretation of the word "God". Thats why is is quite confusing to answer question like "Does God exists?"</p>

              <p>Oh. One more thing I need to clarify.</p>
              <p>I would like to relate "free-thinker" with "not limited to specific beliefs" or "freedom of thoughts".</p>
              <p>A free-thinker has nothing to do with</p>
              <p>"Very lazy bunch of people... dun bother to think

              <p>In the beginning there was nothing in the <a title="Universe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe">universe</a> except a formless <a title="Chaos" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos">chaos</a>. However this chaos coalesced into a <a title="World egg" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_egg">cosmic egg</a> for 18,000 years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of <a class="mw-redirect" title="Yin and Yang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_Yang">Yin and Yang</a> became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy <a title="Giant (mythology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_%28mythology%29">giant</a> with horns on his head (like the Greek <a title="Pan (mythology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_%28mythology%29">Pan</a>)
              and clad in furs. Pangu set about the task of creating the world: he
              separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the <a title="Earth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a> (murky <em>Yin</em>) and the <a title="Sky" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky">Sky</a> (clear <em>Yang</em>).
              To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky.
              This task took 18,000 years; with each day the sky grew ten feet
              higher, the Earth ten feet wider, and Pangu ten feet taller. In some
              versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most
              prominent beasts, namely the <a title="Turtle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle">Turtle</a>, the <a title="Qilin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilin">Qilin</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Chinese phoenix" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_phoenix">Phoenix</a>, and the <a title="Chinese dragon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_dragon">Dragon</a>. After the 18,000 years had elapsed, Pangu was laid to rest. His breath became the <a title="Wind" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind">wind</a>; his voice the <a title="Thunder" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder">thunder</a>; left eye the <a title="Sun" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">sun</a> and right eye the <a title="Moon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">moon</a>; his body became the <a title="Mountain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain">mountains</a> and extremes of the world; his blood formed rivers; his muscles the
              fertile lands; his facial hair the stars and milky way; his fur the
              bushes and forests; his bones the valuable minerals; his bone marrows
              sacred diamonds; his sweat fell as rain; and the fleas on his fur
              carried by the wind became the fish and animals throughout the land.
              Nugua the Goddess then used the mud of the water bed to form the shape
              of humans. These humans were very smart since they were individually
              crafted. Nugua then became bored of individually making every human so
              she started putting a rope in the water bed and lettings the drops of
              mud that fell from it become new humans. These small drops became new
              humans, not as smart as the first.</p>

              <p>We must start from what we know scientifically about universe.
              From science, we are lead into astro-physics as well as quantum
              mechanics. From these few fields, we have many facts, equations and
              also many methods of verifications which people can study and

              <p>For science, the general term is this undiscovered knowledge is
              called "don't know". But mythical people don't like the name "don't
