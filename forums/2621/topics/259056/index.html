            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Man died as friends danced</strong><br><br>COLIN JAMES, LEGAL AFFAIRS EDITOR<br><br>June 05, 2007 02:30pm<br>Article from: The Advertiser<br><br>PARTICIPANTS in a ritualistic ceremony danced, chanted and played drums while one of their friends lay dying from heat exhaustion, an inquest has heard.<br><br>Deputy State Coroner Anthony Schapel today was told the group believed Rowan Douglas Cooke was "astral-travelling" after being exposed to extreme heat inside a North American Indian-style "steam lodge".<br><br>Mr Cooke, 37, of Melbourne, spent several hours unconscious at a campsite 325km north of Port Augusta, before two men went to a nearby homestead for help.<br><br>He had travelled with 10 other Victorians to the Gammon Ranges in late October 2004 on a "Vision Quest" led by a "new age healer", David Jarvis, Mr Schapel heard.<br><br>Amty Davis, counsel assisting, said the trip involved camping on a creekbed, where earth altars were erected near a "steam lodge" built from pine poles, silver insulation and blankets.<br><br>Members of the group took turns to sit inside the sealed, dome-like structure while water was poured over heated volcanic rocks to create steam.<br><br>They would then leave the campsite and sit in circles on their own for 24 hours, without food, before returning for further "cleansing" sessions in the "steam lodge".<br><br>Ms Davis said Mr Cooke and two other people, Maureen Collier and Adrian Asfar, went into the "steam lodge" late on Tuesday, November 2, because they wanted to participate in a "pipe ceremony".<br><br>The trio had sat inside in the structure for about 20 minutes when Ms Collier shouted she wanted to be let out because she was in difficulty.<br><br>Other members of the group then found Mr Cooke and Mr Asfar unconscious inside the "steam lodge" and dragged them outside, where six blankets were put over Mr Cooke.<br><br>Ms Davis said while both men were still breathing, no attempts were made to revive them because the group believed they were having "out of body" experiences.<br><br>"It was considered by some of the campers that the men might have been astral-travelling, that their conscious selves had left their bodies and that they were deep in a meditative state," she said.<br><br>"Given that, it was decided that the group should undertake activities to call them back to their bodies."<br><br>Ms Davis said this involved chanting, playing drums and singing.<br><br>It was not until several hours later, at daybreak, that two members of the group realised Mr Cooke was critically ill and drove to a nearby homestead for help before returning with a station manager, Paul Doran, who tried to revive Mr Cooke.<br><br>Mr Doran called for a volunteer ambulance crew to be sent from Leigh Creek, 75km away, to treat Mr Cooke for severe dehydration and heat exhaustion.<br><br>Attempts to resuscitate him at the campsite failed and he was taken to the Leigh Creek Hospital, where he died later that morning.<br><br>The inquest continues.<span class="large"></span><span class="normal"></span><span class="large"></span></div>
