No human has true, complete knowledge of everything scientific. Buddhism is similar in the aspect that we must discover the way to Enlightenment for ourselves, but because there are teachers who have discovered the way, books and lessons are used instead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, to clarify ur PM, i didn't say that science isn't connected to Buddhism. I merely, say scientific methods aren't advanced to fully comprehend the Dharma, reality as it is. Some scientific theory does not correlate to observation of what reality is. These are some of the limitation of science. i quote that sentence from Thread-starter for reference.<br><br>There is some differences between science and Buddhism.<br><br>Probably you could read on this<br><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/role_of_faith_in_science_and_bud.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/role_of_faith_in_science_and_bud.htm</a><br><br>Btw in Buddhism, we have this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kalama Sutra</span>,<br><br>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.<br>Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it.<br>Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations.<br>Do not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is written in your religious books.<br>Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."<br><br>- the Buddha<br><br>It is simple wisdom and not really dogmatic religious view.<br><br>Cheers</div>
