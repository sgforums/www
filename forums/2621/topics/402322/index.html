              <p>Atheists should have buildings in singapore to allow them to operate like religion buildings like church and mosque to spread their beliefs also.</p>
              <p>Dun worry, we will play by the rules of government stance on religion tolerance. But first, we must our own buildings to compete with other belief systems. Otherwise, all atheist talk will still be not much powerful because we need government support to lease atheist spaces......</p>
              <p>Government and Singapore needs more atheists. Otherwise, gurantee and chopped singapore CMI in the next 5 years.</p>

              <p>all religion is about beliefs in their own theory of god and its story. Atheism, tackles the issue of god theory also, which basically claim that it is a false premise. Therefore, atheism is considered a religion topic also.</p>
              <p>Playing by singapore way of doing religion, atheism will necessarily have to attend the interfaith dialogue between the few major religions of singapore. I wonder how they hacked atheist will go to meeting with these religious leaders. Atheists are smart people, they will surely find a way to join these talks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Basically atheists leaders cannot say "so and so religion is wrong!" our govt is so conservative that we cannot say others is wrong.</p>
              <p>But we can focus on telling kids" why atheism is the truth" When comparing with other religions, we have to necessary say that is is false, but we cannot attack or criticise or talked too much about it, because that is the singapore law.....</p>
              <p>In fact, strictly by singapore law, i figured out that atheist cannot even say "Christainity or Budhhism is wrong." such statments.... we just teach them the atheist part and ask them to figure such question of other religions by inferring and thinking on their own. It just own step only to figure the answer...</p>
              <p>but first of all, we need our own CHURCH... hehe XD</p>

              <p>'church' is used loosely in this sense. in articles used in the West, calling a Buddhist place a 'Buddhist Church' is acceptable</p>
              <p>if u have noticed, the history of the word 'temple' also have came a long way, resulting in the areas of Asian cultural of influence calling 'temple' for many divergent places,  including  "Hindu Temple"  ,  "Taoist Temple"  ,  "Buddhist Temple"  ,  "Yiguandao Temple"  and  "Confucian Temple"   etc.</p>

              <p>Hey everyone!</p>
              <p>Just to inform you, a freethinker group already exists in Singapore since 2008. It is the Singapore Humanism Meetup. You can check out our blog here: <a href="http://sg-humanism-meetup.blogspot.com/">http://sg-humanism-meetup.blogspot.com/</a></p>
              <p>To join us, all you need is sign up here: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Humanism/">http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Humanism/</a> and you will receive email notifications of our gatherings. </p>
              <p>We also have a facebook group: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=41667702434&amp;ref=ts">http://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=41667702434&amp;ref=ts</a> and you will messages from there too. </p>
              <p>Combining both websites we have about 500 members online. Even the Straits Times wrote about us twice:</p>
              <p>1) <a href="http://sg-humanism-meetup.blogspot.com/2010/02/shm-in-news-again.html">http://sg-humanism-meetup.blogspot.com/2010/02/shm-in-news-again.html</a></p>
              <p>2) <a href="http://sg-humanism-meetup.blogspot.com/2009/09/aware-saga-and-pink-dot.html">http://sg-humanism-meetup.blogspot.com/2009/09/aware-saga-and-pink-dot.html</a></p>
              <p>We currently do not have a fixed venue, nor do we need one. We meet at cafes, private rooms and community centres once or twice a month. </p>
              <p>During our meetings, one key feature is discussion where the free marketplace of ideas exist. Among our hottest topics are science, philosophy, religion, politics, and everything that has to do with human nature. As we are freethinkers, no 'dogma' exists. Instead, members sharpen their mind through debate, learn about the world through each other, and practice tolerance and respect of different ideas. </p>
              <p>If you have any more questions, feel free to email us at sg.humanism.meetup@gmail.com</p>
