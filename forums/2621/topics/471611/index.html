              <p>This thread was started in 2005. Basically, it is to highlight that ghosts and god do not exist, and hence there is no way you can insult them and get hurt by them.</p>
              <p>There are million things and tradegy that can befall on me though, and they are no related to gods or ghosts.</p>
              <p>However, in real life, you may be hurt by humans who are devotees to gods or just want to harass and harm you after seeing my post. Hence, the danger of such posting does not come from ghosts or god, but human beings.</p>

              <p>Speaking of conducting an experiment, this maybe one data point only. But in terms of the length , it is quite long already. About 8 years.</p>
              <p>Its funny as I read those posts in 2005 and few years after that between me and the fellow SGforumers, most of which I guess do not use SGforums anymore.</p>
              <p>The common counter points I see is to ask me sign pact with Satan, go pee in Graveyard and stuff.</p>
              <p>I have not done that yet actually. Though I do not intend to do it, not because I am scared of ghosts, but its that if am really lazy to go do it. Psychologically, if I pee on a cemetery, I will feel abit weird because I have not done it before.</p>
              <p>However, I have since cursed god and ghosts with my friend privately quite a few times, challenging them when walking outside so that one is quite easy for me to do it. I just wanted to experiment because I need data. Of course, more data points is crucial to have a balance view.</p>
              <p>However, I still need to do it otherwise, I will not really convince myself about imaginary ghost and god for the cursing part when walking outside.</p>
              <p>So to get more data, and make it more convincing, in some sense, I should try it at out the prohibited places where people say will have ghost or god attacking you if you do. In some sense, my mini experiment is basically a 8 year period of 1 sample data. Its not a strong data, but it is still 1 data point done over long period.</p>
              <p>In fact, I saw a skeptical group recently doing a event where the outing was focussing on doing everything of old wives tales said precisely that they cannot do because it will cause bad things to happen.  Why do they do it? We need people to show younger ones that there are alternative views besides the incumbent ones.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, it will be better if I did urine in a cemetry , to collect more data. However, please note the difference between correlation and causation. Does not mean that a person who pee in the cemetry and gets killed next day means that is the proof of ghost. There are many events in the world, where the chance is 1 in a million rate of happening. We do not have to attritube unproven pattern to these rare events, other than people being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
              <p>If you want to see causality, a court room will be a good place to see how prosecutors try to pin down the guilty.</p>
              <p>In army, most people will go field training at night usually just pee in the forest without saying "excuse me" as a insurance against ghost tagging them. That is just another side information.</p>
