(I'm not suggesting we stop.) If you've read Newsweek's 29th May issue, you'd have noticed that a group of scientists are already researching the possibilities of programming DNA manually (something that could possibly be called 'playing God'). The reason why it seems that a lot of money is being taken in by religious bodies like the Vatican is because of greater media coverage. More media coverage =/= More money being placed there.<br><br>What rituals are you referring to? Rain dances? If you mean praying, it allows people to have a place to express their worries and fears. Keeping all those inside of you isn't exactly healthy, and not many would go to a psychoanalyst (which some people have labelled as 'pseudo-science'). There's an equal amount of rifts and divides within the scientific world as the religious one.<br><br>Besides, are you so sure that all will be better if we started thinking logically? Great feats have been accomplished because some people do irrational things that eventually work out.<br>No one thought that heavier-than-air flight was possible, and in fact, many called it reckless and irrational, until the Wright Brothers did it.<br>No one thought that driving cars would overtake horses until Ford made it possible for every middle-class family to drive one.<br>War heroes have been known to take reckless and irrational action, and yet survive and save the lives of many.<br><br>Again, your tirade on output is impractical. Do we really need to be doing something you call "real work" everyday of our lives? Isn't typing this response a waste of time and effort in that sense? Do you not want your weekends where you can rest and do something that is fun for you? Do you not want your festivals like Deepavali, Chinese New Year and Hari Raya as days of rest for catching up with friends? Life is not all about work. Anyway, what you term "rituals" can also be good opportunities to make friends and connections (especially for the pragmatic-minded).<br><br>Yes, the world sucks today. Humans have made mistakes in the past. However, we should not be suggesting wiping out certain factors just so that we can avoid them.

That's a rare thing to happen.<br><br>The "isn't true" part can be very subjective, and I'm going to avoid that, because it would take a whole essay to say anything substantial.<br><br>The awful truth (irony, haha!) is that there are many out there who do not know what to do with their lives. Those who approach religion tend to be redeemed; this is a fact. Broken souls and hearts who approach fathers or monks or imams will tend to be healed through religion. Whether the god behind it all exists or not is a debate that has been going on for very long (We'll leave my beliefs out of this one, since I'm trying to be objective.)<br><br>Not everyone has the tenacity and passion to search for the atheistic version of "truth". You have to understand that in this case, Science is the main instrument for revealing that truth, and Science is not a good friend of the people. Why? For one, it is elitist and arrogant. If you're not someone important, or if you don't have a good background, no one's going to take you seriously. Second, Science does not have the appeal of religion, where everyone is made to feel blessed and important. In fact, many are intimidated by Science, and perhaps, that is why they avoid it. Third, Science is very technical, meaning you're going to need a lot of training to even know what is going on.<br><br>This is a reality atheists have to accept, that what they consider an unproven theory of a higher being is more easily believed than hard, solid evidence.<br><br>For the second part, your analogy is a nice one. Allow me to use it to illustrate my point. If we take reason and logic to be a box, an open box, not a closed one. In this box are all the scientific truths and inventions and whatnot. Creativity in this sense is an unmovable object outside the box. We see it, and we decide we like it, and we want to have that object inside our box of reason and logic. In order to do so, someone has to approach that object with reason and logic (the very material is box is made of) and eventually, build the box up around that object. Then, we have a new theory, a new invention, a new innovation. That's how I see it works.<br><br>Religion doesn't exactly prevent creativity, rather, it restricts it because it is afraid of what creavtivity would do. It's like a reluctant mother with her child at the playground. She's afraid of the things at the place, because she is afraid her child would get hurt. What she doesn't realize is, that the child can learn from injuries and pain. Religion means well; it's just that we feel very restricted by it, and that is why we are unhappy with it.</div>

Our brains are designed to handle the universe at the scale in which we live. We have problems understanding the very big (interstellar distances) and the very small (quantum mechanics). We use tools like math to help us describe what's going on but we have no intuitive understanding of it. I do see some parallels with Buddhist concepts here though there are many other aspects that I reject.<br><br>So perhaps you can mentally replace the word 'true' with "the truth as far as we can determine through evidence and reason."<br><br>Hmm... did I just write a mini-essay?  :p<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SturmDerSchatten:</div><div class="quote_body">The awful truth (irony, haha!) is that there are many out there who do not know what to do with their lives. Those who approach religion tend to be redeemed; this is a fact. Broken souls and hearts who approach fathers or monks or imams will tend to be healed through religion. Whether the god behind it all exists or not is a debate that has been going on for very long (We'll leave my beliefs out of this one, since I'm trying to be objective.)</div></blockquote>The thing is though, you say this only because you are trying to be objective. You basically conceded that all religions are equally valid (of course I would say equally invalid). Most religions do not teach that all religions are equally valid. Most religions teach that their religion is the true religion. I disagree that those who approach religion tend to be redeemed (mostly because I'm not sure what redemption is). Can religion make people feel better? Sure. But as I mentioned before, I feel that truth (as much as can be determined by evidence and reason) is more important than comfort.<br><br>If so many incompatible religions can achieve the same results, shouldn't we consider some other explanation for those results? I'm not saying that I have the answer. I'm saying that we should just admit we don't know yet and continue searching for the answer.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SturmDerSchatten:</div><div class="quote_body">Not everyone has the tenacity and passion to search for the atheistic version of "truth". You have to understand that in this case, Science is the main instrument for revealing that truth, and Science is not a good friend of the people. Why? For one, it is elitist and arrogant. If you're not someone important, or if you don't have a good background, no one's going to take you seriously. Second, Science does not have the appeal of religion, where everyone is made to feel blessed and important. In fact, many are intimidated by Science, and perhaps, that is why they avoid it. Third, Science is very technical, meaning you're going to need a lot of training to even know what is going on.</div></blockquote>But that's irrelevant. The truth (as we can determine by evidence and science - damn it's getting tiring typing the whole thing each time) is absolute. It's not a matter of whether we like it or not. I don't like the truth that I can't fly. I don't like the truth that drinkings lots of Coke makes me fat. That doesn't mean I can disbelieve it.<br><br>Christians (and other religious people) recognize this as well. I often get these arguments from Christians:<br><br>"You may not believe in God, but God believes in you." - I think this was from Constantine (movie) :lol<br><br>"You don't think Hell exists now. But you will believe when you are burning in it."<br><br>"You simply don't want to face up to the fact that you will be punished for your sins. But you will be punished."<br><br>I don't understand why people accuse atheists for rejecting evidence of the supernatural. Why would I do that? It's precisely because I understand the truth is independant of whether I like it or not, that I accept all good evidence. And it has to be GOOD evidence. Keep an open mind but not so open that your brains fall out.  I know that if something is true, I have to face the consequences regardless of whether I like it or not. I just paid my taxes. I don't like having to pay tax but I just can't believe I don't have to.<br><br>On a side note, the First Commandment should be re-written as "Thou shalt not mess with IRAS."<br><br>I agree that science can be technical and it is sometimes hard to understand. But it's the best tool for us to understand the universe in which we exist.<br><br>Isn't that why we are here debating in this forum? We want to understand why we believe what we believe. We don't want to believe something simply for the sake of belief. The fact we are able to engage in debate also means we are willing to question our own beliefs. Otherwise, that would be preaching. (I admit sometimes I sound like I'm preaching but honest - I don't intend to. :p )<br><br>We all have reasons for believing what we believe. Some Christians look at the world around them and see evidence of God in everything. That is their reason for belief. You have your reasons for being a Christian just as I have my reasons for being an atheist. Obviously, I feel my reasons are better than yours (or I would be a christian) and I am trying to convince you that your reasons for belief are not good reasons.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SturmDerSchatten:</div><div class="quote_body">This is a reality atheists have to accept, that what they consider an unproven theory of a higher being is more easily believed than hard, solid evidence.<br><br>For the second part, your analogy is a nice one. Allow me to use it to illustrate my point. If we take reason and logic to be a box, an open box, not a closed one. In this box are all the scientific truths and inventions and whatnot. Creativity in this sense is an unmovable object outside the box. We see it, and we decide we like it, and we want to have that object inside our box of reason and logic. In order to do so, someone has to approach that object with reason and logic (the very material is box is made of) and eventually, build the box up around that object. Then, we have a new theory, a new invention, a new innovation. That's how I see it works.<br><br>Religion doesn't exactly prevent creativity, rather, it restricts it because it is afraid of what creavtivity would do. It's like a reluctant mother with her child at the playground. She's afraid of the things at the place, because she is afraid her child would get hurt. What she doesn't realize is, that the child can learn from injuries and pain. Religion means well; it's just that we feel very restricted by it, and that is why we are unhappy with it.</div></blockquote>My view of creativity is that indeed we do make the box bigger - but from the inside not outside. Taking the box as the representation of our natural world, I don't believe there is an outside.</div>

There are many far worse.</div></blockquote>It is very dangerous to read the bible so literally all the time. For the uninformed, the bible is not one continuous piece of writing. It is made up of 73 'books', written by different authors at different times to different audiences. Some of these books are biographies, some are letters; others are poems, songs, laws etc. The bible is a complex collection of writings and one needs to interpret them properly, having in mind the context and audience whom the author was addressing. <strong>For the record, Christianity does not teach the amputation of limbs for wrong doing</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But coming back to the original topic, my view is that science and religion have each made important contributions to mankind and both have also been mis-used to devastating efffects. Because of scientific advances, I can now hope to live to 70/80 years on average, I can communicate with a friend half way across the world with the press of a few buttons, I have clean drinking water and can eat meat every day. Religion does not provide these things but it never sought to do so.<br><br>Instead, religion (Christianity in my case) has taught me about the existence of an afterlife; it has given hope to prisoners of war living in the most wretched of circumstances, enabling them to survive when they should logically have died, it has given hope to many a wayward youth who were saved from a lifetime of crime and waste. When I holidayed in Greece, the guide told us that it was religion (Greece is 90% eastern orthodox) which held the nation together during their darkest moments (Turkish occupation etc). Science does not help in such situations, but it was never meant to be put to such uses.<br><br>So the bottomline is that it is pointless to try to determine whether science or religion have made greater contributions to mankind.
