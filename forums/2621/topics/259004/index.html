            <div class='col-md body'>So correct me if I"m wrong.<br><br>You're trying to show that science has contributed a lot more to our world than religion.<br><br>I don't think this is a useful comparison.<br><br>1. It's not possible to fully list what science has contributed. I don't think anyone would disagree that science has contributed a lot to our understanding.<br><br>2. The issue is, "is science the only way we can understand the world". Some would argue that science and religion address two different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould#Non-Overlapping_Magisteria_.28NOMA.29" rel="nofollow">magisteria</a>. You cannot compare the contributions of science and religion because they are not addressing the same problems/issues.<br><br>So I think we could go on forever listing the contributions of science but it won't really convince anyone.</div>

But does anyone?<br><br>Christianity is also exploding in Africa. You could say that Africa is the most 'true' Christian country right now. African Christianity is deeply fundamentalist. Are they now the standard of morality?<br><br>Jesus said:<br><br>"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you."

And as we mentioned before, it's hard to define what "morally bankrupt" means when we can't even properly define the standards of morality. To a large degree, moral standards are simply based on what principles you value more.<br><br>For example, if you could kill 1 person to save 10, would it be right for those 10 people to kill the one? Do the rights of the group trump the rights of the individual?<br><br>So if you value individual rights more, the answer is no. If you value group rights more, the answer is yes.<br><br>Religion in most cases fails as a moral compass as well.<br><br>In Mark 9:43, "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched."<br><br>This is moral?<br><br>And this is just one example.
