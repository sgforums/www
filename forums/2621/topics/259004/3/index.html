Meaning in things like his emotions, memories and this thing called love are just chemical reactions and things illusions set up by nature to produce urges to enable the species to reproduce and survive.<br><br>There is no law of reason or how to behave, there never was. This talk of "improving" the human race through reason and logic is as meaningless as talking about finding a way to make grey rocks red or blue... in the end it all does not matter.<br><br>At the end of the day, it's the person with the strongest will and the means to implement it who has the right of way in our universe. Is there anything wrong with a black hole consuming a star? Is there anything wrong with a spider feeding on a fly?<br><br>This so-called instinct to do "good" for our species is just that: another instinct that we are no worse or better off listening to. Kill or feed the beggar on the street... it makes no difference. Everything is just atoms and our emotions and urges are simply chemical reactions and movements of atoms within us.<br><br>If we are to free ourselves from nature and become true supermen, we must overcome this need for "reason and logic", and look to the self to find the way to be the most powerful with what we have and where we are.<br><br>Survival of the fittest, winners win.

Reason and logic is an illusion in a godless universe where the individual, and the individual alone must make his will and his way. That would be the true atheist, the person who has travelled the long road and reached the natural, and complete conclusion of atheism.<br><br>Such a person, and such a person alone is the real atheist, the liberated human, the superman, not the weak, betterment-of-humanity "athiests" we have today.<br><br>Isn't atheism such a brave way of thinking? Too bad so many people distort it nowadays to some poor parody of the real thing, and think they are "free"... as if having equally illusionary things like "logic" and "reason" had set them free from anything. They are still under the wills of stronger wills, still under the slave mentality to systems above them set up by other masters who have put them in place for some purpose beyond the individual. And they can't even see past this illusion and consider themselves free, when it is but another religion.<br><br>Fortunately, I don't subscribe to atheism.</div>

HereÂ’s a good example.<br><br><blockquote>But gee... I'm an atheist and I am able to think beyond myself. I know that once I die, there is no meaning to my life beyond what meaning other people make of it. And even though I won't be around to appreciate it, it doesn't matter. After all, I won't be around.</blockquote>Notice the use of the word Â“appreciateÂ”, as if it was any justification for Â“thinking beyond the selfÂ”. At the end of the day, this emotion and thought of Â“appreciationÂ” is but a movement of chemicals in the brains of others that can take whatever meaning anybody should see fit, if they are brave enough to be the superman, to impose upon it.<br><br><blockquote>I don't think there is any inherent meaning in this universe. Yes, winners win. The strong survive. There is no 'good' and 'bad' other than what we make of it. We bring our definitions of 'good' and 'bad' into this universe. You seem to be saying that a true atheist would be incapable of thinking beyond himself.</blockquote>How can you seem to grasp the truth of your Â“ideologyÂ” in one sentence and then lose it by the end of the paragraph.<br><br>I am not saying a true atheist is incapable of thinking beyond himself, that is an arbitrary value judgement that you have thrown up from who knows where, and itÂ’s certainly not from the naturalistic laws of atheism.<br><br>The true atheists is not incapable of thinking beyond himself, what he realizes is that, such a question in itself is quite irrelevant as long as he has the power and will to make this question matter to him or not. Being incapable of thinking beyond oneself is neither wrong, nor right.<br><br>As you said it yourself, there is no inherent meaning in this universe and winners win. There is no right or wrong, good or bad in this universe. Even nonsense or lies are not inherently worst positions over having logic or truth, all that matters is if the individual (or system/memes) have the clout and power to make their own way about the universe. It is not selfish, selfishness is an illusion.<br><br>Hence the REAL atheist will realize (if he truly understand and believes his own idealogy) that the question of religion or if God exists of not or if all this is any Â“goodÂ” to the universe is quite irrelevant. In the true atheist mindset religion or the belief in some Devine being is neither inferior or superiorÂ… itÂ’s just a system that has gathered so much will and power through its very nature that it carries on to survive and prosper today.<br><br>The supposed Â“deathÂ” and Â“negativeÂ” points brought out by religion are arbitrary value judgements that differ from person to person and quite irrelevant as far as how much power the individuals who have their pet opinions have the power to affect their will.<br><br>The superman is beyond logic and reason and his own opinion. It is the pseudo-atheist who admits that the universe and all of humanityÂ’s endeavours are simply constructs and illusions, vulgarities of perception created by a feeble human intellection trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose, all of it as artificial as the Matrix itself in one breath, and then retreats to his own pet philosophy of Â“logic and reasonÂ” as if it has any more insipid value then a peculiar arrangement and movement of atoms in his brain. He is no different from the first primitive man who invented his own god out of the blue and decided to structure his life about it.<br><br>What you bring and make of this world is quite irrelevant, what only matters is if you have the will and power to implement it. It is the superman, the true and brave atheist and not the modern secretly religious Â“atheistÂ” that is a poor parody of the true meaning of atheism, that has the true power to do it.<br></div>
