Knowledge and real work, not praying, will increase his chances of safety.<br><br>If you are mature and realistic enough you will know that praying does not really change the situation. When that happens, you will then have the awareness to try to solve whatever concerns you have head on.<br><br>This is real work, involves thinking and effort that is why people subconsciouly avoid facing their problems and turn to praying. It uses less brain cell if all u have to do is routine acts of offering and acts of devotions.</div>
