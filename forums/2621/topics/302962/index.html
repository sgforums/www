You vigorously deny the existence of God, yet you frequently blame Him for all the "evils" in the world, all the natural disasters, and everything else under the sun that is wrong in modern society.<br></strong><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Most atheists however, do not blame god for anything because atheists don't believe that god exists. We don't blame anything for natural disasters. And as for the ills of modern society, if there's anyone to blame, it's probably people.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>9. You feel insulted and "dehumanized" when creationists say that people were created in the image and likeness of God, but you have no problem with the evolutionist claim that we all evolved from slime by a cosmic accident.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Creationist strawman argument. Atheists do not feel dehumanized when creationists say that people were created in the image and likeness of God. We just point out that saying "godddidit" is an unnecessary and completely useless hypothesis. And although it's not exactly accurate to say "we all evolved from slime by a cosmic accident", that's still a better hypothesis than "goddidit".<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>8. You criticize fundamental Christians who believe the Bible, and say that it can't possibly be true because it's just a book written <strong>by mere men, yet you never question any of Darwin's writings or Richard Dawkins' books.</strong><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Er... the Origin of Species is a good scientific book to read because it tells you how Charles Darwin came to his conclusions. However, it is outdated now. Most of the claims he made based on what he observed was true. Our understanding and science have progressed a lot since then.<br><br>Newton misunderstood the nature of gravity, but that doesn't change what he observed about gravity and he wasn't wrong in his observations. His theory was refined over the years and Einstein revolutionized our understanding of it.<br><br>But guess what, Einstein also did not have the complete picture. We still don't really understand gravity. However, that does not lessen the contribution of both men.<br><br>Science is all about questioning. Science places evidence first. There is overwhelming evidence for evolution. Overwhelming.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>7. You can't seem to understand the primary differences between fundamental Muslims and fundamental Christians (hint: strap-on TNT. Plus - Muhammad says, Â“kill innocent people and yourself if you love me.Â” Jesus Christ said, Â“IÂ’ll die for you because I love youÂ”).<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>And how many people have been killed in the name of Jesus? (Hint: Albigensian Crusade) Also, the US military is full of fundamentalist christians.<br><br>But wait, you say, those are not "true christians". Funny how Christians always they they are "true christians" and everyone else isn't.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>6. You say the Bible is full of fairytales and fables, yet you believe all life forms including plants, trees, insects, birds, fish, reptiles and mammals evolved from one species into another - As if evolution isnÂ’t the biggest fairytale of them all.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>There is overwhelming evidence for evolution. Just because creationists claim that evolution is a fairytale doesn't make it so.<br><br>Evidence.</div>

You laugh at the Supernatural, even though scientists have calculated the odds of life forming by natural processes to be estimated less than 1 chance in 10 to the 40,ooo power Â– But you find nothing wrong with believing that billions of years full of random mutations would result in the impossible.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Sigh. This is a misapplication of the math and a misunderstanding of evolution. Mutation is random, however, evolution is not random. Anyway, I think I saw this creationist video before where they tried to "explain" the 10^40,000 thing. There's a good rebuttal to that. I'll try to find it.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>[b]4. You accuse fundamental Christians of being intolerant, judgmental and hateful, while you foam at the mouth calling them freaking lunatics, ignorant, weak-minded, stupid fundies, and hateful bigots.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>That's because fundamentalist Christians ARE all of the above.

You ignore scientific concepts like cause and effect, and you don't realize that a closed system can be defined however the observer wants, so you throw out technological phrases to try to ignore the implications of thermodynamics by saying the laws of physics are not set in stone.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Huh? I thought it's the religious that think that supernatural magical being routinely violates the laws of physics.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>2. While all evidence, logic and reasoning point to a Creator and absolute truth, you prefer to hide behind relativism and a theory of evolution which does not, in fact, describe the creation of the universe at all, or why concepts of good and evil or morality exist.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Er... what evidence, logic and reasoning?<br><br>Also, the theory of evolution has nothing to do with the theories on the origin of the universe. For that matter, the theory of evolution makes no comment about how life came about.<br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>1. Atheism fails to adequately explain the existence of eternal, unchanging truths, for it rejects the existence of an eternal unchanging mind. Atheism cannot offer man any eternal significance whatsoever. Temporary meaning in life is insufficient, for our accomplishments die with the death of the universe -- there is no ultimate purpose in a universe void of God.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>How do you define "eternal, unchanging truths"? Is there such thing as an eternal unchanging mind?<br><br>Atheism is just recognizing the world as it is, based on evidence. It's not intended to offer man any eternal significance.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>You accuse fundamental Christians of being intolerant, judgemental and hateful, while you foam at the mouth calling them freaking lunatics, ignorant, weak-minded, stupid fundies, and hateful bigots.</blockquote>I don't remember accusing Christians of being lunatics, freaks, ignorant, or stupid. Put it this way... it is not the faithful but the faith, how 'bout that? I detest the concept of such faiths, and yes, I detest the way these religions confuse the masses. Yep, religion do teach people to do good. What else? I remember fairy tales like Pinnochio also teaches people to do good by being honest. So you see, religion is one alternative, but it may not be the best solution to everything.<br><br><blockquote>Atheism fails to adequately explain the existence of eternal, unchanging truths, for it rejects the existence of an eternal unchanging mind.</blockquote>This is common sense. I don't accept something that is completely absolute. My world isn't just black and white, it is filled with definitions and subjects of possibilities and opinions. It is, simply put, relativity among the absolutes.<br><br><blockquote>Atheism cannot offer man any eternal significance whatsoever. Temporary meaning in life is insufficient, for our accomplishments die with the death of the universe -- there is no ultimate purpose in a universe void of God.</blockquote>Temporary living condition in this world filled with uncertainty is not a limitation to our escape from reason. It is an opportunity to make the best out of life, as much as we can, in order to live it to the fullest. My philosophy in life is very simple: Do the most conscious good, and the least conscious evil.. leave valuable contributions for future generations, as well as leaving behind a legacy or rather, some positive significance for those closer to me to remember.<br><br><blockquote>Atheism is just recognizing the world as it is, based on evidence. It's not intended to offer man any eternal significance.</blockquote>Who cares? Even death is a goal, I'd rather focus my life on doing things that would give me satisfaction, happiness, freedom, and lots of fun. Besides that, knowing that doing certain things that would make a difference in the lives of others, is something which others would remember, although I couldn't bring it with me to my grave, that would be more than enough for me.<br><br><blockquote>And who says the universe must have an ultimate purpose. Just because you want it to have a purpose, doesn't mean there is one.</blockquote>There is no ultimate purpose. Our purpose is not given by God. It is formed by our belief system - our individual beliefs based upon individual differences. Beliefs shape our action, and action would then shape our future or destiny. The reason that we all have different destiny, is also partly because we are different individuals holding different values, principles, and beliefs about ourselves and others. Therefore, we do not need a purpose to be happy, as it is not our main concern or priority in life. Rather, we need to first examine the things which we value the most, such as our belief system.</div>
