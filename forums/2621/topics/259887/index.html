I won't go into those right now but they should be pretty easy to find. I do agree though that on the historical debate, due to the uncertainty of historical research, there is no general consensus on whether a historical Jesus existed unlike say in the field of biology where an overwhelming number of biologists accept the fact of evolution.<br><br>There is also another argument I heard that goes something like "there is as much evidence for Jesus as there is for Caesar." I'll try to give a quick example of the argument. It goes something like this:<br><br>If we apply the same standard of historical evidence to Jesus and Caesar, we cannot be sure that Caesar existed as well though we accept that Caesar existed as a fact. Also, we assume that certain events happened like "Caesar crossed the Rubicon" when there is no historical account that actually described it.<br><br>This argument has also been addressed to show how there is a lot more evidence for Caesar than there is for a historical Jesus.<br><br>As always, I ask you not to take what I say on faith, but to examine the evidence yourself.<br><br></div>

It's just that some people choose to believe that there is a cosmic purpose in their existence.</div></blockquote>While I agree with your sentiment in principle, I fear that things are not so simple. I know from your other posts that you already agree with me on this but I'll elaborate for the sake of discussion.<br><br>Each individual does not live in isolation, but as part of a larger group and universe that we interact with. This necessitates that we have some shared beliefs. And of course, the fundamental standard of any shared believe would be the truth. Atheists/materialists/naturalists believe that the way to discover  the truth is through science and reason. Religious people believe that the truth can be revealed through supernatural means.<br><br>In most cases, we don't really care what other people believe unless it affects us. Unfortunately, most beliefs affect how one behaves, in which turn affects others.<br><br>For example, I may believe I am God and you were born to serve me. You wouldn't care if I believed that unless I actually expected you to serve me. In which case you would probably show me the middle finger and ask me to F off.<br><br>The advantage of using science and evidence as the standard of determining truth is that everyone can agree on it. Obviously, science is not always right - we sometimes misinterpret evidence - but it's the best we can do. We all see and observe the same things. For religious interpretation, anything goes.<br><br>You said that some just believe there's a cosmic purpose in their existence. If religious people left it at that, I wouldn't have a problem. However, religious people believe in things like the Great Commission that makes it a religious obligation for them to force their beliefs on others. Let's not even get into Islam.<br><br>Religion is also so fundamental to belief systems that many times, people don't even realize that their belief is religious in nature. For example, the issue of pornography and prostitution. Why is pornography illegal? Why is prostitution frowned upon. Personally, I think if a guy wants sex, it is more moral for him to go to a prostitute than to lie to a girl to get sex. What is the basis for monogamy too? Why is sex outside of marriage frowned upon. We could go on to many other issues. Abortion. Euthanasia. Stem-cell research. Drugs. Blasphemy. Apostasy. The list goes on.<br><br>I've said this many times but I totally disagree with the characterization that I try to convert people to atheism. Atheism is not a belief system. What I advocate is people should belief things for a reason and that reason should be  science and evidence as that is the ONLY basis of common understanding.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To illustrate how science and reason is a basis of common understanding.<br><br>I am Chinese, I can look to a Malay person and say, "My God says that Chinese are superior to Malays."<br><br>A Malay person can look at a Chinese person and say, "My God says that Malays are better than Chinese."<br><br>There is no basis of common understanding here except to agree to disagree. That makes a mockery of both beliefs. There is no point saying you are superior if you can't do anything about it.<br><br>But science looks at the evidence and tells us: Biologically, there is no such thing as race. Racial characteristics are a continuum of phenotypes where there is no clear cut distinction. There is no absolute physical standard you can point to and say "you are chinese" and "you are malay". Therefore, you are both equally human.</div>
