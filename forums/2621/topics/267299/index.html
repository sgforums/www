[b](See Fiction Five)</strong>[/b]</blockquote>I missed the second day of the talk. I was actually a bit disappointed when I attended it. I was led to believe it was going to be a presentation or lecture but it turned out to be some kind of worship session followed by a brief presentation of their arguments.<br><br>I don't recall them saying anything about the numbers adding up to 666 though I do recall they mentioned the numbers. I don't really remember in what context they mentioned it.<br><br>I also don't recall them mentioning anything about the tiara though it might have been mentioned during the second day.<br><br>I won't attempt to present their views as  I am wholly unqualified to do so, and any attempt would do it an injustice.<br><br>The point I was trying to make is that even within christianity itself, there are many views. Many of those views are not compatible with one another.<br><br>Just to make things clear, I don't think the Pope is the antichrist any more than I think Jesus the myth (as opposed to Jesus the man whom I suspect may actually have existed as a historical figure) existed.</div>
