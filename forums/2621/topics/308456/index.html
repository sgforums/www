              <p class="textBodyBlack">BEIRUT,
              Lebanon - A leading human rights group appealed to Saudi Arabia's King
              Abdullah on Thursday to stop the execution of a woman accused of
              witchcraft and performing supernatural acts.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The
              New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement that the
              kingdom's religious police who arrested and interrogated Fawza Falih,
              and the judges who tried her in the northern town of Quraiyat never
              gave her the opportunity to prove her innocence in the face of "absurd
              charges that have no basis in law."</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Falih's
              case underscores shortcomings in Saudi Arabia's Islamic legal system in
              which rules of evidence are shaky, lawyers are not always present and
              sentences often depend on the whim of judges.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The
              most frequent victims are women, who already suffer severe restrictions
              on daily life in Saudi Arabia: They cannot drive, appear before a judge
              without a male representative, or travel abroad without a male
              guardian's permission.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack"><strong>What's the crime?</strong><br>Witchcraft is considered an offense against Islam in the conservative kingdom.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">In
              Falih's case, the judges who convicted her in April 2006 relied on a
              coerced confession and on the statements of witnesses who said she had
              "bewitched" them, according to the group.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Falih
              retracted her confession in court, claiming it was extracted under
              duress, and said that as an illiterate woman, she did not understand
              the document she was forced to fingerprint.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"The
              fact that Saudi judges still conduct trials for unprovable crimes like
              'witchcraft' underscores their inability to carry out objective
              criminal investigations," said Joe Stork, Middle East director at Human
              Rights Watch.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">There was no immediate
              comment on the statement from Saudi Arabia, where government offices
              are closed on Thursdays, the start of the Muslim weekend.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">"Fawza
              Falih's case is an example of how the authorities failed to comply even
              with existing safeguards in the Saudi justice system," he added.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The
              Saudi court cited an instance in which a man allegedly became impotent
              after being bewitched by Falih, the rights group said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">An
              appeals court ruled in September 2006 that Falih could not be sentenced
              to death for witchcraft because she had retracted her confession. But a
              lower court subsequently reissued the death sentence for the benefit of
              "public interest" and to "protect the creed, souls and property of this
              country," the group's statement said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack"><strong>Forced divorce<br></strong>Human
              Rights Watch's statement came a day after Yakin Erturk, the U.N.
              special investigator for violence against women, wrapped up a 10-day
              visit to Saudi Arabia during which she highlighted another
              controversial case that has attracted international criticism.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Ertuk
              met with Fatima and Mansour al-Timani, who were forcibly divorced by
              the wife's family on grounds she had married someone from a lesser
              tribe.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The couple learned of the divorce on Feb. 25, 2006, when police knocked on their door to serve Mansour the divorce papers.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">At
              a news conference on Wednesday, Erturk said she met the wife and
              husband who were in a "terrible state of mind" and that Saudi officials
              had promised her arrangements would be made for the couple's reunion,
              according to Saudi newspaper Arab News.</p>
