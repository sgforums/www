            <div class='col-md body'>I read that christianity is derived from philosophers from a passage in the website below:<br><br>Stoicism was one of the most important and influential traditions in the philosophy of the Hellenistic world. It claimed the adherence of a large portion of the educated persons in the Graeco-Roman world. It had considerable influence on the development of early Christianity. The Roman Stoics, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius were widely read and absorbed by the Western cultural tradition. Indeed, the very word 'stoic' has, in the popular sense, become synonymous with 'philosophical' and has come to represent that courage and calmness in the face of adverse and trying circumstances which was the hallmark of the ancient Stoics.<br><br>Anyone has opinions about what give rise to christianity?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>more interesting things about stoicism beliefs.. i was reading about stoicism fyi<br><br>In logic, the Stoics developed the logic of propositions more recently formalized by Frege and Bertrand Russell. Chrysippus was recognized by his contemporaries as the equal of Aristotle in logic. Stoic epistemology was decidedly empiricist and nominalist in spirit. They rejected both Plato's and Aristotle's notions of form. There are no abstract universals, either apart from particulars, as Plato would have it, or in particular substances, as Aristotle held. Only particular things exist and our knowledge of them is based on the impressions they make upon the soul. Our knowledge of particular objects is therefore based on sense perception, as is our knowledge of our mental states and activities, our soul itself being a material thing</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this paragraph talks about how philosophical stuff were borrowed and modified into christian stuff.<br><br>Metaphysically, the Stoics were materialists. While all that exists is material, nevertheless there are two principles of reality. The passive principle is matter devoid of quality. Borrowing from Heraclitus, the Stoics identified the active principle of reality with the Logos, Reason, or God. Unlike later Christian versions, the Stoic view of the Logos is both materialistic and pantheistic. God has no existence distinct from the rational order of nature and should not be construed as a personal, transcendent deity of the sort essential to later Western theism.<br><br>anywhere here is the source<br><a href="http://www2.evansville.edu/ecoleweb/articles/stoicism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www2.evansville.edu/ecoleweb/articles/stoicism.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The below quote is fascinating indeed... and i shall declare it as quote of the day<br><br>The life of virtue is the life in accordance with nature. Since for the Stoic nature is rational and perfect, the ethical life is a life lived in accordance with the rational order of things.<strong> "Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well"</strong><br><br>Anyway.. i have a forum on philosophy which has pretty no activity. Philosophy to me  is an ultra cool and fun stuff, with boring stuff throw in as well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
