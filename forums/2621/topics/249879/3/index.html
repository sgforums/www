            <div class='col-md body'>Hi jljl,<br><br>Thank you for your comments. I will write a more considered reply at a later time but I would like to point out that your arguments are only compelling if one first accepts the existence of god and the validity of scripture.<br><br>I have read many apologetics books. Lee Strobel's "The Case for Faith", "The Case for Christ", and "The Case for a Creator". I have also read C. S. Lewis' "Mere Christianity" as well as countless others. (No choice, my Christian friends keep making the effort of lending me the books so I sort of feel I owe it to them to read. It does take up a lot of time though.)<br><br>One problem with all those books is that they use scripture as evidence. Even in Strobel's "The Case for a Creator" which argues simply that the universe exhibits signs of intelligent design and implies a creator, it is clear that all the authors believe the creator is the christian god. I find it's a bit dishonest actually and it's another example of the "wedge" strategy where they first try to get you to agree on one thing so they can pull you further.<br><br>SturmDerSchatten,<br><br>I feel that God is beyond understanding is a weak argument, though of course, you disagree (or you wouldn't use that argument). Answering a mystery with another mystery is no answer at all.<br><br>Attempts to reconcile the nature of god has resulted in thousands of judeo-christian denominations. I would even argue there are millions of christian denominations as I have yet to met two christians who share the same exact belief.<br><br>The most common response to questions I raise is, "oh that's not TRUE christianity", or "oh but that's not what I believe." So what is the truth then? Who am I to believe?<br><br>If you accept the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism" rel="nofollow">Calvinist</a> view, I'm not one of the 'elect' chosen to be saved. How does one reconcile that with an all loving god? Oh right. We can't understand god.<br><br>Yet you want me to believe that god gave me the ability to reason, but at the same time denied me the ability to understand him. God wants me to worship him even though he has given me no evidence that he exists. God wants blind obedience and faith.<br><br>You want me to believe God revealed himself to us in a book so badly written that countless wars and untold amounts of blood have been spilled over it. You want me to believe that God, after thousands of years of blood and slaughter that he commanded, decided to forgive us. But no, he couldn't just forgive us. He has to send himself down to Earth and sacrifice himself to himself so wash away our sins.<br><br>My friends often ask me, "why are you angry with god?" or "what prayer did god not answer?" or "why do you resent god so much?"<br><br>I find it hard to answer that question because the answer is obvious to me but they cannot understand it.<br><br>I don't resent god. I don't believe that god exists. Simple as that. I don't hate or resent what does not exist. I don't deny god any more than I deny Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny or the flying spaghetti monster.<br><br>Why then, they ask, do you study the bible and read so much about Christianity? Doesn't that show that you believe? Doesn't that show that you are at least searching for god?<br><br>I read to understand why people believe and because I know my friends are sincere. I want to understand why they believe what they do.  I want to understand why people make decisions based on an ancient book written by an ancient culture, instead of fully relying on critical thinking and reason that the modern age has brought us.<br><br>But, they ask, in your discussions, you often assume that god exists. Doesn't that mean you at least believe in god in some way? Aren't you at least accepting the possibility that god exists?<br><br>God, as defined by Christians, is unfalsifiable. By definition, God cannot be proven not to exist.  You cannot prove a negative. You can only disprove positive claims. I always accept the possibility that god exists but you have to put it in context that I feel that possibility is lower than the possibility of a flying teapot orbiting jupiter.<br><br>It's also obvious to me that assuming that god exists for the sake of argument is in no way indicative of belief in god. It's just the logical argument technique   of reductio ad absurdum.<br><br>Okay. I went on longer than I intended. Time for bed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Ok. so i have a inspiration. Religion occurs because human is ignorance. The more wisdom you have, the less igonrance you have, and the more athetistic you will be.<br><br>Human ignorance is inevitable. We are evolved animal that has differentiated greatly from the animal in some aspects but still out brain is suspectible to certain percetual errors in life.<br><br>Such error leads to ignorance, especially with the rise of materialistic lifestyle that focuses on material happiness, out human ignorance is still there, such level of ignorance, or such not so high level of wisdom or reasoning is the reason why religion is able to survive.<br><br>unless we have all people going to read a basic course on philosophy, logic fallacies, psychology, atheism, science, history of all these subjects and finally make people to a person keen to improve his knowledge by himself<br><br>then our human ignorance level will not drop to the point where religion could no longer sustain itself.<br><br>i know religion also teach good things also in them like be kind and loving towards others, dun kill. but it contains errors also which has bad repercussion. therefore, as a whole, religion teaching is not efficient, particularly in creating in critical thinking students, and because religions believe in God , which is false for atheist, and this error in belief will then have repercussion.<br><br>so its better to teach good values to kids and people directly without religion perspective and encourage that to be skeptical thinker themselves.</div>

That is because your assumption and belief is that there is no God. If that was really the case, of course it would be amusing and sad to see so many 'deluded' people praying fervantly to something that does not exist.<br><br>But what if there was truly a God ? Then believing and worshipping God makes absolute sense and it would be sad to see people living in denial of God's existence (might not even be their fault, might have been because of bad experiences or bad role models). I have yet to read anything so far in this forum that proves conclusively that there is no God and I don't think I ever will (that's the nature of these things, we will only know for sure when we die; but that will be a little too late for us to post the answer in sgForums).<br><br>This reminds me of Pascal's Wager which is a simple but rather interesting argument from a Christian persepctive. Not sure if it has been posted before but it goes something like this.<br><br>Pascal's Wager<br><br>Either there is a God or there is no God. So we have two options, to believe in God or not to believe, what will our wager be ? For self preservation, the only logical course of action is to bet that God exists because you have nothing to lose; Atheism is a bad bet.<br><br>Why ? Because if God does not exist, it wouldn't matter how we bet - whether we believe or not; there is no existence after death anyway. BUT if there is indeed a God, we risk losing eternal happiness by refusing to believe. (Remember that Pascal was coming from a Christian perspective of God and life/death)<br><br>And we cannot put this decision off forever as all of us will die one day.<br><br>But is it worth the price to bet that God exists ? Well, it is reasonable to place a finite bet (giving up some autonomy, illicit pleasures etc while we are on this planet) on the chance of winning an infinite prize - happiness in eternity.<br><br>But what if you find it impossible to believe in the 'nonsense' of God ? Pascal suggested that the prospective convert "act into" his belief if he cannot yet "act out" of it. In other words, live good lives and be open to God; living the faith can be a way of eventually getting the faith.<br><br>I am certainly not suggesting that we should believe in God only as a 'bet'. It is neither a mature nor an adequate faith, but for those in the deepest pits of unbelief, it offers a first step out of that pit and we can only pray that they will eventually respond positively to God's love.<br><br>(Some material reproduced from www.catholiceducation.org)</div>

I quote something from Pirates of the Carribean: "If a decision is made for the wrong reasons, then it is a bad decision."<br><br>Of course, that argument is valid. Take a moment, however, to think about how the three most influential monotheistic religions of Christianity, Islam and Jewism still exist till today, whereas the gods of what we call "mythology" have faded into antiquity.<br><br>Now, you may argue that it's because of politics and state policies that keep those three in place, but let's consider for a moment religion untainted by politics and social manipulation. For them to still exist, there has to be some other reason that keeps them alive and so powerful even till today, right?<br><br>And another thing, I notice plenty of atheists (note: I didn't say ALL) like to use words like "limited vision", "uneducated", "guesswork" and "stunted logic".
