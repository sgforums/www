Take a moment, however, to think about how the three most influential monotheistic religions of Christianity, Islam and Jewism still exist till today, whereas the gods of what we call "mythology" have faded into antiquity.<br><br>Now, you may argue that it's because of politics and state policies that keep those three in place, but let's consider for a moment religion untainted by politics and social manipulation.

However, the methods that its followers used to get into this position isn't all that glorifying.

Evidence? Of course, killing others to convert them to your side is atrocious. But then again, the Bible has been misinterpreted by human minds over and over the centuries, and perhaps so, has led to much blood being spilled in the name of religion.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If u insist that becoz of the violence and atrocities commited by the powerful in the past resulting in the situation we have today is a sign of God's will or a prove of his greatness, then i have to say it is indeed a fact that the 3 great monotheistic religions form the majority in the world today.

Luckily they were not wiped out. Does their existence today prove anything to you? Or have we forgotten the "other" religions altogether?</strong></blockquote>Of course, I know they exist. i was just raising the three monothestic religions as an example. One reason why they've not been converted: The regions which used Buddhism as the state religion were relatively free from the reaches of the three monothestic religions. Even if there were missionaries, most of them were persecuted and exiled.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>As for Greek Myths, it was smart of them to chose the word "myth" to escape being destroyed, becoz i must say i really enjoy reading greek myths today.</strong></blockquote>Greek "myths" died along with the Greek Empire when the Romans took over. They just romanized it to a great extent to fit their own purposes.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Regarding my comment about Pascal having a very limited mindset, i do not see how my choice of words is wrong (if you are contesting that)? We have to consider why Pascal came out with the "wager", and his lack of consideration that other religions can claim the same.</strong></blockquote>Not contesting your choice of words, it's just an interesting observation I've made regarding the way atheists argue.</div>

No argument is foolproof, pro-atheism ones included. The same applies to Pascal's wager; but despite its flaws, it is an interesting thought which atheists would do well to think about.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<br><strong>to counter it lets instead use my january wager.<br><br>"do you think if god exist, he would let human so easily go to heaven by just believeing in him. believing is easy and convinent to the uncritical mind. Choosing not to believe in god because there is no good reasons and evidence and staying not to believe reflects courage.<br>If god exist, he would certainly choose those that do not believe in god due to lack of evidence to be with him because god needs courage and wise people to be with him.<br>Do you think choosing to believe in god means that you have a 99 percent chance of going to heaven.<br>bewteen believing and not believing. the chance is actually 50 percent of each of going to heaven [b]if god exist </strong>. </blockquote>Wow, for someone who does not believe in God, you certainly seem to know a lot about how God thinks and acts, the type of people he likes and the virtues needed to go to heaven. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

If ye put the question from within Time and are asking about possibilities, the answer is certain. The choice of ways is before you. Neither is closed. Any man may choose eternal death. Those who choose it will have it. But if ye are trying to leap on into Eternity, if ye are trying to see the final state of all things as it will be (for so ye must speak) when there are no more possibilities left but only the Real, then ye ask what cannot be answered to mortal ears. Time is the very lens through which ye see Â— small and clear, as men see through the wrong end of a telescope Â— something that would otherwise be too big for ye to see at all. That thing is Freedom: the gift whereby ye most resemble your Maker and are yourselves parts of eternal reality. But ye can see it only through the lens of Time, in a little clear picture, through the inverted telescope. It is a picture of moments following one another and yourself in each moment making some choice that might have been otherwise. Neither the temporal succession nor the phantom of what ye might have chosen and didn't is itself Freedom. They are a lens. The picture is a symbol: but it's truer than any philosophical theorem (or, perhaps, than any mystic's vision) that claims to go behind it. For every attempt to see the shape of eternity except through the lens of Time destroys your knowledge of Freedom." </span></div>
