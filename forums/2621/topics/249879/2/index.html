            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ispyyy:</div><div class="quote_body">Therefore, there is some kinds of teaching called spiritual help that enable ones to break this mental barrier. For example,<br>when you are in pain, it reduces yr suffering,<br>when you face problem, it gives u strenght,<br>when you face fear, it gives u courage,<br>when you face death, it gives u the power to see beyond life and death,<br>and many many many things</div></blockquote>But you missed out one thing - there is no evidence that 'spiritual help' exists.<br><br>Your argument seems to be that having an imaginary friend or false beliefs might make you happier. That's perhaps true for some people. For myself, I would rather have the truth.<br><br>The truth is more liberating than any fairy tale that anyone can make up.<br><br>This may not be relevant to many Singaporeans but I would make an analogy to belief in Santa Claus. Many children in the US believe in Santa Claus. Many parents view that belief as a symbol of innocence and they work hard to sustain that belief. They also try to hide it because they want to delay the sense of betrayal that their children feel when they find out that their parents were lying to them.<br><br>Which is better? Is it better for a child to believe that a magic jolly fat man comes down the chimney to deliver gifts? Or that your parents worked hard to get you a gift because they love you?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Of coz, spiritual help works much better than modern psychologic, medicine, code of laws and etc...<br>Therefore, it will be much a worry if there are less people who believe in god...</strong></blockquote>My friend, surely you must be joking! Spiritual help works better?<br><br>If you are sick, I hope you will go see a doctor rather than just pray that you will be cured. The world would be chaotic indeed if we did away with laws and relied on divine intervention for justice. Before modern science brought us a better understanding of mental illness, we used to think that the mentally ill were possessed by demons or satan.<br><br>The worry we face nowadays is that the world seems to be becoming MORE religious not less. Of course, I'm not saying that abolishing religion would solve the world's problems. We will still fight. We will still have wars. But I certainly hope we will kill one another for better reasons than because an ancient book said so.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I am a freethinker but I am not an athesim... I learnt teachings from all kinds of religion. I never practice them devotely. From their different kinds of teachings, I form my own code. That is me.<br><br></strong></blockquote>You are an atheist then. All those religions you look at are mutually incompatible. In the three great monotheistic religions, the first commandment of God is:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me. "</span><br><br>It seems that though you are agnostic about the Christian, Islamic and Hebrew god, you don't have enough belief to take that commandment seriously.<br><br>You look at religion only from a philosophical viewpoint and you decide for yourself what is right and wrong. I commend you for that.<br><br>Certainly, I do think there are things that we can learn from religious scripture. However, we should not attribute any divine inspiration to scripture. We should treat scripture as we would any piece of literature. We should use our ability to reason to evaluate its value so we can decide for ourselves what is right and wrong.</div>
