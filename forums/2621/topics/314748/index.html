              <p>Very entertaining story.</p>
              <p><a title="http://rationalistinternational.net/article/2008/20080310/en_1.html" href="http://rationalistinternational.net/article/2008/20080310/en_1.html">http://rationalistinternational.net/article/2008/20080310/en_1.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="iparagraph">On 3 March 2008, in a popular TV show, Sanal
              Edamaruku, the president of Rationalist International, challenged
              India’s most “powerful” tantrik (black magician) to demonstrate his
              powers on him. That was the beginning of an unprecedented experiment.
              After all his chanting of mantra (magic words) and ceremonies of tantra
              failed, the tantrik decided to kill Sanal Edamaruku with the “ultimate
              destruction ceremony” on live TV. Sanal Edamaruku agreed and sat in the
              altar of the black magic ritual. India TV observed skyrocketing
              viewership rates.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Everything started, when Uma
              Bharati (former chief minister of the state of Madhya Pradesh) accused
              her political opponents in a public statement of using tantrik powers
              to inflict damage upon her. In fact, within a few days, the unlucky
              lady had lost her favorite uncle, hit the door of her car against her
              head and found her legs covered with wounds and blisters.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">India TV, one of India’s major
              Hindi channels with national outreach, invited Sanal Edamaruku for a
              discussion on “Tantrik power versus Science”. Pandit Surinder Sharma,
              who claims to be the tantrik of top politicians and is well known from
              his TV shows, represented the other side. During the discussion, the
              tantrik showed a small human shape of wheat flour dough, laid a thread
              around it like a noose and tightened it. He claimed that he was able to
              kill any person he wanted within three minutes by using black magic.
              Sanal challenged him to try and kill him.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">The tantrik tried. He chanted
              his mantras (magic words): “Om lingalingalinalinga, kilikili….” But his
              efforts did not show any impact on Sanal – not after three minutes, and
              not after five. The time was extended and extended again. The original
              discussion program should have ended here, but the “breaking news” of
              the ongoing great tantra challenge was overrunning all program
              schedules.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Now the tantrik changed his technique. He started sprinkling water on
              Sanal and brandishing a knife in front of him. Sometimes he moved the
              blade all over his body. Sanal did not flinch. Then he touched Sanal’s
              head with his hand, rubbing and rumpling up his hair, pressing his
              forehead, laying his hand over his eyes, pressing his fingers against
              his temples. When he pressed harder and harder, Sanal reminded him that
              he was supposed to use black magic only, not forceful attacks to bring
              him down. The tantrik took a new run: water, knife, fingers, mantras.
              But Sanal kept looking very healthy and even amused.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">After nearly two hours, the
              anchor declared the tantrik’s failure. The tantrik, unwilling to admit
              defeat, tried the excuse that a very strong god whom Sanal might be
              worshipping obviously protected him. “No, I am an atheist,” said Sanal
              Edamaruku. Finally, the disgraced tantrik tried to save his face by
              claiming that there was a never-failing special black magic for
              ultimate destruction, which could, however, only been done at night.
              Bad luck again, he did not get away with this, but was challenged to
              prove his claim this very night in another “breaking news” live
              program.</p>
              <p>Millions of people must have uttered a sigh of relief in front their
              TVs. Sanal was very much alive. Tantra power had miserably failed.
              Tantriks are creating such a scaring atmosphere that even people, who
              know that black magic has no base, can just break down out of fear,
              commented a scientist during the program. It needs enormous courage and
              confidence to challenge them by actually putting one’s life at risk, he
              said. By doing so, Sanal Edamaruku has broken the spell, and has taken
              away much of the fear of those who witnessed his triumph.</p>
              <p>In this night, one of the most dangerous and wide spread superstitions in India suffered a severe blow.</p>

              <p>The only ghost that you see, hear resides in your mind. Its does not reside in reality. But we know that if you believe in something enuff in your brain, you will create the experience of seeing it for real. THat is the tendency of the brain.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Thats very dangerous thing to do. I have read about some people in the past having a strong determination that nothing can stop or harm the person. I read from my own religion that once theres one guy who told people to stop worshipping a God and plot their own farm diligently, but that God was angry. He summoned storms, natural disasters and so on but in the end, the guy won because the God eventually realized that human should really get with business with their own lives. That is the more meaningful thing.</p></div>
