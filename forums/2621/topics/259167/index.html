Haven't really studied China history. </div></blockquote>This is from my two tears of studying sceondary school history, so forgive me if I make errors.<br><br>The Cultural Revolution was to consolidate the power base of Mao. Because of the fiasco of the Great Leap Forward (which Mao came up with and supported with great fervour), Mao's reputation had been soiled, and for the first time, it was shown that he was not the infallible Chairman so respected by the Chinese.<br><br>The purposes of the Cultural Revolution were as such:<br><br>1. To rid China of the old ways of thinking. What are the old ways of thinking? Well, they were the schools of thought of Confucius (Kong Zi) and Mencius (Meng Zi). To the CCP, these ways of thinking were dangerous for their communist ideals, because the old ways of thinking violated the Communist insistence on equality. Therefore, they had to purge China of her old 'culture' and start a new paradigm. An<br><br>2. To eliminate 'dangerous' political opponents. The word 'dangerous' here is used very liberally, as anyone considered an intellectual was a danger to Mao. These included teachers, scholars, scientists, monks, religious teachers and even students of universities. The doctrine then was to swiftly prevent these 'corrupt' people from influencing the young (and uneducated) minds of China. Some were sent to labour in industrial compounds. A great number were shot and executed in various means. To add insult to injury, they were often tried before 'The People's Court', where the common people would accuse them of mostly 'phoney' crimes such as planning to revolt against the Chairman and spreading the 'corrupt, Western' ideology to the people.<br><br>3. Return power to Mao, as I've mentioned earlier on. Actions taken were to heap enormous praise onto Mao, such as praising him for the simplest of things (e.g. for a successful performance, for a good showing at a sports event, even for a surplus of food) Sounds a lot like a monothestic religion, doesn't it? In fact, there was this thing called a 'Little Red Book' containg the 'Great Thoughts of the Great and Infallible Chairman Mao Ze Dong'. That's your equivalent of the Bible or the Q'uran.<br><br>The Cultural Revolution can be summed up in one simple sentence: Mao violated his own communist ideals and turned himself into the Emperor's equivalent, or even worse, a god.<br><br>This is one example of how atheism can get the better of a society. Now, I'm not saying that atheism is bad or evil; what I'm saying is, that one man utilized the lack of faith of the people to turn himself into an all powerful entity. Perhaps, belief in the deities and gods (which is commonplace in China) would have led the people to be less convinced that Mao was as great as he proclaimed: the equivalent of a messiah. We will never know.</div>

Joseph Smith,the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day saints claims to have received divine revelation. How do you determine if what he claims is true? When I attended City Harvest, I heard many people say, "God speaks through Pastor Kong."<br><br>And that really is my fundamental point. Even if you accept religion, which religion? Even within the umbrella term "Christianity", there are many denominations that are basically incompatible with one another.

            <div class='col-md body'>That is a measure of how much you trust the pastor, my friend, and sometimes I find it hard to believe as well. Oh, and the "God speaking through people" part, I believe it isn't meant to be taken literally. More like, it means that Pastor Kong speaks the word of God.<br><br>Evidence and reason... Well, they don't really work very well here, because you're talking about the basic human psyche, which is in fact a thing of the abstract and irrational. Logic and reason are more of social constructs created by humans to make sense of the often chaotic world around them. Evidence, which brings about knowledge, can be said to be the antithesis to faith. Lack of evidence brings about a need for faith. Lack of faith brings about a need for evidence.

We generally do not allow people who are mentally ill total freedom to make their own decisions. Their freedom is restricted based on the level of impairment.<br><br>Most of the time, we only restrict non-reversible actions. Eg. Suicide, amputation, disfigurement.<br><br>I do agree this is a judgment call at times. However, increasingly we allow people to do whatever they want with their bodies as long as we are convinced they are sure of their decision. So there's counseling, cooling-off periods, and other mechanisms to make sure the person is not making a rash decision.<br><br>There's an interesting disorder called Body Integrity Identity Disorder. People who suffer from this condition only feel 'whole' if they amputate their limbs. Every effort is made to discourage this but ultimately, if all other treatment fails, we allow the amputation to occur.<br><br>An article about this disorder can be found at http://www.slate.com/id/2085402/<br></div>
