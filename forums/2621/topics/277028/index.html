I'd give him a second chance, because there might be other reasons that might factor into his rudeness and intolerance. Things like Law and Psychology just don't work very well when viewed ONLY from an objective point of view. Perhaps you're right about religion factoring in. However, I seriously doubt the significance of it; to claim it is the one determining factor would be falling into the trap of the Straw Man fallacy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes but of course I'm not saying it's just one man. I'm use these as individual examples to what I believe is a systematic problem. The problem being unwarranted respect or consideration for religion.<br><br>To list all the examples is simply not possible as it is so pervasive. The unwarranted respect is the belief that religious people are somehow more moral than the non-religious. The unwarranted respect is the support and funding given to faith based initiatives. The unwarranted respect is giving tax exempt status to religious organizations.<br><br>With regards to the straw man argument, let's review the definition from Wikipedia:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. To "set up a straw man" or "set up a straw man argument" is to create a position that is easy to refute, then attribute that position to the opponent. A straw man argument can be a successful rhetorical technique (that is, it may succeed in persuading people) but it is in fact a misleading fallacy, because the opponent's actual argument has not been refuted.</span><br><br>First of all, it's not my fault that people of widely differing beliefs all call themselves Christians. In that respect, there's no such thing as 'true' Christianity, or one core set of beliefs beyond the belief that Jesus Christ is divine and died on the cross for the salvation of mankind. Now just because the interpretation that I attack is not your interpretation does not by any means make it a straw man attack because I am not misrepresenting the position of those I am attacking.<br><br>In fact, let's say if we were to accept there is a true Christianity, it would probably be Catholicism or the Evangelicals. They have the historical backing or the numbers to support them.</div>
