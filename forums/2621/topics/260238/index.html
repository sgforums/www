Â“In fact, the Pentagon has used it repeatedly and subsequently in an effort to promote non-lethal weapons, and in fact they submitted it to the highest scientific review body in the country for them to consider.Â”<br><br>Military officials insisted Friday to CBS 5 that they are not currently working on any such idea and that the past plan was abandoned.<br><br>Gay community leaders in California said Friday that they found the notion of a Â“gay bombÂ” both offensive and almost laughable at the same time.<br><br>Â“Throughout history we have had so many brave men and women who are gay and lesbian serving the military with distinction,Â” said Geoff Kors of Equality California. Â“So, itÂ’s just offensive that they think by turning people gay that the other military would be incapable of doing their job. And its absurd because thereÂ’s so much medical data that shows that sexual orientation is immutable and cannot be changed.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm... no real relationship to atheism. I just thought it was an interesting article. Perhaps the significance of this story is not really the 'gay' aspect. It's about making soliders so sexually aroused that they will screw pretty much anything? It just so happens it is highly likely they will be surronded by men? And perhaps the occasional farm animal?<br></div>
