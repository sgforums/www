              <p>Can we ever debate whether religion is right or wrong, which is right, which is more right and which does not make sense.</p>
              <p>We debate about all kinds of things like NTUC trolley, foreign workers, maid and politics. But when it comes to religion, we cannot debate and there is NO right or wrong in whatever religion you choose, always going by the reason of personal choice.</p>
              <p>However, religion is not merely a personal choice. It has overwhelming effect on community and world. Another way religion is immune from debate is its message of peace and interfaith respect and tolerance.</p>
              <p>Yes, peace, tolerance and respect is good virtues, most of the time, but we cannot always shield religion from debate about its truth of its belief and avoid talking, communicating, and discussing whether what they say about certain beliefs are true or myth, because giving these topic immunity status will affect the society because countries are not just physical stuff but also built upon mental belief of its people.</p>
              <p>We should not trivialise other religion, says SM goh.... I think... i can accept that... i did not ask people to trivialise... but appeal for more debate.... LIke any other topics or issues other than religion... we should not also trivialize the other party beliefs......</p>
              <p>ONE MAIN reason why religion dicussion on the truth of its beliefs and theories is not promoted by countries is because of the possiblity of racial riots, religions clashes, and violence outbreak.... I agree that historical and also in the present and future.. there were and will be many violence that may be due to disrespect for other religions and disagreements and the inability to contain people feelings. But to be worried by such fears of violence and thus do not debate about some parts of religion is just a time delaying tactic which does not solve a root problem and also create some troubles.</p>
              <p>When can a country have the maturity to discuss about religion, analyse it , give opinions and views , although they may be different without breaking out into name calling and trivializing and eventually escalating into street vioelnce in the worst case scenarios? If a country cannot reah such maturity.. and have to use the bandage method which is to disallowing debate of correctness of beliefs and instead foucs on interfaith peace and respect of religions, i think the society cannot progress that much.</p>

              <p>I say Superman, seeing how anyone wearing red underwear outside during Chinese New Year automatically wins in a fight. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a debate or a court room, people defer to a judge. In the case of a religious discussion, who is going to be the judge? </p>
              <p>That's why we can never have a mature debate about religion. Just picking a judge would end with "My God is better than your God" arguments. </p>
