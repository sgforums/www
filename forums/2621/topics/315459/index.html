              <td>
              <p class="story2">Good
                  news for rational, level-headed Virgoans everywhere: just as you might
                  have predicted, scientists have found astrology to be rubbish.</p>
              <p class="story2">Its
                  central claim - that our human characteristics are moulded by the
                  influence of the Sun, Moon and planets at the time of our birth -
                  appears to have been debunked once and for all and beyond doubt by the
                  most thorough scientific study ever made into it.</p>
              <p class="story2">For
                  several decades, researchers tracked more than 2,000 people - most of
                  them born within minutes of each other. According to astrology, the
                  subject should have had very similar traits.</p>
              
              <p class="story2">The
                  babies were originally recruited as part of a medical study begun in
                  London in 1958 into how the circumstances of birth can affect future
                  health. More than 2,000 babies born in early March that year were
                  registered and their development monitored at regular intervals.</p>
              <p class="story2">Researchers
                  looked at more than 100 different characteristics, including
                  occupation, anxiety levels, marital status, aggressiveness,
                  sociability, IQ levels and ability in art, sport, mathematics and
                  reading - all of which astrologers claim can be gauged from birth
                  charts.</p>
              <p class="story2">The scientists failed to find any evidence
                  of similarities between the "time twins", however. They reported in the
                  current issue of the Journal of Consciousness Studies: "The test
                  conditions could hardly have been more conducive to success . . . but
                  the results are uniformly negative."</p>
              <p class="story2">Analysis of
                  the research was carried out by Geoffrey Dean, a scientist and former
                  astrologer based in Perth, Australia, and Ivan Kelly, a psychologist at
                  the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.</p>
              <div class="mpuad">
              <div class="adtxt">advertisement</div>
              
              </div>
              <p class="story2">Dr
                  Dean said the results undermined the claims of astrologers, who
                  typically work with birth data far less precise than that used in the
                  study. "They sometimes argue that times of birth just a minute apart
                  can make all the difference by altering what they call the 'house
                  cusps'," he said. "But in their work, they are happy to take whatever
                  time they can get from a client."</p>
              <p class="story2">The findings
                  caused alarm and anger in astrological circles yesterday. Roy Gillett,
                  the president of the Astrological Association of Great Britain, said
                  the study's findings should be treated "with extreme caution" and
                  accused Dr Dean of seeking to "discredit astrology".</p>
              <p class="story2">Frank
                  McGillion, a consultant to the Southampton-based Research Group for the
                  Critical Study of Astrology, said of the newly published work: "It is
                  simplistic and highly selective and does not cover all of the
                  research." He added that he would lodge a complaint with the editors of
                  the journal.</p>
              <p class="story2">Astrologers have for centuries
                  claimed to be able to extract deep insights into the personality and
                  destiny of people using nothing more than the details of the time and
                  place of birth.</p>
              <p class="story2">Astrology has been growing in
                  popularity. Surveys suggest that a majority of people in Britain
                  believe in it, compared with only 13 per cent 50 years ago. The
                  Association of Professional Astrologers claims that 80 per cent of
                  Britons read star columns, and psychological studies have found that 60
                  per cent regularly read their horoscopes.</p>
              <p class="story2">Despite
                  the scepticism of scientists, astrology has grown to be a huge
                  worldwide business, spawning thousands of telephone lines, internet
                  sites and horoscope columns in newspapers and magazines.</p>
              <p class="story2">It
                  seems that no sector of society is immune to its attraction. A recent
                  survey found that a third of science students subscribed to some
                  aspects of astrology, while some supposedly hard-headed businessmen now
                  support a thriving market in "financial astrology" - paying for
                  predictions of trends such as the rise and fall of the stock market.
                  Astrology supplements have been known to increase newspaper circulation
                  figures and papers are prepared to pay huge sums to the most popular
                  stargazers.</p>
              <p class="story2">Some of the most popular figures in
                  the field, such as Russell Grant, Mystic Meg and Shelley von Strunckel,
                  can earn £600,000 or more a year.</p>
              <p class="story2">A single profitable astrology website can be worth as much as £50 million.</p>
              <p class="story2">When
                  the Daily Mail discovered that its expert on the zodiac, Jonathan
                  Cainer, was about to leave the newspaper in 1999, it reportedly offered
                  him a £1 million salary and a £1 million bonus to stay. He still
                  preferred the offer at the Daily Express: no salary but all the money
                  from his telephone lines.</p>
              <p class="story2">The time-twins study is
                  only the start of the bad news for astrologers, however. Dr Dean and
                  Prof Kelly also sought to determine whether stargazers could match a
                  birth chart to the personality profile of a person among a random
                  selection.</p>
              <p class="story2">They reviewed the evidence from more
                  than 40 studies involving over 700 astrologers, but found the results
                  turned out no better than guesswork.</p>
              <p class="story2">The success
                  rate did not improve even when astrologers were given all the
                  information they asked for and were confident they had made the right
                  choice.</p>
              <p class="story2">Dr Dean said the consistency of the findings weighed heavily against astrology.</p>
              <p class="story2">"It
                  has no acceptable mechanism, its principles are invalid and it has
                  failed hundreds of tests," he said. "But no hint of these problems will
                  be found in astrology books which, in effect, are exercises in
                  deception."</p>
              <p class="story2">Dr Dean is ready for a torrent of
                  criticism. He said: "I'm probably the most hated person in astrology
                  because I'm regarded as a turncoat."</p>

              <p>Astrology are like many supertitous industry in the world... they just want to belief in these things and make money also at the same time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Astrology cannot predict things at all, but they sure can make money. Behind the astrology facade is just people who realize that they can make a living doing these stuffs.... of course they are angry... whether due to conscious or unconscious reactions...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its their livelihoods..... their beliefs and financial system are built around it... I hope this scienctific study can wake up people... serve them right if they lose a lot of money. its a sin to spread falsehoods..... Those newspaper are also very money face....</p>
