              <p><span class="articleLocation">PARIS</span> (Reuters) - The Vatican launched a series of public dialogues with 
                  non-believers Thursday, choosing leading intellectual institutions in 
                  Paris to present its belief that modern societies must speak more openly
                   about God.</p>
              </span>
              <p>The decision to start the 
                  series in France, where strong secularism has pushed faith to the 
                  fringes of the public sphere, reflected Pope Benedict's goal of bringing
                   religious questions back into the mainstream of civic debates.</p>
              <p>The
                   dialogues, called "Courtyard of the Gentiles" after the part of the 
                  ancient Temple in Jerusalem where Jews and non-Jews met, will continue 
                  in at least 16 cities in Europe and North America over the next two 
                  years.</p>
              <p>Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, 
                  the Vatican's culture minister, told participants at the United Nations 
                  Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) the dialogue 
                  was meant not to confront believers and atheists but to seek common 
                  ground.</p>
              <p>Rather it was "an invitation to non-believers ... to start a voyage with believers through the desert," he said.</p>
              <p>The
                   meeting was due to continue Friday with sessions at the Sorbonne 
                  university and the Institut de France, home of the prestigious Academie 
                  Francaise.</p>
              <p>ESSENTIAL QUESTION</p>
              <p>Pope
                   Benedict, who recently launched another Vatican drive to revitalise the
                   faith in traditionally Catholic countries, proposed these meetings with
                   non-believers in 2009.</p>
              <p>"We must be
                   concerned that human beings do not set aside the question of God, but 
                  rather see it as an essential question for their lives," he said in a 
                  speech to the Vatican hierarchy.</p>
              <p>"We
                   must make sure that they are open to this question and to the yearning 
                  concealed within it." Addressing the UNESCO meeting, former Italian 
                  Prime Minister Giuliano Amato said a so-called honor killing in his 
                  country, in which a <a title="Full coverage of Pakistan" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/pakistan">Pakistani</a> murdered his daughter for behaving as freely as Italian youths, 
                  presented a challenge to open democracies that believers and atheists 
                  had to think about.</p>
              <p>"Democratic 
                  societies are founded on the hypothesis that everyone can differentiate 
                  between just and unjust, good and evil, and everyone can find the 
                  limits" he said. "If one is no longer conscious of this, then democracy 
                  doesn't work anymore."</p>
              <p>Although he
                   said Christianity offered a moral compass, Amato did not present it as 
                  the only way to counter the problems challenging affluent liberal 
                  societies.</p>
              <p>Even Ravasi, despite 
                  his Roman collar, did not present his views as a sermon for more 
                  Catholicism. Instead of the Gospels, he quoted secular thinkers such as 
                  the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Austrian philosopher 
                  Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Argentinian novelist Jorge Luis Borges.</p>
              <p>The
                   discussions are due to end Friday evening with a youth rally outside 
                  Notre Dame Cathedral highlighted by a video address by the pope from 
                  Rome.</p>
              <p>Further dialogue meetings are planned in Italy, Albania, Sweden, Czech Republic, <a title="Full coverage of Germany" href="http://www.reuters.com/places/germany">Germany</a>, Switzerland, Canada, Spain, Russia and the United States.</p>
