            <div class='col-md body'>Ahh... I haven't checked that particular thread in a while.<br><br>I think there were a couple of interesting points raised and I do wish to, at some point, rebut what ObiterDicta wrote.<br><br>Briefly, ObiterDicta alleges that science does not, and is incapable of answering a number of questions. My reply to that would be neither does religion. Furthermore, as science advances, it may be capable of answering those questions in the future.<br><br>ObiterDicta also remains unconvinced that the 'lego mixing' analogy is a false one and I shall strive to give a more considered reply to convince him otherwise.<br><br>However, the thread may have started, I do think it would be interesting to examine if there really was a Jesus. The evidence for a historical Jesus is very weak and some would argue that Jesus never existed. However, I do believe there was a person called Jesus that inspired the myth. In those days, wandering prophets was not uncommon and the name Jesus was a relatively common one. However, I believe the miracles and many of the events described in the synoptic gospels are myth.</div>
