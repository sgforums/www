Truth is relative, yet facts are absolute.<br><br>Blood has been shed over the Scriptures exactly because we are human. Humans have a self-serving bias when it comes to anything to do with belief. Atheists are not exempt, even if an "Atheist Revolution" has yet to occur. We divide ourselves because of the way we see things.</div></blockquote>I do agree that humans have a self-serving bias.  However, if we are to attempt to overcome that self-serving bias, it seems that nothing could be more capricious that basing your beliefs on an ancient book.<br><br>We may disagree on how we interpret science but as you said, facts are absolute. The scientific method is the best way to determine what those facts are.<br><br>Ancient writings were written by men. Men who are far more fallible than you and I because of their vastly more limited understanding. And while I concede our understanding is still limited, it far exceeds what was known in those ancient days.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">"The word 'heresy' not only means no longer being wrong; it practically means being clear-headed and courageous. The word 'orthodoxy' not only no longer means being right; it practically means being wrong. All this can mean one thing, and one thing only. It means that people care less for whether they are philosophically right.<br><br>It is foolish, generally speaking, for a philosopher to set fire to another philosopher in Smithfield Market because they do not agree in their theory of the universe. That was done very frequently in the last decadence of the Middle Ages, and it failed altogether in its object. But there is one thing that is infinitely more absurd and unpractical than burning a man for his philosophy. This is the habit of saying that his philosophy does not matter, and this is done universally in the twentieth century, in the decadence of the great revolutionary period.<br><br>We will have no generalizations. Mr. Bernard Shaw has put the view in a perfect epigram: "The golden rule is that there is no golden rule." We are more and more to discuss details in art, politics, literature. A man's opinion on tramcars matters; his opinion on Botticelli matters; his opinion on all things does not matter. He may turn over and explore a million objects, but he must not find that strange object, the universe; for if he does he will have a religion, and be lost. Everything matters Â— except everything.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">"When the old Liberals removed the gags from all the heresies, their idea was that religious and philosophical discoveries might thus be made. Their view was that cosmic truth was so important that every one ought to bear independent testimony. The modern idea is that cosmic truth is so unimportant that it cannot matter what any one says. The former freed inquiry as men loose a noble hound; the latter frees inquiry as men fling back into the sea a fish unfit for eating. Never has there been so little discussion about the nature of men as now, when, for the first time, any one can discuss it. The old restriction meant that only the orthodox were allowed to discuss religion. Modern liberty means that nobody is allowed to discuss it. Good taste, the last and vilest of human superstitions, has succeeded in silencing us where all the rest have failed.<br><br>There are some people, nevertheless Â— and I am one of them Â— who think that the most practical and important thing about a man is still his view of the universe. ... We think that for a general about to fight an enemy, it is important to know the enemy's numbers, but still more important to know the enemy's philosophy. We think the question is not whether the theory of the cosmos affects matters, but whether in the long run, anything else affects them.<br><br>When everything about a people is for the time growing weak and ineffective, it begins to talk about efficiency. So it is that when a man's body is a wreck he begins, for the first time, to talk about health. Vigorous organisms talk not about their processes, but about their aims.<br><br>There is no such thing on earth as an uninteresting subject; the only thing that can exist is an uninterested person.I wish to deal with my most distinguished contemporaries, not personally or in a merely literary manner, but in relation to the real body of doctrine which they teach. I am not concerned with Mr. Rudyard Kipling as a vivid artist or a vigorous personality; I am concerned with him as a Heretic Â— that is to say, a man whose view of things has the hardihood to differ from mine. I am not concerned with Mr. Bernard Shaw as one of the most brilliant and one of the most honest men alive; I am concerned with him as a Heretic Â— that is to say, a man whose philosophy is quite solid, quite coherent, and quite wrong."</span></div>
