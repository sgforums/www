Yes, it's still a 'bang'.<br><br>Sort of... Yes... It's like me saying a chair is still a chair. There is no significance over such a statement, just logic. Logic which people have often taken for granted today? Well.. You can choose to celebrate it if you want to? Perhaps then there'll be 'significance'?<br><br>Unless you're telling me you wanna challenge the very basic of logics and all that are existing around us today (I'm not saying that's impossible)... That a chair might not be a 'chair'. I would 1st say, you'll need alot more things which are more concrete than just what you've been saying to back you up..... And even having done so, the law of relativity and usefulness of defining a chair as a 'chair' in its empiral form would still most likely prove to be more useful to us than not..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
