              <h1 class="heading">Religious police in Saudi Arabia arrest mother for sitting with a man</h1>
                  
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>A 37-year-old American businesswoman and married mother of three is seeking
                                      justice after she was thrown in jail by Saudi Arabia's religious police for
                                      sitting with a male colleague at a Starbucks coffee shop in Riyadh.</p>
                  <p>Yara, who does not want her last name published for fear of retribution, was
                                      bruised and crying when she was freed from a day in prison after she was
                                      strip-searched, threatened and forced to sign false confessions by the
                                      Kingdom's “Mutaween” police.</p>
                  <p>Her story offers a rare first-hand glimpse of the discrimination faced by
                                      women living in Saudi Arabia. In her first interview with the foreign press,
                                      Yara told The Times that she would remain in Saudi Arabia to challenge its
                                      harsh enforcement of conservative Islam rather than return to America.</p>
                  <p>“If I want to make a difference I have to stick around. If I leave they win. I
                                      can't just surrender to the terrorist acts of these people,” said Yara, who
                                      moved to Jeddah eight years ago with her husband, a prominent businessman.</p>
                  <p>Her ordeal began with a routine visit to the new Riyadh offices of her finance
                                      company, where she is a managing partner.</p>
                  <p>The electricity temporarily cut out, so Yara and her colleagues — who are all
                                      men — went to a nearby Starbucks to use its wireless internet.</p>
                  <p>She sat in a curtained booth with her business partner in the cafï¿½'s “family”
                                      area, the only seats where men and women are allowed to mix.</p>
                  <p>For Yara, it was a matter of convenience. But in Saudi Arabia, public contact
                                      between unrelated men and women is strictly prohibited.</p>
                  <p>“Some men came up to us with very long beards and white dresses. They asked
                                      ‘Why are you here together?'. I explained about the power being out in our
                                      office. They got very angry and told me what I was doing was a great sin,”
                                      recalled Yara, who wears an abaya and headscarf, like most Saudi women.</p>
                  <p>The men were from Saudi Arabia's Commission for Promotion of Virtue and
                                      Prevention of Vice, a police force of several thousand men charged with
                                      enforcing dress codes, sex segregation and the observance of prayers.</p>
                  <p>Yara, whose parents are Jordanian and grew up in Salt Lake City, once believed
                                      that life in Saudi Arabia was becoming more liberal. But on Monday the
                                      religious police took her mobile phone, pushed her into a cab and drove her
                                      to Malaz prison in Riyadh. She was interrogated, strip-searched and forced
                                      to sign and fingerprint a series of confessions pleading guilty to her
                                      “crime”.</p>
                  <p>“They took me into a filthy bathroom, full of water and dirt. They made me
                                      take off my clothes and squat and they threw my clothes in this slush and
                                      made me put them back on,” she said. Eventually she was taken before a
                                      judge.</p>
                  <p>“He said 'You are sinful and you are going to burn in hell'. I told him I was
                                      sorry. I was very submissive. I had given up. I felt hopeless,” she said.</p>
                  <p>Yara's husband, Hatim, used his political contacts in Jeddah to track her
                                      whereabouts. He was able to secure her release.</p>
                  <p>“I was lucky. I met other women in that prison who don't have the connections
                                      I did,” she said. Her story has received rare coverage in Saudi Arabia,
                                      where the press has been sharply critical of the police.</p>
                  <p>Yara was visited yesterday by officials from the American Embassy, who
                                      promised they would file a report.</p>
                  <p>An embassy official told The Times that it was being treated as “an internal
                                      Saudi matter” and refused to comment on her case.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tough justice</strong></p>
                  <p>— Saudi Arabia’s Mutaween has 10,000 members in almost 500 offices</p>
                  <p>— Ahmad al-Bluwi, 50, died in custody in 2007 in the city of Tabuk after he
                                      invited a woman outside his immediate family into his car</p>
                  <p>— In 2007 the victim of a gang rape was sentenced to 200 lashes and six years
                                      in jail for having been in an unrelated man’s car at the time. She was
                                      pardoned by King Abdullah, although he maintained the sentence had been fair</p>
