              DO YOU NEED JESUS?
              
              A: Reading.
              T: Reading
              A: Yes, Reading. I read the Bible from cover to cover one weekend when I was in school.
              T:  You canâ€™t read the Bible from cover to cover in a weekend. This is no ordinary book.
              A:  It is an ordinary book, a horrible one, but quite ordinary in that category. And, one can read it from cover to cover quite easily.
              T:   What did you think about it?
              A:   I thought it was a horrible book. I came away stunned with the hatred, the brutality, the sado-masochism, the cruelty, the killing, the ugliness. Oh, I suppose that words like sado-masochism were not in my vocabulary at that time, since I was a child, but I could see the obvious lies, the disgusting storiesâ€¦.
              T: Youâ€™re not talking about the New Testament now. I admit the Old Testament is pretty hairy, but Jesus Christ is a God of love.
              A:   The New Testament is worse than the Old. Your Jesus Christ is a despicable man. Donâ€™t you read this book? Canâ€™t you understand? Donâ€™t you hear what he says as a theme?
              
                    Matthew 10:34, â€œThink not that I am come to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace, but a sword.â€�
                    35, â€œ For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her motherâ€¦â€¦â€�
                     Mark 10:29, â€œ There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or child, or lands, for my sake, and the gospelsâ€™ â€œ
                     30, â€œ But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this timeâ€¦.â€�
                     Mark 13:12, â€œ Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.â€�
                     Luke 12:51, â€œ Suppose ye that I am came to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay but rather division. â€œ
                     52, â€œ For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.â€�
                     53,  â€œThe father shall be divide against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the motherâ€¦..â€�
                     Luke 14:26, â€œ If any man comes to me, and hate not his father, and other, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.â€�
                     Luke 19:27,  â€œ But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over the , bring hither, and slay them before me.â€�
              
              T:    I never read that! That is out of context, out of context.
              
               A:   You say that like a broken record, â€œout of context, out of context,â€� but it is your minister who has taught you â€œ out of context.â€� Every Sunday he stands in that Pulpit and reads a verse or two and then elaborates on it. He NEVER reads a whole thematic statement which threads through the entire Bible. Yet, you have the temerity to charge us with taking â€œ out of contextâ€�? You accept on faith. The New Testament! Alright, hear a few more things from the New Testament.
                       Do you really believe this:  â€œThen he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases,â€� Luke 9:1. Do you think, first, that there are devils and, second that power and authority over them can be assigned to agents?
                        Or what aboutâ€�,â€¦in my name shall they cast out devils.â€� Mark 16:17. Can you cast out devils?

              LOVE THY PARENTS OR HATE THY PARENTS ?
              
              Was Jesus Christ faithful to his own mother ? Does He practice filial piety?
              
               "Honour thy father and thy mother .-- Matthew 19:19- " so says Jesus Christ . But did he himself honour his own mother?
                        				The Wedding in Canna
              			 	          (John 2:1-4)
                 " And the third day there was a marriage in cana of Gailee: and the mother of Jesus was there: And 
              both Jesus was called, and his disciples,to the marriage, and when they wanted wine,the mother of 
              Jesus saith unto him, "They have no wine".Jesus saith unto her, " Woman,what have I to do with 
              thee? Mine hour is not yet come. " 
                    His mother saith unto the servants. " Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it "
              				     (John 2:1-4)
                     Was the "Son Of God" showing a good example in addressing his own mother as "Woman". He behaved insolently towards his mother, he calls her "woman",and to rub more salt into the wound he is made to say "What connection is there between you and me, or what have I got to do with you?  Could he have forgotten that this "woman" had carried him for nine months, and perhaps suckled him for 2 years, and had borne endless insults and injuries on account of him? Is she not his mother? Is there no word in his language for "Mother"? Is  he setting a good example of his father's own commandment in honouring thy parents? Is he then breaking his own commandments?
                   In Luke 14:26 he even encouraged his disciples to hate their own fathers land mother, and wife  and children. Christians who are followers of Jesus  should praise the bible  and  follow his example:-
                                                
              			     The Would-be Followers of Jesus
                   	 	         	     (Luke 9:57-62,Matthew  8:19-22,)
              
                  " And they went on their way, a man said to Jesus, " I will follow you wherever you go."  Jesus said to him, " Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lie down and rest. "
                   He said to another man, " Follow me. "
                   But that man said, " Sir, first let me go back and bury my father."
                  Jesus answered, " Let the dead bury their own dead. You go and proclaim the Kingdom of God"
                   Another man said, " I will follow you, sir; but first let me go and say good-bye to my family. "
                   Jesus said to him, "Anyone who; starts to plow and then keeps looking back is of no use for the  Kingdom of God."
                   Christians follow the admonition of Jesus Christ if you want to go to heaven.
              
                                             LOVE THY PARENTS OR HATE THY PARENTS?
              
                  What right has a Christian to ask anybody to love his father,or mother, or wife, or child? According  to the gospels, Christ offered a reward to anyone who desert his father and mother. He even encouraged the Christians to love only him and to hate their fathers, mothers,mother-in-laws, sons etc. (Luke:14:26). He offered a premium to gentlemen for leaving their wives ( Mark:10:30) and tried to bribe people to abandon their little children ( Luke 12:53).He offered them happiness in this world, and a hundred fold in the next, if they would turn a deaf ear to the supplications of a father, the beseeching cry of a wife, and would leave the outstretch arms of babes. They were not even allowed to bury their fathers and mother ( Matthew 8:22)--all these advocations were suppossed to have been 
              uttered by Jesus in the inspired word of god as to be found in the Christian Bible. This is the end-product of Christianity for the reward for a place in heaven. So parents if you really for the welfare of your children and want them to be filial to you and grow up to be a sensible and rational person  keep a close watch on them lest they be enticed by the Christians who are out to convert the whole world to their faith. Beware at all time--the Christian Evangelist can be a member of your own family who is already a Christian.
              
                  Many of  jesus' statements  are  highly  intolerant, such  as: "He  who  is  not  for  me  is   against  me" (matthew 12:30), or "No man can serve two masters, for either he will  hate  one  and  love  the other, or he will hold  to one  and  despise the other." (matthew 6:24). In john 16:9 he says that it  is a sin merely not to believe in him. He also says that "No man cometh to the  father  but by  me " He says that he wants to turn even members of the same family against each other ( matthew 10:35-6)-- "For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her  mother, and  the  daughter-in-law  against  he r mother-in-law. And  a  man's  foes  shall be they  of his  own household.". He seems to have been extraordinarily successful in this regard, and in one part of  the new testament, he  even says that anyone  who wants to be a follower of his "must hate their father  and mother, their wife and child, and indeed  even themselves." (luke 14:26).
