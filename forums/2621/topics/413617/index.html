              <p>For me, I have reached the point of no return, death thoughts makes my life full and it is becoming intergral to being alive. People who avoid death thoughts of themselves, are too me, living a life of quiet desperation, to quote from a line.</p>

              <p>I do respect death, and I dislike it to the core. but there is nothing i can do. calmness and acceptance are the solutions. I feel scared once a while but sometimes i laugh it off when i realized that our common complaints are mere trivialities cos we are going to die anyway.</p>

              <p>This fear of death actually means (in theory at least) that you will cherish your life as well as others' lives, so you won't anyhow do silly stuff like unprotected sex, murder, rape, drunk driving, etc. It makes you a more considerate and less selfish person IMO.</p>

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart." - Steve Jobs, at 2005 Stanford Commencement Address</span></p>

              <p>If you are really an atheist, you shouldn't have fear because if you believe there is no after-life what is there to be afraid of ? Only those who believe there is after-life worry about their whereabouts after dying. If you have fear, it means you are not convinced there is no afterlife.</p>
              <p>I believe strongly in after-life due to some personal experience. I advise you to find out for yourself and decide for yourself whether is there afterlife. If you final answer is no, so there is nothing to worry about.</p>
