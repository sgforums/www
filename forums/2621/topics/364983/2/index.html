              you can say that again.
              
              but some of their preachings, like eternal hell to non believers and heaven to those who accept Jesus, smacked of biases. some more you shouldnt say other religions are satanic or devil.
              
              if that is the attitude, then I would rather give it a miss.
              
              If you read the history of christianity, a lot of wars are waged. whats the point of having religion if go to war over this.

              u think about it. its quite rude not to mention offensive if you tell people with no religion or other faiths, that only you accept Jesus will you go to heaven. if not eternal hell.
              
              whats that supposed to mean? scare tactics rite? that means it is like an exclusive club. only members of the club will enjoy this. non members not eligible sorry, thats too bad. if you want to enjoy, you have to be a member of the club.
              
              Well so be it. since there are alot of religions in this world, I will pass yours and find my own slowly. its not my loss and neither its yours.

              in all the religions, which religion will tell you salvation can be obtained by self. Buddha said he is a human and is a teacher and a guide, you yourself have to walk the path.
              
              another teaching differentiate it from other religion is no self or soulessness. all religions all spoke of a soul.
