            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!<br><br>I'm starting this topic to see if there're any Singaporean Malay atheists out there. Probably a minority of a minority but still, I'm sure there's an ex-Muslim out there who just can't find any more reason to believe. If you are one, just for curiosity's sake, I'd like to hear your story.<br><br>For me, I used to be the average Singaporean Muslim. Pious sometimes, yet still in tune with the secular part of society. But as i read up more on the sciences, it became impossible to hold on to scientific facts and Islamic beliefs at the same time. Something's gotta give and I just couldn't put my money on a religion that spawns violent extremist mutant-versions of the faith so easily. Or maybe moderate Islam is the mutant. Anyways, that's my very brief story.<br><br>So anyone out there, care to share their eroding faith in Islam?</div>

A recent survey done in the US (I can't really remember) on scientists, showed that 95% of them do not believe in God, or more specifically a personal God. You may say that they're poor souls (and how do you define soul anyway?) but to accuse great minds like Einstein, Dawkins, Darwin, Hawkings, etc. of being insufficiently well-read, intellectually dishonest, mentally lazy and cowardly is going too far.<br><br>And for your information, I'm half-Chinese too so how would you apply your logic to those claims now?<br><br>What catalysmic evolutionary course exactly did these dinosaurs take, that disproves Darwin's theory?<br><br>Which Laws of Physics collapses the idea of life arising from chemical interactions?<br><br>If we could agree on one thing, it would be that there is some form of order in nature, and that random natural processes would never in a billion years assemble a block of stone, or even a brain like yours.<br><br>I wouldn't be so rude as to assume that your understanding of evolution means that complex organisms come about randomly because that would be accusing you of being insufficiently well-read, mentally lazy and having a subservient mind.</div>

Did u get born randomly?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There are specific characteristics for everything in this world. An apple tree will not grow oranges, etc etc ... i hope u get the idea. These specific characteristics and behaviour are not random, thus life did not arise "randomly". what u need is juz the correct conditions and material to be present.<br><br>Religiosity and Intelligence<br>As for your remark about intelligence, will it surprise u if various studies find that there is an inverse correlation between religiosity and intelligence? In simpler words: the more intelligent one gets, the less likely that he is religious.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religiosity_and_intelligence<br><br>Courage<br>Does it take more courage to come to realise that there is NO LIFE AFTER DEATH, or does it take more courage to believe that 'some god' has ur back covered?<br><br></div>

I can see that it makes them really uncomfortable when I bring up this topic, so after a while I just stopped.
