Therefore the act of blowng up a spiderman balloon and praying is the reason for his curing.<br><br>Another kid hears his story and he also has a long illness. He did the same thing but still did not recover. So he went to the first kid and ask him why he was not cured.

However, radical atheism is atheism to the point where religious people (no matter of what degree) are denounced by the person without provision of proper arguments. Radical atheism is when atheists make comments like "Nature gave me a brain. I just choose to use it." in public, and then proceed to imply all religious people are stupid. Radical atheism is when someone disregards the opinions of anyone they don't determine to be atheist enough. How different is that from the "enemy" they want to eradicate?</div>
