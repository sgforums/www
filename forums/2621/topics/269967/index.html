Korea only has 200 troops there. I don't think withdrawing them is a big deal. However, on priciple, it is very difficult to give in to the demands as it will only encourage more kidnappings.<br><br></div>

Take the "Saving Private Lynch" incident, for example.<br><br>I think the volunteers went there knowing full well what might happen to them. Of course, Seoul has to take every consideration before anything happens, but what if something goes wrong and more than 23 people die? It'd be worse, wouldn't it?<br><br>Right now, all we can do is hope for the best until 10.30 pm tonight.</div>
