She thought about the idea of universe and gave birth to one as a result. She thought about the laws of universe and created them which allows the universe to evolve accordingly.<br><br>She does not intervene in the universe after, there is no notion of good and bad, and she has not plan for how she wants the universe to be in the end.<br>She merely thought of having the universe and sets the laws. All claims of what the god wants us to do are created by man, but its not true, cause Nature simply observes the universe only. She does not tinker with it neither does she choose some humans to be a messengers.<br><br>In technical terms, such a god has a name, which i dunno what is it.<br>Anyway, Yesterday, she came to my dream and told me that this is the picture and ask me to type the above, to tell people that the truth about what she has done and what she has not done so as to clear all the myths. Ain't she beautiful.<br><br>She tries not to tinker with the universe but she just want to clear the confusion that is going around. Anyway, she does not have the power to stop natural disaster, and she dun have much concept of good and bad, or emotions which explains why she did not interven even if she has the power.<br><br>She cannot predict the future, and she is only capable of two things. One is to create the universe , the string theory concept through the picture you see above in her stomach. Secondly, she created the laws which the universe will evolve.<br><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1185/663174105_cc5539a848_m.jpg"><br>That is all she wants me to clarify. Bye bye, and good luck, is what she said in the end.<br><br><strong>The above is just my product of my imagination of a possible story</strong></div>

Metabolism here means a cycle of chemical reactions that produce energy in a form that can be harnessed by other processes. The idea is that once a primitive metabolic cycle was established,<span style="color: red;"> it began to produce ever more complex compounds.</span> A key idea of the theory is that this early chemistry of life occurred not in bulk solution in the oceans, but on mineral surfaces (e.g. iron pyrites) near deep hydrothermal vents. This was an anaerobic, high-temperature (near 100Â°C), high-pressure environment.<span style="color: red;"> The first 'cells' would have been lipid bubbles on the mineral surfaces. WÃ¤chtershÃ¤user has hypothesized a special role for acetic acid, a simple combination of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen found in vinegar. Acetic acid is part of the citric acid cycle that is fundamental to metabolism in cells.</span><br><br><strong> Proto-Ecological Systems</strong><br>William Martin and Michael Russell reported a modified iron-sulfur-hypothesis in 2002.[4] <span style="color: red;">According to their scenario, the first cellular life forms may have evolved inside so-called black smokers at seafloor spreading zones in the deep sea. These structures consist of microscale caverns that are coated by thin membraneous metal sulfide walls. Therefore, these structures would solve several critical points of the "pure" WÃ¤chtershÃ¤user systems at once:</span><br><br>the micro-caverns provide a means of concentrating newly synthesised molecules, thereby increasing the chance of forming oligomers;<br>the steep temperature gradients inside a black smoker allow for establishing "optimum zones" of partial reactions in different regions of the black smoker (e.g. monomer synthesis in the hotter, oligomerisation in the colder parts);<br>the flow of hydrothermal water through the structure provides a constant source of building blocks and energy (freshly precipitated metal sulfides);<br>the model allows for a succession of different steps of cellular evolution (prebiotic chemistry, monomer and oligomer synthesis, peptide and protein synthesis, RNA world, ribonucleoprotein assembly and DNA world) in a single structure, facilitating exchange between all developmental stages;<br>synthesis of lipids as a means of "closing" the cells against the environment is not necessary, until basically all cellular functions are developed.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Some of the fundamental ideas of the iron-sulfur theory can be summarized in the following brief recipe for life: Boil water. Stir in iron sulfide and nickel sulfide. Bubble in carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide gas. Wait for peptides to form.</span><br><br>More technically, WÃ¤chtershÃ¤user hypothesized the following steps for producing proteins:<br><br>Produce acetic acid through metallic ion catalysis.<br>Add carbon to the acetic acid molecule to produce three-carbon pyruvic acid.<br>Add ammonia to form amino acids.<br>Produce peptides and then proteins.<br>Both acetic acid and pyruvic acid are key chemicals in the citric acid cycle.<br><br><span style="color: red;">In 1997, WÃ¤chtershÃ¤user and Claudia Huber mixed carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, nickel sulfide, and iron sulfide particles at 100Â°C and demonstrated that amino acids could form.[2] The following year, using the same ingredients, they were able to produce peptides.[3]</span><br><br><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat02.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat02.html</a><br><br><span style="color: red;">5 to 8 million years ago. Shortly thereafter, the species diverged into two separate lineages. One of these lineages ultimately evolved into gorillas and chimps, and the other evolved into early human ancestors called hominids.</span><br><br><a href="http://3.%20Does%20evolution%20stop%20once%20a%20species%20has%20become%20a%20species?" rel="nofollow">3. Does evolution stop once a species has become a species?</a><br><br>Evolution does not stop once a species becomes a species. Every population of living organisms is undergoing some sort of evolution, though the degree and speed of the process varies greatly from one group to another. Populations that experience a major change in environmental conditions, whether that change comes in the form of a new predator or a new island to disperse to, evolve much more quickly than do populations in a more stable set of conditions.<strong> This is because evolution is driven by natural selection, and because when the environment changes, selective pressures change, favoring one portion of the population more heavily than it was favored before the change.</strong><br><br></div>

This is very different from the notion of the family tree as being a slender trunk rising towards the apex, and it's very clear at this point that our human family tree has been very bushy in its structure.</span><br><br>Is that an idea that has been suspected for a long time? I personally suspected this for a long period, but it's only really become absolutely apparent in the last 20 years, and with the new findings over that period, this bushy structure has characterized human revolution.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Beginning at about the 1950s the received wisdom in paleoanthropolgy was that human evolution had been a sort of single-minded slog from primitiveness to perfection, if you wish, without a lot of different species being involved and with species tending to evolve from one into another in a kind of a linear fashion. Clearly these new findings over the last 20 years just cannot be accommodated within a structure like that.</span><br><br><strong>What do you see as the most vexing questions in human evolution now?</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Wherever you turn in the human fossil record, there are unanswered questions. There's no doubt about that at all. To me there are two particular things of interest. One is the range of total diversity that existed over the long span of seven million years or more of human evolution. And the other question is exactly what it was that was involved with the emergence of modern Homo sapiens, which is so different behaviorally and cognitively from every other species that we know of that has ever existed.</span><br><br>This is a very vexing question partly because it's clear that human beings that look like us were around for quite a long time before human beings who behaved like us, and so we really only have the archaeological record to help us in understanding this emergence.<br><br></div>
