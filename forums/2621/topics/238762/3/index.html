            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Eric Cartman:<br><br>Insight that luminosity is mind.</blockquote>Like I said so many times it is not a matter of whether you understand it conceptually, whether it makes sense to your mind or you understand how it works, etc.<br><br>D.T.Suzuki the famous Zen writer wrote 8 points of an authentic satori/awakening experience.<br><br><blockquote>1. Irrationality. "By this I mean that Satori is not a conclusion to be reached by reasoning, and defies all intellectual determination. Those who have experienced it are always at a loss to explain it coherently or logically."<br><br>2. Intuitive Insight. "That there is noetic quality in mystic experiences has been pointed out by (William) James...Another name for Satori is Kensho (chien-hsing in Chinese) meaning "to see essence or nature," which apparently proves that there is "seeing" or "perceiving" in Satori...Without this noetic quality Satori will lose all its pungency, for it is really the reason of Satori itself. "<br><br>3. Authoritativeness. "By this I mean that the knowledge realized by Satori is final, that no amount of logical argument can refute it. Being direct and personal it is sufficient unto itself. All that logic can do here is to explain it, to interpret it in connection to other kinds of knowledge with which our minds are filled. Satori is thus a form of perception, an inner perception, which takes place in the most interior part of consciousness.<br><br>4. Affirmation. "What is authoritative and final can never be negative. Though the Satori experience is sometimes expressed in negative terms, it is essentially an affirmative attidude towards all things that exist; it accepts them as they come along regardless of their moral values."<br><br>5. Sense of the Beyond. "...in Satori there is always what we may call a sense of the Beyond; the experience indeed is my own but I feel it to be rooted elsewhere. The individual shell in which my personality is so solidly encased explodes at the moment of Satori. Not, necessarily, that I get unified with a being greater than myself or absorbed in it, but that my individuality, which I found rigidly held together and definitely kept separate from other individual existences, becomes lossened somehow from its tightening grip and melts away into something indescribable, something which is of quite a different order from what I am accustomed to. The feeling that follows is that of complete release or a complete rest---the feeling that one has arrived finally at the destination...As far as the psychology of Satori is considered, a sense of the Beyond is all we can say about it; to call this the Beyond, the Absolute, or God, or a Person is to go further than the experience itself and to plunge into a theology or metaphysics." See #5 above as well as Turiyatita.<br><br>6. Impersonal Tone. "Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Zen experience is that it has no personal note in it as is observable in Christian mystic experiences."<br><br>7. Feeling of exaltation. "That this feeling inevitably accompanies Satori is due to the fact that it is the breaking-up of the restriction imposed on one as an individual being, and this breaking up is not a mere negative incident but quite a positive one fraught with signification because it means an infinite expansion of the individual."<br><br>8. Momentariness. "Satori comes upon one abruptly and is a momentary experience. In fact, if it is not abrupt and momentary, it is not Satori.</blockquote><blockquote>Why can't sleeping be a meditation when sitting meditation is also just sitting there with a quiet mind?</blockquote>There is no mindfulness to penetrate reality during sleep. You simply cannot practise in sleep.. but non dual can naturally propel into even the dream phases and the subconscious/8th consciousness when you reach certain stage.<br><br><blockquote>Thusness also said that sleeping is the deepest samadhi.</blockquote>Samadhi is just samadhi, a state of complete cessation of subject and object, a form of non dual absorption. It does not necessarily provides any insights at all.</div>

The other 3 still in school. In the last building donation drive. Those 10 people, in a single day, pledged about $28,000 to the building fund. This is in addition to their tithe and twice a week offering.<br><br>They are without exception, sincere in their belief and their love for god.<br><br>But I think the difference between Zouk and church is that Zouk doesn't lie to you. At Zouk, you know what you are getting. You're buying alcohol, a chance to let loose, and perhaps a chance of getting laid. One could argue that Zouk only makes you think you have a chance, but I would argue that most people understand and recognize Zouk for what it is and they are able to choose freely to go to Zouk.<br><br>When people go to church, do they just go for the experience? For those who just go for the fellowship, to sing a few songs and perhaps get lucky with some hot church gals, I would say sure, go ahead. But if you are going because you believe in something that isn't true, your free will has been taken away from you because you have been deprived of the information needed to make a good decision.<br><br>For those would argue that faith does not hurt anyone, I would like to mention Heaven's Gate.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Heaven's Gate was the name of a cult co-led by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Smith.<br><br>The cult's end coincided with the appearance of Comet Hale-Bopp in 1997. Applewhite convinced thirty-eight followers to commit suicide so that their souls could take a ride on a spaceship that they believed was hiding behind the comet carrying Jesus; such beliefs have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of "UFO religion." They believed that the Earth planet is about to be recycled (wiped clean, refurbished and rejuvenated), and the only chance to survive is to leave it immediately [1]. The group was formally against the suicide, but they were convinced that their "human" bodies were only "vehicles" meant to help them on their journey, though they likely thought that their actions were something different as well. [2]. The group was practicing direct hate to the surrounding world: It is also possible that part of our test of faith is our hating this world, even our flesh body, to the extent to be willing to leave it without any proof of the Next Level's existence.</span><br><br>They thought that the willingness to leave their bodies was a test of faith.<br><br>Good people will do good things.<br><br>Bad people will do bad things.<br><br>Only faith and religion can make good people do bad things.</div>
