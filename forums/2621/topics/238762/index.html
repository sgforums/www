Furthermore other religions and philosophies fall into extremes like eternalism or nihilism. The Buddha refuted or shunned all the 60+ philosophies and religions at his time with the middle way, emptiness, dharma seals, and all the Buddhadharma.<br><br>Only Buddhism teaches the middle way/Emptiness free from erroneous dualistic concepts, Interdependent Origination, 3 Dharma Seals or 3 Characteristics of Existence or the 4 Seals. These teachings sets Buddhism completely apart from other religions -- Buddhism is 'THE WAY' to enlightenment and liberation.</div></blockquote>Buddha also said that Mahavira was enlightened.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Eric Cartman:</div><div class="quote_body">Buddha also said that Mahavira was enlightened.</div></blockquote>I think I am mistaken. I cannot find sources that states the Buddha ever said that Mahavira is enlightened. Well, 'mahavira' literally means Â“fully enlightened teacher.Â” and the Buddha may have just called him by his usual name.<br><br>The Buddha is known to have refuted a lot of Mahavira's teachings on eternalism and karma and etc.<br><br><blockquote>From the Buddhist perspective, Jainism commits the following heresies;<br><br>1) Belief in a permanent Â‘soulÂ’ (jiva) Â– as opposed to the clear Buddhist doctrine of Â‘anatmaÂ’ (no permanent Â‘soulÂ’).<br><br>2) The Â‘soulÂ’ is considered Â‘eternalÂ’ Â– Â‘eternalismÂ’ being against the Buddhist teaching of the Middle Way.<br><br>3) A definition of karma that is purely Â‘materialisticÂ’ in nature. Buddhist karma is purely Â‘volitionalÂ’ or Â‘psychologicalÂ’ in essence.<br><br>4) For complete Jainist enlightenment, the physical body must die. This is Â‘nihilisticÂ’ in nature and opposed to the BuddhaÂ’s teaching of the Â‘Middle WayÂ’.<br><br>5) The Jainist practice of severe austerity is again, against the BuddhaÂ’s teaching of the Middle Way.<br><br>In short, there is nothing remotely similar between the jainist teachings, and the teaching of the Buddha. Jainism may be considered a more severe version of othodox Hindu teaching. Whereas the BuddhaÂ’s teachings are/were revolutionary in nature. No one in His lifetime, taught the Dharma that he did. Mahavira Â– the Â‘JinaÂ’ of Jainism, certainly did not. The BuddhaÂ’s enlightenment was not a mere Â‘intellectionÂ’ of the surveying of the contemporary philosophical environment He found himself within. The Dharma is not an Â‘ideaÂ’, designed to be Â‘differentÂ’ from the other Â‘ideasÂ’ around at the time. The ego that leads to the need for philosophical Â‘distinctionÂ’, is the same ego that the Buddha over-came through meditation, the essence of Zen practice.</blockquote></div>
