I'm not directing this post to any particular person or post in the atheism forum. Just something I tell even more my friends.<br><br>It's one thing to question religion, but it's something else altogether when you start making insults and personal comments. Having read some of the posts here, I am sure some of you are mature enough to know the difference.<br><br>I respect those of you who have made your own decisions regarding religion/non-religion based on rational thinking. Which is more than I can say for those who make comments about religion for no reason other than hate itself.<br><br>Most of you I feel would understand what I am saying, but I just wanted to say something about this.

            <div class='col-md body'>There's always a fine line on this topic and often, little agreement can be found.<br><br>One man's legitimate criticism is another man's hate speech.<br><br>Personally, I strongly support religious freedom. In my view, religion is something close to a thought crime. Belief in religion and allowing that belief to guide your behavior and ethics is, in my opinion, utterly senseless.<br><br>However, as I said, I strongly support religious freedom because I think there is nothing wrong with "thought crime" and trying to control peoples thoughts leads us down a slippery slope.<br><br>Similarly, I think there should be no restriction on fantasizing about rape, incest, and even murder. We think about all kinds of things everyday, but it is what we do that really matters.<br><br>The problem I have with religious people is when they try to impose their views upon others. Take for example Section 377a of the penal code. I'm opposed to 377a because I feel no one should have any right to interfere with the private lives of consenting adults.<br><br>Section 377a states:<br><br><strong>Outrages on decency.</strong><br>377A. Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years."<br><br>First of all, I object to the definition of indecency. Who sets that standard? And why should someone else set that standard for me? And more importantly, why should the govt or anyone else have the right to interfere with my private life?<br></div>
