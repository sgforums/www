            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.khyenkong-tharjay.org/images/30b.jpg"><br><br>on the right<br><br>His entering into parinirvana<br>At the age of thirty-nine (by the Tibetan calendar), Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche suddenly passed away on 26th of April, 1992 due to the obstacles for Buddhism, people in general and in particular for the Kagyu tradition. Considering his age, learning, qualities, aspirations and activities, his passing away has been an unbearably sorrowful event for his disciples and all who knew him. Yet, as ordinary people with limited understanding and realization of how things truly are, we are unable to know the profound methods for benefiting sentient beings in the right time and place. We should, therefore, always look at his life with pure vision, great faith, devotion and try to attain in our lifetime, the supreme achievement of Mahamudra through receiving in our mind stream the blessing of his body, speech and mind. We should always turn our minds towards praying that his perfect incarnation and activities will be brought to perfection following the aspirations he had made of the Dharma and sentient beings.<br><br>During His Holiness Dalai LamaÂ’s visit to Mainpat Phande Ling settlement, he said to Beru Khyentse Rinpoche that the many incarnations of Jamgon Kongtrul and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo had benefited countless sentient beings. His Holiness further said that there were two Taglung tulkus who had no complications with each other but are instead working harmoniously together for the benefit of sentient beings. Therefore, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Chokyi Senge had the body and mind emanation. The 4th Jamgon Kongtrul Karma Migyur Drakpa Senge, son of H.E. 2nd Beru Khyentse Rinpoche is related to the 3rd Jamgon KongtrulÂ’s mind emanation because before the 3rd Jamgon KongtrulÂ’s parinirvana, he had predicted his future relationship with Beru Khyentse Rinpoche is forever.<br><br>In 1989 at Rumtek, a ring of Vajra Cross mounted with a ruby and diamonds was presented by the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche to Beru Khyentse Rinpoche, signifying the close Â’Vajra brothersÂ’ pure samaya relationship between these two Rinpoches. Back to the history of the 1st Great Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye, he recognized the 1st Palpung Beru Khyentse as the speech incarnation of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. The 2nd Jamgon Kongtrul Palden Khyentse Ozer was physically the son of 15th Karmapa Khakyab Dorje and lineage holder of Kamtsang Kagyu. At the same time, the 1st Beru Khyentse received all the Kamtsang Kagyu teachings and also, was the main principle disciple and heart son of 15th Karmapa Khakhyab Dorje. During that time, the 2nd Jamgon Kongtrul and the 1st Beru Khyentse were there for each other as guru and disciple as well as dharma brothers. The birthplaces of the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Chokyi Senge and 2nd Beru Khyentse were in central Tibet and they were both recognized by the same guru, the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa. Therefore, both the Rinpoches received the special teachings and empowerments from 16th Gyalwa Karmapa and Kyabje Kalu Rinpoche.<br></div>
