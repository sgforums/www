A platform before the Castle.<br>-<br>Enter two Sentinels-[first,] Francisco, [who paces up and<br>down at his post; then] Bernardo, [who approaches him].<br>-<br>Ber. Who's there.?<br>Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.<br>Ber. Long live the King!<br>Fran. Bernardo?<br>Ber. He.<br>Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.<br>Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.<br>Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,<br>And I am sick at heart.<br>Ber. Have you had quiet guard?<br>Fran. Not a mouse stirring.<br>Ber. Well, good night.<br>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.<br>-<br>Enter Horatio and Marcellus.<br><br>-<br>Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?<br>Hor. Friends to this ground.<br>Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.<br>Fran. Give you good night.<br>Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.<br>Who hath reliev'd you?<br>Fran. Bernardo hath my place.<br>Give you good night.                                   Exit.<br>Mar. Holla, Bernardo!<br>Ber. Say-<br>What, is Horatio there ?<br>Hor. A piece of him.<br>Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.<br>Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?<br>Ber. I have seen nothing.<br>Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,<br>And will not let belief take hold of him<br>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.<br>Therefore I have entreated him along,<br><br>With us to watch the minutes of this night,<br>That, if again this apparition come,<br>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br>Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.<br>Ber. Sit down awhile,<br>And let us once again assail your ears,<br>That are so fortified against our story,<br>What we two nights have seen.<br>Hor. Well, sit we down,<br>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.<br>Ber. Last night of all,<br>When yond same star that's westward from the pole<br>Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven<br>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br>The bell then beating one-<br>-<br>Enter Ghost.<br>-<br>Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!<br>Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.<br><br>Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.<br>Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.<br>Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.<br>Ber. It would be spoke to.<br>Mar. Question it, Horatio.<br>Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night<br>Together with that fair and warlike form<br>In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br>Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!<br>Mar. It is offended.<br>Ber. See, it stalks away!<br>Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!<br>Exit Ghost.<br>Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.<br>Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.<br>Is not this something more than fantasy?<br>What think you on't?<br>Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe<br>Without the sensible and true avouch<br>Of mine own eyes.<br><br>Mar. Is it not like the King?<br>Hor. As thou art to thyself.<br>Such was the very armour he had on<br>When he th' ambitious Norway combated.<br>So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,<br>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br>'Tis strange.<br>Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,<br>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.<br>Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;<br>But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.<br>Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,<br>Why this same strict and most observant watch<br>So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon<br>And foreign mart for implements of war;<br>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br>Does not divide the Sunday from the week.<br>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br><br>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?<br>Who is't that can inform me?<br>Hor. That can I.<br>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,<br>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,<br>Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet<br>(For so this side of our known world esteem'd him)<br>Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,<br>Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br>Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;<br>Against the which a moiety competent<br>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd<br>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart<br>And carriage of the article design'd,<br>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br><br>Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,<br>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>For food and diet, to some enterprise<br>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,<br>As it doth well appear unto our state,<br>But to recover of us, by strong hand<br>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>So by his father lost; and this, I take it,<br>Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>The source of this our watch, and the chief head<br>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.<br>Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.<br>Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br>Comes armed through our watch, so like the King<br>That was and is the question of these wars.<br>Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.<br>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead<br>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;<br><br>As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,<br>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star<br>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands<br>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.<br>And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br>As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>And prologue to the omen coming on,<br>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>Unto our climature and countrymen.</div>

[Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen,<br>Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand,<br>Cornelius,] Lords Attendant.<br>-<br>King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death<br>The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom<br>To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>That we with wisest sorrow think on him<br>Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,<br>With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,<br>With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,<br>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,<br>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd<br>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br><br>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br>Or thinking by our late dear brother's death<br>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br>Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,<br>He hath not fail'd to pester us with message<br>Importing the surrender of those lands<br>Lost by his father, with all bands of law,<br>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.<br>Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,<br>Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears<br>Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress<br>His further gait herein, in that the levies,<br>The lists, and full proportions are all made<br>Out of his subject; and we here dispatch<br>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,<br>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,<br><br>Giving to you no further personal power<br>To business with the King, more than the scope<br>Of these dilated articles allow.            [Gives a paper.]<br>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.<br>Cor., Volt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.<br>King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.<br>Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.<br>And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?<br>You told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?<br>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane<br>And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br>The head is not more native to the heart,<br>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br>What wouldst thou have, Laertes?<br>Laer. My dread lord,<br>Your leave and favour to return to France;<br>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark<br>To show my duty in your coronation,<br><br>Yet now I must confess, that duty done,<br>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France<br>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.<br>King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?<br>Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave<br>By laboursome petition, and at last<br>Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.<br>I do beseech you give him leave to go.<br>King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,<br>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!<br>But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-<br>Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!<br>King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?<br>Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.<br>Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br>And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br>Seek for thy noble father in the dust.<br>Thou know'st 'tis common.

I know not 'seems.'<br>'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br>Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br>Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,<br>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br>Nor the dejected havior of the visage,<br>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,<br>'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,<br>For they are actions that a man might play;<br>But I have that within which passeth show-<br>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.<br>King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,<br>To give these mourning duties to your father;<br>But you must know, your father lost a father;<br>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br>In filial obligation for some term<br>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever<br><br>In obstinate condolement is a course<br>Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;<br>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br>An understanding simple and unschool'd;<br>For what we know must be, and is as common<br>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br>Why should we in our peevish opposition<br>Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,<br>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>To reason most absurd, whose common theme<br>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br>'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth<br>This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br>As of a father; for let the world take note<br>You are the most immediate to our throne,<br>And with no less nobility of love<br>Than that which dearest father bears his son<br>Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br><br>In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>It is most retrograde to our desire;<br>And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.<br>Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.<br>I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.<br>Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.<br>King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.<br>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.<br>This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet<br>Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,<br>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day<br>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br>And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,<br>Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.<br>Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.<br>Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,<br>Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!<br>Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd<br><br>His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!<br>How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable<br>Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br>Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden<br>That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature<br>Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br>But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.<br>So excellent a king, that was to this<br>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother<br>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br>Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him<br>As if increase of appetite had grown<br>By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-<br>Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-<br>A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br>With which she followed my poor father's body<br>Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she<br>(O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason<br>Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;<br><br>My father's brother, but no more like my father<br>Than I to Hercules. Within a month,<br>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br>With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br>It is not, nor it cannot come to good.<br>But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!</div>

The funeral bak'd meats<br>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.<br>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven<br>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!<br>My father- methinks I see my father.<br>Hor. O, where, my lord?<br>Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.<br>Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.<br><br>Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.<br>I shall not look upon his like again.<br>Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.<br>Ham. Saw? who?<br>Hor. My lord, the King your father.<br>Ham. The King my father?<br>Hor. Season your admiration for a while<br>With an attent ear, till I may deliver<br>Upon the witness of these gentlemen,<br>This marvel to you.<br>Ham. For God's love let me hear!<br>Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen<br>(Marcellus and Bernardo) on their watch<br>In the dead vast and middle of the night<br>Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,<br>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,<br>Appears before them and with solemn march<br>Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd<br>By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,<br>Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd<br><br>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br>In dreadful secrecy impart they did,<br>And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br>Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,<br>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br>The apparition comes. I knew your father.<br>These hands are not more like.<br>Ham. But where was this?<br>Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.<br>Ham. Did you not speak to it?<br>Hor. My lord, I did;<br>But answer made it none. Yet once methought<br>It lifted up it head and did address<br>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br>But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away<br>And vanish'd from our sight.<br>Ham. 'Tis very strange.<br>Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;<br><br>And we did think it writ down in our duty<br>To let you know of it.<br>Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.<br>Hold you the watch to-night?<br>Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.<br>Ham. Arm'd, say you?<br>Both. Arm'd, my lord.<br>Ham. From top to toe?<br>Both. My lord, from head to foot.<br>Ham. Then saw you not his face?<br>Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.<br>Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.<br>Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.<br>Ham. Pale or red?<br>Hor. Nay, very pale.<br>Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?<br>Hor. Most constantly.<br>Ham. I would I had been there.<br>Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.<br>Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?<br><br>Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.<br>Both. Longer, longer.<br>Hor. Not when I saw't.<br>Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?<br>Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,<br>A sable silver'd.<br>Ham. I will watch to-night.<br>Perchance 'twill walk again.<br>Hor. I warr'nt it will.<br>Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,<br>I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape<br>And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,<br>If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,<br>Let it be tenable in your silence still;<br>And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,<br>Give it an understanding but no tongue.<br>I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.<br>Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,<br>I'll visit you.<br>All. Our duty to your honour.<br><br>Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.<br>Exeunt [all but Hamlet].<br>My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.<br>I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!<br>Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,<br>Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.<br>Exit.<br></div>

You are a fishmonger.<br>Pol. Not I, my lord.<br>Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.<br>Pol. Honest, my lord?<br>Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man<br>pick'd out of ten thousand.<br>Pol. That's very true, my lord.<br>Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god<br><br>kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?<br>Pol. I have, my lord.<br>Ham. Let her not walk i' th' sun.

Words, words, words.<br>Pol. What is the matter, my lord?<br>Ham. Between who?<br>Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.<br>Ham. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men<br>have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes<br>purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a<br>plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,<br>sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it<br>not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,<br>should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.<br><br>Pol.

[Aside] How pregnant sometimes<br>his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which<br>reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I<br>will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between<br>him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take<br>my leave of you.<br>Ham.

Let me<br>question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,<br>deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison<br>hither?<br>Guil. Prison, my lord?<br><br>Ham.

We think not so, my lord.<br>Ham. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good<br>or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.<br>Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your<br>mind.<br>Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a<br>king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.<br>Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of<br>the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.<br>Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.<br>Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that<br>it is but a shadow's shadow.<br>Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd<br>heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my<br>fay, I cannot reason.<br>Both. We'll wait upon you.<br><br>Ham. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my<br>servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most<br>dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what<br>make you at Elsinore?<br>Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.<br>Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;<br>and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were<br>you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free<br>visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.<br>Guil. What should we say, my lord?<br>Ham. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and<br>there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties<br>have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen<br>have sent for you.<br>Ros. To what end, my lord?<br>Ham. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights<br>of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the<br>obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a<br>better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with<br>me, whether you were sent for or no.<br><br>Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?<br>Ham. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold<br>not off.<br>Guil. My lord, we were sent for.<br>Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your<br>discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no<br>feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my<br>mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so<br>heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,<br>seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the<br>air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical<br>roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing<br>to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a<br>piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in<br>faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in<br>action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the<br>beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what<br>is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman<br>neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.<br>Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.<br><br>Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?<br>Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten<br>entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them<br>on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.<br>Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall<br>have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and<br>target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall<br>end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose<br>lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind<br>freely, or the blank verse shall halt fort. What players are<br>they?<br>Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the<br>tragedians of the city.<br>Ham. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in<br>reputation and profit, was better both ways.<br>Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late<br>innovation.<br>Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the<br>city? Are they so follow'd?<br>Ros. No indeed are they not.<br><br>Ham. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?<br>Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,<br>sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top<br>of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd fort. These are now<br>the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call<br>them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and<br>dare scarce come thither.<br>Ham. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they<br>escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can<br>sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow<br>themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means<br>are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim<br>against their own succession.<br>Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation<br>holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a<br>while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player<br>went to cuffs in the question.<br>Ham. Is't possible?<br>Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.<br>Ham. Do the boys carry it away?<br><br>Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.<br>Ham. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and<br>those that would make mows at him while my father lived give<br>twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in<br>little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if<br>philosophy could find it out.<br></div>

Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?<br>Ham. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform<br>honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can<br>translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,<br>but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.<br>Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.<br>Ham. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so<br>inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you<br>not.<br>Oph. I was the more deceived.<br>Ham. Get thee to a nunnery!

At home, my lord.<br>Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool<br>nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.<br>Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!<br>Ham. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:<br>be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape<br>calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt<br>needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what<br>monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.<br>Farewell.<br>Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!<br>Ham. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath<br>given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you<br>amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your<br><br>wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made<br>me mad.
