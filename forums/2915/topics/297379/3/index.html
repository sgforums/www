Why, I will fight with him upon this theme<br>Until my eyelids will no longer wag.<br>Queen. O my son, what theme?<br><br>Ham. I lov'd Ophelia.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SCENE II.</strong><br>Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.<br>-<br>Enter Hamlet and Horatio.<br>-<br>Ham. So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.<br>You do remember all the circumstance?<br>Hor. Remember it, my lord!<br>Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting<br>That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay<br>Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly-<br>And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,<br>Our indiscretion sometime serves us well<br>When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us<br>There's a divinity that shapes our ends,<br>Rough-hew them how we will-<br>Hor. That is most certain.<br>Ham. Up from my cabin,<br>My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark<br>Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,<br>Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew<br>To mine own room again; making so bold<br><br>(My fears forgetting manners) to unseal<br>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio<br>(O royal knavery!), an exact command,<br>Larded with many several sorts of reasons,<br>Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,<br>With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-<br>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,<br>No, not to stay the finding of the axe,<br>My head should be struck off.<br>Hor. Is't possible?<br>Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.<br>But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?<br>Hor. I beseech you.<br>Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,<br>Or I could make a prologue to my brains,<br>They had begun the play. I sat me down;<br>Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair.<br>I once did hold it, as our statists do,<br>A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much<br>How to forget that learning; but, sir, now<br><br>It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know<br>Th' effect of what I wrote?<br>Hor. Ay, good my lord.<br>Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,<br>As England was his faithful tributary,<br>As love between them like the palm might flourish,<br>As peace should still her wheaten garland wear<br>And stand a comma 'tween their amities,<br>And many such-like as's of great charge,<br>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,<br>Without debatement further, more or less,<br>He should the bearers put to sudden death,<br>Not shriving time allow'd.<br>Hor. How was this seal'd?<br>Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.<br>I had my father's signet in my purse,<br>which was the model of that Danish seal;<br>Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,<br>Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,<br>The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br><br>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent<br>Thou know'st already.<br>Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.<br>Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!<br>They are not near my conscience; their defeat<br>Does by their own insinuation grow.<br>'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes<br>Between the pass and fell incensed points<br>Of mighty opposites.<br>Hor. Why, what a king is this!<br>Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-<br>He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;<br>Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;<br>Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,<br>And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience<br>To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd<br>To let this canker of our nature come<br>In further evil?<br>Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England<br>What is the issue of the business there.<br><br>Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,<br>And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'<br>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,<br>That to Laertes I forgot myself,<br>For by the image of my cause I see<br>The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.<br>But sure the bravery of his grief did put me<br>Into a tow'ring passion.<br>Hor. Peace! Who comes here?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enter young Osric, a courtier.<br>-<br>Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.<br>Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this<br>waterfly?<br>Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.<br>Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a<br>vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be<br>lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis<br>a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.<br><br>Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart<br>a thing to you from his Majesty.<br>Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your<br>bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.<br>Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.<br>Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.<br>Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.<br>Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.<br>Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot<br>tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that<br>he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter-<br>Ham. I beseech you remember.<br>[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]<br>Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is<br>newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman,<br>full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and<br>great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card<br>or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of<br>what part a gentleman would see.<br>Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I<br><br>know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of<br>memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail.<br>But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great<br>article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make<br>true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else<br>would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.<br>Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.<br>Ham. The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more<br>rawer breath<br>Osr. Sir?<br>Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another<br>tongue? You will do't, sir, really.<br>Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman<br>Osr. Of Laertes?<br>Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are<br>spent.<br>Ham. Of him, sir.<br>Osr. I know you are not ignorant-<br>Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not<br>much approve me. Well, sir?<br><br>Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-<br>Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in<br>excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.<br>Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him<br>by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.<br>Ham. What's his weapon?<br>Osr. Rapier and dagger.<br>Ham. That's two of his weapons- but well.<br>Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;<br>against the which he has impon'd, as I take it, six French<br>rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and<br>so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,<br>very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of<br>very liberal conceit.<br>Ham. What call you the carriages?<br>Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent<br>ere you had done.<br>Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.<br>Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could<br>carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.<br><br>But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their<br>assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages: that's the French<br>bet against the Danish. Why is this all impon'd, as you call it?<br>Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between<br>yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath<br>laid on twelve for nine, and it would come to immediate trial<br>if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.<br>Ham. How if I answer no?<br>Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.<br>Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,<br>it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be<br>brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,<br>I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my<br>shame and the odd hits.<br>Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?<br>Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.<br>Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.<br>Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it<br>himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.<br>Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.<br><br>Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,<br>and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes<br>on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter-<br>a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and<br>through the most fann'd and winnowed opinions; and do but blow<br>them to their trial-the bubbles are out,<br></div>

No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!<br>The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.                 [Dies.]<br>Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.<br>Treachery!

            <div class='col-md body'>Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;<br>No medicine in the world can do thee good.<br>In thee there is not half an hour of life.<br>The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,<br>Unbated and envenom'd. The foul practice<br>Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,<br>Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.<br>I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.<br><br>Ham. The point envenom'd too?<br>Then, venom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.<br>All. Treason! treason!<br>King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.<br>Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,<br>Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?<br>Follow my mother.                                 King dies.<br>Laer.

Dies.<br>Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.<br>I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!<br>You that look pale and tremble at this chance,<br>That are but mutes or audience to this act,<br>Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,<br>Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-<br>But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;<br>Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright<br><br>To the unsatisfied.<br>Hor. Never believe it.<br>I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.<br>Here's yet some liquor left.<br>Ham. As th'art a man,<br>Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.<br>O good Horatio, what a wounded name<br>(Things standing thus unknown) shall live behind me!<br>If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,<br>Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br>And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br>To tell my story.         [March afar off, and shot within.]<br>What warlike noise is this?<br>Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,<br>To the ambassadors of England gives<br>This warlike volley.<br>Ham. O, I die, Horatio!<br>The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.<br>I cannot live to hear the news from England,<br>But I do prophesy th' election lights<br><br>On Fortinbras.

            <div class='col-md body'>Fort. Where is this sight?<br>Hor. What is it you will see?<br>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.<br>Fort. This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,<br>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell<br>That thou so many princes at a shot<br>So bloodily hast struck.<br>Ambassador.

All this can I<br>Truly deliver.<br>Fort. Let us haste to hear it,<br><br>And call the noblest to the audience.<br>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.<br>I have some rights of memory in this kingdom<br>Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.<br>Hor.
