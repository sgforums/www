Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,<br>trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our<br>players do, I had as live the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do<br>not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all<br>gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)<br>whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a<br>temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the<br>soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to<br>tatters, to very rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who<br>(for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb<br>shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing<br>Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.<br>Player. I warrant your honour.<br>Ham. Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your<br>tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with<br>this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of<br>nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,<br><br>whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as<br>'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature,<br>scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his<br>form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though<br>it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious<br>grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance<br>o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I<br>have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to<br>speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of<br>Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so<br>strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's<br>journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated<br>humanity so abominably.<br>Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.<br>Ham. O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns<br>speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them<br>that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren<br>spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary<br>question of the play be then to be considered. That's villanous<br>and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.<br><br>Exeunt Players.<br></div>

[To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once<br>i' th' university, you say?<br>Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.<br>Ham. What did you enact?<br>Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus<br>kill'd me.<br>Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be<br>the players ready.<br>Ros. Ay, my lord.

You are merry, my lord.<br>Ham. Who, I?<br>Oph. Ay, my lord.<br>Ham. O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?<br>For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died<br>within 's two hours.<br>Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.<br>Ham. So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a<br>suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten<br>yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life<br>half a year.

Are all the rest come back?<br>Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?<br><br>Laer. Know you the hand?<br>King. 'Tis Hamlet's character.

If it be so, Laertes<br>(As how should it be so? how otherwise?),<br>Will you be rul'd by me?<br>Laer. Ay my lord,<br>So you will not o'errule me to a peace.<br>King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd<br>As checking at his voyage, and that he means<br>No more to undertake it, I will work him<br>To exploit now ripe in my device,<br>Under the which he shall not choose but fall;<br>And for his death no wind<br>But even his mother shall uncharge the practice<br><br>And call it accident.<br>Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;<br>The rather, if you could devise it so<br>That I might be the organ.<br>King. It falls right.<br>You have been talk'd of since your travel much,<br>And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality<br>Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts<br>Did not together pluck such envy from him<br>As did that one; and that, in my regard,<br>Of the unworthiest siege.<br>Laer. What part is that, my lord?<br>King. A very riband in the cap of youth-<br>Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes<br>The light and careless livery that it wears<br>Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,<br>Importing health and graveness. Two months since<br>Here was a gentleman of Normandy.<br>I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,<br>And they can well on horseback; but this gallant<br><br>Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,<br>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse<br>As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd<br>With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought<br>That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,<br>Come short of what he did.<br>Laer. A Norman was't?<br>King. A Norman.<br>Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.<br>King. The very same.<br>Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed<br>And gem of all the nation.<br>King. He made confession of you;<br>And gave you such a masterly report<br>For art and exercise in your defence,<br>And for your rapier most especially,<br>That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed<br>If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation<br>He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,<br>If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his<br><br>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy<br>That he could nothing do but wish and beg<br>Your sudden coming o'er to play with you.<br>Now, out of this-<br>Laer. What out of this, my lord?<br>King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?<br>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,<br>A face without a heart,'<br>Laer. Why ask you this?<br>King. Not that I think you did not love your father;<br>But that I know love is begun by time,<br>And that I see, in passages of proof,<br>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br>There lives within the very flame of love<br>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;<br>And nothing is at a like goodness still;<br>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,<br>Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,<br>We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,<br>And hath abatements and delays as many<br><br>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br>And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,<br>That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!<br>Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake<br>To show yourself your father's son in deed<br>More than in words?<br>Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!<br>King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;<br>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,<br>Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.<br>Will return'd shall know you are come home.<br>We'll put on those shall praise your excellence<br>And set a double varnish on the fame<br>The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together<br>And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,<br>Most generous, and free from all contriving,<br>Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,<br>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br>A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,<br>Requite him for your father.<br><br>Laer. I will do't!<br>And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.<br>I bought an unction of a mountebank,<br>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br>Collected from all simples that have virtue<br>Under the moon, can save the thing from death<br>This is but scratch'd withal.

No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty<br>enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,<br>Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is<br>earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he<br>was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel?<br>Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,<br>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.<br>O, that that earth which kept the world in awe<br>Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!<br>But soft! but soft! aside!
