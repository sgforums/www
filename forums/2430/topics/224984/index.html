Whenever a sultan or a head of state travels, he is often preceded by a colourful parade," said Sara Roslan, a dancer from eastern Sabah state dressed in a red and black traditional costume.<br><br>Dancers also bore golden umbrellas and curved knives called keris, symbolising protection of the king from weather and danger.<br><br>Malaysians also called in sometimes tearful tributes to national television, which broadcast the king's farewell ceremony.<br><br>Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin, who has a son and daughter, was proclaimed Malaysia's 12th king in April, 2002.<br><br>The country on Wednesday is due to see the proclamation of its 13th king, the sultan of Terengganu state, Mizan Zainal Abidin, who at 44, will be one of the nation's youngest monarchs ever.<br><br>Constitutionally, the position of king is rotated every five years among the traditional Malay rulers of nine states. The monarch has largely ceremonial duties and acts on the advice of the cabinet.<br><br>However, he commands the respect of Malaysians, especially the country's majority ethnic Malays, who maintain a loyalty to rulers that can be traced back to Malay sultanates centuries ago.<br><br>The king or agong, as he is known, is also the majority-Muslim country's symbolic head of Islam and the nominal chief of the military.<br><br>"The agong was a people's king. He was not a controversial figure but he carried out his duties well," said one onlooker at the airport.<br><br><img src="http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/7908/captkl10512120459malayspg9.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/2972/captkl10612120501malayslk9.jpg"><img src="http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/919/captkl10312120503malaysyt4.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/9910/r2460409469kx1.jpg"><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/9474/l2265615ku8.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/2752/r762324847jpgx380y323sigs1.jpg"><img src="http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/8172/r3692204784mg5.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Malaysia swore in a new king, its second-youngest ever, on Wednesday amid some controversy over the amount of money spent on the country's little-known royals.<br><br>Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, 44, wore canary-yellow robes and jewel-encrusted headgear for the glittering ceremony at the national palace, which is to be replaced in a few years at a cost to taxpayers of 400 million ringgit ($113 million).<br><br>Malaysia has nine sultans and each takes turn to rule for five years as king, signing legislation into law and appointing judges but always on the premier's advice.<br><br>A symbolic role, the king embodies Malaysia's heritage as a collection of Muslim kingdoms and also serves as titular head of the armed forces and keeper of the official religion, Islam.<br><br>But since the government announced plans last month for a new palace, despite painful budget cut-backs, the opposition has raised some awkward questions about the royal upkeep.<br><br>The new palace is to be built atop a hill on 240 acres (97 hectares) and is expected to be finished in 2009.<br><br>"The question we have in mind now is whether we really need a new palace at a time when our economy is so sluggish," said Ronnie Liu, a leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party.<br><br>"To us, the old palace is still in good condition and sufficient for its functions and purposes."<br><br>Sultan Mizan, from the oil-endowed northeastern state of Terengganu, held his palms open in prayer during the ceremony, watched by fellow royals and government officials.<br><br>A far less colourful figure than some of his predecessors as king or his fellow sultans, the new monarch attended Britain's Sandhurst Royal Military Academy and served as a land administrator before succeeding to the throne of Terengganu.<br><br>The royal family of southern Johor state has captured the most headlines over the years. Mahmood Iskandar, now the sultan of Johor and a former king, was once convicted of manslaughter but pardoned by his father who was then the sultan.<br><br>One of the new king's cousins described Sultan Mizan as a quiet family man.<br><br>"He's humble and down to earth," he said, adding: "He loves horses. He competes internationally in horse endurance events."<br><br>Mizan will be Malaysia's 13th king, or Yang di-Pertuan Agong, since the country gained independence from Britain in 1957. He replaced Syed Sirajuddin Syed Putra Jamalullail, ruler of Perlis state.</div>
