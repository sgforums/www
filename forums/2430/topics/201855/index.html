Tengku Datuk Puteri Kamariah is the half-sister of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang.<br><br>About six hours later, Tunku Shahzan died at the Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital. Police had earlier arrested him at the villa.<br><br>Tunku Ismail, who is a member of the Negri Sembilan royalty, is reported to be in stable condition after undergoing an operation at the same hospital.<br><br>Tunku Shahzan, who died at 7.35pm, was believed to have been under the influence of designer drugs when he tried to slash his father repeatedly for no apparent reason. He was the youngest of the coupleÂ’s eight children.<br><br>A relative living next to the villa, Tengku Ahmad Faisal Tengku Abdul Jamil, said Tunku Shahzan was acting strangely.<br><br>Â“He first jumped out of the side balcony and walked on the fibreglass roof before jumping into my house compound,Â” said Tengku Ahmad Faisal, who is related to Tengku Datuk Puteri Kamariah.<br><br>Â“He looked strange, and his eyes were red and bulging. When I questioned him, he replied 'Takut, takut', then dashed across the road like a man possessed.Â”<br><br>Sensing something amiss, Tengku Ahmad Faisal went over to Villa Ismaputri to investigate and heard cries for help from the coupleÂ’s maid.<br><br>Â“I saw Tunku Ismail slumped on the chair on the veranda, with a slash wound in his abdomen. With the help of several friends, we chased after Tunku Shahzan, overpowered him and tied him up,Â” he added.<br><br>Tengku Ahmad Faisal said he then went back to the villa and found Tengku Datuk Puteri Kamariah bleeding profusely in the kitchen.<br><br>Â“She was very weak. Before drawing her last breath, she muttered: Â‘Belajar ugama. Kalau nak jual, juallah kereta tu.Â’ (Learn the religion. If you want, sell off the car),Â” recalled Tengku Ahmad Faisal, adding that he did not understand what Tengku Datuk Puteri Kamariah meant.<br><br>Â“She died in my arms.Â”<br><br>At press time, Tunku Ismail, 69, had yet to be informed of his wife's or son's death.<br><br>The tragedy shattered the quiet affluent neighbourhood, and residents there could only shake their heads in disbelief. The shocking news spread within minutes and quickly became the talk of the town.<br><br>State police chief Deputy Comm Datuk Abdul Razak Bokhari said police, who arrived at the villa after receiving a call earlier, had found Tunku Shahzan tied up.<br><br>They also recovered a Â“RamboÂ” knife and a screwdriver, believed to be the murder weapons.<br><br>Â“The case has been classified as murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code. We are still investigating the motive for the attack,Â” he said.<br><br>Tengku Datuk Puteri Kamariah is expected to be buried at the burial ground for royalty in Pekan before Zohor prayers today.  </blockquote><img src="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/nst/Tuesday/Frontpage/pahang1.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://www.thestar.com.my/archives/2006/7/25/nation/n_01grief.jpg"><br>Sultan Ahmad Shah weeping for his half-sister Tengku Datuk Puteri Kamariah who was stabbed to death in her house in Kuantan on Monday.<br><br><img src="http://www.utusan.com.my/pix/2006/0725/Utusan_Malaysia/Muka_Hadapan/mh_01_big.jpg"><br>Crown Prince Tengku Mahkota Tengku Abdullah (in blue t. shirt) helps his father Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah to look at the (mortal remain) of Tengku Kamariah.</div>
