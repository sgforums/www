            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has used his birthday speech to call for economic diversification and better planning to ensure continued prosperity in the tiny oil-rich nation.<br><br>More than 2,000 foreign and local guests gathered at a 1,700-room palace for the speech by the sultan, once rated as the world's richest man.<br><br>"Among the most important things is to ensure that the sources of oil and gas can continue to be enjoyed by the people," the sultan said.<br><br>"Along with that, economic diversification is also important for strengthening the country's survival, including an increase in foreign investment and a more eco-friendly policy."<br><br>The sultan, one of the world's longest-reigning monarchs who is also prime minister, defence minister, finance minister and head of Islam, spoke without a microphone in front of a golden canopy where his two wives sat.<br><br>Hassanal last year married Malaysian television news presenter Azrinaz Mazhar Hakim, 26. She bore him a son, his 11th child, last month.<br><br>In the 13-minute speech akin to a state of the nation address, Hassanal said: "It is not appropriate for us to remain complacent, because we are accustomed to importing everything including fruits and vegetables ... We must strive to improve and stem the perception that our current resources are adequate."<br><br>The sultan's comments re-emphasized a call he made in last year's address when he said Brunei was facing intense competition from its neighbours. He vowed then to take steps to strengthen the financial system and develop an environment conducive to business.<br><br>Brunei, which occupies a sliver of Borneo island, is Southeast Asia's third-largest oil producer. It is also the world's fourth-largest producer of liquefied natural gas.<br><br>"We must plan further and that includes acquiring productive and professional human resources," said the sultan.<br><br>"We should prepare ourselves with the appropriate skills if we are to compete with others in all aspects," he said.<br><br>Last year the oil and gas sector accounted for 93 percent of Brunei's total exports.<br><br>Official figures say the country had a population of about 341,000 in 2002, and the mineral wealth has brought the citizens one of the highest per capita incomes in Asia.<br><br>There is no personal income tax, and education and healthcare are free. Houses, cars and even pilgrimages to Mecca are subsidized.<br><br>Hassanal did not mention record high global crude prices, which on Friday broached 78 dollars per barrel. But he noted without giving figures "that government revenue and financial standing have improved lately", and announced a pay rise for civil servants. Most people in Brunei are employed by the government.<br><br>The sultan's Malay Muslim absolute monarchy dates back to the 14th century.<br><br>In a report in March, the United States Department of State said the sultan "governed under emergency powers that place few limits on his power."<br><br>Such thoughts seemed far from the minds of onlookers like Mohammed Akram Hossain, 34, who waited earlier Saturday for the sultan's motorcade to arrive for a ceremony at a city stadium.<br><br>"In Brunei, all men like the sultan," a smiling Hossain said.<br><br>"Every year I come," said the Bangladeshi, a 10-year Brunei resident who said he runs a construction firm. He is one of tens of thousands of foreigners working in the country.<br><br>Hassanal was welcomed with a 21-gun cannon salute at the stadium, watched over by his goateed image displayed on surrounding buildings.<br><br>Wearing a pillbox hat and military dress tunic bearing several medals, he walked onto the field under a parasol to inspect a military honour guard to the sound of bagpipes.<br><br>The sultan's celebration was to continue into the evening with a state banquet attended by 10,000 guests including leaders of neighbouring countries.<br><br>The sultan was crowned on August 1, 1968 and Brunei achieved full independence from Britain on January 1, 1984.</blockquote></div>
