Stunner!</strong><br><br>STUNNING student Ana Ferreira told last night of the moment she was groped by Prince William.<br><br>The 18-year-old recalled: "I was a little bit drunk myself but felt something brush my brea<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>st.<br><br>"I thought it couldnÂ’t be the future king Â— but now I've seen the picture it's no wonder he has a smile on his face! He has big manly hands and certainly knows what to do with them."<br><br><img src="http://images.thesun.co.uk/picture/0,,2007140484,00.jpg"><br><strong>Prince "Hands" William</strong><br><br>Ana, studying INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, went to Elements nightclub in Bournemouth, Dorset, to party to Latin tunes.<br><br>Wills, 24, was downing pints of Stella and shots of sambuca with Household Cavalry pals on his first night off since starting a tank commander course at Bovington, Dorset.<br><br>Ana said: "Word went round that William was in a section playing cheesy '80s music so we went to look. He was dancing, looking a bit wooden Â— I don't think he would be any good at the samba! But there were a lot of girls hanging around him and he was posing for pictures."<br><br>Strapping 6ft 3in Wills towered over 5ft 4in Ana. She said: "He had me on one arm and my friend Cecilia on the other.<br><br>"I didn't really know what to do so made a silly gesture with my hand, giving a big peace sign. Now as you can see William clearly knew what HE was doing with his hand!"<br><br>Ana emailed the photo to her family in north-east Brazil. She said: "My mother thought it was very funny. She is pleased I met Prince William even though he was a little naughty."<br><br>William was snapped on the same night with leggy blonde Lisa Agar, 19. He invited her back to his barracks for a nightcap and she left at 4.15am when he said he had to go to bed.<br><br>Last night a royal source said Wills would have to grovel to girlfriend Kate Middleton, 25, when they meet this weekend.<br><br><img src="http://images.thesun.co.uk/picture/0,,2007140477,00.jpg"><br><strong>Kate ... girlfriend.. Stunned</strong><br><br>The source explained: "Kate and William have a mature relationship but this will be very embarrassing for them both.<br><br>"He must have been mad to pose for pictures in the first place, let alone groping a girl. Can you imagine the fuss if she made a complaint?"<br><br>Wills' brother Harry, 22, was pictured groping TV presenter Natalie Pinkham in 2003 Â— and was seen with her again on Friday at London nightclub Boujis.<br><br>He appeared to grab at a photographer as he left at 3am, then fell over and had to be helped into a Range Rover by his security team.<br><br>Natalie, 28, told The Sun the pair were just pals and Harry only had eyes for girlfriend Chelsy Davy, 21.<br><br>But the source added: "Prince Charles was not happy seeing the pictures of Harry and now he has William groping a girl. It is fair to say both boys will be in for quite a talking to."<br><br>(source: <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007140253,00.html" rel="nofollow">The Sun</a>)</div>
