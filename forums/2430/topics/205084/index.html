            <div class='col-md body'>I also want to play what and which!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>One is The Queen!<br><br>We feel we must curtsey to you, your Majesty! You are grace personified. No, thatÂ’s not a polite way of hinting that you are a bit style-challenged!<br><br>Rather, that you possess the attributes that monarchy is made ofÂ—a keen sense of responsibility, an appreciation of tradition, and true leadership skills. But thatÂ’s not to say that youÂ’re stodgy in any way--who knows, perhaps if you were the monarch you might even throw caution to the wind and abandon those white gloves and that little royal wave.<br><br>You may find that your natural ability to problem solve may lead others to seek out your advice and direction. When itÂ’s needed, you have the ability to take charge whilst maintaining that most British of all personality traitsÂ—the stiff upper lip. And, like the Queen, you may just find youÂ’re able to emerge with a highly quotable quote when itÂ’s least expected. You share Her MajestyÂ’s ability to hold your cards close which may sometimes lead others to wonder whatÂ’s going on behind that placid demeanour, but you know itÂ’s not that youÂ’re cold or removed.<br><br>Perhaps itÂ’s merely that youÂ’re more comfortable providing the calm in the eye of the storm rather than creating the tempest yourself. After all, when is the last time The QueenÂ’s behaviour created headlines? Whilst you may be ready to lead the nation, your love of lifeÂ’s quieter pleasures means that you may find youÂ’re more comfortable with quieter lifestyle away from the spotlight. But thatÂ’s fine. When you choose to exercise the full power of your personality, youÂ’ll find that you are truly the ruler of your own domain!<br><br>I am truly a great monarch...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><a href="http://uk.tickle.com/test/royal/start.html" rel="nofollow">http://uk.tickle.com/test/royal/start.html</a></div>

Yes, you are most like the second in line royal heirÂ—a true blue blood with the common touch.<br><br>As one who recognises their responsibilities, youÂ’d probably be just the type to interrupt your own fun on a marvellous skiing holiday to satisfy the need for a royal photo call. But like Prince William, youÂ’d probably find that once your duties were fulfilled, youÂ’d prefer to retreat back into the privacy of your own worldÂ—and woe be to the photographer who overstepped the royal bounds and captured your private moment for prosperity--that would not make you a happy prince!<br><br>Like the PeopleÂ’s Prince, you are very willing to give but would probably be most comfortable if that could be done in private. If you think about it, you may find that youÂ’re happier with lifeÂ’s simpler pleasures and would eschew the limelight if you couldÂ—if only you werenÂ’t such a charming soul that people seem to gravitate to you! If you were to give a party, who knows who might just try to gatecrash! YouÂ’re most likely the sort that generally prefers quiet, intimate evenings with a few friends rather than big lavish partiesÂ—they may be fun on occasion but youÂ’d probably prefer they werenÂ’t the norm for your own social scene. And whilst you can certainly appreciate lifeÂ’s finer things, if you had the royal treasury at your disposal your trappings would most likely be quality rather than quantity. Do you suffer from WilliamÂ’s conflict of feeling a strong sense of obligation whilst still wanting to march to the beat of your own drummer? DonÂ’t fretÂ—with your natural charm youÂ’ll find that if you set your mind to it, you can manage bothÂ—and still remain the heir to the throne of peopleÂ’s hearts!</div>

When it comes to the finer thingsÂ—you know how to appreciate little luxuriesÂ—if you were a royal your palace would most likely be filled with loads of regal comforts and things that you love.<br><br>Like Fergie, you might find that youÂ’re not wholly comfortable when ensconced in heavily traditionalismÂ—but thatÂ’s not to say if you had to don a hat for a special occasion you would arrive in something sure to generate giggles. YouÂ’d simply make sure that a little life was injected into the party.

You may not quite have the reputation in your circle of being an all out raconteur, as the playboy prince seems to be acquiring, but you probably are viewed as one of the livelier members of your clique.<br><br>WeÂ’d guess that in times past your free spirit might have landed you in a wee spot of trouble with authority figures. Or perhaps, youÂ’ve managed to squeak your way out of many situation's with a bit of wit and lots of laughter.<br><br>For you, reigning royal would mean having a rollicking good time of it. After all, if thereÂ’s fun to be had, parties to attend, youÂ’re most likely willing to take on the job! And would you enjoy the good life! YouÂ’re one who would know how to make the most out of the royal advantages that would come your way and enjoy every minute of it. Never let it be said that if a royal duty waited, you wouldnÂ’t find a party to go to instead! And even if you were forced to work during your gap year, youÂ’d find a way to climb on that bucking bronco and turn work into play. Of course, youÂ’d be the most hip royal goingÂ—knowing all the best clubs, the latest hit songÂ—everything thatÂ’s happening at the moment and who itÂ’s happening to. Wherever fun was to be had, youÂ’d most likely be thereÂ—even if you had to use a fake i.d. to get in!<br><br>I am one rebellious royal.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You probably find that you're a bit of a hybrid when it comes to traditional roles and the modern world.<br><br>You have a genuine appreciation for custom and history but you can preserve that whilst also injecting a touch of the modern sensibility (like Prince Charles planting an organic gardenÂ—a bit traditional combined with the oh-so hip). You may discover that in many situations in life you play the role of second in command and, like the Prince of Wales, find yourself wondering, "Will I ever get to be king?!" But don't fret your position. You probably aren't the sort that just wants to be famous for famous-sake. If you were a royal, you'd most likely want to make a real royal difference. Others recognise this quality and perhaps if you take a step back and look at your own accomplishments you might find that in reality your "on the ground" work has actually achieved more than those standing more firmly in the limelight. And after all, isn't that what's important? So don't worry about winning the spotlightÂ—you most likely already have it from those who count. Just unspool that keen sense of humour and wit that you possess and go out and hug a tree today!<br><br></div>

When it comes to the finer thingsÂ—you know how to appreciate little luxuriesÂ—if you were a royal your palace would most likely be filled with loads of regal comforts and things that you love.<br><br>Like Fergie, you might find that youÂ’re not wholly comfortable when ensconced in heavily traditionalismÂ—but thatÂ’s not to say if you had to don a hat for a special occasion you would arrive in something sure to generate giggles. YouÂ’d simply make sure that a little life was injected into the party. And as far as being the centre of attentionÂ—well you wouldnÂ’t mind posing for the cameras but when those snaps were developed theyÂ’d probably reveal someone playing the fool rather than taking themselves oh so seriously!<br><br>Hmm, dunno why Red Devil boss SAF is on my mind right now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One is Prince Charles!<br><br>Well, perhaps just the mention of Frankenfood or the mere sight of the London Eye rising over the capital's skyline doesn't automatically make you throw a wobbly, but you probably have your own "issues" that you feel just as strongly about.<br><br>And like Prince Charles, you are one who is willing to fight for what you feel is right, even when others disagree. You probably find that you're a bit of a hybrid when it comes to traditional roles and the modern world.<br><br>You have a genuine appreciation for custom and history but you can preserve that whilst also injecting a touch of the modern sensibility (like Prince Charles planting an organic gardenÂ—a bit traditional combined with the oh-so hip). You may discover that in many situations in life you play the role of second in command and, like the Prince of Wales, find yourself wondering, "Will I ever get to be king?!" But don't fret your position. You probably aren't the sort that just wants to be famous for famous-sake. If you were a royal, you'd most likely want to make a real royal difference. Others recognise this quality and perhaps if you take a step back and look at your own accomplishments you might find that in reality your "on the ground" work has actually achieved more than those standing more firmly in the limelight. And after all, isn't that what's important? So don't worry about winning the spotlightÂ—you most likely already have it from those who count. Just unspool that keen sense of humour and wit that you possess and go out and hug a tree today!</div>
