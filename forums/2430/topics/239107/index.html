            <div class='col-md body'>On 22 February 2007, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that Prince Harry will be deployed with his regiment in Iraq. He will serve as part of the 1st Mechanised Brigade of the 3rd (UK) Mechanised Division.<br><br>The Blues and Royals are expected to form part of the force patrolling the Iran-Iraq border with Troop Commander Wales leading a small force tasked with reconnaissance duties using Scimitar tanks.<br><br>This deployment in Iraq will be part of a long-planned rotation of troops. The last member of the British Royal Family to serve in a war zone was Prince Harry's uncle, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, who flew helicopters during the Falklands War in 1982.<br><br>According to a BBC news article, Prince Harry had made it clear that he would leave the army if he was left in safety while his regiment was sent to a war zone. He is scheduled to leave for Iraq in May or June of 2007.</div>

Firstly, the situation in Iraq is already dangerous for any soldier, and we cannot really assume that Prince Harry's presence would make it any more so for him and his men.<br><br>Secondly, it has always been the duty of royalty to lead troops into battle, and Prince Harry is not wrong in following that tradition.<br><br>Lastly, until we have seen real evidence of his performance as a soldier in the field we should not hastily judge the decision to deploy him to Iraq.</div>
