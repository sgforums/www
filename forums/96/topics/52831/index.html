            <div class='col-md body'>My view of MLM. I was like most people drawn by the promise of leverage, finanicial freedom etc.<br><br>The truth of the matter is that only 1 percent of people make money of MLM and they usually the upline. The topcat makes the most money as he is at the top of the pyramid. MLM is actually a product based pyramid scheme.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>The products are secondary as the aim of MLM is promote distributiorship. You have to recruit people who recruit people and the leverage comes from the people recruit people. The business model seems logical but the flawed system as the pyramid is not sustainable mathematically.<br><br>Check things out before commiting! There is more than meets the eye.

            <div class='col-md body'>The MLM talks about the leverage but if you look at the mathematically model. It takes let 50 people to support one MLM based on each spending $300 per month and the next level is 50 by 50 or 2500 and the next level is 2500 x 50, 12500 x 50 is 6.25 Million more than the population of Singapore. It cannot be sustained. The Promise of leverage is but a false hope. People in the States have been involved long before us and they are hurting from it. Learn from them !!!!<br><br>The aim of MLM is not products (products are just the excuse to get by the Pyramid ruling) but distributorship. The top of the pyramid(upline) get leverage from those below (downline). There is no limit of distributionship or people joining. You have situation as someone describe as runaway train with no driver.In the normal market there supply and demand in MLM there is will be too many supply and the demand may not be there.<br><br>If the products are sooo good why are they not marketed in the normal way thro supermark etc. It is because the products are many of the time priced many times over the similar products and MLM is the only way to get the products out.They say you are buying from your own shop who cares if it is expensive as long as you are saving money. But if the products are tooo expensive youb are not really saviing money you are in fact spending more to get that retail profit.<br><br>IHMO my 2 cents worth</div>

It takes let 50 people to support one MLM based on each spending $300 per month and the next level is 50 by 50 or 2500 and the next level is 2500 x 50, 12500 x 50 is 6.25 Million more than the population of Singapore. It cannot be sustained. The Promise of leverage is but a false hope. People in the States have been involved long before us and they are hurting from it. Learn from them !!!!<br><br>The aim of MLM is not products (products are just the excuse to get by the Pyramid ruling) but distributorship. The top of the pyramid(upline) get leverage from those below (downline). There is no limit of distributionship or people joining. You have situation as someone describe as runaway train with no driver.In the normal market there supply and demand in MLM there is will be too many supply and the demand may not be there.<br><br>If the products are sooo good why are they not marketed in the normal way thro supermark etc. It is because the products are many of the time priced many times over the similar products and MLM is the only way to get the products out.They say you are buying from your own shop who cares if it is expensive as long as you are saving money. But if the products are tooo expensive youb are not really saviing money you are in fact spending more to get that retail profit.<br><br>IHMO my 2 cents worth</div></blockquote>Maybe, ONLY Maybe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
