U believe in karma, u believe in kwanyin and buddha? 5 questions for u<br><br>1) have u, in  any senses feel kwan yin and buddha???<br><br>2) what exactly is buddhism? Some pray kwan yin, some dont believe, some burn money believe it will reach hell, and hell is a place u can drive car and some done? some believe in Heaven God some dont, u will all say taoism and culture, but let me tell u something, when being asked, those ppl will say that they are buddhist. And buddhist should only believe in Buddha, but then why i saw alot of kwan yin statue around also? buddist is just not coherent. If it is culture, and logically the money dont reach hell ( do u need science to proove), so WHY DONT EDUCATE THEM. THESE THINGS ARENT CHEAP.<br><br>3) you pray to buddha and kwan yin, but u dun believe they are God, then what makes u think prayers would reach them? they alive until now? u see them? I thought u regard him as only a teacher? Aren't u praying to Buddha like praying to God?? just dun wan to admit that he is God. ( Buddha nvr say that he is God, but the way u treat him, more than a teacher. U pray, u kneel is ok, but u pray)<br><br>4) Karma? so is karma scientifically proven? no of humans life + animal 8000 years ago = today? conservation of life??<br><br>5) Believe in Nature? so WHAt is nature? nature can decide u become Buddha and u r not? hence nature can think? Nature can judge ur karma? so waht is nature? If karma is nature, i tell u what, Mother Theressa becomes Buddha already because she is so kind hearted and nice. If nature only decide by heart.<br><br>I dont usually post such a thread regarding religion, but i HATE it when they say christian is not scientifically proven, and the non-existing of God theory, AS IF their Buddha existence is SCIENTIFICALLY proven and thier Kwan Yin is being sensed by human senses. Is there any difference in PROVING the existence of Buddha and God? no right, so is just by faith. So pls dun mention that God is not scientifically proven , as if Buddha is scientifically proven.<br><br>Thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Thank You</div></blockquote>Please do not use other religions as a basis to justify your own views, especially when no one uses it yet.<br><br>Thats kinda low.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Darkness can be the abscence of light. You can't measure how dark it is, but you can measure how much light there is and that's a fact.<br><br>It still works either way because the point is darkness aka evil does not exist. It's only used to express the lack of light/good.<br><br>Put it this way.. evil is generally regarded as being the bottom of the scale, not the top.</div>
