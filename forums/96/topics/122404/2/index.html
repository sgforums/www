There will be different degrees of seperation, isoliation and emptiness in hell. And hell is a seperation and banishment from God. Does all these answers your question ?

            <div class='col-md body'>Has anyone physically seen God? Has anyone conversed personally with God? If you have, I'd be interested to know.<br><br>Take note that all religions start out with a BELIEF - One believes that the Bible or the Koran is the Word of God. (The Bible was never written in English. Christian scholars had INTERPRETED the Word from ancient texts. Then again, there are many, many biblical texts out there, and it was the Christian scholars who determined that 66 texts are truly the Word of God, and hence formed the Bible. So what you are believing in are selective interpretations of biblical texts.)<br><br>I feel the greatest gift that God (if He exists) has given us (be it in Islam, Christianity or otherwise) is not a chance to enter heaven, but rather the power of CHOICE - that is, to make our own decisions. You may choose to believe His Word, or to refute it. You may choose to believe that there is a Heaven, or believe that this world is the only one we have.<br><br>In the end, we got to respect each other's choices. And if that's the case, there's no need for any argument at all.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all ...<br><br>do read a bit on sociologist Emile Durkheim's Theory of Religion.<br>For me, his theory seems the best explanation for religion. Religion is merely where communities gather together; human is social and we need to socialise, interact ... So religion is the best place for us to do that.<br><br>As for whether we should believe in A god ... DUAL god ... or MANY gods ...<br>i'm agnostic. Meaning ... one god, 2 god, many god its based upon your faith. Have anyone seen god ? heard god ? or even touch god? I mean this mite not be a good explanation as we see in the student-philosopher argument; language is just well relative. But like what Socrates said "I think therefore I am". So i take that my judgement will tell me what to believe ...<br>Agnostic as I am means that I neither believe in God, neither can I disprove the presence of God ...<br><br>some closing words about my thots of evil. Yes, evil is around; and without evil, how can there good ...<br>But i always wonder, if god does/do exist there is already so much evil.<br>If i take god out of the equation, the world would probably still be the same<br>so hell man, why bother???</div>
