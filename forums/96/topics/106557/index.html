            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore girls not that bad what. Most of them quite nice.<br><br>I am a foreigner living in Singapore. I like Singaporean girls much more than Malaysian, or other countries in the region. They are more modern, more sophisticated, more ambitious, generally more intelligent and definitely better educated than most. Besides, the level of affluence in Singapore has produced a generation of very healthy and overall quite attractive girls.<br><br>I like dating Singapore girls. I would NOT want a foreign wife that is only good as a housewife. I would want a wife that is a good match for me, a good partner in terms of intellect... Some one I can confide in, and who has the intelligence to understand my worries, and give me support.<br><br>I dont find Singaporean girls overly arrogant. Proud, yes. But then, men are proud too. At least for those of us who have a spine.<br><br>I feel that giving women education is an excellent move. If the Singaporean men are losing out to the women, it's no one's fault but their own for being such slouches.<br><br>For those who resort to buying a Vietnamese bride, go ahead if it makes you happy. It just means more Singaporean girls for the men (both Singaporean and foreign) who HAVE the looks, money and education to woo Singaporean girls. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Don't worry we'll take good care of them for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I've read the article already and I'm quite agreeable to some extend that Singaporean women are a challenge to love.<br><br>In my opinion, what they need is not primarily the 5Cs but rather a man who has a maximized manhood. That is, the ability to be a real man - doing what a man suppose to excel in - that is, to be the leading role.<br><br>Originally, Man are made to lead. Women are made to adapt to man's orders.<br><br>But somehow, as society grows, things get corrupted. But nevertheless, some things still remain the same - that is, the way the two genders function.<br><br>I still believe that all women are the same. In a way that they all have a soft interior inside them despite of any circumstances, and they all expect man to lead them and make decisions.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  good day ahead!</div>

Singapore is westernizing but not everything is westernizing at the same speed. Guys still feel the need to provide for the gal. In the world we live in now $ is important, though not omnipotent, but alot of things are rated by it. The power to provide is one. So guys will generally feel pressurized. Plus pressure from society? People say the guy "xiao bai lian" and so on. Yes we can say ignore their comments, but thigns are always easier said than done.</div>
