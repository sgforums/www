No one.<br><br>But since you're so confused...maybe try to consult some close friends or people you can trust. Keeping yourself busy and going out with friends to be happy... this kind of "plessure" will only last you for a very short period of time. It's like getting yourself drunk and having a hangover the next day. Therefore, it's not a solution to run away from your problems. Instead, you have to face it and deal with it. You have no other choice.<br><br>What's done is done brother... now is the time to move on and start everything afresh. Erase the past from your mind - free your mind. Start planning for the future. I believe you will have a good future ahead. So start cherishing this moment and build a future for yourself. One must have an objective in life. But if a person have no goals, no plans, or no objective, that person will always go back to his past, brooding over things and not benefit from anything.<br><br>Seriously, I think it's now time to re-build your self-confidence, your mindset about the things around you, and your character... etc... perhaps, by doing so... you may encounter another group of girls coming into your life?? Who knows?! By then I think you TAO TIAH (headache) already ah... hahaha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>By the way, no such chemical called love.
