He has to get in touch with his masculine self before he feels smothered by love. But he also cannot do without it.<br><br>Rubber Band Effect<br><br>Think of the man's affection for you as a rubber band. The more he gives you love, the more it stretches. Until a time whereby it *snaps* much like what will happen to a real rubber band if you stretch it long enough.<br><br>The time whereby it's at is breaking point is also when you feel that suddenly you feel neglected. (The affection level for you has reached its peak, He can give you no more) so you will start to ask him to do funny things like *send me home*, say things like *do you still love?*. Of course you know that he still loves you, but you need the assurance.<br><br>However, at this point in time, the man is a breaking point, the more you try to pull him back, the further he will try to run. Until he breaks, and that may be because why a couple quarrels about such stuffs.<br><br>If you stretch a rubber band tight, and let it go, it will bounce back violently. Same like a man, let him go, let him off for a while, when he is stretched to his limit, he will eventually bounce back, and thats when you will get all the love and affection you need.<br><br>Its natural, and I always tell my galfriends that. Guys will understand it, when they need to go out with friends, do some male bonding, but may be witheld by their partners.<br><br>Hope it helps.

Like I mentioned its really hard to put this into practise, both parties have to be aware of themselves and their emotional beings. You are actually doing very well, its just that your bf does not truely realise the good points of you YET. Once he does, I am sure that he will appreciate all that you have done.<br><br>Perhaps you may want to try this. Its also from the book and if I recall they call it writing a Love Letter.

            <div class='col-md body'>Luc85 writes "*R&amp;R - Rest &amp; Relax<br>HUMANS AND DOLPHINS are the only animals that engage in sex for pleasure. About 100 million acts of sexual intercourse occur daily, says the World Health Organization. Only the female gender has an organ whose sole purpose is to give sexual satisfaction - the clitoris. Are these carnal revelations too raw for you? Then run, run, save yourselfÂ¡K are you still hereÂ¡K you want to know more don't youÂ¡K read onÂ¡K<br><br>Sex revelation 1<br>The best cure for menstrual cramps isÂ¡K<br>Ladies, what's the best cure for menstrual cramps? An orgasm! The muscle that contracts during cramps is actually the same muscle being released during an orgasm.<br><br>Here's another shocker! Don't be surprised if the next time you have menstrual cramps, you experience an orgasm. Menstrual cramps, yes, pain-pain-painful menstrual cramps, have been known to bring on an orgasm in very rare cases.<br><br>Sex revelation 2<br>This country uses the most condomsÂ¡K<br>In Nevada, it's legal to have sex without a condom. In Japan, birth control pills are illegal. So which country do you think uses the most condoms?<br>The winner is the Land of the Rising Sun.<br>Today in Japan, condoms are available, literally, right at your doorsteps. Like cosmetics, they're sold door to door by women, mainly to women.<br><br>Sex revelation 3<br>Semen tastes likeÂ¡K<br>Lipstick was said to be invented in the early Egyptian days for women who specialized in oral sex. They wanted their lips to look like their vulva, so as to appear more inviting to Egyptian men.<br><br>Generally, the taste of a man's semen depends on his diet. And there're about 7 calories in a teaspoon of semen.<br>Alkaline-based food, like fish and some meat, produces a buttery, fishy taste in the semen. Garlic gives a garlicky taste while dairy products a foul taste. The foulest taste of them all is said to be produced by eating asparagus. Acidic fruits and alcohol (except processed liquors) give it a sweet tang.<br>By the way, oral sex firms up the lower face nicely.<br><br>Sex revelation 4<br>I have a headache, honeyÂ¡K<br>Alas, wives can no longer use headache as an excuse not to have sex with their husbandsÂ¡K unless their husbands still don't know that sex is in fact one of the best ways to get rid of a headache. During sexual intercourse, the release of endorphins (pain relieving hormones with properties similar to morphine) acts as a pain-suppressant for the headache, relieving you of your immediate discomfort. So you feel a lot better.<br>But in rare cases, sex can also cause headaches. If you suffer from these sex headaches frequently, give your General Practitioner a visit.<br><br>Do you know what's a common side effect of using Viagra? Bingo! It's headache.<br><br>Sex revelation 5<br>Sexy numbers that put you to zzzÂ¡K<br>An average lovemaking session burns off about 100 calories.<br><br>It takes 17 muscles to smile, and 116 muscles to climax.<br><br>The fastest speed for erotic sensations to travel from underneath the skin to the brain is timed at 251.16 km per hour.<br><br>You can hope for more, but an orgasm generally lasts around 3-11 seconds, and the orgasmic contractions for both men and women are on par at 0.8 seconds intervals.<br><br>The bigger the orgasm, the sounder you'll sleep. But take note, having multiple orgasms, let's say 20 times or more per hour, can induce coma.<br><br>Sex revelation 6<br>Size mattersÂ¡K<br>During foreplay, a woman's breast can increase up to as much as 25% - not that this happens every time of course. In response to the sexual stimulations, the increase in blood flow also often causes the veins in the breasts to show more obviously.<br><br>Since we're onto the subject of size, here's a piece of good news going out to fleshy women out there. A worldwide survey of men's tastes in women revealed that more men preferred plump women to slim ones. So much for fat hope, ay?<br><br>Sex revelation 7<br>Chocolate + coffee makes a nymphomaniacÂ¡K<br>If you're a chocolate addict, it sure explains a lot of things.<br>Well, chocolate contains phenylethylamine (PEA), the very chemical that flows through the veins of someone in love. You know what I mean, it's responsible for the feelings responding to love - the sensations of euphoria, bliss and sexual attraction.<br>In addition, chocolate also contains phytosteral, a plant substance that may mimic human sex hormones. (Perhaps this explains why some women crave for chocolates just before menstruation, when their hormone levels dip.) Add up these 2 chemicals and you understand why chocolate is referred to as a sex food. Right, dear chocolate addict?<br><br>And if you're a chocolate addict and a coffee drinker, blessed art thou. According to the Archives of General Medicine, coffee drinkers have sex more often and enjoy it more than non-coffee drinkers.<br><br>I wonder if chocolate and coffee explain why statistics indicate that Australian women are the most likely to have sex on the first date?<br><br>Sex revelation 8<br>Are these sex laws for realÂ¡K<br>Many thought the ban on chewing gum was ludicrous. Wait till you read about these laws in US taken off the internet:<br><br>In San Francisco, 1964, a jury awarded US$50,000 to a woman who claimed a cable car accident turned her into a nymphomaniac.<br><br>In Florida, a woman cannot call a male... honey, sweetie or darling, and she can be arrested for pinching his butt.<br><br>In Oxford, Ohio, women are forbidden to strip naked in front of a man's picture.<br><br>In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, women are not allowed to have sex with a truck driver in a tollbooth.<br><br>In the state of Washington, it's illegal to have sex with an under-16 under any circumstances (and that includes the wedding night)."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject: Female Dictionary<br>&gt; &gt; 1. "Fine"<br>&gt; &gt; This is the word a woman uses at the end of any argument<br>&gt; &gt; that they feel<br>&gt; &gt; they are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use<br>&gt; &gt; fine to describe<br>&gt; &gt; how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of<br>&gt; &gt; those arguments.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 2. "Five minutes"<br>&gt; &gt; This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five<br>&gt; &gt; minutes that your<br>&gt; &gt; football game is going to last before you take out the<br>&gt; &gt; rubbish, so they<br>&gt; &gt; feel that it's an even trade.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 3. "Nothing"<br>&gt; &gt; This means something and you should be on your toes.<br>&gt; &gt; "Nothing" is usually<br>&gt; &gt; used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to<br>&gt; &gt; turn you inside out,<br>&gt; &gt; upside down, backwards, or all three. "Nothing" usually<br>&gt; &gt; signifies an<br>&gt; &gt; argument that will last "Five Minutes" and end with the<br>&gt; &gt; word "Fine".<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 4. "Go Ahead" (with raised eyebrows):<br>&gt; &gt; This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting<br>&gt; &gt; upset over<br>&gt; &gt; "Nothing" and will end with the word "Fine".<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 5. "Go Ahead" (normal eyebrows):<br>&gt; &gt; This means "I give up" or "Do what you want because I<br>&gt; &gt; don't care". You will<br>&gt; &gt; get a raised eyebrow "Go Ahead" in just a few minutes,<br>&gt; &gt; followed by<br>&gt; &gt; "Nothing" and "Fine" and she will talk to you in about<br>&gt; &gt; "Five Minutes" when<br>&gt; &gt; she cools off.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 6. (Loud Sigh)<br>&gt; &gt; This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal<br>&gt; &gt; statement very<br>&gt; &gt; misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you<br>&gt; &gt; are an idiot at<br>&gt; &gt; that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time<br>&gt; &gt; standing here and<br>&gt; &gt; arguing with you over "Nothing".<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 7. (Soft Sigh)<br>&gt; &gt; Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs"<br>&gt; &gt; are one of the few<br>&gt; &gt; things that some men actually understand. She is content.<br>&gt; &gt; Your best bet is<br>&gt; &gt; to not move or breathe and she will stay content.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 8. "Oh !"<br>&gt; &gt; This word followed by any statement is trouble. Example;<br>&gt; &gt; "Oh, let me get<br>&gt; &gt; that". Or, "Oh, I talked to him about that you were doing<br>&gt; &gt; last night". If<br>&gt; &gt; she says "Oh" before a statement, RUN (do not walk) to<br>&gt; &gt; the nearest exit.<br>&gt; &gt; She will tell you that she is "Fine" when she is done<br>&gt; &gt; tossing your clothes<br>&gt; &gt; out the window, but do not expect her to talk to you for<br>&gt; &gt; at least 2 days.<br>&gt; &gt; "Oh" as the lead to a sentence usually signifies that you<br>&gt; &gt; are caught in a<br>&gt; &gt; lie. Do not try to lie more to get out of it, or you will<br>&gt; &gt; get raised<br>&gt; &gt; eyebrows, "Go ahead", followed by acts so unspeakable<br>&gt; &gt; that I can't bring<br>&gt; &gt; myself to write about them.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 9. "That's Okay"<br>&gt; &gt; This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman<br>&gt; &gt; can say to a man.<br>&gt; &gt; "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard<br>&gt; &gt; before paying you<br>&gt; &gt; retributions for whatever it is that you have done.<br>&gt; &gt; "That's Okay" is often<br>&gt; &gt; used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction with a<br>&gt; &gt; raised eyebrow and<br>&gt; &gt; "Go Ahead". At some point in the near future when she has<br>&gt; &gt; plotted and<br>&gt; &gt; planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 10. "Please Do"<br>&gt; &gt; This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is<br>&gt; &gt; giving you the chance<br>&gt; &gt; to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for<br>&gt; &gt; doing whatever it is<br>&gt; &gt; that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the<br>&gt; &gt; truth, so be careful<br>&gt; &gt; and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay".<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 11. "Thanks"<br>&gt; &gt; The woman is thanking you. Do not faint, just say "you're<br>&gt; &gt; welcome".<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 12. "Thanks A Lot !!"<br>&gt; &gt; This is very different to "Thanks". A woman will say,<br>&gt; &gt; "Thanks A Lot!!" when<br>&gt; &gt; she is REALLY pi*sed off at you. It signifies that you<br>&gt; &gt; have hurt her in<br>&gt; &gt; some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud<br>&gt; &gt; Sigh". Be careful not<br>&gt; &gt; to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh", as she will<br>&gt; &gt; only tell you<br>&gt; &gt; "Nothing".<br>&gt; &gt;</div>
