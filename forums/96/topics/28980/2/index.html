            <div class='col-md body'>To Rain Tree<br><br>To continue with my Caveman Theory.<br><br>Sometimes, you may find that your man is quiet, keeping to himself, when you ask him anything he just say nothing nothing nothing. Then suddenly, after ignoring him for a while, he's back to normal as if nothing has happened. Frustrated? Confused? Dont be. Lots of women out there having this same problem.<br><br>To solve the problem, we must first understand why it happens? i.e the cause.<br><br>For women, if they have any problems, they prefer to *speak* it out loud, talk it over with their galfriends. They need to *hear* their problem. They feel better this way and this is how they cope with their problems. Of course if it works for the gals, the gal will also assume it will work for the guy. Thats why the gal will keep asking *why?, anything wrong? tell me tell* as she feels that the guy would be better if he pours everything out.<br><br>But guys are different.<br><br>When guys have problems, they prefer to think it over in their minds, pouring over each and every possibilities. They need peace and most importantly their own *cave*. When a man retreats into his cave, he is saying that *I do not want to be disturbed. Please give me some time alone. When I am done, I will come out and everything will be solved.* So what you as a lady should do is if he goes into his *cave*, ask him *Do you need some time alone? If so I will go *insert whatever you are going to do* and give you your time. Once the guy is out, he will be the loving and caring guy you have always known.<br><br>Most important is to know the signs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hope that helped a bit. 6pm now. Going back home. Bye [/url]</div>
