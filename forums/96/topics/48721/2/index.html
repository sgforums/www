It is all the crush and affections between me and the gals lah. Today there is another one. Me &amp; my colleague (female, married) went to the food court and there is this particular gal in skin tight top keep walking to and fro(playing her hair) in front of  us. My colleague asked me is the gal my friend/someone I know? I told her -NO. My colleague is curious why she behave like that.<br>Feeling shy and just nice this gal's friends meet up with her then the gal and the group left us.<br><br>Well, if a guy keeps asking a gal for her hands/contact no. etc, she might feel agitated and decided not to associate with U -- worst right? Let's say if a guy wait for a gal, someone out there might be faster than U and U ended up with nothing.<br><br>Well, for my encounter with gals in the food court, it is very difficult to know them even if they are still single and say wanted to befriend me. They are also reserved as they might feel that I am a bad guy?<br><br>Unless the 2 keep bumping into each other and chances are that things might look good or else, please do not have high hope<br><br></div>
