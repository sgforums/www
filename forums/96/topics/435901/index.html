            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hi All:</p>
              <p>I'm new to SgForums. I have some unique perceptions and opinions regarding the gender-differential treatment of children. I really hope no one is offended. I believe children should be treasured equally regardless of gender.</p>
              <p>I'm disturbed about the fact that male teachers in Singaporean schools are forced to treat girls better than boys. By "better" I mean one or more of the following:</p>
              <p>1. More compassion<br> 2. More sympathy<br> 3. More respect<br> 4. More gentleness<br> 5. More easiness<br> 6. More empathy<br> 7. More cleanliness<br> 8. More protection<br> 9. More luxury<br> 10. More personal space<br> 11. More privacy<br> 12. More security<br> 13. More freedom<br> 14. More modesty<br> 15. More decency</p>
              <p>I personally feel it is wrong for society to force a male of any age to treat a girl-child "better" than a boy-child.</p>
              <p>On average, the adult woman:<br><br>1. Is physically weaker than the adult man<br>2. Is more emotional than the adult man<br>3. Is better behaved than the adult man<br>4.
               Is far more likely to be a victim of opposite-gender violence [e.g. 
              violence may be sexual, domestic, or spousal abuse] than the adult man<br>5. Can get or be pregnant whereas the adult man can't<br>6. Is physically more delicate than the adult man<br><br>Also,
               it is likely natural for a man to want to treat an adult woman 
              partially over an adult man -- this is seen in many mammalian species. 
              For example in many species of large mammals -- such as bison --, the 
              adult males are rough with each other but tender with the adult females.<br><br>I therefore understand that:<br><br>1. Women need - and should be provided with - more protection against men, than visa versa<br>2. Women need - and should be provided with - more protection against men, than adults of the same gender from each other<br><br>However, the same does not apply to boy-child vs. girl-child.<br><br>I
               believe males of all ages should be taught to be gentle and polite to 
              adult women and to give adult women more space than adult men. This will
               give men/boys a respect for adult women and will help prevent these 
              males from perpetrating domestic violence against their wives and 
              girlfriends. However, males -- of any age -- should never be taught to 
              treat girl-children better than boy-children because this will cause 
              boys to develop an intense and life-long hatred for young girls and a 
              hatred for the macho men who teach these boys to defer to girls. This 
              sexism against boy children will likely cause boys to also despise 
              society and it's irrational norms. <br><br>The average girl is no more 
              weak, innocent, well-behaved, delicate, vulnerable, or sensitive than 
              the average boy of the same age.</p>
              <p>In fact, because the caning of girls is banned, girls will cruelly-exploit this anti-boy sexism and bully boys just for the pleasure of causing trouble when one knows the chances of facing negative consequences of adequate intensity is low enough not to deter these girls from mistreating boys.</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope society understands the heinous ramifications of this pro-girl sexism and stops forcing males -- of all ages -- to treat girl-children better than boy-children. Please tell me I'm not asking for too much.</p>
              <p>It is due to this pro-girl sexism that I don't want to have any children. I don't want my potential son being brutalized by society just because he is a boy. I don't want my potential daughter turning into a vile monster who goes out of her way to mistreat boys just because she knows she'll get away with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Girls, I have a question for you:</p>
              <p>How would you feel you had a significantly younger brother [below 14 years of age] and he was being picked on by stronger girls while innocently minding his own business? How would feel if your little brother reported it and got laughed at by the male professoers? How would you feel if your little brother was caned for simply defending himself against those evil girls? Would you girls join in with those bullies and take pleasure in harming your own little brother just because he is a boy? Or would you do the right thing and protect your younger sibling from those cold-hearted girls?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best Regards,</p>
              <p>CAC</p>

              <p>Aneslayer:</p>
              <p>No child -- boy or girl -- "grows resilient" when subjected to violence. If society continually subjects a male child to the pro-girl sexism I described, the boy will eventually go insane and end up with suicidal and homicidal thoughts. What if the boy acts on these thoughts? What if the boy commits suicide and does so in such a manner that he takes a large number of girls with him? Things like this can and do happen.</p>
              <p>As a human being, you can only take so much abuse from society. At some point you *will* retaliate. After the aforementioned boy has his suicide planned out, he has nothing to lose by "punishing" society by taking its girls with him.</p>
              <p>In the above tragedy both genders are hurt. Wouldn't it be better to prevent such a catastrophy that attempt to recover after it occurs? I think so. The best way to prevent this hypothetical calamity is for society to stop forcing males of all ages to treat girl-children "better" than boy-children.</p>
              <p>I'm doing my part by not having children. I'm not going to offer a boy for society to abuse nor will I offer a girl for society to use as a weapon against boy. Hopefully more and more people will understand the effects of anti-boy sexism and refuse to reproduce. Then society will be forced to change its ways in order to prevent the human population from declining.</p>
              <p>Another important note: Women usually treat children in a genderless manner. It's the men -- who are forced by societal norms -- to treat girls better than boys.</p>
              <p>I don't believing in fighting one injustice by creating another injustice. In not reproducing, I'm practicing a form of civil disobedience in an attempt to fight the unfairness I speak of. I hope others will do the same.</p>
              <p>I think all boys subjected to abusive nature of pro-girl sexism should respond by refusing to have children when they grow up. This will force society to stop mistreating little boys.</p>

              <p>Unless proven by statistics that pro girl sexism leads to "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">suicidal and homicidal thoughts" </span>on boys is actually a trend to be noticed, I take your opinion with just a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>The reactions from people, not just any particular gender, tends to be less dramatic than you figure it would be, else we would have A LOT of such sociopaths lurking among the people. The solution is not on balancing the sexism part, but to educate each individual how they <strong>should </strong>handle upsets of life. You are actually adopting a protective mother hen stance on these... issues(if any). Greenhouse plants most probably can't adapt to the cruelty of nature. </p>
              <p>The "unfairness" you speak of... seems like an isolated case. Bring it up, expose to the media and blow it up to the national level if you intend to fight.</p>
              <p>The current trend is indeed girls over boys... since the strength of boys are pretty much dispensable these days. And the trend will continue into their adulthood. You should see evolution in motion the lifetime :)</p>

              <p>Pro-girl sexism is not an isolated case at all.</p>
              <p>Here is how pro-girl sexism started:<br> <br> It most likely started more than thousands of years ago with a small 
              gang of  strong men [the only male homo-sapien humans existing at the 
              time] who decided that they would treat girls better than boys. The gang
               singled out male individuals and forced them to follow and enforce this
               rule -- they left the females alone. These male individuals joined the 
              gang and -- out of extreme fear -- began following and enforcing the 
              gang's pro-girl, anti-boy rules. More and more male individuals began 
              joining this gang -- out fear for their own safety -- and submitting to 
              their oppressive anti-boy regime. This is how the anti-boy, pro-girl 
              gang got bigger. Members of this gang began teaching their boy-children 
              -- likely through extreme corporal punishments -- to follow these sexist
               rules and pass these rules onto the next generation of children. 
              Fathers who didn't teach their boy-children to follow this sexism were 
              singled out by the gang [which was now big enough to be considered a 
              society] and horrifyingly mistreated along with their helpless sons.<br> <br> This is my theory as to why anti-boy sexism exists. It exists for the 
              same reason many other irrational, un-natural societal norms exists -- 
              they are followed and enforced out of fear of facing social 
              condemnation.<br> <br> This historical gang of humans I describe pretty much had similar rules 
              of most of today's street gangs. If they want you, they force you to 
              join, and if you try to leave, they torture and kill you. If they see 
              you and don't want you, they torture and kill you regardless of your 
              actions.</p>
              <p>The effects of this sexism can be seen in schools such as that of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Pro-girl sexism is not at all innate or instinctive. It is an example of learned behavior that is practiced out of fear and shame.</p>
              <p>BTW, do you have any children? Are you a man or woman? I'm guessing, from the way you talk [no offense], that you are a man.</p>
              <p>Women treat children in a genderless manner. Since you seem to openly-support pro-girl sexism, it's very easy for me to figure that you are male.</p>

              <p>Erm... I actually stated clearly that the trend of girls over boys is in effect and will be for sometime. The isolated case I'm refering is to the victimized boys that you narrated. Just to make you clear.</p>

              <p>Whether isolated or not -- wouldn't it be better to prevent the suicidal/homocidal reaction [from victimized boys] then try to recover after it takes place?</p>
              <p>What would you do if you were consistently bullied, no one defended you, and you weren't allowed to defend yourself? You'd eventually go psycho and do something unspeakable. It's human nature. We can only handle so much oppression before backlashing.</p>
              <p>This "trend" of pro-girl sexism usually causes boys to develop a deep-seated hatred for society and girl-children. This of no surprise to me.</p>
              <p>Much as a despise pro-girl sexism, I don't believe in fighting fire with fire. I just think boys should peacefully protest this injustice by refusing to have kids of their own when they grow up. It's completely legal and no one gets hurt.</p>
              <p>So many people have asked me "when will you have kids?" The obvious answer is "not until society stops pampering girls and abusing boys".</p>
              <p>All children -- regardless of gender -- deserve to be safe from abuse.</p>

              <p>No point doing something with no basis. If you want to prevent ppl from being suicidal/ homicidal... most effective is surveillance. People kill for various reasons not just sexism.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">What would you do if you were consistently bullied, no one defended you, and you weren't allowed to defend yourself? You'd eventually go psycho and do something unspeakable. It's human nature. We can only handle so much oppression before backlashing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">This "trend" of pro-girl sexism usually causes boys to develop a deep-seated hatred for society and girl-children.

              <p>So far at this point you have not proved that "pro girl sexism" leads to "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; "> suicidal/homocidal reaction " </span> How do you think you should eliminate the root cause?</p>

              <p>I dunno what the crap is TS talking about, has there been a rampant bullying of boys by girls? Its mainly boys bully one another, where got girl bully boy lol.</p>

              <p>last time parents pamper boys more , I think some still do, and some parents just favor one of their child that could be either gender so I dun agree they always pamper the girls. we generally treat girls gentler simply becoz they are not as rough as the boys and is this wat TS is refering as abuse?</p>
