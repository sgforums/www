I'm sick of it! You reported in a recent column that many women are staying with boyfriends who treat them badly. I think that should be a wake-up call for all men: If you want to maintain a relationship with a woman, you should be mean.<br>Â—Sad Chad<br><br>Dear Reader:<br>I received several letters like yours after I wrote that column. Men wrote to me complaining that "nice guys get left on the shelf" and that women just want "bad boys." One guy wrote this harrowing description (female readers, take note!):<br><br>"I have co-workers who are, frankly speaking, unambitious, pretty-boy slobs. Every week they tell us about these outrageous sexual exploits with a variety of women. The sad thing is that at least half of these stories are true. I've gone to bars with them and watched, with a mixture of awe and horror, as they played their games with women, each one hypnotizing his target with a unique, calculated, well-practiced con."<br><br>If that cold-blooded description doesn't send a shudder up your turtleneck sweater, I don't know what would. Sadly, I can't doubt what he says because I know too many men who have either admitted to being players, or given me graphic descriptions of other men who were.<br><br>Honestly, I find it so depressing I don't know what to say. Especially since you're right. I know women (heck, I've been one myself) who stick it out with guys who treat them badly. And not just once. Over and over again. It's sickening.<br><br>But for every letter I get from a lonely, nice guy like you, I swear to you, I've gotten a hundred times as many from women who are genuinely looking to date a sweetheart.<br><br>I wish we had some numbers, because I bet they'd be eye opening.

Scientists, deeply puzzled, go back to studying asteroids."<br><br>The good-boys-in-peril phenomenon keeps me up at night. OK, not quite, but it does creep into my mind while I'm stuck in traffic.

Why does it seem that never the twain shall meet?<br><br>To be honest, one big reason is maturity. If you've been meeting a lot of women who throw themselves at schmucks, it's a sad reflection of their high-school mentality. Brash, arrogant guys seem desirable when you're too immature to recognize that they make lousy partners. Women who lack confidence are particularly drawn to narcissistic nincompoops because they subconsciously believe some of that bravado will rub off. They want a boost to their self-esteem. It takes a few years to realize that only nice guys, who are capable of providing true love, care and support, can do that.<br><br>So take heart, oh sad and cynical one. Every 30 seconds some woman finally gets it: Nice guys are the juice. You just have to stay on the dating scene so you can eventually meet them. Too often, nice guys get discouraged, so they stay home and watch the game rather than get shot down, rejected or blown off by some babe who can't see their charms. Don't do that! Grab all your nice guy buddies and hit the bars, take dating seminars, start a revolution! Women everywhere will thank you.<br></div>
