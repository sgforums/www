ONLY a fool will take this gal as this gal has already exposed her true self to the guy in the early days and she is NOT WORTH the effort.<br><br>People will judge U in the 1st meeting, what job U are doing, qualifications, appearance, friendly etc before making a conclusion whether want to devlope further. This is a standard process in our society <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div></blockquote>I agree to this comment to a certain extent, that people are judged conditionally in this society. There's no wrong being judgemental. It's the way we handle the situation that matters.<br><br>If a gal cannot accept a guy because he does not have all the conditions that the gal is looking for but one fine day this guy make his mark (have all the things) and this gal out of a sudden come back to him, will this guy still consider her?<br><br>Well, this is a very hard question to answer. It depends on the guy. If he loves her dearly and had forgiven her for all that she's done to him in the past, then it's okay. Otherwise, it can't be forced, because love cannot be forced. I would be very happy to see that the guy accepts her for all she is and all she has done, because the past is already the past and what's done is done. So let bygones be bygones, and let's not bring them up again.<br><br>Also, love takes two. Now, it's the girl's side. The guy now has made his mark, the girl comes back. It's very hard to say lor. Could it be fate? Could it be that he has grown into a better man? Or perhaps could it be the status thing that attracted her to make her way to him? It could be many explanations and we can't simply tell or jump into conclusions, for it's up to the girl &amp; guy.<br><br>Of course, when we find find a partner, one must also consider the fact that he/she must have a stable job, with a moderate pay to support the future family. This is essential for every couple. It's reality. But to go for status...?? I would rather suggest that you go look for the ones who also have the above mentioned quality - job stability / moderately paid job.<br><br>Last but not least, the above quality is only part of the criteria one should have. Please do not make it the top priority, for character in a person is much much more important, and THAT can last you a lifetime of marriage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
