If a gal is a poly graduate, the min criterion she will go for is that guy's qualification is a Diploma or higher.<br><br>2. It would be best that the guy owns a car... I have a friend who told me this story: There is an admin Staff in his company &amp; she is chased by an Ah Beng who owned a car. After few tries, the gal agree to be that Ah Beng's GF. My friend concluded that so long the guy has a car, it will naturally make things easier --- get what I mean?<br><br>3. Out of 5Cs, the guy must have at least 3 --- Credit Card, Cash, Car/Career or better.<br><br>One thing I wanted to ask U guy --- isn't our life too stressful.

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay... if any partner were to look for such criterias like those mentioned above. (i.e. holds a great job, comes from good schools, owns a Lexus, 4 to 5 Cs... etc..) This list will go on, if a person starts to be judgemental about things.<br><br>You see, relationship is not about what the person have or does not have. Love is not materialistic, and it's so foolish to just look at the status alone.<br><br>No one is perfect. A person can be high in status but low in character, or a person can also be good in character, but not so high in status wise. So, it depends on how we judge others. HOWEVER, when it come to loving a person, that will be a different situation altogether.<br><br>If you see a couple who got together just because of status or wealth, then in time, they will soon find themselves drifting from each other, if there's no love in their relationship anymore.<br>But to see a couple - one is rich; has status, the other is simple - loving each other for a long time... that's exceptional.<br><br>After so much of talking, it all boils down to some conclusions: If you TRULY love somebody, that love must be unconditional. *&amp;* When choosing a partner, choose wisely without unnecessary judgements.<br><br>Last but not least, love is humble. If you "love" a person because he/she is rich or high in status just because u think u'll lose face if u go out with someone who is contradicting to your "criteria", then, it's your problem that you have to deal with lo. it's your pride that u have to deal with. Having ego or self-pride is okay, but Pride itself will kill a relationship, a marriage or a friendship.</div>
