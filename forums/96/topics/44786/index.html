THIS IS THE TRUTH AND THIS IS MOST PROBABLY A FACT. also i quote again 'understands me'. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE for a girl to understand yourself (although i can guaran-DAMN-tee that i 99% understand myself at my age of 22++). i give up on this 2 things u quoted. it is simply not possible to achieve. if it is possible, why r there so many complain cases of girls saying their bf or husband never spend enff time with them. instead in our very and very real own sg world, if u really wanna look for a partner, it should be the other way round.<br>but basically now, i also have your mentality although i know what is the 'correct' mentality to have a gf. so what can i say??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
