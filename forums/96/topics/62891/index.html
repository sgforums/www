She is in her early 30s and not much time left to be frank. My friend is also keen in settling down soon as he is not young either. she is old enough to think for her future and by this time, she still CANNOT so do, i think no one can help her.<br><br>I feel she is matured enough not to play the game of when my friend keep contacting her, she will play hard to get kind of thing liao. What is the problems of being persistence? If by the end of the day, this lady cannot solve her personal problems (by the way, her family background is also very complicated resulting her to behave a bit strange) then, no point to press on.<br><br>U seem to be an expert in going after gals, why not share some tricks here for we guys especially those single ones so as to settle our "personal happiness" soon?<br><br>Hope to hear from U.</div>

If a girl like a guy she won't test such a long time, and everything the guy do the girl always can give themselve excuse that the guy is doing it for good. I think her behaviour she rather be single than torturing your friend for whole life. I agree that guys should put in affort but there is a limit, else be sure that you are so "nice" forever don't ever think that after you get her you can relax. </strong><br><br><strong>Not even started a relationship yet should open up yourself to more chance and choices, there is no such think as testing before a relationship before really get along daily. Even  though both are couple and never stay together evryday for 1 to 2 years you won't see the true colour.</strong><br><br><strong>There is not such thing as "she will change", "maybe after give birth she will change", maybe after a couple of year she will be better.<br>you guys can wait long long.<br><br>If you love a person, you better to telk yourself to accept his or her worst before you look for a long term relation. Things like digging nose, lazy, body odour........ many many..</strong><br><br>my 1 cents<br><br></div>
