But I prepared 2 weeks in advance. I started with the present. I hunted around for a Sapphire necklace, her birth stone. I got one at Meyson...but the packaging sucks. So I decided to change that. I went to the beach...collected shells...could not get all the types that I need and went hunting for shells...I need one of those oyster shell types...and I finally found one at a Collectors shell shop at SUNTEC...and then I went to Bodyshop and bought a packet of Oceanus potpourri...I saw some soap beads in the shape of a dolphin with Oceanus shower gel in it...and grab a couple too...and headed home...then I started to polish the shells that I have...it was tedious...and took me 4 nights to finish polishing all of them...then I went on to apply clear lacquer on them which took another 3 days....after which they looked like they were up for sale. Then I started making a box...a big one 210 x 300 x 60...after completing that...I laid the bottom with shimmering rainbow paper to created a feeling of water reflections...then I pour the potpourri into the box...and since they are blue...they look like the ocean itself....and then in went the shells that I have polished...63 of them to be exact...the soap dolphins followed and the look like they were jumping out of the ocean...she is a worshipper of these lovely mammals...and then finally the oyster shell sat in the middle of the whole thing...with the sapphire Necklace inside...after a few drops of Oceanus Aromatherapy Oil, my present is complete.<br><br>I went on to prepare for the day...of course I had to apply for leave...and in order to make sure everything went right...I rehearsed everything and timed myself. (Perfection only comes with practice remember?) The first calculation I did was how much aromatherapy oil placed around the house was need for the scent to fill the house in 15 minutes. I got the placing and amount needed and went on to see where I would need to place candles in the house for the house to be only lighted by candles...not too dark and not too bright...it took 37 candles...placed at various places in the house to achieve that effect. And then again I have to make sure that I would be able to place and light all of them in 15 minutes. This 15 minutes is crucial...<br><br>Finally came the preparation for food...the menu is set...Black Pepper Rib Eye Steak as the main dish, Cream of Chowder for soup...Italian sausages and ham as the side dish, with boiled carrots and broccoli for the vegetables. Of course, red wine to go with the steak is a must.<br><br>The big day came...we went for a movie...Miss Congeniality....after the movie we went back to my house...I started to cook...and she watched...occasionally helping with the soup and vegetables. After the cooking is done...we were both dirty and sticky and it's already 7p.m. just as I planned ...I suggested a shower...which is of course part of my plan...and I dashed into the shower first...and was done in 5 minutes...I came out and she was sulking...asking why I did not let her go first as usual...I just smile and kissed her saying I'm sorry.. and hassled her into the shower...she normally takes 15 minutes...and that's all I have...I placed and light the aromatherapy burners and the candles around the house as rehearsed...turn on some soft Jazz music...and then lay the food on the table...lighted the candles for the table...poured the wine...and placed the present...underneath the table on another chair where the tablecloth was long enough to hid it. She came out only after 30 minutes...which was longer than usual... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>She was surprise at the great change in the atmosphere of the house in just 30 minutes...as planned...everything was perfect...the lights...the scent...the food...and of course us...I lead her to the chair and she was smiling even in her eyes...the dinner started with a toast of the wine and we went on to eating the rest of the food...we did not talk much...most of the time just looking at each others eyes...smiling and holding hands...after finishing almost all the food...I kissed her hands and ask her if she like everything so far...she smiled and nod shyly...she turned...and took out a small present...and said happy valentines day to me...I opened it...and it's a Brun Baffel Wallet...something I wanted for a long time...I smiled said thank you and lean over to kiss her...and then I took the present I have prepared out from under the table...I kissed her hands and then placed the box in her hands...<br><br>She opened  the box and her hands shivered...tears started to well up in her eyes...and she hug me so tightly...telling me how much she love me and how thankful she is for today...I whispered gently into her ears... "You are worth it...worth everything I did..." I kiss her earlobes gently...and she looked at me with the pair of big teary eyes...and hugged me again...and we started to dance to the soft music till the end of Valentine's Day....<br><br>- My Valentine day story....by Callan Chua</div>
