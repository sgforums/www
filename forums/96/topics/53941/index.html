It's also a good thing that you are understanding and caring enough to support him by his side throughout this relationship.<br><br>However, from what you had described about how you are beginning to feel tired and all... maybe, if you still have a chance to meet up with your boyfriend during his off-days or weekends, try communicating with him and tell him what you feel all these while. Tell him also that you understand his situation so that he'll not misunderstand your statement.<br><br>The most important thing in a relationship that I would still wanna stress is: Communication and Emotional Openess (means saying what u feel and being expressive in a positive way).<br><br>If you've got any further doubts or problems, just post here again. I'll try my best to help.</div>

Passion is still a passion, but it seemed that time is the factor that borth of you should consider... you must find time with him that he could give time for the relationship for both of you... As many had said, it takes two to build up a relationship... So he too must commit in the relationship to make it a whole, regardless whether he has work....<br>Cos even Im the busiest, i ll definitely find time for my missing rib...<br>So if he is willing, den both of you must co-operate together to find time for each other or as you said, this relationship will fall apart...<br>Do it asap or the consequence won't be as delightful as you can imagined...</div>
