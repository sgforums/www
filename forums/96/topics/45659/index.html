People who point at their wrist while asking for the time....I know where my watch is, pal......where the f*ck's yours? ... Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is?<br><br>2. People who are willing to get off their arse to search the entire room for the TV remote because they refuse to walk to the TV and change the channel manually.<br><br>3. People say "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too".......... F*cking right! What good is a cake if you can't eat it?<br><br>4. People say "it's always the last place you look". Of course it is........Why the f*ck would you keep looking after you've found it?.......Do people do this? Who and where are they?<br><br>5. People say while watching a film "did you see that?".........No tosser, I paid $12 to come to the cinema and stare at the f*cking floor.<br><br>6. People who ask "Can I ask you a question?"......Didn't really give me a choice there, did you sunshine?<br><br>7. Something is 'new and improved!'.......Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it......If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it.<br><br>8. People say "life is short"......What the f*ck??......Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever f*cking does!!.......What can you do that's longer?<br><br>9. You are waiting for the bus and someone asks "Has the bus come yet?"........If the bus came would I be standing here, Knobhead?<br><br>10. People who say things like 'My eyes aren't what they used to be'........So what did they used to be? ears, Wellington boots?<br><br>11. You are eating something and someone asks 'Is that nice?'.........No it's really revolting I always eat stuff I hate.<br><br>12. People who announce they are going to the toilet.......Thanks that's an image I really didn't need.<br><br>13. McDonalds staff who pretend they don't understand you unless you insert the 'Mc' before the item you are ordering.....It's has to<br>be a McChicken Burger, just say "a Chicken Burger" and u will get a blank look...........Well I'll have a McStraw and jam it in your McEyes you McTosser.<br><br>14. When you're involved in a accident and someone asks 'are you alright?'...... Yes, fine thanks, I'll just pick up my limbs and be off.</div>
