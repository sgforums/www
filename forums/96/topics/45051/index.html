See them bring different bf come out, sometimes have the urge to warn those guys but I will lose the friendship with the girls. Haiz....so end up, I juz keep quiet.<br><br>Well, if the guy is sensitive enuff, I think they will know, and they can tell if their gf is two-timing around. I have been thru that stage of life...painful experience, but I learn and grow up from it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To the guys:<br><br>If all you want is to have some fun and enjoy her company. Who cares whether she is attached or not, right? Just have fun. Don't even need to ask her. She don't say, you don't care.<br><br>If you are looking for a serious gf, you have to be frank with her. If she say she is single when in fact she is 2-timing you. Then good luck to you as you know her real character before it is too late.<br><br>To the girls who want to "pretend" to be single:<br><br>If the guy is also out having fun only, it is OK. But if the guy is those very serious types please be honest with him. I have a lot of experiences of wanting to be serious with girls and they welcome all the attention, then when I make a move....., whoa lau, they say they got bf. Very disappointed and sometimes hurt.<br><br>To the guys again:<br><br>Overall, girls like to be "chased" and "wooed". It is their nature. Don't blame them. They want to be a pretty flower, with a lot of "bees" buzzing around them. They cannot change. Therefore, as guys, you should be careful.<br><br>For example, even when my current gf is already very serious with me, there are guys who are after her... and she say that they are just friends. I know that she will not be interested in them but yet she did not "reject" them. Got one even buy breakfast drink for her every morning. When you ask them, they will say,,,, "He want to do that want but.... I didn't ask them"....<br><br></div>

Who cares whether she is attached or not, right? Just have fun. Don't even need to ask her. She don't say, you don't care.<br><br>If you are looking for a serious gf, you have to be frank with her. If she say she is single when in fact she is 2-timing you. Then good luck to you as you know her real character before it is too late.<br><br>To the girls who want to "pretend" to be single:<br><br>If the guy is also out having fun only, it is OK. But if the guy is those very serious types please be honest with him. I have a lot of experiences of wanting to be serious with girls and they welcome all the attention, then when I make a move....., whoa lau, they say they got bf. Very disappointed and sometimes hurt.<br><br>To the guys again:<br><br>Overall, girls like to be "chased" and "wooed". It is their nature. Don't blame them. They want to be a pretty flower, with a lot of "bees" buzzing around them. They cannot change. Therefore, as guys, you should be careful.<br><br>For example, even when my current gf is already very serious with me, there are guys who are after her... and she say that they are just friends. I know that she will not be interested in them but yet she did not "reject" them. Got one even buy breakfast drink for her every morning. When you ask them, they will say,,,, "He want to do that want but.... I didn't ask them"....<br><br></div></blockquote> i like ur theory too.. yes if there mr nice guy after u n u knw thry r reli v nice ppl it betetr to be frank n tell them dun tk thier advantage...<br>muahhaha it nature mah ger like to be woo like guy to treat them better n treat them like ladies n with respect but then u must tell them n drawn a clear line dat it only frenxs..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
