              <p>How old was this boy? I sure hope he wasn't below 18 when this happened.</p>
              <p>I strongly believe children should be treated in a genderless manner.</p>
              <p>The following 3 facts -- when reinforced -- cause my circulatory system to go into shock:</p>
              <p>1. Society forces males of all ages to treat girl-children better than boy-children. Society perpetrates this anti-boy sexism in all cultures and has done this ever since humans formed a society.</p>
              <p>2. Singapore culture is the most intense in terms of this anti-boy sexism -- especially in secondary schools. This bothers me because my ancestors are from Singapore.</p>
              <p>3. There is nothing I can do to change the above 2 facts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whenever the above 3 facts are reinforced, I feel strong sensations of fear, sadness, and disgust. Because these 3 emotions are so intense, my endocrine system reacts by putting my circulatory system in a state of shock.</p>
              <p>When I'm in shock, here the medical signs/symptoms:</p>
              <p>1. Cold, pale, moist skin</p>
              <p>2. Bluish discoloration of lips, palms, and nailbeds</p>
              <p>3. Muscle weakness and sharp pain in those muscles when attempts are made to contract them.</p>
              <p>Will the girl-children and men of Singapore's society please stop being so cruel to sweet innocent boy-children? If not, then my circulatory system will continue to be hit with paroxsymal attacks of shock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I lay the following blessing on any cruel Singpore girl:</p>
              <p>When you grow up and if you have a child, you will have a son. Your son will be so soft, sweet, smooth, silky, creamy, elastic, and cute -- physically and emotionally. He will be polite, serious, calm, innocent and passive. He will keep his hair just short enough so that he doesn't look like a girl.</p>
              <p>He will have no elements of anger, aggression, annoyance, drama, boredom, silliness, humor, pleasure, romance, sensuality, or sexuality in him.</p>
              <p>At the age of 15, your defeneless boy will be bullied mercilessly by a gang of cold-hearted14-year-old girls, and you be helpless to stop them. These girls will slap, punch, push, hit and smack your son around until his arms, wrists, back, neck, face, and shoulders are covered in bruises. They will pull and play with his soft silky hair until he sobs. One day this girl-gang will lethally injure your son in front of you. He will then crawl up to you in sheer agony -- with tears streaming down his face -- and will utter his last words in an unusally high-pitched voice -- "I love you mom".</p>
              <p>But you can prevent this by earning karma points. Simply stop mistreating boys now, and your son won't face the above tragedy.</p>
