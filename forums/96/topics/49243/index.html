            <div class='col-md body'>Basically one has the ability to analysis and provide solution to solve a problem. But usually when he'she is in it, it tend to be overwhlem by emotions and clouded and lost their direction and rations.<br><br>Below is a few case in which i was wondering.<br><br>Case 1:<br>How would u react if u court and gal and u fail, and worst of all u goto meet her everyweek?<br><br>Personally i choose to avoid her, gifing myself time to cool down but on the other hand. Am i escaping?<br><br>Case 2:<br>Over the limit of friends?<br><br>Althought everything is over, answers are reveal and time to face the reality, would u hack care them? treat as nothing had happen? or still care for them?<br><br>Mi try to tell myself tat it is nothing more to do with mi and it is wiser to keep a distance. (need a break) but sometimes when i see tat she is not feeling well, will tend to care a bit to the extend of buying them some herbal tea or food when they are not feeling well or hungry.<br><br>I know tat i am gifing on my own willingness, but on the other hand.<br>from the way they react, feel so extra and cheap.<br>the more i do, the more stupid i felt.<br><br>So wat did i do wrong? i just cant find a perfect solution. If i ignore her, mi "narrow minded". If i just treat them better, they think i am back for more, perhaps.<br><br>It is so hard to work it out a friendship when u tried to over step it and fail.<br><br>Suggestion from both genders. Free to say wat u feel.Hopefully can get more feedbacks. Tx</div>
