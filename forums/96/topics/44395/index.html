Sian..............</div></blockquote>My recent encounter was the same or worse than you. This girl is my colleague but from different office. I have seen her in joint projects 2-3 times since July last year. Everything seems so perfect when we were on emails for 2 weeks until I ask her for a date. She shows postive signals like asking about my hobbies and telling me hers. She also flash big smile to me, as she seldom smile, I decided to try my luck on this ice mountain beauty, since I know I have developed some feeling for her. Boy, I was sure disappointed! But, I know this type of thing cannot be forced and I accept that I may never get an answer.</div>

Sian..............</div></blockquote>yo ho fellow sunluver.....i also kena your case 3 weeks ago....asked a girl out but she busy gimme very valid reasons. when she not busy liao, i suppose she waiting for me to ask her out again but my turn to be all tied up with stuff and i never bring the topic out and also never explain to her i busy(she dunno), she then began to react a bit coldly to me. u dun expect too much when u trying out with the girl at this stage, if not emotionally, u'll be the 1 to suffer. as u said, if u r really serious, be sincere and follow your heart what to do. if the girl really totally not giving u a chance, u'll hit the wall immediately(unless she is a biatch), if not gather all your courage and confidence to go out all and give her your attention lor. if u dun give a girl your attention, u can never get to the stage where u can be in her 'potential' bf list.<br>easier said than done ar.......hahaha...i believe if u really like the person, u'll have the drive to chase her....if not most prob, she a bit bo chap u, u also sian can tell yourself to 4get it and do other things in my life(just like my case now)</div>
