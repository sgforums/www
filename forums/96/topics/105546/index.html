            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Please spend 1 minute to read this, it's very<br>meaningful.<br><br>When the bus come, you look at it and you said<br>to yourself, "eeee... so full...cannot sit down one".<br>So you said to yourself, "I'll wait for the next one."<br>so you let the bus go and waited for the second<br>bus.<br><br>Then the second bus came, you looked at it<br>and<br>you said, "eeee...this bus so old...surely very<br>uncomfortable one." So you let the bus go and<br>decided to wait for the next bus.<br><br>After a while, another bus came. It's not<br>crowded<br>and not old but you said, "eeee... no air-con<br>one...and the weather is so warm, better wait<br>for<br>the next one." So again you let the bus go and<br>decided to wait for the next bus.<br><br>Then the sky started to get dark as it is getting<br>late.<br><br>You panicked and jump on to the next on<br>coming<br>bus. It is not until much later that you found out<br>that<br>you had boarded on to the wrong bus! So you<br>wasted your time and money waiting for what<br>you<br>want!<br><br>Even if an aircon bus came, can you ensure<br>that<br>the aircon bus won't break down or will the<br>aircon<br>be too cold for you?<br><br>So people...(mostly girls but guys too!) want to<br>make sure that what you want is not wrong. But<br>it<br>wouldn't hurt to give other people a chance,<br>right?<br>If you found that the "bus" doesn't suit, you just<br>press the red button and get off the bus!<br><br>But wait...I am sure all of you have this<br>experienced before. You saw a bus is coming<br>(the<br>bus you want of course) you flagged it and the<br>driver acted blur by pretending not seeing you<br>and<br>zoomed pass you!<br><br>The bottom line of being loved is like waiting for<br>a<br>bus and whether you want to get on the bus<br>and<br>give the bus a chance depends totally on you<br>and<br>walking alone is just like being out of love.<br><br>If you love someone set him/her free. If he/she<br>comes back to you, you know they're yours. If<br>they<br>don't then it was never meant to be.<br><br>Remember to always say what you mean.<br>If you love someone, tell. Don't be afraid to<br>express yourself.<br><br>Reach out and tell someone what they mean to<br>you. Because when you decide that it is the<br>right<br>time, it might be too late.<br><br>Seize the day.<br><br>Never have regrets.<br><br>And most importantly, stay close to your friends<br>and family, for they have helped make you the<br>person that you are today.<br><br>Pass this along to your friends. It could make a<br>difference.<br><br>The difference between doing all that you can<br>or<br>having regrets which may stay with you<br>forever.<br><br>Friendship is never an accident. It is always<br>the<br>result of high intentions, sincere effort,<br>intelligent<br>direction and skillful execution. It represents the<br>wise choice of many alternatives.<br><br>And remember.... Keep Smiling....coz... "Of All<br>Things You Wear, Your Smile Is As love<br>returns to<br>me, As I return to you, As love returns to us.<br><br>I guess this is really wondeful and make a lot of<br>sense.<br><br>Happy Reading<br><br></div>
