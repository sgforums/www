            <div class='col-md body'>Asking a girl out is definitely more than going up to her and saying bluntly: "Will you go out with me?". We will point out some pretty common sensible points that you should take note of.<br><br>1.Golden rule: Do not ever sound desperate when asking her out.<br>Do not make it seem that if she were to reject your date your entire world will collapse. You might ask, : How do I know if I sound desperate or something?". Well personally I feel that a person who is desperate for a date might actually ask something like this:" Hi May, would you like to catch a movie with me? Erhmm I mean Lynn, Jasmine, Trina, Christina, Jane, Linda and Regina just rejected me and I really want to watch a movie with a gal....so maybe we can...". Any fool out there knows that you would be rejected if you were desperate!" Alternatively, this would probably work better." Hi May, I was just wondering if you would be free tonight as I would like to catch a movie with you. I just rejected Lynn, Jasmine, Trina, Christina, Jane, Linda and Regina's date for a show tonight as I would want to spend the night with someone really special-someone like you." Okie you guys out there probably think that it is extremely ridiculous and too far fetch but believe me-girls like to hear things like that-regardless if whether you really mean things from the bottom of your heart. It is just like how ecstatic you would feel if a girl commented that your junior is long and big even though it really is--small and thin.<br><br>2. Movies? Nah It is an absolute NO-NO<br>I really do not understand why guys like to take gals out for movies on their first few dates. It is not as if both of you are stead and need the privacy of a movie theatre for some handy panky stuff. Face it! Are you going to pay $16 for two tickets, go to a dark place with both of you sitting down eyes glued to the screen with virtually NO interaction? Now honestly do you think that helps in nurturing a relationship? On the other hand, quiet places like beaches and cafes are great places not because they are cheap but because these places that allow both of you to have heart-to-heart talks! Communications is important to any relationship.<br><br>Warning! You should be tactful when asking her out to places like beaches and parks and she might think that you have other ulterior motives!<br><br>3. Don't be Stingy<br>Unless you are really strapped for cash, try not to let a tight budget spoil a supposedly romantic evening! It is RIGHT for a guy to pay for everything on the first date. However that doesn't mean that you bring her out on a shopping spree and burn a big hole in your pocket. There is really just a very thin line between a generous man and a sucker.<br><br>4. Chit Chat<br>Unless the both of you are studying social science or she is the next contestant for the next "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" game show, you would really bored her out if you are going to talk about politics, technology and current affairs. As suggested by the previous articles, we advise you talk about her. No idea on how to start such conversions? Well sentences starting with" I realised that you......"."Do you know that you......","The first time I saw you......" and "Your bossoms are pretty......" etc are some good examples to start with.<br><br>5. The "Gentleman" Factor.<br>Other than being wild and barbaric in bed, a man should always behave like a gentleman. A lady would not want to be spotted with someone crazy and barbaric. Just in case you guys have problems defining what "behaving like a gentleman is about", the 2 lists below should come in handy.<br><br>List 1: The Don'ts<br>1. Don't spit on the floor or anywhere.<br>2. Don't use vulgarities<br>3. Don't laugh hysterically<br>4. Don't have too high an opinion of yourself. Be humble<br>5. Don't use any accent ( unless your date is an SPG or you are an ABC)<br>6. Don't wear single and shorts and slippers on a date.<br>7. Don't kick kittens or puppies, look as if you love small animals even if you are really a sadist.<br>8. Don't scratch your crotch in public-or at least in front of her.<br>9. Don't eat like a pig.<br>10. Don't ogle at other women. Pretend your date is the most beautiful woman on earth.<br><br>List 2: The Dos<br>1. Do hold her hand while crossing the road.<br>2. Do open all doors for her.<br>3. Do pull her chair for her at dinners.<br>4. Do crack jokes here and there. And you know you're successful if she laughs, if she doesn't stop your crap.<br>5. Do take off your tops and lay it on the wet floor for her to cross.<br>6. Do foot the bills but don't be a sucker.<br>7. Do make sure that she feels comfortable with you.<br>8. Do speak to her gently.<br>9. Do ask for her opinion while ordering dinner.<br>10. Do say "Please excuse me, I need to go to the Gents/Washroom" and not "Sorry I need to pee". The latter is definitely not polite at all.<br><br>The lists go on but we have decided to name just 10 each. The main thing is to give you the idea of what we are trying to say and not a "Buayaing For Dummies" kind of guide.<br><br>Last but not least:<br>SEND HER HOME AT THE END OF THE DATE<br>This doesn't necessarily mean that you have to send her right to her doorstep. But if you are do try to do so as you would know exactly where she lives. Thus if you fail in winning her heart, you have an easier time stalking her.<br><br>Sending your date home is also sending her the message that you are responsible for her safety and security. You are telling her that you are a man-a real man. For best results, flex your biceps and triceps every now and then to display your masculinity. Warning! Take plenty of salt or you will get cramps.<br><br>Dr Buaya</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Robbie Fowler:</div><div class="quote_body">Asking a girl out is definitely more than going up to her and saying bluntly: "Will you go out with me?". We will point out some pretty common sensible points that you should take note of.<br><br>1.Golden rule: Do not ever sound desperate when asking her out.<br>Do not make it seem that if she were to reject your date your entire world will collapse. You might ask, : How do I know if I sound desperate or something?". Well personally I feel that a person who is desperate for a date might actually ask something like this:" Hi May, would you like to catch a movie with me? Erhmm I mean Lynn, Jasmine, Trina, Christina, Jane, Linda and Regina just rejected me and I really want to watch a movie with a gal....so maybe we can...". Any fool out there knows that you would be rejected if you were desperate!" Alternatively, this would probably work better." Hi May, I was just wondering if you would be free tonight as I would like to catch a movie with you. I just rejected Lynn, Jasmine, Trina, Christina, Jane, Linda and Regina's date for a show tonight as I would want to spend the night with someone really special-someone like you." Okie you guys out there probably think that it is extremely ridiculous and too far fetch but believe me-girls like to hear things like that-regardless if whether you really mean things from the bottom of your heart. It is just like how ecstatic you would feel if a girl commented that your junior is long and big even though it really is--small and thin.<br><br>2. Movies? Nah It is an absolute NO-NO<br>I really do not understand why guys like to take gals out for movies on their first few dates. It is not as if both of you are stead and need the privacy of a movie theatre for some handy panky stuff. Face it! Are you going to pay $16 for two tickets, go to a dark place with both of you sitting down eyes glued to the screen with virtually NO interaction? Now honestly do you think that helps in nurturing a relationship? On the other hand, quiet places like beaches and cafes are great places not because they are cheap but because these places that allow both of you to have heart-to-heart talks! Communications is important to any relationship.<br><br>Warning! You should be tactful when asking her out to places like beaches and parks and she might think that you have other ulterior motives!<br><br>3. Don't be Stingy<br>Unless you are really strapped for cash, try not to let a tight budget spoil a supposedly romantic evening! It is RIGHT for a guy to pay for everything on the first date. However that doesn't mean that you bring her out on a shopping spree and burn a big hole in your pocket. There is really just a very thin line between a generous man and a sucker.<br><br>4. Chit Chat<br>Unless the both of you are studying social science or she is the next contestant for the next "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" game show, you would really bored her out if you are going to talk about politics, technology and current affairs. As suggested by the previous articles, we advise you talk about her. No idea on how to start such conversions? Well sentences starting with" I realised that you......"."Do you know that you......","The first time I saw you......" and "Your bossoms are pretty......" etc are some good examples to start with.<br><br>5. The "Gentleman" Factor.<br>Other than being wild and barbaric in bed, a man should always behave like a gentleman. A lady would not want to be spotted with someone crazy and barbaric. Just in case you guys have problems defining what "behaving like a gentleman is about", the 2 lists below should come in handy.<br><br>List 1: The Don'ts<br>1. Don't spit on the floor or anywhere.<br>2. Don't use vulgarities<br>3. Don't laugh hysterically<br>4. Don't have too high an opinion of yourself. Be humble<br>5. Don't use any accent ( unless your date is an SPG or you are an ABC)<br>6. Don't wear single and shorts and slippers on a date.<br>7. Don't kick kittens or puppies, look as if you love small animals even if you are really a sadist.<br>8. Don't scratch your crotch in public-or at least in front of her.<br>9. Don't eat like a pig.<br>10. Don't ogle at other women. Pretend your date is the most beautiful woman on earth.<br><br>List 2: The Dos<br>1. Do hold her hand while crossing the road.<br>2. Do open all doors for her.<br>3. Do pull her chair for her at dinners.<br>4. Do crack jokes here and there. And you know you're successful if she laughs, if she doesn't stop your crap.<br>5. Do take off your tops and lay it on the wet floor for her to cross.<br>6. Do foot the bills but don't be a sucker.<br>7. Do make sure that she feels comfortable with you.<br>8. Do speak to her gently.<br>9. Do ask for her opinion while ordering dinner.<br>10. Do say "Please excuse me, I need to go to the Gents/Washroom" and not "Sorry I need to pee". The latter is definitely not polite at all.<br><br>The lists go on but we have decided to name just 10 each. The main thing is to give you the idea of what we are trying to say and not a "Buayaing For Dummies" kind of guide.<br><br>Last but not least:<br>SEND HER HOME AT THE END OF THE DATE<br>This doesn't necessarily mean that you have to send her right to her doorstep. But if you are do try to do so as you would know exactly where she lives. Thus if you fail in winning her heart, you have an easier time stalking her.<br><br>Sending your date home is also sending her the message that you are responsible for her safety and security. You are telling her that you are a man-a real man. For best results, flex your biceps and triceps every now and then to display your masculinity. Warning! Take plenty of salt or you will get cramps.<br><br>Dr Buaya</div></blockquote>POWER~~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
