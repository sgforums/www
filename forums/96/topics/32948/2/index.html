Most of us are not born to be frank, but seek to become one.<br>Don't worry, take your time. Let you, your partner understand each other slowly. Just make sure both of you have the patience to discover yourself, your partner. You will be frustrated at the beginning, feel loss, worried, or not knowing what is happening. But when your relationship develop, and you look back, these would be wonderful memory.<br><br>To find your true love you have to find your true self.<br>True love is also about willing to let go relationship if it doesn't work out.<br><br>Take your 1st relationship seriously, don't listen to statistics of failures.<br>If you think 1st relationship won't work out, then you are not being fair to yourself, your partner. Then why go into a relationship at the first place?<br><br>If you want to know whether it is worth the effort...just ask yourself, how much effort is worth to seek a lifetime partner. Once you can visualise you are getting lifetime partner, then the effort is worth it. And a relationship will start to be meaniful, and you will less worried when you are on the ROM day! Many relationships fell apart during courtship or in marriages, because they didn't understand that they are looking for a lifetime partner (not a obedient pet or their parent).<br><br>Yes, make marriage the goal when both of you start a relationship.<br>Yes it sound too serious at the beginning, but make sure you don't lose track of the goal as your progress.<br><br>Finally, statistics... my only relationship lasted beyond 8 yrs, and is upgraded to Marriage to continue its path.<br><br>However this doesn't gurantee yours!</div>
