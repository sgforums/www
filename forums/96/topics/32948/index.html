Analyse why you like the person, is it because of superfical reasons like apperance and external behaviour (sweet and nice?) or because you really know the person deep down?

For my case, i broke up with my ex 3 years when im 16yrs old. that was in 1999 then in 2000 i patched with him again.. that lasted for a week and then we broke up.. he did horrible things to me like threatening me non stop..<br>Then after that, 2002 sept, we came back together again. Now its even better then ever,, we are going on strong.. we realized that we learnt many things during these few years..... and im sure he is gonna be the last one..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ...<br></div>
