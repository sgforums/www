And with your capabilities n personallity, you are a "to die-for" man..<br><br>i am a normal guy who is clearing my NS leave, waiting to step into the society and i must say... you are almost a too good too be "a true guy " that ever existed in s'pore. i envy you , really. I look up to you as my idol. To be rich and successful yet blessed with good looks and intelligence. That's almost every guys' dream. every girls' dream man.  May i ask how old are u actually? Are you a local?<br><br>btw<br>83.7% of Mr Bill Gates wealth( say take his 2003 's wealth 40.7bil) = <strong>34.06bil</strong><br><br>which also means u are listed 2nd in the world top ten richest man 2003.but in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2003/02/26/billionaireland.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/2003/02/26/billionaireland.html</a>, the world 2nd richest man is Warren E Buffett , aged 72, estimated 2003's wealth is <strong>30.5bil</strong>. This " Forbes.com"  website track the world richest people and they are very effective.  Maybe it's their BIG DEAD mistake not placing your name in the list. But on the 2nd thought, you are really capable to make about 34.06bil in approximately 8 months time. I must have heard your name and forgotten about it. But i normally won't forget such a capabable man's name. Especially he made 34.06bil in 8 mths time. What's your name again?<br><br>Pls get your facts right next time. And please DON"T discriminated and downgrade the girls yourself. It's unfair to them. speaking of understanding...hmm....<br><br>If you need some consultations, PM me. My dad can recommend some psychiatrists. They definitely will help u with my dad's recommendation letter. Don't feel inferior.<br></div>
