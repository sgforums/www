Ehem ...some watch too much porn , ra , blues or even browse the sggirl's photo furum and see so many chio bus ( have to admit they are ) thats why they become so easily horny and when they are horny  , they will start to talk about it to release the urge for it ^_^ . Why i know  all these stuff , its because i USED to be very desperate for sex as i always try to avoid girls due to my Jing ( too loyal to her ) so.. thats why i trying to get to know more female friends not to have sex with me ...but to help me release my sexual desire by ........( confidential ) though now i got a few female friends ( those pool counter zabos ) i dont REALLY look forward to have sex with them but just to like chat with them... and play some games ( ^_^ ) hehe... ( kidnap ) thats my way to increase my relationship with them . I am very honest bout my feelings .... when i dont feel any feelings for them ( crush ) i become honest with them as to prevent them from getting too serious with me . I will reject them most likely ( did once ) as i dont wanner get involve with them  ( baby ) Anyway , both party dont stand to lose ... I am yandao and rich , honest too so what will they lose if they becomes my " girlfriend " and i dont wanner take their virginity as i very guai 1 ^_^ and... last of all the ads thing ... Bear in mind is just to go out with me as my stead for 1 day thats all.. NO SEX [/b]</blockquote>the rest of the stuff is juz rubbish tat isnt related to this topic<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
