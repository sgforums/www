            <div class='col-md body'>The beginning of my sec 3 life begins with a girl ( quite chio ) after school suddenly with her grp of frens come and look 4 me. Her friends all tell me say she likes me and then when we walked together out of the sch , she ask me to pretend go stead with her by walking with her... i rejected her bcos i liked some 1 from my class since sec 1 until now.  I wanted to jio this girl long ago but it seems we're not fated for now bcos during my years in this secondary school , i wanted to go 4 early enlistment and know the realationship wont go far and currently she went overseas study ..Back to the 1st girl,  she began to get my attention and we became good friends at 1st and slowly i liked her more &amp; more .. but i tell myself to try prevent myself from liking her cos of another girl ~_~ and later on regretted. Few mths later when she juz broke up with her stead i took the oppunity , sms her to be my stead. She said yes at 1st then next day suddenly change her mind = ( Since then we became like strangers , trying to ignore each other  but always look at each other from far but dint talked. I wanted to forget her but everytime i was bout to 4 get her she come sms me telling her new hp .no She always tell her hp no when she changes.. aLready like change 5 x and i sms her back ..<br><br>After taking the O levels result slip , it was a long time since we chatted on phone and shes like almost become a stranger to me then suddenly one day sms me. I knew i was going ns then already so i juz thought of steadying with her tempolary to pass my time but it was wishful thought as i keep sms her bo liao msg . As time passes by , i start to dream of her often and start to like her again .. I know she still listens to my msg but now currently im like stuck in a cross road .<br><br>Im not sure should i meet up with her and tell her my true feelings bout her and y i rejected her then cos of my ns and liking another girl Or carry on with my lonely life till ns .. Sighs i nv go stead with anyone all these years when i have the chance to and always feel so selfless. Can anyone give me piece of advice??</div>
