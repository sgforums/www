I know some of you might have some bad experience with JC/Poly guys/girls.<br><br>There are some important points that i would like whoever is reading this to think about~<br><br>1) I'm from Ngee Ann Poly and i have seen people dye hair, talk in singlish and etc...<br>2) I have also seen some really nice guys in Ngee Ann Poly (gentlemen ^-^)<br>3) Yes yes there are also some people who wear thick glasses and <strong>look like</strong> nerds from Ngee Ann.<br><br>4)I have JC friends who although dont dye hair (they cant ^-^), talk in singlish<br>5)Of course my JC friends are nice ^-^ that's why they are my friends!<br>6) Not to mention i have known some JC friends who <strong>look like</strong>  nerds<br><br>Final Point) From the above points u can see that u can find all sorts of people in either JC or poly. So no more sterotyping please &gt;_&lt;.<br><br>Finally my personal opinion is if u want to <strong>JUDGE</strong> a person, do it by his/her <strong>CHARACTER</strong> ^-^.<br><br>(Does this sound like "singlish" ^-^ ????)</div>
