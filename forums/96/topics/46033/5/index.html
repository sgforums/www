A lot of people have been complaining that JC people are proud and stuck-up. I don't think that's the case, I think the only reason why some feel that way is that they feel intimidated by the fact that they can actually speak decent english!! There is a communication barrier between them because MOST people speak chinese or chinese mixed with english in polys. And I'm not defending them cos I'm in a JC, I'm actually from an international school.<br><br>If you read the replies, it's soo hard to find one that has correct grammar!! They type exactly like how they speak, and its such a turn off when a guy can't even get a proper english sentence out of his mouth!! That's my opinion anyway. [b]I don't hang out with people from a poly because of this</strong>, but i do have a few friends from JC. We just don't speak the same language. I really cannot stand their so-called 'singlish'. It's not impressive at all and sounds terrible.<br>[/b]</blockquote>These are why people...I mean most people prefer to have a poly guy as a friend...not because of decent english or whatever you're trying to imply that you're better in,it's because we're friendly...and more easy to get along with...admit it pal...being arrogant has no benefits...and don't you ever try to deny that you are arrogant...because from what you've written here...at least I found it stink!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Don't be so ignorant. And yes, i do respect the people, and i know that singaporeans are identified by their singlish. Just so you know, i went to the UK once and someone asked me where i'm from. I said 'singapore'. And he went "Ooohh so you speak the donkey english."  I was like,"what do you mean?!?!" and he said,"They sound like donkeys, they are always like 'har' and 'hor'.." I was soo emabarrssed to hear that that is what they think of singlish!! It's so uncivilised!! So you guys can just carry on..<br><br>U asking me not to visit the page juz because of the grammar? Well, MOST singaporeans speak like this not just the people on here.<br><br>Hmmm.. u must be really pathetic to resorting to personal insults.. u call me a stubborn donkey.. well.. like what i said above.. ppl think singaporeans speak donkey english..<br><br>And why are you guys so proud of singlish when your own government isn't?! the singaporean government has been encouraging ppl to speak correctly, that's the reason why Phua chu kang was taken off air a while ago remember?

            <div class='col-md body'>You can't blame the top JCs student to be arrogant because they are being brought up that way. And not all JC students are arrogant or having some type of attitude problems. I'm from a local JC but i wasn't been label as one who has attitude problems. Place your target wisely for those who kept their cynical remarks against the JCs. Sometimes, it really set me thinking, was it out of jealousy that these remarks emerged?<br><br>Is it true that JC students mean that polytechnical graduate, although earn more pay, are inferior that the A level graduate? Going to a JC is a stepping stone to a university degree with the traditional education pathway and its no big deal, or rather having a diploma or A level cert proves nothing. It does not clearly different your superiority over another.</div>
