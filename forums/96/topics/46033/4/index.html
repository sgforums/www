            <div class='col-md body'>Does it matter if one is from polytechnic or the junior college? If it matter, are you agreeing that the British elite education system is one that is superior in producing the better individuals? Education is to provide individuals a foundation to knowledge. The polytechnic in Singapore provide a solution to skilled labour. Whilst JC, the traditional institution, aim to train students to lead and excel with large amount of conceptual and communicative skills. Each institution train students in different layers of the thinkings. Do polytechnic students taught how society evolve to the current structure? Are they require to produce a logical flow of how things or process works, into words without any aids? Are they require to work individually?<br>JC train the independence mentality of the students, whilst polytechnic train the interdependence mentality. Each has its pros and cons to the society but neither is superior than other. They focus on different areas of education.<br>Whether jc or poly guys are interesting, it takes one's interest to be interesting. If you never like something, can you be interested? Likewise, how sure are you, when you like something, you must be interested?<br>All institutions have flaws in their design. None are perfect, that is why, if there are cocky Jc students, there will be cocky Poly students as well. Thus, why compare? Does creating differences make your self esteem higher? If that is so, then, what is your concept of yourself? A Self esteem build by you or by the environment? Wouldnt that make you one that, will imitate what others do?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"></span> Ok, i've been reading a few posts and I just couldn't help but add something. A lot of people have been complaining that JC people are proud and stuck-up. I don't think that's the case, I think the only reason why some feel that way is that they feel intimidated by the fact that they can actually speak decent english!! There is a communication barrier between them because MOST people speak chinese or chinese mixed with english in polys. And I'm not defending them cos I'm in a JC, I'm actually from an international school.<br><br>If you read the replies, it's soo hard to find one that has correct grammar!! They type exactly like how they speak, and its such a turn off when a guy can't even get a proper english sentence out of his mouth!! That's my opinion anyway. I don't hang out with people from a poly because of this, but i do have a few friends from JC. We just don't speak the same language. I really cannot stand their so-called 'singlish'. It's not impressive at all and sounds terrible.<br></div>
