            <div class='col-md body'>Ms S'pore<br><br>One of the main reasons why in recent years the Singapore Government has always ensured that their Miss Universe representative were of tertiary level education or higher was because of the following incident which occurred not too many years ago. It is the final round of the Miss Universe Pageant and the 3 finalists, Miss USA, Miss Malaysia and Miss Singapore are being asked 3 simple questions:<br><br>MC: The first question is name me an electrical appliance starting with "L"<br><br>Miss USA: Lamp<br><br>Miss Malaysia: Light bulb<br><br>Miss Singapore: LADIO<br><br>Judge: No, no, Radio does not start with the letter "L"<br><br>MC: I am going to give you 2 more chances; The next question is name me an animal starting with the letter "L"<br><br>Miss USA: Lion<br><br>Miss Malaysia: Leopard<br><br>Miss Singapore: LABBIT<br><br>Judge: No, no, no, Rabbit does not start with the letter "L"<br><br>MC: I am going to give you one last chance, if you answer this question incorrectly, you are disqualified.<br><br>Name me a fruit starting with the letter "L"<br><br>Miss USA: Lemon<br><br>Miss Malaysia: Lychee<br><br>Miss Singapore, with full of confidence, smiles and says: LIEWLIAN !!<br><br>This is not the end of the story, the Judge consulted the board of judges to determine if Miss Singapore should really disqualified; and they decided that since Miss Singapore was having as many problems with the letter "L", the decided to give her another chance.<br><br>Judge: OK, the final question is name me a human anatomy starting with the letter "L"<br><br>Miss USA: Lung (applause)<br><br>Miss Malaysia: Liver (even more applause)<br><br>Miss Singapore: LAN JIAO<br><br>Judge: ?????????!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Beng All WET!<br><br>Last night, an incident took place at Boat Quay. What happened was some idiot was trying to show off and declared that he would swim across the Singapore River. He jumped in and started swimming. But before he could reach the halfway mark, he started to panic and started to shout for help.<br><br>Being typical Singaporeans, a crowd started to gather to watch and yet no attempt was made by anybody to save that poor chap.<br><br>Suddenly there was a splash and the crowd turned to see a guy doing what seemed like a desperate attempt to reach the drowning victim. It was clear that this hero couldn't swim !<br><br>Luckily a tongkang filled with tourists was passing by and the operator saw the incident and picked both men from the water. The crowd cheered !<br><br>Back on shore, the crowd cheered again as the hero stepped off the tongkang. "Steady Lah !" and "Awright, man !" were among the many congratulations shouted.<br><br>The hero looked angry and shouted "Ka ni na! Siang too wa loh chui?" (*%#@! Who pushed me into the water?")<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Beng's HOT shOt<br><br>During the Japanese Occupation, 3 Singaporeans, Ah Meng, Ah Seng and Ah Beng were caught for smuggling. They were sentenced to death by firing squad.<br><br>That night, Ah Meng came up with a plan. He told the others that the Japanese were afraid of natural disasters. So he would cause them to panic, and escape in the confusion.<br><br>The next morning, Ah Meng was led to the wall. The firing squad was lined up and the Captain commanded, "Ready.. Aim..", but before he could complete, Ah Meng shouted, " Earthquake!! Earthquake!" The Japanese soldiers panicked and Ah Meng made his escape.<br><br>Later, the soldiers took Ah Seng out and the firing squad were ready. The captain commanded, "Ready... Aim..." This time Ah Seng shouted. " Flood! Flood!!" Again, the Japanese soldiers panicked and this time, Ah Seng made his escape.<br><br>Observing all this, Ah Beng began to get the idea. "It's important to get the timing right."<br><br>Soon, it was Ah Beng's turn. "Timing, that's the key.." Ah Beng kept saying to himself. The soldiers lined up in front of him. The captain started, "Ready..."<br><br>"Timing," Ah Beng thought to himself<br><br>"Aim..."<br><br>"Okay," thought Ah Beng, and shouted, " FIRE!!! FIRE!!! "<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TicO MONKS<br><br>There were four Buddhist monks who played instruments and chanted everyday.<br><br>One fine morning, a lady in a mini skirt went into the temple to pray. When the lady knelt down to pray, one of the chanting monks saw the lady zhao keng (i.e. exposing herself accidentally).<br><br>The monk was shocked to see that the woman was not wearing any panties! He felt he had to share this valuable insight with his fellow monks, but also did not wish to alert the lady.<br><br>So he began chanting the message: "Wu lang bo chin nai ko....(Someone's not wearing panties...)"<br><br>The monk beside him was playing a tambourine, and he thumped this response: "Ti-to-lok, ti-to-lok (Where? Where?)"<br><br>The third monk, playing a horn, replied: "Duuu... Duuu........(There! There!)"<br><br>Finally, the last and the most  righteous monk, sounded his cymbals in disgust: "Ti ti kua... ti ti kua! (Still peeping! Still peeping!)"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Beng On e SeA<br><br>Ah Beng, Mohammad and Muthu were at sea when they were hijacked by a group of pirates.<br><br>The pirates cornered the 3 men and said "Give us all your valuables!" The chief pirate then raised a syringe and added, "Or else we'll inject you with the AIDS virus!"<br><br>Mohammad quickly stripped off all his valuables and handed them to the pirates. Satisfied, they threw him into the sea.<br><br>Muthu was equally quick to comply with the pirates' wishes. Similarly, he removed his valuables and surrendered them to the pirates. Like Mohammad, he was thrown into the sea.<br><br>Finally it came to Ah Beng's turn. He stared at the pirates and sneered. "You all kee see lah! (go and die!) Inject, inject lah, you'll never get my lolex and my JPG warret!"<br><br>The pirates, showing no mercy, injected Ah Beng with the HIV virus, and robbed him of his precious watch and wallet. They then threw him into the sea with the rest.<br><br>In the water, both Mohammad and Muthu commended Ah Beng for his bravery. However, they were pretty perplexed by why he was unafraid of the virus. Grinning, Ah Beng answered, "AIDS I not scared, what... I got condom!!!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Man and a Woman were dating. She being of a religious nature had held back the worldly pleasure that he wanted from her so bad. In fact, he had never even seen her naked.<br><br>One day, as they drove down the freeway, she remarked about his slow driving habits.<br><br>"I can't stand it anymore," she told him. "Let's play a game. For every 5 miles per hour over the speed limit you drive, I'll remove one piece of clothing."<br><br>He enthusiastically agreed and sped up the car. He reached the 55 MPH mark, so she took off her blouse. At 60 off came the pants. At 65 it was her bra and at 70 her panties.<br><br>Now seeing her naked for the first time and traveling faster than he ever had before, he became very excited and lost control of the car. He veered off the road, went over an<br>embankment and hit a tree. His girlfriend was not hurt but he was trapped. She tried to pull him free but alas he was stuck. "Go to the road and get help," he said.<br><br>"I don't have anything to cover myself with!" she replied.<br><br>The man felt around, but could only reach one of his shoes.<br><br>"You'll have to put this between your legs to cover it up," he told her.<br><br>So she did as he said and went up to the road for help.<br><br>Along came a truck driver. Seeing a naked, crying woman along the road, he pulled over to hear her story.<br><br>"My boyfriend! My boyfriend!" she sobs, "He's stuck and I can't pull him out!"<br><br>The truck driver looking down at the shoe between her legs replies: "Ma'am, if he's in that far,I'm afraid he'a a goner!"<br></div>
