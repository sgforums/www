Its like most of the time, the couples will definitely have sex after a certain period of relationship. I don't have any friends whom never have sex with their gfs. Why is it that gals can't really control themselves till marriage. I have friends who are still single kept on complaining knowing how loose girls can be, they have no confidence in Singapore girls and chose to marry or get into relationship abroad, e.g thailand, china, taiwan, hong kong rather than in Singapore. Comments please...</div></blockquote>I also heard from my friends regarding this matter. I'm not too sure about it but I won't believe them totally. But nowadays, girls are really open.

I hate guys who think like that.<br><br>having sex is a gift. something that you can share with another partner(s). Dont feel sorry for yourself that you lost your virginity to a loser. move on with your life. go find someone else to fark.<br><br>What about men? They think that they can have sex with many women but girls cannot. they have to preserve themselves for after the marriage. piss off pigs.. so if the marriage doesnt work out. they end up divorced. does that mean the girl will forever be without a guy? she did try her best to keep her virginity for the one she love.. but in the end she got betrayed.

Why do guys have to see them as a s lut? or being easy? loose vagina?<br><br>And if you met a girl and she told you that shes not a virgin.. does that mean that you will never date or love her? that she is garbage? 2nd goods?. I hate guys who think like that.<br><br>having sex is a gift. something that you can share with another partner(s). Dont feel sorry for yourself that you lost your virginity to a loser. move on with your life. go find someone else to fark.<br><br>What about men? They think that they can have sex with many women but girls cannot. they have to preserve themselves for after the marriage. piss off pigs.. so if the marriage doesnt work out. they end up divorced. does that mean the girl will forever be without a guy? she did try her best to keep her virginity for the one she love.. but in the end she got betrayed. If she feels sorry for herself.. then she should commit suicide. dumb woman.<br><br>ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!so angry!</div></blockquote>i think the one tat doesnt get it is u .. u r liberal .. u r the new age woman .. who don care a fark aboout V ... u believe tat men are bad cos u hav yet to see some1 gd .. well tats all up to u .. u believe having sex is something normal .. becos the society bends in such n now u believe it is normal .. however .. ur ideas n beliefs r not wat most of us think ... y r u trying to hard to tell every1 to think the same as u ...<br><br>mayb from ur post .. u hav been hurt by men .. but tat brings out something from them .. not the whole of men out there .. so pls do not sterotype ...<br>finally .. u like to do it the way .. so be it ..</div>

If this world revolves around your principle, I do believe that many things can get done without many objections, but there is no such world. In a place where men are of single mind, there will always be one who is the exception. Be it the majority or the minority, everyone would still be different and that is what makes all of us unique.<br><br>If you, sexiserene thinks that being liberal is right, then I think you have made your point, just try not to step on other people's tails who have their own way of thinking. I am not flaming you, please do understand this, but I am trying to in fact take you back to the sole topic of the forum, that is what is your idea or thinking of liberal sex, and not a heated argument or flames about criticizing other people's comments. Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree with renoreal.<br><br>Everyone has their own opinions and beliefs. And it would be narrow-minded to call those who have different views from you narrow-minded. We are all entitled to believe in whatever crap we want. As long as we don't try to enforce those ideas unto others.<br><br>Now comes to my personal opinion about virginity :<br><br>To me its like fresh meat and second hand or whatever-hand goods. Personally I rather have fresh delicious juicy meat. Hell ain't no way am I going to settle for some stale crap thats been chew and spit out. Its your choice if you want to dine upon those stale crap. I ain't going to stop you. Feel free to. Me ? I like my steak prime and pure. If it doesn't come up to standard. Fudged it. Ain't worth my time or my money. No one iota.<br><br>Now I am sure alot of you people am thinking what a scum and lowlife I am in believing such thing. Well too freaking bad cause that is what I believe in and you losers can go suck an egg.<br><br>For those who are inclined to accept what I believe and accept it as another individua'ls preferences even if it might diametrically opposed to your own opinion, good for you. Wish you the best of luck in all.</div>
