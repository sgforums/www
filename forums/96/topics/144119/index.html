            <div class='col-md body'>We have all heard it before, virginity is the greatest "gift" a woman can give to her husband. This is the cornerstone in the upbringing of most young women. Society has come up with words to describe women who have lost their virgnity ( slut, loose women and easy lay) without the sacrament of marriage. The onus is on women to uphold moral values. Conversely, there are no similar derogatory terms to describe men who engage in premarital sex.<br><br>While traditional values exist, other factors influence the sexual behaviours and attitudes of young people. One of these is the fact we are in the age of sexual liberation. Madonna and MTV where sex is the "in" thing. Virginity is outdated and archaic, totally out of tune with the modern age. Virgins are missing out on the collective experience of truly modern women, those who know exactly what sex is. Virgins are stereotyped as awkard, straitlaced and uptight prunes.<br><br>Conflicting pressures from different social institutions have trapped today's young women in the middle. To keep or to loose her virginity. Either way, she becomes a stereotypical image, the loose nonvirgin or the old fashioned virgin. Either way she's judged. The middle ground may be virginity is a sign of women's control over their bodies. They refuse to give in to sexual liberalism  nor are they old fashioned or devoutly religious. Virginity is an informed choice some women make.</div>

Girls weather they are virgins or not are still GIRLS. Guys too. So what is wrong with people??  Do they have the right to judge us? So what if I had sex with a few guys? This means I'm hot, and guys love that.<br><br>To be a virgin or not a virgin.. Pah.. what a waste of time.
