            <div class='col-md body'>I would just like to ask several questions about Singapore, to all you Singaporeans because I am seriously considering coming here as an exchange student for a semester or two from Australia.<br><br>1) Firstly I would just like to get this sorted out and out of the way first. Australians love Rugby League and I am no different, hence this is why I'm 6 foot 1 or 184 cm and I weigh 200 pounds or 90 kilos (I do not know what system your country use), because I love playing the sport and have to be at this size inorder to play for my club. With this explanation aside, I would like to know, when I come here on exchange, "Will I look conspicuos or like the giant that just fell down the beanstalk". I ask this question because the last time and only time I went to a Asian country (Japan) people in the streets were staring at me like I was some freak, they were short, I was tall, and my clothes were different, I just felt like a giant and that every body was gawking at me. Will I have this same problem in Singapore? With my size and my clothes?<br><br>2) Secoundly is the National University of Singapore a good law school in Singapore, whats its prestige like compared to other Uni's in Singapore. I would like to know this because this is the only law school in Singapore my Uni has exchange agreements with.<br><br>3) Finally do the pubs in Singapore show the big time boxing fights? I do not mind if they do not show the small time unknown fighters. But they do show fighters like Tyson, Tszyu, and De La Hoya right?. Moreover does Singapore have access to the Ultimate Fighting Championships or the Pride Fighting Championships ?<br><br>All these questions are really important to me, I would like to know them before I decide to come on exchange here, so could you please answer them. Your patience in answering these question will be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Thank you</div>

Your patience in answering these question will be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Thank you</div></blockquote>Allow me to render some assistance to you.. AND enlighten you in the process...<br><br>1) First and foremost, I truly comprehand your concern as I'm 1.82cm &amp; 81kg, my build &amp; stature is anything but mediocre. (Plus it's really tough getting in and out of my BMW Z3) But due to the rising number of caucasians in S'pore, it is not a cause for worry. Anyway, the average height for locals is 168 - 176cm. An increase from 162 - 172cm since 1998. (Due mainly to an increasing number of cross-culture marriages and basically short people just not getting enough action in bed it seems) Regarding ur Australian fashion, not to worry. Singaporeans are very open to new and sometimes shocking choices of fashion. However, if u choose to blend in, I seriously suggest you shop at Ulu Bay Shopping Mall.<br>Look out for our local designer wear, especially "Ferre Singh", "Beng &amp; Lian", "Ahmad Sulaiman Couture" &amp; Gopulversace Istantemuthi" etc. as they have large sizes.<br>Ulu Bay Shopping Mall is lacated at 4 Ulu Sembawang Rd 5.<br><br>2)The National University of Singapore is a good law school, but if prestige is paramount to you, the National Sembawang University would be the preferred choice. Many of our brilliant lawyers like Jusueme Singh etc. including myself, hail from the above mentioned law school. For more info, visit the website.<br>http://www.nsu/law.gov.sg<br>The NSU is located at 1 Ulu Sembawang Rd 5<br><br>3)Last but not least, in Singapore, boxing is not as popular and commercialised as football/soccer. You should consider equipping yourself with relevant knowledge regarding this sport as not to be isolated in group discussions. I recommend you sign up as a trial player for Sembawang Rangers in NSU. (We have a 'thriving' local football league known as the S-League and we hpoe to be in the 2010 World Cup Finals  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) However, to satisfy your boxing urge, you can catch live telecast action of your favourite boxers at Muthu's Prata &amp; Curry Cafeteria &amp; Disco Pub. (Free flow of curry on Wed and Sat nights). It is located at 7 Ulu Sembawang Rd 5. (Impossible to miss with it's mesmerising neon lights and authentic curry fragrance. Plus It's within walking distance form the NSU!)<br><br>You're welcome.</div>

(side-track abit, our armed forces actually gotta specially condition obese kids to make them suitable for military life. my goodness! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) looks-wise, the ethnic group with the fairest complexion here, are the chinese and they are already darker than Carlifornian beach bums (different shade though). so catch some Australian sun whichever state you're in now. also, as you might have guessed after reading some of the posts from this forum, Singaporeans speak weird English, so if you can't understand some of the Martian language on Sgforums.com, better start posting queries here. our spoken Singlish will sound even weirder.<br><br>(2) again, fret not over which university to apply for your semester-long stint in Singapore. you don't have a choice! NUS is our only campus with its own law faculty. NTU is on its way to becoming a full and complete university, but not soon enough.<br><br>(3) however, please do fret if you're addicted to blood sports like the Ultimate Fighting Championships. Singapore is a nanny nation which does not trust its citizens to choose their poison. so-called excessive violence and sex are not shown on national tv and cinemas. you gotta get your own daily fix from VCD/DVD sold illegally (don't worry about finding them, they'll find you! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) by the way, most of my Australian friends are into drugs. drug-trafficking is punishable by death in Singapore. and they sometimes refuse to buy that 'ONLY for self-consumption line'.<br><span style="color: red;">   </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks you all of you for taking your time to answer my questions. Previously I did not no much about Singapore, except that finding out you guys have very fine girls after visiting this site and apparently according to my friend, Singapore people have a real clear english accent (not like the South Africans). Anway it seems like the people here are really nice and I look forward to coming here and immersing my self in a culture of peculiar english, and genetically gifted females.<br><br>"Oh sweet Singapore and your promises of scintilating culture and girls, PLEASE DO NOT FORSAKE ME".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, most singaporeans speak the "local version" of snglish but you'll pick it up easily <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>rugby league? those who watch rugby here rarely know of the League version and were exposed (due to the world cup) to the Union Rules...<br><br>you're pretty big.. an inch taller than me and about 12 kg heavier... but i'm supposed to be "tall" here... you'll not really stick out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>the national universities that offer law? i think only the National University of Singapore offers that... unfortunately... but i may be wrong... i did my degree in melbourne (so i'm a little more partial to Aussie Rules <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>pubs here usually show football (aka Soccer) on weekends.. i don't think there are many which show fights.. but there are exceptions... booze here is unreasonably expensive <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>UFC and all that? i don't think so... the closest things to "fights" are the silly pro-wrestling show by WWE (a guilty pleasure of mine <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>hey, if you do come around, have a good time here yah?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So you studied in Melbourne "Bear", I am just going to make a wild guess that you studied at Monash, actually it is not a wild guess I know that Monash has a high proportion of international students.<br>Aussie rules is very popular in Melbourne, I feel sorry that you were not exposed to League which is better in my opinion and more exciting, but this is just a personal prejudiced voiced in the absence of solid evidence and the fact that I play League does cloud my judgement I guess. League is probably the biggest sport in Sydney, thats why 90% of the teams are from Sydney.<br><br>Anyway what did you study?<br><br>What the hell is Snglish? Did you make that word up like in Rush Hour when Chris Tucker said "i'm Blackanese"?  Are the people of Singapore known as Snglanese or Singlo or something? Is that even a language?I looked up the word "Snglish" in the Meriam-Webster Dictionary and nothing came up. Is Snglish some of the "Lor" "Lah" and "Chio Bui" stuff that the people put at the end of their sentences? Because those are real weird ass words.<br><br>I will try to enjoy myself immensley in Singapore whilst balancing study, but I think I am going to have a real hard time learning law in Snglish.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PhiskerOne:</div><div class="quote_body">I would just like to ask several questions about Singapore, to all you Singaporeans because I am seriously considering coming here as an exchange student for a semester or two from Australia.<br><br>1) Firstly I would just like to get this sorted out and out of the way first. Australians love Rugby League and I am no different, hence this is why I'm 6 foot 1 or 184 cm and I weigh 200 pounds or 90 kilos (I do not know what system your country use), because I love playing the sport and have to be at this size inorder to play for my club. With this explanation aside, I would like to know, when I come here on exchange, "Will I look conspicuos or like the giant that just fell down the beanstalk". I ask this question because the last time and only time I went to a Asian country (Japan) people in the streets were staring at me like I was some freak, they were short, I was tall, and my clothes were different, I just felt like a giant and that every body was gawking at me. Will I have this same problem in Singapore? With my size and my clothes?<br><br>2) Secoundly is the National University of Singapore a good law school in Singapore, whats its prestige like compared to other Uni's in Singapore. I would like to know this because this is the only law school in Singapore my Uni has exchange agreements with.<br><br>3) Finally do the pubs in Singapore show the big time boxing fights? I do not mind if they do not show the small time unknown fighters. But they do show fighters like Tyson, Tszyu, and De La Hoya right?. Moreover does Singapore have access to the Ultimate Fighting Championships or the Pride Fighting Championships ?<br><br>All these questions are really important to me, I would like to know them before I decide to come on exchange here, so could you please answer them. Your patience in answering these question will be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Thank you</div></blockquote>1.83m and 70-80kg here i dun think people would stare at you here unless you have a habbit of going around semi-naked or being over-dressed<br><br>we only have 3 unis here<br>standard feels pretty much the same to me<br><br>i dun think we have much people watching boxing matches here<br>i dun even think you can see much of it unless you have cable<br><br><blockquote>What the hell is Snglish?

Previously I did not no much about Singapore, except that finding out you guys have very fine girls after visiting this site and apparently according to my friend, Singapore people have a real clear english accent (not like the South Africans). Anway it seems like the people here are really nice and I look forward to coming here and immersing my self in a culture of peculiar english, and genetically gifted females.<br><br>"Oh sweet Singapore and your promises of scintilating culture and girls, PLEASE DO NOT FORSAKE ME".  </div></blockquote>if you are really interested in UFC and boxing, just make friends with local girls, take at least one with you and walk around Marina Square, Mohd Sultan, Boat Quay, Clark Quay and almost everywhere in singapore late at night  like 2-3 a.m..  I guarantee you that you will see some live action.  Actually, sometimes you will be involved sometimes.  Once, I saw this Ang Moh got the sh*t whacked out of him by this little chinese guy and it sure was hilarious.  The Ang Moh wet his pants.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I think that guy was on drugs or something.  I never read about this in the papers.  Maybe the Ang Moh too embarassed to tell police or the newspapers cover up.  Good luck and welcome and spend a lot of money here!</div>
