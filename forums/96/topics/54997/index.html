            <div class='col-md body'>Men views on Women<br><br>Fowarded email...<br><br>We always hear "the rules" from the female side.<br>Now here are the rules from the male side.<br><br>These are their rules!<br><br>Please note...<br>these are all numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!<br><br>1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it<br>down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us omplaining about<br>you leaving it down.<br><br>1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.<br>Let it be.<br><br>1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.<br><br>1. Crying is blackmail.<br><br>1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!<br><br>1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.<br><br>1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br><br>1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.<br><br>1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.<br><br>1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br><br>1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.<br><br>1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br><br>1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done.<br>Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.<br><br>1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during<br>commercials.<br><br>1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.<br><br>1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.<br><br>1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.<br><br>1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like<br>nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the<br>hassle.<br><br>1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.<br><br>1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really.<br><br>1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.<br><br>1. You have enough clothes.<br><br>1. You have too many shoes.<br><br>1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.<br><br>1. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping.</div>
