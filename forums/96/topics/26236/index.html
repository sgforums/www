We guys, should take the first move to care about the gal, dun just sit there and guessing. Since she said she like u a lot, so no need to worry much. It's just only u and her in different field, n  it's not a problem to get along with. There still a lot of things u and her to share together. Be more care and luve her more, dun think too much, though if u r the only one giving........... this wat we call luv............<br></div>
