            <div class='col-md body'>Alright i apologise for my previous posting. It seemed as if i wasn't supportive of our very  own Sg girls. I just tuned in to the encore of Miss Universe Singapore and recorded the whole thing over my TV tuner card.Comparing it with last week's previeew before telecast, here's what i have to say about some of the contestants.........<br><br>Adeline Lim - she is very tall and confident. Unlike Joan Seah and Sandy chua, Adeline do not really need. Her natural outlook alone draws my attention and charisma wise, she outshines the other contestants.<br><br>Cassandra Ng - She has that typical 'Ah Lian' look, but she is my type of Ah Lian. She speaks with some Singlish in her English which is a drawback. Anyway, she is very natural and cute too! She likes gaming......i wonder? FPS, role-playing?<br><br>Bridgette Leong - nothing much about her caught my eyes during the contest but i can never forget her in the rehearsal. She was wearing that all-too-short skirt and i think she looks great in it. Just like Cassandra Ng, another girl-next-door.<br><br>Low Wee Naa - Again she wasn't much of a shine during the finals but her great figure game me a stun during the rehearsal. She displayed her full blossom hips and legs and etched an unforgetable image in my mind!<br><br>Marilyn Tan - I am not looking for shiny dark skinned babe. I am looking for a great tan. She happened to have it! The other ladies i mentioned far surpassed Marilyn in figure and looks but not the smile. Marilyn has a smile that lights up Sg - and perhaps that is how she secured her position as a runner up.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I will get an Italian or Spanian who is a Singapore citizen or PR!<br><br>The reason why Miss Universe is put up is partiallyy to promote international peace and harmony with beauties around the world gathering for a contest of personality and wits. So what if an Indian could dress up as an European and win? If an Indian dress up in the way you see that walking on the streets, you think they can even qualify for the semi-finals? They wouldn't be elceted in the first place!<br><br>Since Sandy Chua is the winner and shall be representing Sg in Miss Universe, i wouldn't expect her to look like an European during the big day. She is representing Sg and i expect her to like like a Singaporean, that's what.<br><br>Bollywood - originates from 'Hollywood'.<br>Beng         - originates from the Hokkien dialect.<br>Haven't anyone got something of their own creation and origin to begin with?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the organisers want to attract better applicants must give better prizes- $10K cash &amp; contract with Mediacorp not good enough. Not everyone wants to be an actress. They should get sponsors to give free supply of cosmetics, clothes, accessories, beauty/ spa treatment for 1 year, free trip/ or education scheme/car/ jewellery etc. It's our reputation at stake, got to choose good candidates who can speak proper English. Maybe should scout around the JC/ poly/ Universities. Sometimes I see very pretty girls in Orchard Rd. Don't understand why we always get the 'ah lians' &amp; those with poor  figures</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hei dun b a racist ok.indians walkin down the street can't get elected or enter semi finals?then the chinese must be shameless or not rite up there to even enter the contect with their lorry run over features.better yet the judges still can pick one of them over so many ducks walkin down tht stage.WAKE UP!!!<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by 'm back:</div><div class="quote_body">If i want Sg to win with a model who has an Italiian or spanish look, i will not dress up or pick a Chinese or Malay or Indian for the contest. I will get an Italian or Spanian who is a Singapore citizen or PR!<br><br>The reason why Miss Universe is put up is partiallyy to promote international peace and harmony with beauties around the world gathering for a contest of personality and wits. So what if an Indian could dress up as an European and win? If an Indian dress up in the way you see that walking on the streets, you think they can even qualify for the semi-finals? They wouldn't be elceted in the first place!<br><br>Since Sandy Chua is the winner and shall be representing Sg in Miss Universe, i wouldn't expect her to look like an European during the big day. She is representing Sg and i expect her to like like a Singaporean, that's what.<br><br>Bollywood - originates from 'Hollywood'.<br>Beng         - originates from the Hokkien dialect.<br>Haven't anyone got something of their own creation and origin to begin with?</div></blockquote></div>
