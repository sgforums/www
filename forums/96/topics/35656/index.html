He declined to give his full name.<br><br>Dao Jing's grandmother said the dispute might have been over a wallet he had apparently picked up.<br><br>Madam Sua Ah Moi, 66, said quietly, in a voice thick with grief: 'His two friends told us that he had picked up a wallet at the games arcade and had kept it with him.'<br><br>It is believed that several men had approached Dao Jing later, saying the wallet belonged to one of them.<br><br>Dao Jing had gone to Genie Funworld on the third storey of Lucky Chinatown Shopping Centre with two childhood friends.<br><br>They were playing at another machine, while Dao Jing was on his own.<br><br>Some witnesses told police they saw him being led away by a group of Chinese men.<br><br>When the two friends found him missing, they went in search of him and found him on the staircase landing between the first and second floor. Initially, they thought he had tripped and cracked his head on the floor.<br><br>A shopkeeper, who declined to be named, said the police were asking people in the vicinity if they had seen a 'tall and well-built Chinese man in his 30s' fleeing from the staircase.<br><br>Shopkeepers said the staircase was usually deserted and that any shouts or screams for help would have been drowned out by the loud music from the karaoke lounge on the fourth floor.<br><br>Dao Jing's grandfather, Mr Wong Seng Wah, with whom he lived, said: 'When I heard that he had been beaten up in a fight, I thought he had suffered some minor injuries.<br><br>'Never did I expect to see him dead in hospital.'<br><br>Dao Jing, a first-year commerce student, had an older and a younger sister.<br><br>The sisters have lived with their grandparents in a Bedok South Housing Board flat since their parents divorced about five years ago.<br><br>Police are investigating and any one with information should call 1800-255-0000.<br></div>
