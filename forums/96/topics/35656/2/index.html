            <div class='col-md body'>My younger brother was beaten up like this before and landed in the hospital... Of course, he didn't die from that incident... According to him, he didn't provoke anyone but just bought something from 7-11 that EARLY MORNING... Around 1-2am...? The IRONIC part is there was a Neighborhood Police Post just behind the 7-11 where he was beaten... But the NPP was closed... You know... Those you have to push the button for HELP in case of emergency thing...? He was attacked from the back, of course he didn't managed to make it there....<br><br>He was so badly beaten that one of his eyes couldn't close too... And after the police had went down to take his statement, they said they couldn't help much unless my brother can identify those group of people... And in that case it'll be a CIVIL case...

Then they would say ACTIONS have to be taken... The rest just doesn't matter... I ain't surprise that such things would happen at all... ESPECIALLY with the police force having this kinda ATTITUDE..?
