            <div class='col-md body'>I think it shouldnt be an issue of persevering? It should be an issue of making an interest and seeing if it is interest on both sides? I mean what is yours is yours even if you persevere and eventually land her but one day finds out that you both are incompatible then arent you wasting your efforts for nothing. I think it is still better to get to know the person first. After all if she knows you well enough and you know her well enough chances are that you will not only be able to form a nice relationship but one that could actually lead on to bigger things. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh sorry just to add one more thing. I personally know of such an incident. My good friend (gal) was wooed very persistently and with superb determination by her ex-bf. Went on for a quite a number of years but eventually he decided to break up because he felt they werent right. So i guess the ancient saying of.."whats yours will be yours".. no point forcing the issue.<br><br>Of course, there are exceptions but its way too indepth to get into. I am merely suggesting a more favorable form of action. Cheers~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally experinced this kind of thing also.<br>my ex was after me for exactly a year. Initially I had no feelings for him but slowly I feel that he's quite a nice guy. he is so much taller than me and he never met any of my requirement for a bf. eventually we became very close friends and we became a couple.<br>I broke off with him 1 year later when I met a guy that i know i like<br><br>in the first place, he never was the kind of guy i will like. maybe i was with him out of tong qing. I feel that we look funny when we were out together. i saw our reflection on glass or mirrow and i actually feel embarrassed. he is so soft and i don't like his boastful ways.<br>but now, I'm with my current bf of 3 years. he's fat and ugly and i am not embarrassed at all.<br><br>I feel that when the unwilling party gives in and agree to be a couple, the forced person be trying to love and acept the relationship. but he/she will still see the bad things like she not goodlooking enough, he's shorter than me, he's abit sissy, she's fat.<br>we tend to sian the person. and the sian will not go away cos he/she's not the right person for you.</div>
