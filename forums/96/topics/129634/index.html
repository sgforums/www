            <div class='col-md body'>(this thread is basically directed at females because I need to know how females react in such a case)<br><br>Hi,<br><br>Now, there's this girl at one particular MRT station I'm really impressed with and I see her almost everyday. She sees me too, but basically, I'm just one of the many people she just casually glances at etc.<br><br>I'm getting more interested in her with each passing day until I now realize that there's no choice but to walk up to her and ask for her phone number.<br><br>In such a case, how will the average Singaporean girl feel? I know in Western countries, this is nothing...but Singapore is still pretty conservative by current standards.<br>Furthermore, she's a down-to-earth and well-behaved girl from what I've found out, not some kind of gangster girl. This makes it even harder.<br><br>I'm not scared of approaching her, but I'm scared of <strong>freaking her out!</strong><br>If she freaks out, there goes my chances.<br><br>So, from a female's point of view, how will a well-behaved and decent 19-year old college student feel(that's her)?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Annonymous!<br>(can't believe that I actually have to resort to this post)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PLEASE do not whip out your hp and wave it in the girl's face saying your not a bad guy. I've had guys do that so many times and honestly it's very irritating. Pick up lines are awful too. I suggest what everyone has, that is to make eye contact and smile and see what happends from there. good luck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks a lot for your reply, folks!<br><br>Hmmm....I can imagine myself making eye contact with her, but no smiles for the initial stages, though.<br>But the issue is : if you make eye contact with a girl, wouldn't she get freaked out?<br><br>Like, she would think "Huh? Why does he keep looking at me?"<br>And within her, she would have a vague conception that I'm a pervert or some guy with naughty ideas or something...and that's not good for me.<br>Don't girls(especially the decent ones) feel this way when a guy make consistent eye contact with them?<br>Not to mention the smiling part. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Need more opinions, though.<br><br>Secondly, about asking for e-mail/MSN. Assume that she has an e-mail address(99.9% likely), what do I even talk about? That's what I don't like about e-mails, for they're pretty emotionless and I find it hard to express anything through e-mail.<br><br>I also need some tips to improve *credibility* so that she doesn't freak out or think that I'm a bad guy.<br><br>Thanks!<br>Annoynymous.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
