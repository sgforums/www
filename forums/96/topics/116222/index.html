            <div class='col-md body'>Would like to ask the gals for info on the  estimated  number of women between 19 crappers below 27 in sgforum. and who are the women who may be open to the idea of dating an older guy? or the numbers doesnt pile up but i find it difficult to believe cos there are white expat who have pretty young spg gal friend around their arms and their age difference is definitely more than 10 years, would things be different if it was an  older expat  asking for a date with a younger local gal, if this is is so, we still living in colonial mentality baggae?Would like to ask adive from the women what can make the gals be more responsive, i did have a chance online but this gal in late teens  of mixed spanish indoensian  parentage  lived in  the states and though she declared her feelings and loved, we knew it couldnt work out due to the distance , so if its here, much better,advice/assistance  from the gals on the my quest would be appreciated. Another time when i was 29 and this caucasian gal was 18 , we had dated one another before howvery she wasnt used to singapore local life hawker food local delicacies. therefore would prefer a local gal whom theres more common interests , therefore i will listen to the gals,  in their early mid twenties,to evaluate and to asses and to decide where to  go from here.<br>where do i intend to go from here / wh do i want to be with<br>what do i need to do get there (strategy planning)<br><br>Personally i dont think its the age issue cos there are people whoa re more than 10 years older than the gal and they are together,its bcoming more common now when you wal in the streets an see these couples holding hand in hand  jut hope the gals here have an open heart, we are living in the 21st century, dotn see the trivial things like age and height,if yuo remember some time ago there were gals who woldnt date a guy shorter than them or younger than them, this is rather weak reasons, anyway i am tall not dating an older woman so whats the problem?So gals open up just for a while and look beyond the age factor and look at the chemistry an click factor</div>
