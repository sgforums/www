            <div class='col-md body'>Got this off another forum...<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large"><strong>PICTURE THIS</strong></span></span><br><br>John is your average guy. Every morning he gets up, goes to work and finds sexy little notes from his girlfriend Kristy promising him all kinds of naughty things. Of course, that not only helps get him through the day, it keeps him looking forward to the evenings.<br><br>At least it used to be that way; nowadays it seems like John is lucky if Kristy can drag her lazy butt far enough away from the couch and bonbons to clip her toenails.<br><br>The last piece of lingerie she wore to bed turned out to be a pair of crotchless panties that ended up that way after one too many revolutions through the spin cycle. As well, Kristy seems to think that simply rolling over and flopping her legs open is all that's needed to satisfy her man on the rare occasion that she does go for a little nighttime fun.<br><br>Unfortunately, more and more guys are waking up every morning to the feeling of unshaven legs scratching at their thighs and bunion-ridden toes sticking out from under the covers. It's a damn shame that these hardworking guys have to watch as their once firm, young beauties transform into cellulite-packing sasquatches who won't so much as eliminate their mustaches, much less wash the dishes that have been stinking up the kitchen for days. This travesty has to stop before it gets out of control.<br><br><strong>warning signs</strong><br><br>We all know that this will occur at some point in every relationship, but the question now becomes: How can you detect and put a stop to it before it gets out of hand? Constant problems within the relationship, a slight change in her appearance and a lull in your sex life can be indicators that she might be headed downhill.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New problems in the relationship </span><br>She tries to catch you in the wrong. She wanders through the house trying to find things you've done that might anger her. She goes postal when she finds the toilet seat up, for example.<br><br>She avoids seeing your loved ones. She doesn't seem to care about spending time with the people who used to be close to you.<br><br>You never go out together like you used to. Nice dinners and dancing are merely a memory; she would rather rent a movie and stay home.<br><br>She doesn't say, "I love you" anymore. She used to tell you how much she adores you all the time, now you're lucky if you hear it once a month.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Her personal appearance deteriorates</span><br>She's a bit fuzzy. That once baby soft skin feels like sandpaper. She won't even wear short shorts because of it.<br><br>She doesn't smell as good. She used to smell like strawberries and cotton candy, but now she won't even wear the perfume you bought her.<br><br>She doesn't dress up as much. She wears the same clothes over and over again and seems to think that brown pants with a hot pink top match just fine.<br><br>She doesn't care about putting on weight. Normally, she would freak out if the scale moved up at all, but now she doesn't even notice her developing belly.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bedroom issues</span><br>She no longer wants to experiment in the bedroom. The same old position is just fine. And you can forget about those massage oils, let alone the toys.<br><br>She says things like, "Let's get it over with." Intimacy has taken a backseat and foreplay is a distant memory. Now she just wants to hurry up and get through it like a chore.<br><br>She no longer seems concerned with pleasing you. She won't go out of her way to make sure you are happy in bed anymore. She's happy just getting from point A to B in three minutes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large"><strong>what do you do? </strong></span></span><br><br>Your woman has become a wrinkled vegetable in the relationship, that much is clear at this point. Needless to say, she is not going to do anything about it. So, if you're serious about keeping her around, then you'll likely have to take the initiative. Here are a few tips.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Star System </span><br>Go to your local supermarket and get yourself a little notebook and a few packs of those little foil star stickers. Each day, whenever your woman does something worth noticing, give her a star or two.<br><br>For example, if she actually makes herself look half decent, give her a star. If she makes you a great dinner and asks about your day, give her two. If she wakes you up with oral sex, well maybe you shouldn't be complaining to begin with. Then you can set up an award system for a set number of stars that she receives.<br><br>Think of it as a Pavlovian experiment. Apply positive reinforcement and teach her what she has to do if she wants to receive a treat. Once she starts racking up some points, then you can use the following to treat her to something exquisite.<br><br><strong>5 stars</strong>: A personal massage<br><strong>10 stars</strong>: Dinner at a nice restaurant<br><strong>15 stars</strong> : A sexy outfit<br><strong>20 stars </strong>: A treatment at a day spa<br><strong>25 stars</strong> : A piece of jewelry<br><strong>50 stars</strong>: A weekend getaway<br><strong>100 stars</strong>: ...Time to propose</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"><span class="large"><strong>prevention is key </strong></span></span><br><br>You have to make it your duty to notice the problems early on and take action right away. Otherwise, one day you'll wake up to some hairy, smelly beast that can belch longer and louder than you. You've got to get her off her tail and coax her into some exercise. Telling her to get her chunky rump to the gym isn't going to cut it.<br><br><strong>Find something you can do together</strong>. Suggest that the two of you take a long walk one night and look at the stars. Not only is it good for her, it might score you some brownie points. Or take her shopping; this way she gets to do some walking outside combined with an activity every woman loves.<br><br><strong>Compliment her</strong>. Try some positive reinforcement and tell her all the things that you still like about her. The sexier you make her feel, the sexier she will want to become. And the best way to keep her motivated is by letting her know that you notice and care about her.<br><br><strong>Practice what you preach</strong>. Ask yourself what kind of an example you are setting in the relationship. Perhaps a large part of her laziness is a reflection of your own lack of interest. Why should she put in the effort if you just lay around like a pig all day?<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;"><strong><span class="large">talk to her </span></strong></span><br><br>Remember that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">communication is key</span>. If you make sure she knows you're interested, she will want to be sexy for you. And, although a little honesty is always good, sometimes too much can just be dangerous. So be careful how you approach the situation and make sure to treat her with the compassion and understanding she deserves. As long as she knows she still has that, keeping her beautiful will be a breeze.</div>
