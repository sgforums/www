I used the soft approach and definitely it works.<br><br>First of all, oways use the "I' message... everything starts with the teacher (personal life experiences can be used in here) Ive oways told them how i behaved in sec sch and how i achieve to what I am now... (of coz in between add some 'stories')<br><br>Secondly, as a form teacher or subject teacher, oways spend more time with the slower students or those students in gangs, get to noe them more and understand why they are not performing in school. And this is wat i did... i oways have to work till 9pm in the nite so that i could finish my admin work and lesson preparation because earlier in the day i was trying to building a rapport with my students either lunching or chatting normally in their lingo..<br><br>Thirdly, if they have unsupportive parents, the teachers will need alot of patience and call the parents up. We haf to be thick skinned and let them understand their child's performance in school. If they parents do not show concern, let them noe... 'As teachers, we are trying our very best to bring out the talent in your child, and we definitely need your support in making the parents proud of their child in the society in the near future. We aint complaining to you but we do need to let u understand what is going on in school as your child spends half their day in school with the teachers. The school can only help you to a certain limit as eventually, you are the parents.' There are times threats haf to be used on parents who turn abusive....(confidential)<br><br>Actually, it is partly due to parents over concern for a kid that they had adored their child far too much and so their child misbehave in school thinking they can haf they ways. But they are disciplined from the school, they complain to their parents wif a difft story.. so as teacher, the school and I do keep a record black and white and sometimes wif a witness asking the offender to sign on a piece of paper and den will send to parents to inform them.<br><br>But den again its not entire all the parents at fault because their child can be an angel at home but out for mischief in school because of peer influence... so pls do not blame entirely on the parents... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I was juz speaking from a teacher's point of view <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> (Abit too lengthy i noe..)<br></div></blockquote>excellent! the system we have here is not exactly supportive of students who are less academically inclined. they become marginalised and ostracised and frustrated with the system. and these students tend to cluster and fall behind and go wayward...<br><br>and it is the teachers who will have to make a difference here...<br><br>but sad to say not all teachers know and understand this. some refuse to teach at neighbourhood schools cos its less prestigious and cos they do not want to teach these less fortunate kids...<br><br>but teaching is about educating the younger generation, and not about prestige and avoiding problems rite?</div>

I, myself could not get used to the sch initially due to culture shock... but slowly I adapted to it.. it gives us a greater sense of satisfaction in the job rather than the other sch which ive been to.. esp. Mission sch. And slowly I get to love my job... but den again... the rigid sch system or the sch wif many politics does pull the morale of a teacher down greatly and this is happening in my sch. The quieter teacher does bite more painfully than those vocal ones... this is wat ive learnt in the sch Im  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  The politics get worse when there are external factors involved in the sch activities  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  I used to move on in the sch coz of the CCA but seems like Im now moving on in the sch due to my form class who has gone thru thick and thin wif me for the past half year  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .<br><br>Teaching is about being a disciplinarian and also an educator (of coz there are other jobs too like.. tel operator, nanny, cleaner, etc). I dunno about the other teachers but I do not teach my students according to the book so that i'm fair to them as they have read the books, i believe strongly in applying what they've read n learnt so I teach wif a difft approach.<br><br>Some teachers are more ambitious and definitely is teaching due to prestige (The ranking system is stressing all most teachers out) and many avoid problematic students so that they can haf a peaceful job in the sch. On the other hand, we teachers cannot get too involved with the students as someday we'll not know what troubles with the law they can get us to. There is a line to be drawn in between us but i still believe in treating them as a general friend coz teachers actually spend half of their day wif them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
