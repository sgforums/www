People get married because of love, money and sex. They happily plugging in and out of each other everynight and when they have a child, they are not mentally-prepared for it. Not that they don't know that their plugging exercise will bring them a baby, but their mind is not mature enough to handle a family life yet. They think...hmm...I got a good and stable job, wonderful wife/husband, maybe I should be getting a baby before it is too late?<br><br>So the question is, are they prepared to take on the responsibilities of being a good father/mother to their child?<br><br>The fact is that they are not prepared at all. Like going into a classroom to take a sudden exam. Well, if they pay enough attention in the class normally, they would have done fairly. People indulge themselves in their own enjoyment and happiness and they failed to pay attention to life itself. So when the time comes for them to become their own parents, they realised that they didn't have the tolerance and patience and discipline for the children...most of them completely clueless about it and these people often seeks the advice of their peers who have already had children before them.<br><br>So...make sure you are really ready to take on the heavy and long-term responsibilities of a parent before you pop one out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I also feel disgusted and pity those parents who don't know how to discipline their kids. What kind of future generation are we producing and rearing for? This topic probably piss me off more than anything else when I go out. Is Singaporeans mental-growth on par with our economy-growth?<br><br>I certainly do not want to be an incapable parent in the future. And will definitely slap my kids silly if they ask me to chop seats for them in the MRT. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all!! Still can't to get to sleep... this topic really disturbs me...<br><br>I can say Im strict towards my students and raises my voice when the students does misbehave...<br><br>But den after sometime in a school, I was given one of the worst NT class for a beginning teacher of a month. Harsh treatment only invited more troubles for myself <span style="color: red;">e.g. fights in class, vulgarities used on teachers, speak and insult teacher in their dialect which teacher dun understand, molest their classmate, do not attend sch neither bring books or school bags to school.</span> <span style="color: #444444;"></span> They are creating a rebel in class and wanna show the teacher that they want to have their own ways.<br><br>After a while i understood that corporate treatment does not work as ive sent too many students to the P's office for canning for open defiance and absconding from school. I used the soft approach and definitely it works.<br><br>First of all, oways use the "I' message... everything starts with the teacher (personal life experiences can be used in here) Ive oways told them how i behaved in sec sch and how i achieve to what I am now... (of coz in between add some 'stories')<br><br>Secondly, as a form teacher or subject teacher, oways spend more time with the slower students or those students in gangs, get to noe them more and understand why they are not performing in school. And this is wat i did... i oways have to work till 9pm in the nite so that i could finish my admin work and lesson preparation because earlier in the day i was trying to building a rapport with my students either lunching or chatting normally in their lingo..<br><br>Thirdly, if they have unsupportive parents, the teachers will need alot of patience and call the parents up. We haf to be thick skinned and let them understand their child's performance in school. If they parents do not show concern, let them noe... 'As teachers, we are trying our very best to bring out the talent in your child, and we definitely need your support in making the parents proud of their child in the society in the near future. We aint complaining to you but we do need to let u understand what is going on in school as your child spends half their day in school with the teachers. The school can only help you to a certain limit as eventually, you are the parents.' There are times threats haf to be used on parents who turn abusive....(confidential)<br><br>Actually, it is partly due to parents over concern for a kid that they had adored their child far too much and so their child misbehave in school thinking they can haf they ways. But they are disciplined from the school, they complain to their parents wif a difft story.. so as teacher, the school and I do keep a record black and white and sometimes wif a witness asking the offender to sign on a piece of paper and den will send to parents to inform them.<br><br>But den again its not entire all the parents at fault because their child can be an angel at home but out for mischief in school because of peer influence... so pls do not blame entirely on the parents... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I was juz speaking from a teacher's point of view <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> (Abit too lengthy i noe..)<br></div>
