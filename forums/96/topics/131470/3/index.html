If you don't like the shop then do not partronise it.<br><br>On the other hand, they are people who like to play the role of High Priests who may be totally out of touch with reality when they pass judgment.  Just like the parent who complaint to the newspaper Â– Laianhe Zaobao Â– 11 May 05, Chu Yin Chan (Ms) article to The ST Forum, 13 May 05.  They yean for more government control of their life, limit their own choices, in so doing also to limit their children exposure to the real life out there.<br><br>Whereas government is progressive and going the other direction, recognizing that more choices should be given back to the people (eg casino).  Recongnising that SÂ’porean (including Singapore students) should learn to grow up to meet the new challenge of tomorrow and face the future squally and do not depend on governmentsÂ’ Â“rules and regulationsÂ” to control how they should live their life, how they should think.<br><br>It is interesting why the High Priests do not request for shutting down all porn sites?  DonÂ’t they know that these porn sites are just a click away?<br><br>I believe the best way forward for them is to take away all the high tech gadget from their own life and from their off springs.  May be they should learn from, and follow those farmers in Northern Malaya, who throw their TVs, computers and high tech gadgets into the river sometimes back.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you deathscythe99 for typing out the article.<br><br><strong>Quote - The STÂ’s Forum H10, 13 May 05.<br><br>&gt;&gt;Showcase of 'Oriental Beauties'<br><br>Objectionable website on Singapore girls<br><br>At first glance, the website www.sggirls.com seems to be showcasing Oriental beauties but, beneath that facade of innocence, it is anything but decent.<br><br>Most of the photographs are of Singaporean girls, as indicated by the website's address.  I believe many of the photographs were published without their owners' knowledge.<br><br>Most of these photographs came out of good, clean fun, but the comments below some of them carry sexual innuendos; others - featuring male fantasies - are outright obscene.<br><br>The pictures are even divided into categories, including one of girls in school uniforms. Even these photographs of students in their uniforms are not spared the risque remarks, and risk damaging the schools' reputation.<br><br>Worse still, innocent victims are getting their names tarnished and are being subjected to emotional and mental harm - that is, if they are aware that their photographs are being scrutinised by people all over the world. Such audacity and impudence cannot be tolerated.<br><br>Although every individual has a role to play in protecting his rights and preventing invasion of privacy, it must be noted that many of the photographs are ordinary, everyday ones and may have been put up elsewhere on the Internet - if not by the subjects themselves, then by friends who had no intention whatsoever of causing harm to them.<br><br>It is the abusers who have so odiously re-published the photographs on sggirls, together with lewd remarks.<br><br>Ever since the Internet has established, there has been much controversy regarding its pros and cons. As much as I enjoy logging on, some people have turned what was meant to benefit the human race into a forebidding realm - and they have taken it a step too far this time.<br><br>The development of digital cameras has made it easier for pictures to be uploaded on the Internet. Not surprisingly, mankind has yet again found a way to misuse the work of geniuses.<br><br>Technology is constantly advancing and the Internet is no longer simply a virtual world providing information and entertainment.<br><br>It is, in fact, and extension of our real world, and it is high time that laws are extended to this new boundary.<br><br>I am sure the authorities would not be very happy to have people around the world stumbling onto www.sggirls.com and going, "Oh! So this is what Singaporean girls are like."<br><br>I hope the authorities will act on this matter.<br><br>Chu Yin Chan (Ms)</strong><br><br>Chu Yin Chan (Ms) recognized that most of the photographs came out of good, clean fun and also recognized that many of the photographs are ordinary, everyday ones and may had been put up elsewhere on the Internet - if not by the subjects themselves, then by their friends.<br><br>What she objected to were the abusers who have so odiously re-published the photographs on sggirls.com, together with lewd remarks / comments below some of the photographs which she perceived to carry sexual innuendos; others - featuring male fantasies - are outright obscene.<br><br>She perceived innocent victims are getting their names tarnished and are being subjected to emotional and mental harm - that is, if they are aware that their photographs are being scrutinized by people all over the world.  She concluded that such audacity and impudence cannot be tolerated.<br><br>So the issue with Chu Yin Chan (Ms) is not that the photographs are objectionable or pornography in nature.  It was the abusers who re-posted the photographs with lewd / risquÃ© remarks / comments which she cannot tolerate.<br><br>Chu Yin Chan (Ms) also recognize that the photographs may have been put up elsewhere on the Internet Â– if not by the subjects themselves, then by their friends.  She should have recognize that it is just a few clicks away for the abusers to re-publish the photographs on sggirls.com or for that matter any other websites in the world, with the attending lewd / risquÃ© remarks.  When you post your photographs on the Internet, you must have though through the consequences before you do so.  You should not consider yourselves as innocent victims Â– knowing full well that what is on Internet is for all over the world to see, save, print, download, and re-post.<br><br>Chu Yin Chan (Ms) should recognize that any concern she had is toward the abusers who re-post the photographs with lewd / risquÃ© remarks / comments and not the Internet (sggirls.com inclusive).  She should recognize that the abusers could be from all over the world, where government has no jurisdiction.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like this<br><br>chioeves, photoforum all must close liao<br><br>kaoz. this mother really thinks all singaporean girls are angels and they have been mishandled and mutilated by the dark side of the society when such photos of them in degradatory poses have been posted on the net. do they look forced ?  it is not a matter of whether such pictures were taken privately and someone steals it and posts it on the net. rather the question is why would these girls even want to pose for such pictures?<br><br>the lady's letter to the strait times shows just what is the society becoming of. when something happens, blame someone else. my daughter skip class, blame the school for disciplinary slack when the question is when was the time the mother talked to the daughter. my son fall down in mac donalds, sue macdonalds when the son is obviously running ard in a crowded place. failing to wake up in time, blame alarm clock for not being loud enough.<br><br>blaming sggirls? that's so degradatory to the higher level thinking of humans. what difference does it make to 'shoot the messenger' when the messenger brings you bad news? obviously this mother in concerned has never experienced the need to discipline her children because from this incident we can clearly see she takes the behaviour, intelligence and discipline to chance. what difference does it make for this mother as compared to someone holding out at casinos waiting to strike it rich?</div>

They are always some near 0 and some near 100.<br><br>Hence you have people asking government to act on "requests" which may be viewed by majority as "unreasonable requests".<br><br>Lets wait and see which branch of government will respond to the "requests" in this case and what comments they can offer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Channel 8 news, 6.30pm, 17 May 05.<br><br>Basically, it is about a parent who found her daughter trying to upload intimate photo of her (acting like lesbian type) with her classmate onto the net.  Then angry then complain to TV station.  Then the news.<br><br>One of the school girls interviewed said that she had done so due to peer pressure!  Recognising the attention gathered by those classmates who had posted their intimate photo on the net!  So the school girl also posted similar intimate photos on the net to gain similar attention.<br><br>Some of the parents interviewed mentioned of educating the students with proper value, and teach them the consequence of their action in posting photos on the net (websites or blog sites).  The school should not just concentrate on teaching and learning.  They should go one step further in preparing the students to think deeper about posting on the net.<br><br>The news report that the issue at hand is basically to do with the studentsÂ’ way of thinking, their value, their consideration of the consequence.  The educator interviewed advised that the student should think carefully of the consequence before they put their photos on the net.<br><br>Sggirls.com was not mentioned at all, nor any website was blamed.  Nothing obscene was shown on TV but some intimate photos of poor quality.<br><br>I guess that the parent who had reported to the press wanted to attract sufficient attention with intention is to take down the websites!  It appears that the reporter is sensible enough not to reflect this nonsense, hence the news is quite balanced.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The previous post is funny (not the post but the whole report to news)  What do people hope to achieve by calling a news station because her daughter was doing something she disagrees with.  The only thing she has done is advertised the whole situation to more children and given more people the idea ... so in effect she hasnt done any good.<br><br>Its a shame that the news cant report news.  WHAT THE F*** has some uploading pictures to the web got to do with news<br><br>Mediacorp should be more responsible and tell these people to fuck off and sort out there own family issues, and not to broadcast such shit which has no value</div>
