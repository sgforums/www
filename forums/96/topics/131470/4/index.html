Not streat wise so to speak </div></blockquote>There is enough forummates who are subscriber to Starhub, having problem with access to sggirls.com but not other oversea sites for the last few hours.<br><br>Could this be a sign that Starhub is working very closely with MDA to block the sggirls.com?  At lease for the last few hours?<br><br>Had ranged Starhub and hold onto the line for 20 minutes until the technical assistance came onto the line and questioned them about the inaccessible to sggirls.com.  They gave reason of under sea cable damage Â… blah blah blah, which is not convincing as other similar websites from USA are not affected.<br><br>Now that the access to sggirls.com is OK.  Could it be that there were sufficient forummates making similar complaints until Starhub has to own up?  Has Starhub looked at the contents of sggirls.com before taking action?  Has Starhub conclude that sggirls.com is a pornographic site?  Has MDA convinced Starhub that sggirls.com is a pornographic site?<br><br>I will call Starhub and hold on to their lines and demand an answer when there is another similar incident in future.  Will you do the same?<br></div>

Theoretically, if you report lost of a hand phone to the police, the lost hand phone can be disabled and not be able to be used in Singapore.  This is not done because if the telcos do it, the policy will jam up their resources, resulting in a decay of their services.<br><br>Similarly, if a broadband service provider is to Â“blockÂ” the websites, and if there are sufficient websites or sufficient traffic being Â“blockedÂ”, then their resources will be tied down.  This may result in all the troubles in the related services that you can see now, eg problem with msn, lagging, drop out, etc.<br><br>Thus, a telco could be very good at Â“blockingÂ” but had to degrade the other services as the resources are always limited.  The one who play games in the telco determine what he want his company to be good at Â– Â“blockingÂ” or otherwise.<br></div>
