            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Female Students Photo Appearing On "Adult Site"</strong><br><br>Local female students' pictures have been found published on an adult-flavoured site. This has attracted the attention of many parents. Mr Sun discovered his daughter surfing a controversial site, and emailed the press:<br>"She (daughter) showed me pictures of girls in uniform, some of which are sexily posed, in a teasing and daring manner. She revealed to me that she is under peer pressure to take her own pictures and post them on the net. She is currently studying in an all-girls school. I was stunned. She is only 16."<br><br>The site that raised Mr Sun's eyebrows is www.sggirls.com. When the writer entered the site, he discovered that users can sort the pictures by nationality, theme, people. Among the pictures include those with "adult flavour", as well as voyeuristic shots.<br><br>With regards to the female student pictures that Mr Sun highlighted, the writer observed that they are just candid shots and playful moments. No doubt there are  some daring pictures, they are very different from the more provocative shots in other parts of the site. However, the board consists of lewd comments by surfers, criticising figures and looks. That's what made parents uncomfortable.<br><br>Besides, pictures in sggirls.com are categorised. (with a disclaimer that pictures not suitable for the underaged will not be displayed) This appears to show that this site is a socially responsible community. But, as the writer uses the filter, he still get hit results of adult pictures.<br><br>With the slogan: Oriental and Beautiful; enjoy and share pictures of the most beautiful Singapore girls (and other countries), sggirls.com is a very popular site. It houses a wide collection of ladies' pictures, especially singapore girls, allowing surfers to browse and leave their comments on the board.<br><br>The site claims to clock up to 10.7million hits a month. To verify the figure, the writer tried to contact Jason through the mobile number listed on the site, but to no avail.<br><br><strong>What Teachers Say?</strong><br>A secondary school teacher who declined to be named expressed that, "As a reflection of self-identity,  teenagers find recognition and shotr-term happiness through online communication and from others' criticism. Seldom do they know or realise the consequences of dissemination of information on the net."<br><br>He said, "These students tooks the shots at the spur of the moment. They uploaad their pictures on some websites, or they take pictures of their friends and upload them. Some students may not know that their pictures have been taken, some were taken and uploaded to sites without permission. They were shocked when they discovered their pictures being abused."<br><br>He added, "On the other hand, some students know that they can upload pictures freely, but do not have the power to remove them. Most of the times, it's due to insufficient knowlegde on how the site operates, resulting in some misunderstaning."<br><br><strong>What Students Say?</strong><br>The most "in" thing among teenagers is Blog, which is also a channel to upload and share personal pictures. Do bloggers worry about their pictures being misused or being posted at controversial sites?<br>Wong XX (22yrs old, graduate) has the habit of sharing her personal pictures on her blog. She told the writer, "People will ill intention abusing the pictures is unavoidable. I'm not against posting daring pictures, like bikini pictures, as long as the pictures are decent.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by FireIce:<br><strong>[b]Female Students Photo Appearing On "Adult Site"</strong><br><br>Local female students' pictures have been found published on an adult-flavoured site. This has attracted the attention of many parents. Mr Sun discovered his daughter surfing a controversial site, and emailed the press:<br>"She (daughter) showed me pictures of girls in uniform, some of which are sexily posed, in a teasing and daring manner. She revealed to me that she is under peer pressure to take her own pictures and post them on the net. She is currently studying in an all-girls school. I was stunned. She is only 16."<br><br>The site that raised Mr Sun's eyebrows is www.sggirls.com. When the writer entered the site, he discovered that users can sort the pictures by nationality, theme, people. Among the pictures include those with "adult flavour", as well as voyeuristic shots.<br><br>With regards to the female student pictures that Mr Sun highlighted, the writer observed that they are just candid shots and playful moments. No doubt there are  some daring pictures, they are very different from the more provocative shots in other parts of the site. However, the board consists of lewd comments by surfers, criticising figures and looks. That's what made parents uncomfortable.<br><br>Besides, pictures in sggirls.com are categorised. (with a disclaimer that pictures not suitable for the underaged will not be displayed) This appears to show that this site is a socially responsible community. But, as the writer uses the filter, he still get hit results of adult pictures.<br><br>With the slogan: Oriental and Beautiful; enjoy and share pictures of the most beautiful Singapore girls (and other countries), sggirls.com is a very popular site. It houses a wide collection of ladies' pictures, especially singapore girls, allowing surfers to browse and leave their comments on the board.<br><br>The site claims to clock up to 10.7million hits a month. To verify the figure, the writer tried to contact Jason through the mobile number listed on the site, but to no avail.<br><br><strong>What Teachers Say?</strong><br>A secondary school teacher who declined to be named expressed that, "As a reflection of self-identity,  teenagers find recognition and shotr-term happiness through online communication and from others' criticism. Seldom do they know or realise the consequences of dissemination of information on the net."<br><br>He said, "These students tooks the shots at the spur of the moment. They uploaad their pictures on some websites, or they take pictures of their friends and upload them. Some students may not know that their pictures have been taken, some were taken and uploaded to sites without permission. They were shocked when they discovered their pictures being abused."<br><br>He added, "On the other hand, some students know that they can upload pictures freely, but do not have the power to remove them. Most of the times, it's due to insufficient knowlegde on how the site operates, resulting in some misunderstaning."<br><br><strong>What Students Say?</strong><br>The most "in" thing among teenagers is Blog, which is also a channel to upload and share personal pictures. Do bloggers worry about their pictures being misused or being posted at controversial sites?<br>Wong XX (22yrs old, graduate) has the habit of sharing her personal pictures on her blog. She told the writer, "People will ill intention abusing the pictures is unavoidable. I'm not against posting daring pictures, like bikini pictures, as long as the pictures are decent. If you upload your own pictures, you should have considered carefully and thought of the consequences. You don't have to bother what people say"<br><br><strong>What Parents Say?</strong><br>On the topic about how to monitor their children using the Internet, at the same time, practise effective communicationn, Fei Yue Counselling Services' Mr Ling said, "Parents should have deeper knowledge of the websites, so they will not be biased, and the children will not repel. More importantly, parents should set the principles right, like not restricting the children to make friends over the net, but should warn them about the dangers embedded.<br><br><span class="small">translation courtesy of FI</span>[/b]</blockquote>thanks FI</div>
