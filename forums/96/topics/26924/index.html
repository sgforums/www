            <div class='col-md body'>S'pore girls, secret cameras &amp; Internet photos<br><br>BY AMY CHIEW<br>Sept 28, 2002<br><br>SOME of them may not have allowed it. They may not even know about it.<br><br>But pictures of a number of Singapore girls have been put up on a website.<br><br>The photos, contributed by the site's supporters, ranged from makeover portraits to snapshots of unsuspecting girls on the bus.<br><br>Taking pictures without anyone noticing is easy these days: Digital cameras are getting smaller, and there are nifty gadgets like handphones that can also record images.<br><br>And most people we spoke to are uneasy about it.<br><br>Said Lingehswari Eisvran, 17, a first-year college student: "It's disrespectful to others and I'll be disgusted if someone did it to me."<br><br>Miss Teng Peiyun, 20, an undergraduate, agreed.<br><br>"It's an invasion of privacy, and it's sick because it's no different from any other peeping-tom type of voyeurism," she said.<br><br>But the question is: Can these photo snappers be stopped? The answer, for now, is no.<br><br>According to criminal lawyer Ng Wee Jin, there is no law in Singapore to do so.<br><br>"If a person takes your photo without your permission, it is his camera and negatives.<br><br>"This means that the photos are his property," he said.<br><br>Said Mr Chia Boon Teck, a partner at Chia Yeo Partnership: "A woman would have recourse when her modesty is insulted or where the picture taken intrudes upon her privacy.<br><br>"Whereas if a photo is taken of her in circumstances where her modesty has not been insulted nor her privacy intruded upon, then she has very little recourse, if any."<br><br>But Mr Chia, who is also the vice-chairman of the Law Society's Criminal Practice Committee, pointed out that there could be a case for defamation.<br><br>YOU CAN SUE IF...<br><br>Let's say a photo of a well-known person is taken outside a sleazy place.<br><br>If the photo is accompanied with words that suggest that the person is patronising the place, then the person may find cause for defamation.<br><br>This is Mr Chia's advice to girls: "If a woman feels that her modesty has been insulted or her privacy intruded upon, she should make a police report.<br><br>"Then, it'll be up to the authorities to follow-up on the matter as they deem fit."<br><br>In Singapore, however, upskirting - or filming up women's skirts - would be an offence, though a recent ruling in a US court said it was okay. (See report, below.)<br><br>NEW LAW NEEDED?<br><br>Should there be a law in Singapore against snapping pictures of people without their knowledge?<br><br>Lawyers The New Paper spoke to felt that it was difficult to draw the line.<br><br>Mr Chia felt that it would be difficult to enforce.<br><br>"It is really quite difficult to have a law like that. How would you implement or enforce it?<br><br>"For example, you'll have situations where you can't accuse the photographer of targeting a particular person unless he or she is the only person in the photo," he said.<br><br>Lawyer Gloria James, also said that she didn't know where and how to draw the line. Different people, she said, will have different views on what is acceptable.<br><br>Mr Ng felt that having a law like that might result in a society that is litigious.<br><br>This means that we might have the tendency to engage in lawsuits - never mind whether it's necessary.<br><br>"We need to strike a balance - if someone just takes a picture without any evil intention, then wouldn't it be too much to arrest him?" he asked.<br><br>And how do our young feel? Students The Y Scene spoke to also felt that a law totally banning this would be too extreme.<br><br>Explained Tan Lay Boon, 17, a first-year college student: "I think we need to know the purpose for which the photos are being used. The law should only be for those who take the pictures with evil intentions in mind."<br><br>Another college student, who wanted to be known only as Jeremiah, 18, had the same views.<br><br>"It should be fine if I'm taking a picture of someone ill-treating a cat. But I wouldn't say the same for those taking pictures of others for viewing pleasure," he said.<br><br>Ivan Gn, 18, a second-year college student was more careful.<br><br>"I wouldn't want a blanket rule as then, there would be no freedom of expression.<br><br>"But if there is no law, then we'll have people abusing the situation," he said.<br><br>Lawyers said the photos may be taken "out of context" and posted on a site considered undesirable.<br><br>By association, this may become a nuisance to you - hence you may have a case.<br><br>Said Mr Ng: "If your photos are portrayed in any way that is offensive or indecent, you may sue on the grounds of outrage of modesty."<br><br>UPSKIRTING...<br><br>PEEPING under skirts is okay, ruled a US court recently.<br><br>The Washington State Supreme Court in Olympia set free Richard Sorrells last week.<br><br>He had been caught for "upskirting" - for filming up women's skirts at a street festival.<br><br>The court said that the state's voyeurism law does not apply as the women were taped in a public place, such as a park, where there's no reasonable expectation of privacy.<br><br>In Singapore, however, upskirting is an offence.<br><br>In May, Tan Chin Wee, 30, an engineer was jailed three weeks for using a video camera to film the underwear of women at Northpoint Shopping Centre.<br><br>WATCH WHAT YOU WEAR...<br><br>THE legal debate aside, there are some other issues for our young to consider.<br><br>It's obvious that girls these days don't dress the way their mothers did. That's something that comes as the society changes.<br><br>But some of the photos on the site clearly show that the girls have no qualms dressing in a sexy manner.<br><br>Do girls know what they are doing? Do they realise that they may be attracting unwanted attention?<br><br>What can then be done?<br><br>Girls The Y Scene spoke to felt that the key word is "responsibility".<br><br>They didn't approve of the suggestion of restricting what they could or could not wear.<br><br>Said college student Tan Lay Boon, 17: "I think we should have a right to dress whichever way we want to."<br><br>But she added that there are people out there with evil intent so precaution should be taken.<br><br>Added Lingehswari Eisvran, 17, also a college student: "We can have fun but there must be a limit.<br><br>We cannot be sending out the wrong signals."<br><br>Ivan Gn was more blunt.<br><br>"If they want to dress provocatively, then that's their own problem. They must be responsible for themselves."<br><br>Miss Cecilia Tan, 25, a civil servant, however, emphasised that there is a difference between one's dressing and behaviour.<br><br>"A girl may dress sexily but she may not behave so. It isn't fair to generalise," she said.<br><br>But Miss Tan said that she was concerned that young girls may not know what they get themselves into.<br><br>"A friend of theirs might tell them to pose for fun - who knows what the friend might do with those pictures?" she said.<br><br>Madam Lee Ling Li, 45, a mother of two girls, also said that girls should be responsible in their dressing.<br><br>By dressing revealingly, she said, there's no wonder that they'll attract attention.<br><br>Miss Angeline Tan, 25, a software development project manager, had an interesting view.<br><br>"Young girls are able to say that they should be able to dress in any way they want because we live in a safe country.<br><br>"If we were to live in a more dangerous city, I don't think they'll say the same thing," she said.<br></div>
