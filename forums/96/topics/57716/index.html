This is the latest updates from my friend.<br><br>He SMS to the gal saying he got good feeling about her etc..... and call her but she did not answer the call last week. Later that night, the gal SMS him asking him" Did u call me just now? I am busy with my work"!!!<br><br>The question is " How can she does not know it when her HP has a caller ID function? It seems she did it purposely(I mean SMS to my friend after my friend did comment that he had good opinion/feeling about her). Any explanation to this?<br><br>The 2 still keep in contact. The gal did mention that her best friend(also single) like bowling (my friend also like) and she would introduce her friend to him!!! When my friend mention OK, the gal KEEP QUIET!!!<br><br>When my friend mentioned that someone introduced another gal to him, this gal immediately ask:<br><br>1. Did U ask her out before?<br>2. Did the 2 still keep in contact?<br><br>When my friend mentioned: " U seem to be very concern about me and the gal"... She quickly defended herself<br><br>My friend seeks help from me and I also a bit blur about the situation now but I personally have a few questions<br><br>1. From what I describe above, CAN I SAY THE GAL IS ACTUALLY TESTING THE SINCERITY OF MY FRIEND AFTER MY FRIEND CONFESS HIS FEELING TO HER?<br><br>2. After my friend confessed to her, she still in contact with my friend, Can I say my friend "Still stand a chance"?<br><br>3. What is the position of my friend in this gal's heart?<br><br>All are welcome to express your view. Hope to hear from U guys/gals out there so that I can advice my friend.
