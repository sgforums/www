Later that night, the gal SMS him asking him" Did u call me just now? I am busy with my work"!!!<br><br>The question is " How can she does not know it when her HP has a caller ID function? It seems she did it purposely(I mean SMS to my friend after my friend did comment that he had good opinion/feeling about her). Any explanation to this?<br><br>The 2 still keep in contact. The gal did mention that her best friend(also single) like bowling (my friend also like) and she would introduce her friend to him!!!

Did the 2 still keep in contact?<br><br>When my friend mentioned: " U seem to be very concern about me and the gal"... She quickly defended herself<br><br>My friend seeks help from me and I also a bit blur about the situation now but I personally have a few questions<br><br>1. From what I describe above, CAN I SAY THE GAL IS ACTUALLY TESTING THE SINCERITY OF MY FRIEND AFTER MY FRIEND CONFESS HIS FEELING TO HER?<br><br>2. After my friend confessed to her, she still in contact with my friend, Can I say my friend "Still stand a chance"?<br><br>3.

Important or not - helpful, though it cannot win battle for you. Like all relationship courting mix - you have to combine every single tools for your advantage. This is the same for calling her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Game of love is a kind of seduction cum psychological game where both parties are employing different tactics, scheme to their own advantage.

Therefore she stall for clarity. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advice:</span></strong><br><br>He wants to chase, then just do it. Useless to play mind games, considering this intention, motive, situations and all-around factors affecting this case. He can date her out, act normal, forget about trying to see if she is jealous all that crap. Have a good dinner, humor conversation and probably a walk somewhere good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Then he can talk to her, heart to heart about certain issues regarding relationship, love, definition, feel, thinking, etc. Trust me, he will need to go through this at least once, before he will know if she is suitable for him anot. Find a good timing and allow this plan to execute. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She will question about those girls he knew - tell her he is not interested in them at all. All other question, just answer truthfully.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> From there, he will have a real good gauge about her.
