            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: orange;"><strong>How To Be A Better Couple</strong></span></span><br>10 steps to enjoying each other better...<br><br>1. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Be realistic about each other.</strong></span><br>Don't try to turn your partner into something he or she is not. Let's face it, guys - there's only 1 Pamela Anderson in the world, and even she has had her implants removed! Give your gal a break and understand that her physical appearance is NOT going to change overnite with the help of a few facials or treatments.<br>And ladies, Brad Pitt has already been taken, so you're gonna have to do with what your guy is like! Chill out, love each other for whom you are. There is more to your partner than what meets the eye.<br><br>2. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Always talk things out.</strong></span><br>Now guys, I know this is not your fave pastime or mode of resolving issues, but you know what? This works with the gals. Don't make assumptions about each other's feelings. Learn to express yourself better so that your partner understands what you're angry about, or hurt about, or even happy about! When you stop talking to each other from the heart, it's the beginning of the end.<br><br>3. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Do stuff together.</strong></span><br>Make an effort to do things together. Do some sports or involve yourselves in some shared activities; something both of you enjoy or are interested in. It could be as simple as watching movies together, or just strolling hand-in-hand down Orchard Road. Watch soccer with him once in a while though the green patch on TV puts you to sleep in 3 seconds. And guys, do give in if your gal asks for another day at window-shopping, rather than suggest that she go out with her girlfriends for "that sort of activities" instead. If you're spending more time with your friends rather than with your partner, it's a warning sign that you're drifting apart!!!<br><br>4. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Meet each other halfway.</strong></span><br>If he agrees to throw out that rotten T-shirt with the "The Rock" print, you shouldn't kick up much of a fuss if he asks you to keep your room tidy. There's gotta be a little giving and taking in a relationship, so learn to meet each other halfway.<br><br>5. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Show your love.</strong></span><br>Buy her flowers or candy or perfume every now and then, even if you have been together for 5 years. It's wonderful to continue showing someone that you care for him or her. Cook him a special meal, paint him a Valentine's Day card. Knit him mini-socks he can't wear ( like for decoration purposes ), buy him a packet of milk for breakfast, or pack his wardrobe for him...so he knows you can still be romantic and loving despite having been together for quite a while.<br><br>6. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Respect each other.</strong></span><br>Stop making jokes about her hair or skin, or whatever it is you love to laugh at. Ask yourself if she thinks if it's funny. And if he has an inferiority complex about his height, stop ogling at tall guys and make him feel worse! Love is about respecting each other's feelings and being sensitive to each other at all times.<br><br>7. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Bury the past.</strong></span><br>Stop bringing up the past. Gals...don't bring up the happy things about you and your ex to your guy, it would just make him jealous or unhappy. And guys, don't talk about the happy times that you had with your ex or mention about her in your every other sentence as it would make your gal feel unhappy and she might think that you are saying all this because you are gonna get back with your ex or not interested in her anymore.<br><br>8. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Sit on your jealousy.</strong></span><br>All of us go thru' spells of insecurity at the beginning of the relationship, but don't translate that insecurity into jealousy. If you're gonna go through your partner's mail and cupboard, and eavesdropping on conversations, you know something is wrong - with you!!! Jealousy is like a poison that slowly spreads thru' the relationship before finally killing it. Trust your partner; love has to have trust in it.<br><br>9. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Keep your commitments to each other.</strong></span><br>If your partner is standing you up all the time and cancelling dates and breaking promises, you need to talk! If you're in a relationship, make your partner your priority and don't disappoint them if you can help it. It's really terrible when someone promises to take you to dinner, and then calls to cancel it. Don't make promises you can't keep. If your partner starts to feel that he/she is not important enough to u, you may just lose him/her.<br><br>10. <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Be honest.</strong></span><br>Honesty is not scowling at how awful she looks first thing in the morning, or telling him that he has the biceps of a fly~! When we say "be honest", we mean expressing your feelings clearly, not being bitingly cruel. When you're hurt, say so, and when you're angry, tell him/her, without getting hysterical. If you can't be honest with your partner, who can you be honest with? Love is also about honesty, and a relationship where no honesty exists probably isn't worth it!</div>
