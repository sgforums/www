But I think that your friend is a walking time-bomb if she does not change. After 2 babies, 1 abortion, a few suicide attempts, beatings by bf, infidelity, countless rejections and manipulations, your friend still believes her bf loves her??? What I know is that pple who attempt suicide is at high risk to try repeatedly unless they change their thinking and behaviour. If she still continue to pin her hopes on the guy, her world will come crashing down again somedayÂ…..<br><br>She is stuck in the past, in denial mode, probably too young to handle love, not to mention motherhood. I take it that she is undergoing counseling??? If not, she must go until she shows some change in behaviour.<br><br>There are some things that her family and friends can do:<br>[b]1) Build new possibilities of her future</strong>.<br>By this I mean to talk to her, ask her to set some goals(from few weeks to few years) for herself and her son. Any goals (exclude the guy) like, teaching son to speak, learn new skills or hobbies, etc, will be fine as long as she can elaborate and imagine achieving them. This is vital bcos pple commit suicide when they see no pt in living. It also allows her to grasp her future for herself(w/o presence of guy).<br><br><strong>2) Emphasis the threat of guy to her future</strong><br>Guy is violence-prone, (got cases where wife-basher beat wife until teeth fall out, wife still in love with him) what if he beats her or her son???  He is a parasite, what if he threatens her for money in return for not harming son???Â…think of some moreÂ….<br><br>Note that <strong>[b]step 1 is MORE impt than step 2 </strong>and must be carried out first [/b](Focus on step 1, repeat over time if necessary), else your friend will be past-oriented and not future-oriented(she will only think of past happiness, not future happiness). Pls share this  information with her family and friendsÂ…can prevent mishap from happening.<br>[/b]</blockquote> is 1 baby &amp; 1 abortion. . .she knw her bf dun luv her anymore but then she still dun1 2 giv up it juz so foolish of her. . .<br>we hv try the 2 methods but she juz so stubborn so nw we juz leave everytin to her. . .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Throw a frog into a pot of boiling water and it jumps out immediately, put the frog in pot of water and slowly heat it, the frog will be cooked alive. Your friend is Â‘dying slowlyÂ’.  There are methods to make your friend experience PAIN from this relationship in one moment, so much that she will leave her bf immediately. Wicked but very effective, and healing always comes after. Too bad IÂ’ve decided never to meet anyone from here, cos I talked too much crap elsewhere.  Maybe this is retribution for her, cos karma works both waysÂ….
