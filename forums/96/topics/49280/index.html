            <div class='col-md body'>A priest took a vacation to a fishing lodge. On the last day of his<br>trip, he hooked a monster fish and began fighting it. A few minutes<br>later the guide, holding a landing net, yelled, "Look at the size of that sonofabitch!"<br><br>"Please, my son, I'm a priest. Your language is uncalled for", said the gravely embarrassed priest immediately.<br><br>"No, Father, you don't understand" explained the guide to cover up his spontaneous exclamation, "That's the species of fish you have on; it's called a 'Son of a Bitch' fish!"<br><br>"Really?" asked the surprised priest, "Well then, would you please net the Son of a Bitch for me" Once the fish was aboard, the guide<br>marvelled at its size."Father,that's the biggest Son of a Bitch I've ever seen!"<br><br>"It really IS a big Son of a Bitch" the priest beamed, "What should I do with it?"<br><br>"Why, eat it of course. I promise, you've never tasted anything as<br>good as one of these Sons of Bitches!"<br><br>Elated, the priest headed home. While unloading his fishing tackle and prize catch at the church's back door, Sister Mary appeared and enquired about the trip. "Take a look at this huge Son of a Bitch I caught!" the priest gushed, opening his ice chest.<br><br>Sister Mary gasped and clutched her rosary, "Father, such language from a priest!"<br><br>"It's Okay, Sister. According to my guide, that's the species of fish this one is: it's called a Son of a Bitch fish."<br><br>"Oh, well then...what are you going to do with that huge Son of a Bitch?"<br><br>"Eat it! My guide said they're great!", replied the priest.<br><br>Sister Mary then informed the priest that the Pope was scheduled to<br>visit in a few days. "Why don't I clean that Son of a Bitch for you, and we'll cook it for this special occasion", she volunteered.<br><br>On the night of the Pope's visit, everything went perfectly. The wine was fine, the fish excellent. The Pope leaned back from his plate and said, "This is absolutely marvellous fish, where did<br>you buy it?"<br><br>"We didn't buy it, Your Holiness; I caught that Son of a Bitch!" proclaimed the proud priest. The Pope's eyes opened<br>wide, but he said nothing.<br><br>"And I cleaned and cooked the Son of a Bitch!", exclaimed the Sister.<br><br>The Pope looked silently at each of them. Glancing around the dining room, he saw they were alone. A big grin spread across his face as he leaned across the table and whispered, "Go get us<br>some more wine.You motherfuckers are my kind of people!"<br><br></div>

She opened it and was as beautiful and charming as everyone had said.<br><br>"I'll be ready in a few minutes," she said. "Why don't you play with Spot, my dog, while you're waiting?" He does wonderful tricks. He rolls over, shakes hands, sits up and if you make a hoop with your arms, he'll jump through."<br><br>The dog followed John onto the balcony and started rolling over. John made a hoop with his arms and Spot jumped through--over the balcony railing.
