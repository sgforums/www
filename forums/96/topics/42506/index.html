Usually I'd start out by knowing the girl as a normal friend, observing the way she treats other people...the way she behaves. And of course, the chemistry should be present. And when I am sure she is the kind of girl I have in my mind, I would take action. First will drop hints, then see her response. If she is receptive, then I will start the entire courting routine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But then, like you said, maybe I have always been looking straight, so I may have kind of miss out on girls who are beside me all the time.

Afterall the world is huge... but that perfect partner might be 1 out of billion? I dunnoe...<br><br>To me, there isnt a perfect partner or a perfect match. I wish there is! But i shall dreamz onZzz..Zzzzz.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   However, i belive that 2 imperfect persons can work together to perfect their relationship.  Meaning that both party are willing to work to maintain and bring out the best in the relationship. If then, the relationship is near to perfection. (Bearing in mind, there's always up and down in a relationship, its never perfect and flawless)Thus to find a partner that share the same "vision" is good enough. Like u said we r living in an imperfect world...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like u said this world is no perfect so where to find ideal mate which is perfect in your eyes??? There's bound to be differences between pple, and it is how the couple resolves them looking for a both/and solution and not a either/or solution.

But how do we measure more ideal? Does that mean the current 1 isnt ideal? Or less ideal? Then why get in the relationship when he wasnt the more "ideal" one. Even when the more ideal (3rd party) is chosen, what if another more more ideal come by? There isnt a stop to idealism... once again, its searching for perfection.. There is always someone better. But of cos, its the gal choice to chose... bearing in mind..ideal now doesnt mean it be ideal in years to come...<br><br>So i guess, <span style="font-style: italic;">Go with the heart plus put the analytical skills to used..</span><br><br>I don't know am i making any sense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

Communication will allow for intimacy. As all human are different, there is bound to be conflicts in relationships, the important thing is how to sort out the differences in a constructive way through communication. As long as the both of them are willing to commit, communicate and resolve conflicts, they will become the perfect match after all these work, even more perfect than the more ideal partner.<br>If she just think that the other is more ideal and goes for him, i think that she will fail again as there seems to be the lack of commitment and communication.<br>So i think that the guy should have a good talk to the girl and see what she thinks.<br>Just my 1 cent worth...</div>
