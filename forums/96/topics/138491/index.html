Everything would be fine and dandy till one of you develops real feelings for each other. Love is a hard thing to keep under wraps. Then it becomes complicated.<br><br>Personal advice. Like I said, if the love has died and there isnt any children, go ahead. Better late than never.<br><br>For all you know, your wife may be thinking the same thing, or she may already be a step ahead of you. Go have a good talk if this affects you.<br><br>I have no idea what the AA forums are. I just joined last night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stick to her... Remember...whatever is happening now is going to happen again next time. You are bored by present one... will repeat again with ur next one.<br>There are 2 choices. First.... Stay and try to think how to have interesting time with her (maybe consider do things u havent done 2gether.. goin for trip, holiday, think about better, more fun sex together etc)... or second.. leave her now.. look for another one and will ended up feel the same thing like what u r thinking now (boring etc).. only that u get much less respect by all people around you. As a man, should be able to think for long term.</div>
