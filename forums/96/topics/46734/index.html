Without it, you cannot go anywhere. It is important, but still not THAT important without buddies and people close to you. When you need help, financially or emotionally , close buddies or relatives you have will support you (including family members). That's something money can't buy.<br><br>But if you were to talk about dating someone, or even stepping into relationship, one must be stable in his career. He doesn't have to be super filthy rich, or a billion-millionaire sort of person... We guys have to be stable in our job first, and other areas in ourselves (i.e. character, personality traits, good habits, healthy lifestyle... etc) All these play their part in making a guy attractive and approachable.<br><br>So what if a man is rich but he doesn't know how to win a girl's heart? He may have $$$ but in the end, if he is so full of himself, then I don't think there's any attractiveness in him. Yah lar... he may have the girl for a while, but only the BODY, may not be her HEART??? Thinkabout this lor... I hope I express it well...<br><br>To the guyz: If you are still not in the working force, don't try to get attached too much. You hurt yourself, you hurt the other party, and nobody's happy in the end... juz because of not having enough $$$ to support or please her (i.e. going on cheap dates by eating in McDonalds).<br><br>I've been through all these dating games... quite tired of it already. But still I want to share all these with you all as a forum friend.<br><br>Cheers,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>angel911, totally agree with you.<br><br>it's much better of course to have enough $$. i said "enough" , i didn't say  " a lot". sometimes even the most loving guy may end up one day taking his girl for granted 'cos he can just throw money here n there to try to make up for this and that.<br><br>the good news for us guys is that not all girls are that shallow. some actually couldn't care less for your money. i've heard stories about girls complaining that their guys give them money to spend but just have no time for them.<br><br>i won't totally discourage guys who aren't working yet to get into relationships. You will have to however, manage your money wisely and save when you can so you can take your girl on a nice date every now and then. If she understands your financial situation then it's ok. If she's not understanding then i guess she wasn't worth the time anyway ! right?<br><br>there are lots of fun things you can do on dates which don't require much money.. kayaking, jigsaws, picnics etc<br><br>you have to be creative. i once made out a room in my house to look exactly like some fancy romantic restaurant and cooked up something for this girl that i liked. she was really impressed and it was really cheap. everything i used was found lying around in my house.<br><br>i could go on and on but i hope i put my point across. oh yah and as a reply to the first thread, on the poor suitor with no money? well u don't always have to go over to comfort the girl. talk things out over the phone, on the net.. meet her up the next morning for breakfast. the rich guy may be over there with her but if u've got her attention on the phone, he can only sit beside her and wonder why he wasted his money on the cab fare over ! =)</div>
