            <div class='col-md body'>I think first impressions do count, whether you like it or not. And even though a lot of people say "Don't judge a book by its cover", I think looks play a major role in first impressions. It all comes together with the way you carry yourself, the way you dress and the way you talk. Like they say, you only get one chance to make a first impression.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Tough luck, especially when you're going for job interviews!!<br><br>A lot of people say that when they first meet me, they get the impression that I'm kinda like a b|tch cos I talk too much and I'm really loud lol.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  But once they get to know me, they'll realise that I'm just really outgoing and simply CRAZY haha.. cos I'm the kind of person that can talk to ANYONE lol. Plus I have a weird sense of humour so some are not used to it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like what many of you have said, first impressions are inevitable, but it is also important to portray your real self. many make the mistake of trying to be someone they're not, so as to be accepted, or so that they can give the "right" impression to others. but i think, in the end, this fallacy will just fall through, so if you can help it, just be yourself. and if people don't like you, then that's really just too bad, cos i'm sure everyone has something beautiful in them, as cliched as that may sound.</div>
