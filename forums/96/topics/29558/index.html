            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br><br>Recently,a close female friend of me commented that I am a good listener but I do not talk too much about myself.I know I am a good active and passive listener.I maintain eye contact throughout and pay very close attention to a gal when she speaks to me(even if Celest Chong walks past,I'll not notice) I do not just nod my head and mutter affirmatives either.I always try to give a response to what she said.Oh yes,I make extensive use of the "empathy" or "paraphrasing" tactic also.It has been proven to be very effective so far.<br><br>My belief is that the gal should always be the focus of attention and thus the conversation should centre around the gal unless she asks the guy questions about his affairs.Only then should the guy answer,but he should use his answer to ask for comments from the gal( focusing on the gal again)<br><br>Any comments on this approach?<br><br>I think I may need to make some changes to this approach.</div>
