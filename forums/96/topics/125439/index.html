            <div class='col-md body'>Muhahahah. ok then. i'll start first. happy?  and this story is not crap. it's real ok?<br><br>I used to as a temporary staff at the national cancer center. Work there wasn't easy. You were faced with the prospect of people dying everyday. You could be having a chat with a 12-year-old girl suffering from lung cancer and realise the next day, she was gone forever. Try as i might, i couldn't get used to the fact that i worked at such close proximity with death. I guess i might have been over emotional, but the pain of seeing death staring straight at me through the patients' eyes haunted me. It's not that patients can't heal, but still....<br>I was working with my favourite doctor. He would always put in his best effort for the patients. He didn't care if he was hungry or tired. If there was a patient, he could help, he would. Even if he/she was obviously for another doctor.<br>Then walked in a man accompanied by his wife. He looked perfectly fine. But the wife was doing her best not to cry. The man had cancer of the brain, or somewhere along the lines (I canÂ’t really remember). The cancer was slowing eating into his brain and he was losing his functions. I watched on as the doctor did the brain tests. My heart sank when he failed the tests one by one. But when he was asked what was two times two, heÂ’s face lighted up, confidently yelled: "i know! i know! it's six!" He looked triumphantly at the doctor and turned to flash a smile at his wife. He saw her face, screwed up, trying so hard not to cry, and he realised that .... The doctor did other tests on him, but he was so shaken that he didn't care anymore. I don't know whether he could or didn't want to identify the cat, but he refused to co-operate. He either shook his head distractedly or kept mumbling... "i don't wanna die". I was trying so hard not to cry. The doctor came to the last test. He handed the man a slip of paper:" Write anything you want." With a shaking hand, the patient grasped the paper and pen. He seized the pen until his knuckles turned white. At last, after staring at the blank paper, he scribbled on it. With all the anger, frustration in him, he threw it on the floor. Lightly and unperturbed, it floated and landed on the doctorÂ’s feet. He picked it up. From the illegible scrawl, I could barely make out the words: " I want to be happy."<br>The doctor handed it back saying with a smile " DonÂ’t we all?"<br>" Yeah. But you still have time to see the blue sky, to smile, to laugh, to enjoy life! You still have time to love and to be loved. I donÂ’t."<br>He started crying and trembling. Keeping the professional composure, we tried to comfort him. Suddenly, he stopped crying. He reached into the plastic bag that he was carrying and pulled out a pretty box of decorated with seashells. And he gave me a rose.<br>"There, thatÂ’s the souvenirs I bought when I went to Malaysia. IÂ’m not going for anymore treatment. IÂ’ve spent all my money on my first and last trip overseas. IÂ’m going to die. I donÂ’t need momentos. IÂ’m happy. And I want to make you happy too."<br>We were too stunned to speak. He and his wife got up and shook our hands, gripping tightly and left. Then my self-resolve crumbled and the doctor and I cried openly.<br>I never saw him again. I wished I had said more to him. But I never forgot him. Whenever it seems that IÂ’m against the world, I look at the pressed flower in my wallet and am grateful for the chances I had to be happy.<br><br>there. this is one of my stories.</div>
