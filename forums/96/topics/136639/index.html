            <div class='col-md body'>I think we are starting to become so predictable and stone-aged.<br><br>Our mind don't grow anymore.<br><br>Once we see some gals kissing, EEEEEKKKKKkk we go,<br>like we never seen anything before in life, are we so shallow?<br>We are trying to be so self-righteous that we want to direct<br>how youngsters think, learn and play like movie show directors like that.<br><br>We always try to lock up our minds, mindsets and etc to tell ourselves not to do this not to do that, blab blab blab but at the end of the day,<br><br>we never wonder why pple out there are doing all sorts of things to actually get attention, play unique, "improve" their culture daily, at least "SELL" their culture, make some form of value out of it. Like why you watch Star Wars - some green old wrinkled thing waving a laser tube around, or<br>Harry Potter - some kid wearing robes flying on a broom,<br><br>why we SELF-IMPRISON our minds?<br><br>When we imprison ourselves, does anybody come around to reward us?<br>No.<br><br>Gals go hanky panky, go ahead lah, maybe make a movie, drama, shortfilm out of it, like the US's L Word, don't they make it fancyful, attractive?<br><br>The guys go grumpy over it, wat self-reflection blab blab crap!!! Don't grumble, there are still many hetero females around!!!<br>Can afford to have many gfs? GO AHEAD LAH, nobody blocking you!!!<br><br>Don't just flock to Geylang, the pubs / karaokes, whatever sizzy places you can think of, all you have is lots of foreign chicks and STD carriers then, what does that bring you? THINK!!!! At end of the day, Nothing wat. Even prostitution is considered outdated. You think if some damn act-cute revealing star got on movies bare-all, boxoffice sure hit ah? NO LAH, everywhere almost the same lah, Geylang also have, some got more $ will consider Batam, Thai, Viet, lots of places to go lah. Nothing NEW already.<br><br>Pple only rewards<br>an interesting "VALUABLE" culturally-rich and exciting society,<br>not a socially tied-up culturally repeating "like some old lecture chanted over and over again" grumpy society.<br><br>Why reality shows used to be popular? After so many rounds of survivor, AI,<br>blab blab blab, pple have already gotten tired of reality shows as well. yet we are still trying to backdate ourselves into believing that tied-up rules will still bind the pple and believe that some long-time exposed and over-exploited truths / uglies in the society DO NOT EXIST. But the truth is even reality shows are not selling so well nowadays, that's why we hear "YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE BEST OF OUR ** SHOW YET" from some dun-know-wat showhost.<br><br>Why not at this age of emergence of new concepts after year 2000,<br>make a change of things huh? Do something unexpected, fresh when expected stuff does not SELL well anymore?<br><br>Pls, as citizens of our own society, pls let our society update itself with its own competitive edge, truths and feelings to determine the exact measures of "VALUE" alongside with the world and not imprison ourselves in our minds.<br><br>I am not trying to upset the ethic balance here, I am saying we can still "ethnically" accept the truth of changes within our society without upsetting the balance.<br><br>Why not we practice try not to preach and publicly condemn the acts of others, and try to practice the best art of sticking to monitor actions of our very own only? That way not only we can lessen the risk of us being more ethnically degrading and detrimental to ourselves and devalued. That way we can also try to nurture some kind of value that pple around the world will see in us other than plain cikobeks, condemners, grumblers, see?<br><br>This is my personal point of view,<br>I hope pple who will take heed, pls take heed,<br>pple who will not, pls take no offence.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>
