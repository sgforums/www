And as a biker, you racetrack forum is whom you are a mod at is really notorious. <strong>&lt;--- hmmm not bad got some feedback ... </strong><br><br>that's why most people prefer more professional and comfortable environment to chat somewhere else nowadays.. <strong>&lt;--- Get the facts before you say this </strong><br><br>all your lackeys there.. and yah, whatever i said.. u dun give a damn, u can just dun reply lo. hehe, just voicing my opinion only. seriously just think its rather contradicting how you dun allow profound vulgarities and colourful language, yet u yourself is letting your uncouthness show through here.. <strong>&lt;-- My lackeys ??? i dun remember i have any ... what for i care for other forums where the mod here is so F**K up ??? and i'm also a typical singaporean hmmzzz if i dun remember wrongly ... i do remind my forumnites about vulgarities ... <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=35619" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=35619</a> ... if you think one thread is not enough ... then i also cant do anything  </strong><br><br>even you locked people's thread and ban people too. so what make you so difference from him? <strong>hmmzzz what make you think that as a mod i can ban ppls ??? Do try open a forum and be a mod and you will know... </strong><br><br>Even those close to you and used to join your forum outings have the same comments about u.<br><br>you are just saying all the things you do it yourself. i am not siding him, but just find that u are such a joke. <strong>Thanks again for the reminder ...ya i'm a joke but at least i'm not like someone ... who will only hide away from clearing up messes  </strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>but it really goes to show what kind of person you are. &lt;--<strong> ya that me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  and that will be me forever </strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>yup, real life relationship. i think you are famous to be a mess in that, so it's understood that you ought to focus more on that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and oh yeah, people know  you in person know full well of that. &lt;---<strong>as i said that just me ... there will alway be ppls who are unhappy of what i've done ... i'm not to the extend of a perfect guy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ... and also i believe that there are ppls who agree who me too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong><br><br>and if people are regulars from racetrack, you will realise, you also take cyber stuffs a wee bit too seriously.  &lt;---<strong> you are right ... i ought to be much more serious in Racetrack as i'm given the post of being a mod there ... </strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>so what i say is, don't slap yourself in the face by doing all these foolish things here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> &lt;--<strong> That's what you think  ??? maybe that truth who tell my mum to born me in this character that i would not hide away from problems still you have the freedom to think whatever you think is right ... Cheers </strong><br><br>not that i am siding Angel here or what, but just something i observe from the time in racetrack and till now. I am not a regular chatter here, and not intending to get involve either. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> &lt;--- <strong>Just be more regular and you will know more </strong><br><br>freedom of speech. u wan that here? but there isn't any over the other forum, so what's the big deal? at least people are gracious enough to make it open here.. and not like you, closing and locking at the slightest threat at you even though people are stating the truth about you...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  &lt;---<strong> O really  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  ... i dun really recall anyone stating any feedback bout me but if i do really lock or close thread that is directed towards me just because i'm a mod over at RACETRACK  ... i'm so sorry ... do paste me the link pls...   </strong><br><br>look at all those behaviour and language, and people can make a decision and judgement for themselves. Even if he is the bad guy in this case, you gave him a very good cover-up by all those immature things u said/did. Come on, be a sport, and people will stand by you naturally. <strong> as i said in the a/m ... there will alway be ppls who are unhappy of what i've done ... so that isnt my problem  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </strong><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Last but not the least ... i do think this is getting way out of topic ... and also i'll be waiting for his reply ...<br><br></div>
