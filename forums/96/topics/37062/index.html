In fact, all that lounging in the sun may lead to premature aging, wrinkles and skin cancer. There is no such thing as a healthy tan from natural sunlight. Complete sun avoidance, however, is impractical, and in sunny ol' Singapore, just plain silly. It is not feasible to speak strictly of "safe sun-tanning", but, rather in the analogy of "safer sex", "safer sun-tanning". This means choosing circumstances, which minimizes the risks of tanning, while at the same time enjoying outdoor social activity, sports and (more importantly) looking good in that tight white tee.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I could bore you with the details here but let's just skip the rest and get down to the important ones we need to know for tanning purposes. And for that we need to understand the properties of ultraviolet light to make intelligent choices for our basking pleasures.<br><br>Ultraviolet light has clearly deleterious effects on the skin, causing premature aging, wrinkles and skin cancer. When we tan in response to ultraviolet (UV) light, our skin is merely trying to protect itself (and us) from this unwanted assault. This is why, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a "good" tan or a "healthy" tan.<br><br>There are two main types of ultraviolet (UV) light: ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB). (Ultraviolet C is filtered by the ozone layer.) UVA rays burn the skin less, but penetrate more deeply and are much more abundant overall in the output of normal sunlight. UVB is much more destructive to the skin, but less abundant.<br><br>The time of day also influences the relative proportions of UVA and UVB. UV light is relatively dependent on the angle of the sun's rays, which are much less prevalent in the morning and late afternoon, and are concentrated in the "11am to 3pm" period of the midday -- which not coincidentally is often the hottest time of day. Ultraviolet light stimulates the skin to produce more melanin, which makes the skin look tan. In reality, the skin is trying to protect itself from the real business of ultraviolet light, that is, DNA damage and breakdown of collagen and elastin in the skin. Though a tan looks pleasing (even sexy), it is really a "callous" that the skin makes to try to prevent injury to itself.<br><br>But worry not, because in the end we have the advantage when it comes to the sun for the darker you are the higher resistance you possess to protect your skin. And Asian skin seems to be well equipped to handle the sun better than our fairer-skinned cousins on the other side of the world.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Let's get on with some helpful, concrete suggestions for enjoying the sun and the outdoors.<br><br>Don't forget your sunscreen. In the warm months, especially on leisure days, put sunscreen on first thing in the morning as part of your routine before you go outside, even before you have a cup of coffee on your terrace in the morning.<br>Use waterproof sunscreen if you plan to be physically active. Re-apply often, even if the sunscreen is waterproof. Use at least SPF 15 with UVA protection, but the closer you get to SPF 30, the better.<br>Stay in the shade when you can. Choose the shady tennis court, not the sunny one. Get a beach umbrella and a pair of sunglasses -- squinting will wrinkle your eyes. Wear a hat. Walk on the shady side of the street if possible. Sit in the shade when you eat lunch. You will get plenty of reflected light, don't worry (imagine opening a roll of film in the shade, thinking that since you're not in the sun the film won't be exposed). As much ultraviolet light is reflected as visible light. Sometimes, reflection intensifies light exposure, such as on ski slopes or near the water.<br>Stay out of the sun between 11am and 3pm. It's too hot then, anyway.<br>Use self-tanning creams to get that "healthy glow". If you want a "healthy glow", try self-tanners. The technology has improved considerably over the last 20 years, and an orange stain is no longer the industry standard.<br>Get an annual skin examination from a dermatologist. If you are like most people, you have already had sufficient sun to cause skin cancer. The only way to keep dangerous skin cancers like melanomas from being fatal is to catch them early, before they bleed or become raised. This is the single most important recommendation. All the sunscreen in the world without an annual (more often if something suspicious arises) skin exam (head-to-toe) is inadequate.<br>It is a myth that people with dark skin cannot get skin cancer. The chances are less, but checking your skin regularly, especially your hands and feet, is important.<br>If you get a sunburn<br><br>Don't panic, first of all. Drink plenty of fluids and take an anti-inflammatory (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxin, all available over the counter). If your skin is blistered, see a dermatologist as soon as possible. Moisturize your skin. Learn the lesson.<br><br>Better Take Care Of Your Skin &amp; "Tomatos"...heehee!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
