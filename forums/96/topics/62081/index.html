If a gal is interested in a guy initially BUT the guy DID NOT express interest/confide to her and after sometime the gal will a bit like disappointed and decided to leave but when the guy confides to her at a later stage --- Is it TRUE that the gal must again " find back" her feeling again (will not accept the guy that easily) before accepting the guy again??<br><br>2. If a gal told the guy that HE must ALWAYS remember her but claim that he is just a friend of her. Does it mean anything? Is the gal hiding her true feeling from the guy?<br><br>I feel that if both are really just friend, it is unlikely that the gal will keep mentioning/expect the guy to remember her(what so special by the way?)

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, this gal is hurt before and she don't trust guy that easily. Maybe she is testing the guy to see how sincere he is before she commits eventually BUT all this takes TIME.<br><br>As for whether her action is child play or not (she is in her early 30s), I am not sure but one thing I am sure is that whenever the guy mentioned about leaving Singapore to further studies, she will advise NOT TO GO!!!!!!<br><br>There seems to be a dilemma with her thoughts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems to me that you enjoy guessing game, if you dare not to ask direct to the girl then just enjoy. Your question has no fix answer, everybody tells you how they react doesn't mean how she react.<br><br>Is a girl simply tells you "please don't go" can make you guys think so much" even she is your gf, you have hard time finding every words she mean. She will never tell you the truth.<br><br>my 2 cents worth :<br>1) Just tell her you like her, if yes go on else remain as friend and forget about after her.<br>2) If she likes you she will sense that you are after her (from what you have worte) she is playing hard to get instead, is an excuse for saying "bad experiance" from the pass (provided she was rape). Else even you become her bf can you stand her for giving you this excuse forever on everthing she refuse?<br>3) Help her to walk out from the bad experiance (if you think she is still suffering) not give in to her.<br>4) If a girl tell you "don't go" and you can think so much why don't you ask her "who is she" tell her " if you are my someone I won't go" if she refuse you just go ahead with your study...<br><br>I think if a girl that stop me from anything that is good for my future she is not a good gf or wife.<br><br>If a relationship can make you think so much, she is not the right one.You want your whole life guessing?<br>She is yours is your, this is not chasing is torturing.<br><br>Told you in your other post "play hard to get", go check yourself 1 or 2 months ago, till now still the same.<br><br>Hope you understand what I mean.<br>no offence<br>good luck.<br></div>
