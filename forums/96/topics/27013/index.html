            <div class='col-md body'>this is a very warm story...i loved it......cried while i was reading..hope it touches ur heart to....<br><br>Her Name Was Mrs. Thompson<br><br>As she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of<br>school, she told the children a lie. Like most teachers, she looked at her<br>students and said that she loved them all the same. But that was impossible,<br>because there in the front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named<br>Teddy Stoddard.<br><br>Mrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he didn't<br>play well with the other children, that his clothes were messy and that he<br>constantly needed a bath. And Teddy could be unpleasant. It got to the point<br>where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight in marking his papers with a<br>broad red pen, making bold X's and then putting a big "F" at the top of his<br>papers.<br><br>At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review each<br>child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last. However, when she<br>reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise.<br><br>Teddy's first grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is a bright child with a ready<br>laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners...he is a joy to be<br>around."<br><br>His second grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is an excellent student, well liked<br>by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal<br>illness and life at home must be a struggle."<br><br>His third grade teacher wrote, "His mother's death had been hard on him.<br><br>He tries to do his best, but his father doesn't show much interest and his<br>home life will soon affect him if some steps aren't taken."<br><br>Teddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is withdrawn and doesn't show<br>much interest in school. He doesn't have many friends and he sometimes<br>sleeps in class".<br><br>By now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself.<br>She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents,<br>wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for Teddy's. His<br>present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper<br>that he got from a grocery bag. Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the<br>middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to laugh when she<br>found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing, and a bottle<br>that was one quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children's<br>laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was, putting it on, and<br>dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist.<br><br>Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say,"Mrs.<br>Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to." After the children<br>left she cried for at least an hour. On that very day, she quit teaching<br>reading, and writing, and arithmetic. Instead, she began to teach<br>children.<br><br>Mrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. As she worked with him,<br>his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he<br>responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest<br>children in the class and, despite her lie that she would love all the<br>children the same, Teddy became one of her "teacher's pets."<br><br>A year later, she found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling her that<br>she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life.<br><br>Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then wrote that<br>he had finished high school, third in his class, and she was still the best<br>teacher he ever had in his whole life.<br><br>Four years after that, she got another letter, saying that while things had<br>been tough at times, he'd stayed in school, had stuck with it, and would<br>soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. He assured Mrs.<br>Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his<br>whole life.<br><br>Then four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he<br>explained that after he got his bachelor's degree, he decided to go a little<br>further. The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite<br>teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little longer -- the letter was<br>signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD.<br><br>The story doesn't end there. You see, there was yet another letter that<br>spring. Teddy said he'd met this girl and was going to be married. He<br>explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was<br>wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding<br>that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom. Of course, Mrs.<br>Thompson did.<br><br>And guess what? She wore that bracelet, the one with several rhinestones<br>missing. And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered<br>his mother wearing on their last Christmas together.<br><br>They hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs.Thompson's ear,<br>"Thank you Mrs. Thompson for believing in me. Thank you so much for making<br>me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference."<br><br>Mrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back. She said, "Teddy, you<br>have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could make a<br>difference. I didn't know how to teach until I met you."<br>Please remember that wherever you go, and whatever you do, you will have the<br>opportunity to touch and/or change a person's outlook. Please try to do it<br>in a positive way.<br><br>"Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings stop remembering<br>how to fly."<br></div>
