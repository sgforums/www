            <div class='col-md body'>I'm creating this post because I found that people around us might not know this matter. So I'm here sharing with you all. This is my incident, although it doesn't happen on me but it happen to my relative.<br><br>My relative bought a house at Bukit Timah area half year back (around Dec - Jan) and the building was a new block and 4 rooms I think... And of course, lots of things have to be done to a new flat and so, she went around Showroom and found this really cute Kitchen Design/Layout and she decided to get this particular contractor who designed the ShowRoom's kitchen to renovate her house @ <a href="http://www.hbay.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">Hbay</a> for a price (it aren't cheap). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Her husband and her thought that Hbay was a professional recommend contractor company and they should have no worries about that. So the renovation started after week of discussion and choosing design for their kitchen as well as some cupboards. The contractors is mainly focus on Kitchen Designing.<br><br>This relative of mine went to their main factory or company they call it at Toa Payoh and the contractor seems real friendly and even promised alot of things to my relative. They choosed the designs and all the stuffs needed after sometime. The contractors drew out a concept of the Kitchen's Layout and offers lots of goodies to them at a affordable price. My relative and her husband was so GLAD to see all this happening. But good thing doesn't last long...<br><br>After they both sides agreed on everything and work have to be done, the contractors build in things that he didn't mention in the concept or discussion and he gave lots of reason/excuses to my relative for the action and stuffs he did. Not only once, but numbers of time. My relative have decide to order those kitchen drawer (or whatever you all call it) with glasses in the displayed which need have 1 layer of plastic stick to them (for what purpose, I'm not really sure with this area). More and more shock things happened after the BIG cleanup in her house. While she was wiping those glasses, she noticed lots of scratches on the mirror, not only that, she noticed lots of "bubbles" on her glass and so, she requested to have a brand new piece. Things didn't get well. Second pieces of glass was installed and to her terror, she found more scratches and "bubbles"! How could that be? Well, again, she requested for a change. The contractor looks and sound very annoyed but you couldn't blame my relative, she paid for it and wanted a NEW and NICE looking glass instead of all this rubbish. The contractor changed and it was the 3rd attempt, my relative saw numbers of bubbles but she was too tired to request a change again. She give up. This is only a small case in this matter and there's numbers of it I didn't mentioned.<br><br>This is the informations I got from her regarding the contractor,<br>Name: Alick Yew (He was said to be well known for his designing)</div>
