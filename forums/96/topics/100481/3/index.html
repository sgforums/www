            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I haven't had much contact with Singapore or Singaporeans for many years. I initially came here to the US for my tertiary education and  have stayed on because of work. Its been so long and I am very excited to have found this forum. I sorely missed the sarcastic style and Singaporean brand of humor that is so prevalent in these forums. I have devour most topics here with interest and decide to input in my two cents here on this subject. I have dated a few oriental girls during my college years and here is my take on them based on nationality.<br><br>Japanese Girls, I have dated quite a few of and I don't really think they prefer their own. In fact, I think they are the most open about dating other nationalities and even race; they do seem more submissive than their Asian counter parts. For some reason, I would have the shortest relationships with them.<br><br>Taiwanese girls, I only had one girlfriend who was Taiwanese, talks very loud but I love the accent.<br><br>Korean girls, I only dated two Korean girls and hang out with a few Korean friends, they seem the most mysterious of all the Asian groups. It seems they are more conservative and it would take a long time to open them up unless if they were born here. But if you have them as a girlfriend, they do pamper you like hell, one would feel like a big baby under their care; but watch out, do not look at other girls, think of looking at other girls, or leave them for someone else because when they get angry, they get angry. A friend of mine broke up with a Korean girl for another one and she totally destroy his car. I was once throw out of a building because my Korean ex call security and told them I was loitering around her apartment when in fact she knew that I was just there visiting another friend of mine who happens to be in the same building.<br><br>HK girls, the most aggressive of all, based on the friends I knew. The ones I dated were pretty Americanize so I am not sure whether they are aggressive because they were Americanize but the other HK girls I know are pretty aggressive so there must be some truth to that.<br><br>Caucasian girls, I have several Â‘angmoÂ’ friends, not as close as the Asian ones, and I dated one of them, I am normally more attracted to oriental girls but this girl had a porcelain face and petite figure, which was pretty Asian to me, and she actually turned out to be most fun.<br><br>Singapore girls, I havenÂ’t really dated any Singapore girls since leaving Singapore but I sure do miss them.<br><br>I have friends from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, but haven't dated any of them so I don't know much in terms of them as girlfriends.<br><br>I donÂ’t date as much now because of work.<br><br>Anyway, this forum is a great find for me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Donald Trump, u want to do some joint-ventures with me? I have lots of business ideas. We sure make money.<br><br>Singaporean girls....from my experience, compared with other girls, are busier, more career-oriented, and more materialistic. Most of them are well-educated too.<br><br>In terms of looks, I think u can find pretty girls in all races. But the prettiness is different and unique in each race. If u compare with Western girls, the Westerners are taller, whiter, and have sharper facial features. Not to mention their hair colour and eye colour are so diverse. Asians only have black hair and black eyes.<br><br>By the way, Asians in my opinion shouldn't dye their hair. The jet-black silky shiny hair can be so sexy and appealing. If u dye, somehow the silkiness is gone. Not shiny anymore. And it makes the person look Ah Lian. Low class, you know?<br><br>Anyways, as I said, u can find pretty girls in any race. And their prettiness is different and unique in each race.<br><br>For me, I like the facial features of the girls from Latin Americas, Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean/ North Indian regions, the skin colour of Northern Chinese, and Westerners, the body of Asians, the hair and eyes of Westerners, and the personality of villagers/ small town residents (friendly and not materialistic).<br><br>I also find girls of mixed race are prettier. I think it's because they combine the best from their parents. And they look...so...unique. Like u see Prada and Gucci bags, then u see a mix of "PraGucci" bag. It's so unique and rare and special.</div>
