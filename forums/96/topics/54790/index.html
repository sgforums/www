            <div class='col-md body'>are u an idiot?<br><br>no?<br><br>try this..<br><br>1. What do you put in a toaster?<br><br>The answer is bread. If you said "toast", then give up now and go do something else. Try not to hurt yourself. If you said, "bread", go to question 2.<br><br>2. Say "silk" five times. Now spell "silk". What do cows drink?<br><br>Answer: Cows drink water. If you said "milk", please do not attempt the next question. Your brain is obviously overstressed and may even overheat. It may be that you need to content yourself with reading something more appropriate such as "Children's World". If you said, "water" then proceed to question three.<br><br>3. If a red house is made from red bricks and a blue house is made from blue bricks and a pink house is made from pink bricks and a black house is made from black bricks, what is a greenhouse made from?<br><br>Answer: Greenhouses are made from glass. If you said "green bricks", what the heck are you still doing here reading these questions????? If you said "glass", then go on to question four.<br><br>4. Twenty years ago, a plane is ; flying at 20,000 feet over Germany. If you will recall, Germany at the time was politically divided into West Germany and East Germany. Anyway, during the flight, TWO of the engines fail. The pilot, realizing that the last remaining engine is also failing, decides on a crash landing procedure. Unfortunately the engine fails before he has time and the plane crashes smack in the middle of "no man's land" between East Germany and West Germany. Where would you bury the survivors - East Germany or West Germany or in "no man's land"?<br><br>Answer: You don't, of course, bury survivors. If you said ANYTHING else, you are a real idiot and you must NEVER try to rescue anyone from a plane crash. Your efforts would not be appreciated. ...... If you said, "Don't bury the survivors" then proceed to the next question.<br><br>5. If the hour hand on a clock moves 1/60th of a degree every minute then how many degrees will the hour hand move in one hour?<br><br>Answer: One degree. If you said "360 degrees" or anything other than "one degree", you are to be congratulated on getting this far, but you are obviously out of your league. Turn your pencil in and exit the room. Everyone else proceed to the final question.<br><br>6. Without using a calculator - You are driving a bus from London to Milford Haven in Wales. In London, 17 people get on the bus. In Reading, six people get off the bus and nine people get on. In Swindon, two people get off and four get on. In Cardiff, 11 people get off and 16 people get on. In Swansea, three people get off and five people get on. In Carmathen, six people get off and three get on. You then arrive at Milford Haven. What was the name of the bus driver?<br><br>Answer: Oh, for heaven sake! It was YOU, you dummy. Read the first line!!!</div>
