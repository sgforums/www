She was the one who chase me first. At that time i was telling myself, wah! a pretty girl come and chase me. why should i reject her...  but then while i was dating her, i had quite a few flings here and there. i think she knows about it, but she was just keeping quiet. There was one time when we quarelled and i didn't picked up her call and i even went as far as bringing another girl home from pub. in fact two different gals on two different occasions. God! i realise how bad i was last time... On one of the occasion when i brought another girl home, the girl was sleeping beside me on my bed when my phone ranged! 7am on christmas day..  it was my GF, she said: dear... open the door.. i'm outside... i brought breakfast........ S_h_i.t man.... that is gonna be very exciting.... I locked up my room door and took breakfast with her in the living room. the other gal was sleeping inside... ohhhh!!! my heart went BANG &amp; BANG &amp; BANG... it nearly explode.. i was really afraid that the girl would wake up.... den my GF wanna go into my room. i said i lost my keys..... i slept in the living room yesterday nite and the locksmith will be coming later on... This reason doesn't makes sense at all. she start to get suspecting..... she asked, dear dear..... where did you went yesterday nite?... ....erm..... dinner loh... with few friends den KTV.... den i can stand it anymore... this is really too exciting for my heart to take... i send my GF home first den tell her to bath and dress up first den we go shopping even though she bath already... i insisted... haa~ (shopping really excites her... dunno why...) den i came back home and chase this girl out of my house.... ok  first part of the story finished.......<br><br>after nearly 6months with her.... she was a realy sweet girl... very pretty and very understanding too... hard to find such girls.. I found my conscience.... i got obsessed with her... I got no more interest in any other girls anymore... she become my prettiest girl in the whole world..... for whatever that she did for me... my emotions was really moved....  apart from all that.... my parents liked her... and her parents was really friendly to me too.... and her sisters too.... Everyone was saying we were so compatible......   Oh god............ It was the first time i got so serious with a relationship in the whole lot of my life.....<br><br>After 2 years,  pictures of those sweet moments starts to turn blur.... I dunno why.... she doesn't need money... and give me a stupid reason that her old ah lian friends that were hostesses at a nite club ask her to help out as a waitress.... i really oppose this idea..... and she claim that she wants to work there not only because of her... what i called... ah lian friends... also because she was a shy girl and wants to see more of this world... oh god.... want to see i bring you see lah... what is going to happen when her and my family and my friend and my clients and my colleague know that my GF is working in a niteclub..... wat the f.u.ck...... i really don't wan her to work there.... but.... i loved her... i let her do watever she liked if shes happy..... One nite, i went to pick her up from after work... her b_i_tc_hy friends wanna hitched a ride on my car....  f.u.ck... one vomitted..... nvm... i kept quiet ... my GF keep apologising to me afterwards... but i still keep quiet.... i jus clitched my fist and drive on..... i really don't like those vulgar and those loud voices at the back..... f.u.ck......<br><br>she knows that i don't like.... but she still wants to work there..... this is the only thing that she let me down..... One fine afternoon.... she called me..... and said... i got raped,,,,, she was in hotel 81 and she accompanied her friend there to smack.... den... got raped.... so stupid...... she changed...... haiz.....  i knows that she was sad.... and went to the hotel to pick her home... i console her... try talk to her as a goodfriend ... not a BF.... she Hugged me.... and my heart became soft again..... after a few days... she left me... dunno why..... and we nv stay in contact again..... i tried to call her b4,  but her number changed... but her sister sometimes do send me some letters... but she nv mention her in the letter.... her sis was just talkin to me as a friend.. and i nv ask her sis abt her too...<br><br>I send her a birthday card this year, as i did it every of her birthday... One day... i received an SMS on my hp... it was her... she thanked me... and said she missed me... i missed her very much too.. we talked for few hours on the phone... til dawn.... abt those sweet days we had together... it was so sweet,,,,,,,, i missed her voice so much......<br><br>I was thinking what to do now........ i was afraid of being hurt again.... i was afraid of meeting her.... i missed her.... but is she still the same person that i loved? haiz... dunno what to do.... she say she was waitng for me...... wait for one yr den can receive my card.... how? anyone??? any ideas???</div></blockquote> u reli a jerk... tamade... reli throw guys face...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Vodka Ice,<br><br>Lucky thing I press top 50 Topics before I wanted to leave and saw this post. *Pai seh normally only look around in Aunt Agony*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>This is a story - a story of possible loving couple turning into a pile of ashes because of each other's action and inadequate decisions making and the 'wrong-kind' of empathy - giving and receiving.<br><br><strong>...wah! a pretty girl come and chase me. why should i reject her?</strong> - I always believe what comes around goes around. Such inmature thinking would eventually be the downfall of you. Psychological explaination, I won't nag further.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Flinging while dating her, bring woman home to sleep - again shows how shallow your attitute towards relationship at that point of time. Retribution as some may say, because if you got to learn things the hard way - experience would be arriving soon to teach and enlighten you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>After 6 months with her you found yourself treasuring her. Why? No more girls to flirt around? And she actually tolerated everything since day 1 and accepted it? You have found such wonderful girl and may heaven strike you if you were to continue your ways until the end of your relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>HOWEVER....<br><br>Everything has their own first time. *Ok I close my eyes on this since you did change* I knew of many flirts in my life and eventually they would all settle for those kind of 'nice plus makes a good wife' kind of girl. Reasons being very simple: They ain't like any other woman you slept with. Change is not enough - learn to be a proper decent boyfriend to repay her for the times when you were a jerk. She wants attention, give her. She needs love - shower her. She needs someone to be there, aim to be the first. When she did something, always encourage her along the way - Sometimes little words goes a long way. The list goes on.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She decide to work in a KTV: You are displeased with it, however you decide that if she likes it, she can go ahead with it. Look, a decent boyfriend who loves their gf would not look at short term - they look at the overall picture and sees if there is danger. Would you sent your gf to explore a lion's den just because she wants excitment? No? Why? Because you know that its dangerous. Isn't so similiar in this case?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why didn't you firmly dissuade her? Because you did her wrong in the past and now when you treasure her, your senses tells you that giving personal space is very important, which blindly led you to agree. Let me tell you something: Wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>she knows that i don't like.... but she still wants to work there</strong> - Not enough my dear friend - communication is very much needed here. I don't blame you because you never had a serious relationship before. In a flirt or an ONS - you don't need any communication between the hearts other then physical gratification you seek to enjoy. Tell her about your point of view, the danger and everything. You are communicate properly, it shouldn't be a problem. Its only a problem if you don't even attempt a good try.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She left you and there could be two reasons:<br><br>I) First - the entire plan to work in the KTV, etc has alot of hidden motive, intentions, unseen schemes going on behind. Like what you said, she doesn't need the money, but she insisted in working there. She left you on the account that this guilt accumulates and when she was raped, she regreted everything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>II) Second: She was raped and she felt inferior, not worthy of you, therefore she felt you on the account that she is tainted and unpure.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>One year later then she received your card? You and her no contact for one year? How on Earth can you not do anything practical? Cannot call then find manually lar! Check with her sister, beg her, did you do absolutely every single means you could to find her? No?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>*Warning Offensive mode coming on*<br><br><strong>HOW COULD YOU LEAVE YOU GF IN A LURCH WHEN SHE NEEDED YOU THE MOST AND YOU DIN EVEN BOTHER TO TRY TO FIND HER. SHE LEFT, DOESN'T MEAN SHE BREAK UP WITH YOU. SHE WAS A VICTIM AND WHAT SHE WAS UNDERGOING IS NO LESS THAN HELL - WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU?  </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>My heart ached when I see your post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> I swear, because of your numerous actions which made this relationship a ill-fated drama. My advice is to date her out and probably have a nice dinner or something with her. Chat with her like a normal friend and see how things is. (You got her number from the SMS do you?) Read up books about relationship, about understanding woman and about everything relating to these two issues. Learn and strive to be a even better guy and bf to any other good lady who were to come.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You both need to talk - because each of you left a question mark in one another's heart. Don't you think its time to clear this doubt? Or are you going to wait until something else happens again? By then, perhaps you may not have the chance anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Do update me about your situations. I be praying for you. Pte message me or simply post it in Aunt Agony.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WEll brudder ur case quite similar to mine sia...<br><br>Also e very beautiful chase me on my bdae.... during that time i was having e same thought as urs on my mind... And that having relationship with Chio BUs cant really last long... cos they  tend to be sian with e relationship when times passes... AS so many pple chase them...<br><br>So this particular pretty girl of mine last time had many suitors behind her tail... up to someone actually wanna 'PAO' her 4 $9000 per mth..  A 32 yrs old married guy... who is her ex boss...<br><br>Same case as you.. i still going cheong.. pick up new girls and have fling with some of them...<br><br>Her frenz caught me and told her abt it... She confronted me saying that she doesnt like e idea of only her giving her best while i e other party is not doing e same... So she wanna to break up...<br><br>Well.. i bought some nice flower and wait under her blk to say sorry to her and that i would treasure her..<br><br>So she forgive mi and we carry on e relatioship...<br><br>Since then i decided to give her all my best effort and that my family treat her not bad.. Her mother likes me alot.<br><br>Soon she tell me that she wanna go work in a KTV, i wan like What!!!<br><br>How could i let her work there right, Its like a normal decent girl would not be appearing in that kind of place. Den she say its not like what i think at e KTV pub.<br><br>Anyway i ask her how intro e job to her, she say was her ah lians frenz... ( Btw all her sisters all not even poly standard, few of them even takes drugs! Couple of times i told her to stay away from them but she will nv listens!!! )<br><br>I loved her and i know she like freedoms, in e end i let her go for e job and promised her not to tell her family esp her mother.<br><br>After 4 mths... she somehow wanna break off again... out of no reason.. i am someone who give in to her.. We dun have much friction between us thou...<br><br>So i ask her what is going on, she replied me saying e love was just not as strong as it was before. I den ask since when it happen. She say since that incident of her frenz catching me with other girls.<br><br>And now that she wanna be alone.  And so she cancel her hp as well as her hse.<br><br>I tried calling her and went to her hse. To my surprise, her family had move out. Well i wan very sad back then.<br><br>After half a yr, she sms me some good night stuff. So i ask back who izzit? She sms me back her name. I was like out of breath, cos i expected this and that all these while i still cant forget her beautiful face, lovely voice and wonderful smiles which can really melt away my heart.<br><br>So we chat over e night nd i realised her family move to Yishun and all these while she is still single. **I wonder why but i din not ask **<br><br>So we meet out like once per mth. So one fine night i ask her whether is there any chances we could be back again.<br><br>She din not answer my question say that she does not wanna rush things and that she just got her new job. Things are pretty bad in her coy.<br><br>WEll these goes on for like 3 mth and i finally ask her again.. She still not answer my question and tell me not to press her ...<br><br>Perhaps mine is not as detail as e one earlier on but i have e same kind of thought on my mind all these while and that is :<br><br>1) I was thinking what to do now........ i was afraid of being hurt again....  i am confused. I talk to her mother as our retionship is quite close. She relate to me that shi indeed have been single all these while. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2) I miss her lots all these while But is she still e same one as i loved before.
