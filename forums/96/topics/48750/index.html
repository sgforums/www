Till one day they find out there's no such thing, unless of cos they think they've found someone.<br><br>You can spend your entire life waiting, but you can end up all alone in the end.<br><br>I totally agree when you say we shouldn't settle for anything less than out true love. But what if you just can't find this true love, wouldn't you want to just settle for something, though it has lesser to offer?</div>

I felt really sorry for you. And I think that the girl's being a bitch. (my opinion, I'm sorry) But I think she's being unfair cos she wants someone waiting for her somewhere, even after she's decided that her bf's still the best. I mean, WTF??!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>It's true, girls like guys chasing them, they like the wooing part. But it's so friggin unfair to want him to go on waiting and pursuing when she's not going to even give a second thought about giving him a chance. I mean, ARGH! I'm a girl, and I'm not supporting her way of handling things.<br><br>Above are my opinions. So I apologise if I've offended anyone<br></div>
