Love has no eyes-<br>-Love is not blind...-<br>-It sees, but it doesn't mind-<br><br>In the arithmetic of love<br>1+1=everything<br>2-1=nothing<br><br>In real love, you want the other person's good,<br>In romantic love, you want the other person.<br><br>Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength,<br>while loving someone deeply gives you courage<br>-Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime<br>and never let off till we're gone-<br><br>Love is a fire<br>Whether it is going to warm your heart or burn down your house,<br>you can never tell<br>Time is too slow for those who waits<br>too swift for those who fear<br>too long for those who grieve<br>too short for those who rejoice<br>but for those who love,<br>time is eternity...<br>Some of us think holding on makes us strong,<br>but sometimes, it is letting go<br>If you have reasons why you love a person,<br>you are using your mind.<br>If you love a person for no reason at all,<br>you're using your heart.<br><br>I can't tell you I care<br>I can't tell you my feelings but I know it's there.<br>I can't tell you I want to stay,<br>I can't tell you I love you because you might go away.<br><br>A memory of true love is like a favourite song<br>no matter how many times it plays again,<br>you never get tired of it<br><br>I never felt true love until I was with you<br>I never felt true sadness until without you<br><br>-True love should be lived like an imperfect circle-<br>-that has its bumps, but never end-<br><br>Love is not something you hold, its something you set free<br>Not something you just do, but something you don't imagine to last<br>It's not something we choose, it chooses us<br>Perhaps the best thing in life is being able to choose the one you love and perhaps the worst thing is not being able to choose the one who will love you in return<br><br>Why hold someone back... when u know u don't love them...<br>Why keep them to yourself... when u know you won't wanna have them?<br>Why let them miss other chances...when they can have them? If you really don't love someone....let them go...hurt them NOW... not later...for a longer relationship builds stronger emotions...<br><br>A good relationship isn't a game you play or an ego trip you take. It is about love and two people.<br>Loving someone can give us the greatest joy we can ever know and it can hurt more than we can believe too.<br>When it does not really hurt when that person did something<br>disappointing to you, but really hurts when you see that person in pain and sadness, then you know you truly love that person.<br><br>Loving someone means you should be ready to experience heartache and happiness at the same time.That's the reward and that's the risk. Unless we are willing to experience it, we will never really know what it's like to love and be loved.<br><br>Sharing love is probably the most valuable and meaningful experience a person can ever have.And there's a difference between being in love with someone and loving someone.<br>It's the difference between a love that's fickle,wild and short-lived<br>and one that's tender and passionate,nurturing and lasts a long time. The first is easy. The second, the one that really matters to all of us,takes work because it's about keeping a relationship.<br><br>Loving someone takes efforts. We have to be able to communicate with each other. Nobody can read anyone else's mind. We always presume that our partner knows what we think and feel. Maybe in time we might be able to predict or sense each other's thoughts but it's never perfect and takes time to develop. Getting the chance to love and be loved by someone is blessed.<br><br>Respect him/her for who he/she is, and not what you want him/her to be. Everyone is pretty and special in his/her own special way. No one is perfect. It is true love which closes the gap of imperfectness to form a smooth surface of acceptance for each other.<br>True love sees and accepts a person for who he/she is. It is also true love which makes a person change for the better. The power of true love to a person is undeniable.<br><br>A relationship needs commitments too. What is love without commitments from each other anyway? It's like principles and values. Everyone has them but they only mean as much as we are willing to stand for them. The same goes for our commitments to relationships, and the person we love.<br><br>"Love is like an antique vase. It's hard to find,hard to net, but easy to break."<br>Every day everywhere, people fall in love ... but just how many of these relationships are self-sacrificing love, and not just relationships which are formed only for the intense! feeling of falling in love? I know hundreds of friends who say the magical words "I love you"... but more often than not, the truth is just I am IN love with you.<br><br>But if a person says he/she loves you, he/she means<br>that he/she loves you unconditionally for who you are now, who you were in the past and who you might be in the future.<br>When he/she says he/she loves you and really means it,you have to ask yourself if you love him/her too or if you're in love with the idea of being in love. It is very hard to see the difference through logical thinking. Let your heart guide u.<br><br>**The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.**<br>If u think something will make you happy, go for it.<br>&gt; &gt; **Remember that we pass this way only once.**<br></div>
