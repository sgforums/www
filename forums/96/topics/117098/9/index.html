You are way too sensitive. However, I sincerely urge you to stop whinning about how you can't get a date because Singapore women are materialistic, highly educated, pretty, able to stand up for their own rights, speak their mind, etc. If you can't get a date, the problem lies with you. Do not, ever push the blame to others. I have deep hatred for whinners. Don't ask me why. But I think human beings should stand up for themselves. Complaining is furtile. It will not change anything. Please do something constructive, like helping out in an orphanage.<br><br>If you wanna crap, I'll be glad to do so, despite our difference in age. But please do not whine.
