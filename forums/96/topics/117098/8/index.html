He will lay the blame on others as much as he can for his flaws and character issues. Everyone can see it for themselves.<br><br>3.  He is the one who trashed me and trample me, putting words into other people mouth, claiming I am whatever whatever negative things, slamming me and getting personal. I did not even retaliate. I did not even flame him for god's sake. I never did anything back to him. As I said and you and I joke around. Nothing wrong to joke is there?<br><br>4. I never asked him to PM me and even invite me for a meet up. Hell! Can anyone find any prove I asked for his PM? Did anyone see me force him to PM me? He did it on his own free will after he's made insulting comments about me. Is it my fault that his charater flaws are so many and in full view and he invited scorn from others through his behaviour and actions. Yet, at the end, Oh blame it on the girls. Blame it one anyone who does not fight back and talk back. Its easy to always put words in my mouth cause I do not do the low thing like our Loser here does. Flame/slander/insult others and then claim he was "forced" to do it and he has high character.<br><br>As I say, I do not take back what I say about this person.<br>I do not want to spoil my day for such a piece of sh!t<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
