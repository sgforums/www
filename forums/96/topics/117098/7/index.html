            <div class='col-md body'>I believe we are all fair and reasonable people and that would include dcx i try to believe people should try to get along harmoniously talk things calmly and settle in a friendly manner if possible live and let live and to work things out together and not make things difficult for each to cause unneccesary problems other,to coexist an dgive the respect , even if both cannot agree all the time  if it can be done that would be the best  decision   but if not ,then theres no mutual  interest holding people together then people should depart and seperate from here,i am not too active user till recently with my postings about looking for  potential possibilities, but if things are made more complicated and more difficult,it shows that sggirls would not be the alternative unless there are people who can think otherwise<br><br>The reason i send a pm to misty blue in the first place was i was trying to be friendly and to be sincere about my intentions  but she took it the wrong and  misunderstood misjudged that i was out for sex. as i said i  believe it has to be based on chemsitry and feelings ,and i know it snot possbile to find ons from here, if iwanted to i could have trid clubs an dpubs but thats not my intentions, as i am looking fo somethign else<br>one needs to make a distinction between virtual and actual, in real life the things misty blue said doesnt apply, didnt expect her to react so strongly with her response with using words not pleasing to the ears like pervert and fuck off bugger, i want to come witht he feeling of being happy easygoing rather than feeling thats its not a nice place to be .<br>as for misty blue i took a clue from her posting here that she gives me the impression shes ok being friends  from this posting<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=116548</div>
