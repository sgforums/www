            <div class='col-md body'>Sally n Roy were lovers....like any other couple, they get to know each other tru friends.<br>Sally juz ended a short-term relationship and was rather depress but knowing Roy helped<br>her coped with the misery of a broken relationship.<br>Roy was in army then, after being single for a long time, he felt he was ready to find someone.<br>Or perhaps he needed companionship...<br>The timing was perfect, both needed companionship, hence after knowing for less than a month,<br>they became lovers.<br><br>Like all relationship, the beginning was honeymoon period for the both of them.<br>Sally was glad to have Roy, but after a failed relationship, she too felt unsure.<br>She was not sure whether it was a right thing to do, hence she told Roy all about her past,<br>how she felt,and most importantly, that she was really someone who take relationship seriously<br>and was extremely possessive. Roy, on the other hand, didnt take it too seriously, being a typical guy,<br>he felt that it wasnt much of a problem. He  was sure things would work things out, he was very optimistic.<br>He assured Sally millions of time with words and actions,<br>Sally was touched and in return she begin to put in feelings.<br>She felt that since Roy had put in efforts, she should too put in her part.<br>So in return she love Roy back.<br><br>Sally and Roy have  alot in common, they both love to have fun, enjoy food and most importantly,<br>they can communicate with each others.<br>They can tell each other their stupidest n silliest thoughts, without fear that the other person wld laugh or<br>look down on the other person<br>Sally thought she found her soulmate, she enjoyed every moment with Roy, being with Roy was like in cloud 9.<br>They did many things together, going to each other house to stay when parents wasnt around, Sally would cook for Roy<br>or Roy wld drive Sally around to different places around singapore and try out different delicacy that Roy would noe.<br>Roy would showered Sally with gifts, once in a while gave Sally the sweetest surprise...<br><br>A year soon pass, Roy had ORD and ready to go in to uni.....his relationship with Sally had become very stable, perhaps too<br>stable that Roy was getting tired of it. His feeling had changed whereas Sally's feeling for him had deepened.He dunno how to<br>tell Sally. They do quarrel, it was not really a fairy tales...like any ordinary couples, they quarrel over the tiniest matters.<br>Roy hate to quarrel but Sally perferred to tok things out...she hated cold war.<br>They began to have difference....but Sally felt that such differences is normal in any relationship, as long as they love each other, such problems would be resolved.<br>But Sally was wrong, Roy did not really love her as much as she tot he would.<br><br>They soon went on a trip together, to a small sunny island, they wld go snokelling together and party in the night.<br>When they go snokelling, swimming in the deep blue sea, everything was silent, Roy hold on to Sally's hand as they swim.<br>Suddenly, they seem to be alone in the whole world except for the both of them. Sally tot Roy wld hold on forever,<br>never did she know that this hand would soon let go....<br><br>As Roy enter nus, their relationship deteriorated....Roy would get to know girls and concealed his attached status.<br>Sally was very unhappy about it, being a possessive girl, she cannot stand the idea of her bf knowing other girls behind her back<br>and worse concealing his status...<br>Because of this, they keep on quarrelling....Sally stared to interfer with every aspect of Roy's life, Roy was sufforcated.<br>In one major quarrel, he would not take it anymore and slapped her and Sally slapped back. She was devastated.<br>She would not understand why the person who she tot loved her so deeply wld do such a things to hurt her.<br>Why would he hate to tok to her or go out with her anymore and lie to her n go out with other people behind her back.<br>Roy on the other hand was shocked, he never tot he wld hit a girl or scold a girl so badly...<br>He dun understand why Sally would love him so much, n why she would not let go...<br><br>They continued the relationship, trying hard to savage the relationship, or at least that was wat Sally tot to be until<br>a girl came into their relationship.<br>She was his classmate, it started on the icq chat, it was rather innocent or to some extent of flirtation.<br>Sally was shocked to find out, she did something she never would tot she wld do, that is to call the girl.<br>Stuck between two girls, Roy was stressed, he was shocked by Sally's behaviour. he never tot she wld call the other girl up like that.<br>Eventhough, he did go out with the other girl, Sally still look him up. He ended up being with two girls.<br>Despite Roy's betrayal, Sally still loved him very much....the tot of breaking up hurt her even more than the feeling of betrayal.<br>She begged Roy to stay, eventually Roy being soft-hearted came back again.<br>All Sally's friends would not understand why she would do such a things. They dun understand how would<br>she choose to forgive someonewho had hurt her so much once n once again.<br>Eventually, they felt that she would not listen to their advices and stop giving it anymore, they would only look on..<br>Sally felt more and more isolated, her soulmate Roy have stop loving her, and her friends have left her...<br>She knew it was her own fault, she was so blinded by her love, that she refuse to take her friends advices,<br>she still tot that if she perserve things eventually wld work out between Roy and her.<br>She forgotten the fact the relationship was very much a two-sided affairs, it doesnt matter how much she do for Roy,he juz wld not<br>appreciate it anymore.<br><br>The more Roy take her for granted, the worse he treated her. To the extent, he was so disgusted by himself and with Sally too.<br>He knew Sally love him deeply. he knew too she understand him fully and perhaps in this life,<br>he would never find another girl who would love him as much as Sally does.<br>But he is so young, he dun want to be bounded by a girl, he felt that he would continued to stray n continued to hurt Sally.<br>N he was frightened by Sally's behaviour, she have changed from a fun-loving girl to someone who was easily paranoid n insercure.<br>She became extremely hysterical when she cant find him and would cry and laugh at the same time. She would call him million time a day, to the extend of getting into his nerve.<br><br>In a way, Sally had went 'crazy' and was in extreme depression....but she did not let anyone noe....only Roy noe.<br>But Roy would not handle it, he dun understand how would someone become like this, he felt disgusted and helpless.<br>Sally too was helpless....she couldnt control her emotion and was extreme vulnerable,it didnt help much when her only emotion support<br>Roy had chosen to desert her. To a point she tried to end her life.....<br><br>Everything came to a end, when another girl came into the picture.<br>This time no matter how Sally beg, Roy refused to give in anymore, he said he really love this girl.<br>Sally dun understand, how would a girl that he noes not too long would change everything....<br>This 2 yrs 8 mths 26 days of relationship meant nothing at all......all the memories, picture they taken,<br>gifts that was given was nothing more than a waste of his time.<br>He say they would still be friends....but in Sally's heart, she knew things would never be the same before.<br>Knowing that they were together, she would feel hurt.....Sally really would not bring herself to give him the blessing...<br>Perhaps she didnt love him that much, she was juz afraid of losing him....<br>But Sally knew she really loved Roy very much, he would be very special to her...<br>But she also knew she meant nothing to him anymore</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Over Time Story Pt 2<br><br>A mistake!! It was a big mistake, a price that Sally wasnt prepared to pay....<br><br>When Sally went to see Roy, she was hopeful and wishful in thinking...she thought that since Roy said he missed her....it would mean something rite?<br><br>When she saw him, all the feelings start flowing back....she missed him....and the feeling was overwhelming...she felt so sad, so wanting to hug him again...but she as afraid that he would hurt her again...<br><br>As for Roy, he is not very sure of his feeling....he missed Sally when he was abroad...but he also missed his gf...he dunno why is he this way....he dunno why he would want to meet Sally...perhaps it was familiarity?? He was too used of having Sally around even when he dont love her....he felt angry when he knew Sally met up with other guys...but that was cos he dun like to share and Sally used to belong to him?<br><br>Both were confused by their own thoughts...<br><br>That night, they talked and hugged the whole night, as if they never did break up....n so the hope in Sally grew...Roy said many sweet things and sweet promises. Sally knew it was wrong yet she chose to follow her heart...and to believe him again...<br><br>Roy dunno why he would make such promises....he did mean it when he say it, cos when he was holding Sally, he really wished to make her happy but on the other hand he felt guilty...he felt that he had betrayed his gf.<br><br>As one grew hope....the other grew guilt....<br><br>Sally kept reminding herself....its only for a while...since Roy is leaving to study overseas soon....once he left, everything would be back to normal....she knew it was not right but please God..let her have a few last moments with him again...just for a while...even if it meant to sin...<br><br>But little did she know, for the little greed she had, she have to pay such a hearty price....<br><br>As Roy went back home, he felt more and more guilty...especially when he meet up with his gf....to him now, his gf is an angel, and that is was wrong to hurt her....so he made up his mind.....he choose again to hurt Sally....he comfort himself...this is for Sally good too....She can get over him and be happy...with this thoughts he told Sally that he want ed to end all contacts with her again...<br><br>Sally was desvastated....how would the person who just said those sweet nothings yesterday, changed his mind so quickly....what about those sweet nothings?? what about those promises?? All are lies???!!!<br><br>She felt sad and angry and cheated...most of all, she felt foolish and ashame... why did she ever let the same person to hurt her over and over again?? Why didnt she heel her friends' advice?? Why did the person she love have to hurt her so much???<br><br>She cried, she scolded, she begged...she did whatever she feel that can make her feel better but the pain would not stop...<br><br>But no matter what she did,Roy would not change his mind...in fact the more Sally begged...the more he tried to hurt her...<br><br>Roy dont understand how come he would become like this....he never thought he would scream and shout at anyone as he did to Sally....He cant believe himself that he actually said those things....he felt like a monster and he felt Sally was the cause of it.<br><br>Only by leaving Sally, then he can kill the monster in him....<br><br>Knowing that nothing can change Roy's mind...Sally begged him one last time....please return all the photos to her...she begged....but Roy refused....he refused to meet Sally...he refused to return all the stuffs to Sally...."Dunno what you wld do with it!!" that was his reply....Sally was so hurt...<br><br>She went to his house, but he refused to open the door....perhaps he was pushed to the wall, out of anger he took all the photos and burn it before Sally's eyes....<br><br>As he torn n burn the photos...Sally's heart sank and became so cold...she dont understand why he hate her so much,to the extend he wanted to destroy the memories....was it so un happy for him...is she such a nasty person....so disgusted that he need to erase and destroy all memories of her??<br><br>She left the place in daze....she cant think anymore, she cant cried at all....she felt like she just attended a funeral...the funeral of her relationship....she dunno how she went home and what she did.....</div>
