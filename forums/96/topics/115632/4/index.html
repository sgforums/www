            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean1971,<br><br>Actually, I'm kinda free so I'll post this to help you out.Instead of being in conformity with the rest of the forum, I'm really going to assist you against the depredations made by people in this forum who simply have had enough of your incessant demands for the "perfect" girl.While my comprehension of the opposite sex is nothing short of esoteric, I feel you'll be doing yourself a big favour by heeding my advice.<br><br>1.STOP posting such topics in the forum (you know what kind of topics im referring to) It simply won't do you any good to uninhibitedly display your disappointment the moment you get rejected.<br><br>2.BRUSH up on your grammar.Though' I'm no fine specimen of the Queen's language, I can confidently tell you that you won't be impressing many people with your romantic insights. The reason being that they won't even understand what you're trying to tell them!<br><br>3.TOLERATE the bullshit you receive from people who can't appreciate or understand your quest for romance.If they are vacuous, they won't understand your rebuttals in the first place, so there's no point trying to talk some sense into them.<br><br>4.DON'T be desperate. You like FireIce? Mistyblue? Stop being so pushy with the date, and start taking things slowly.Actually, I don't think there's a point anymore.I figure they're fed up of your sophomoric opinions.No pun intended.<br><br>AND stop harrassing Mistyblue already,don't you know that she's friends with many other girls in this forum? You f@cking moron or what? you mess with her and you destroy your chances at any girl.We're getting tired of your inane caterwauling all the time. As a general rule, "Girls are never wrong" You probably won't understand that now, but you will soon enough.It's quite appalling that you need advice from someone 2 generations younger than yourself, but as a friend, and as my religion compells me, I will love you as my neighbour, and hence provide you with my heavenly advice.<br><br>Good luck.</div>
