She has bf also doesn't matter. What matters most is that she has interest in you. If you've been dating her for sometime and she's really happy every moment spent with you, why not ?<br>Of course all these holding and hugging depends on your approach, the distinct period of dating, place and also how good you are. If it's only casual friends and you do that to her of course no chance lar...she might even slap you.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

You are just opening up yrself for rejection. It's like selling your soul to the devil. If you dont know wat she thinks about you, just test her, keep testing her. This how i read one's mind. It may take a few days to weeks. For instance, tell her what happened[ any incident you experienced or u just make up 1]  to you then see her reaction. Ask whether she believe you.<br><br>If she has been out with you but you still have not held her hands, hug or even kiss her, dont expect her to answer you positively. She's probably still not ready or you've not done enough and are seen trying to rush things.<br><br>But if you have done all the things i've mentioned above, good luck to you! What's the point of asking ? Both of you are just a few steps closer to being together. Right? Then just enjoy the prsent moment..</div></blockquote>how do i test her? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
