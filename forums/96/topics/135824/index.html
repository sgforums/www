            <div class='col-md body'>Dear folks,<br><br>In view of the recent media spotlight on Sggirls.com, i cannot help but ponder whether if we have lost our founder's intentions when he  1st established this website.<br><br>I believe our founder (this 24 year Singaporean chap) wanted this site to be a pure website featuring pretty , unique and charming Singapore girls in decent poses so that we can appreciate and praise the girl's beauty.<br><br>But somewhere along the line, this simple and pure vision of appreciating beauty is lost when we see people posting all sorts of sexually suggestive pictures of women in their candid positions. So we are no longer appreciators of Sg girls beauty but Peeping Toms of Singapore.<br><br>I must say that our moderators are trying very hard to weed out pornographic pictures and pictures with illicit content.

We may enjoy the cheap thrill now in ogling at such pictures of category (i) and (ii) but BAd Karma will return one day when u realize the woman in the picture is someone you know and love.<br><br>May i suggest that we increase the number of moderators and the moderators work in shifts 24/7 to ensure the site is secured from pictures of type (i) and (ii). And also, Can we eliminate the category of "Candid", "lingerine" and "sexually(Not suitable for Children)" pictures?<br><br>Hmm, i would really like to hear from our founder (this 24 year old Singaporean) and our moderators on my opinion.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br></div>

It is understandable that Chen Jiahao was frustrated. Philip Yeo threatened him with a lawsuit because he was scared that all of A*Star's weaknesses would be revealed. But then again, Yeo is only a bureaucrat responsible to the MIW, and has no mind of his own. His bosses screw him, and he can only screw the scholars. The reason for scholars to break bonds is due to the rot in the system as a whole, not just one organisation.</div>
