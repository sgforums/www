            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ferguson:</div><div class="quote_body">sg got women charter. you think leh</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">well, that's interesting: The law book has precedence over the cook book.<br>Now, I am curious how female lawmakers well-fed were when they were schooling and doing the paper chase ?<br><br>Women...TODAY'S women to be precised, has lost much of the feminine charm and mastery of the home and kitchen skills that only yesteryear generation can enjoy.<br><br>Just look around u from university to workplace, a pack of Maggie is the best sumptuous meal that they can wip up.<br><br>I am NOT AT ALL impressed with women in high cooperate positions or HER WORLD only mindset. That is NOT at all a complete nor a natural woman.<br><br>THAT is recreation of MAN in an altered gender to satisify the unnatural belief that all-sex-are-equal social engineering under the consumeristic atmosphere of political correctness.<br><br>With all her education, exposure, opportunities and yes, WOMEN'S CHARTER, are they really any "happier" than their mums and grandma ?<br><br>When I meant Happier, I am referring to happier as a WOMAN. Can any ladies share on this ?<br><br>Why I asked is because I notice in today's cross-gender, role sharing and conflicting ideas, many are quite lost.<br><br>I fear not of MAN himselve lossing out as they do hv other choices (Vietnamese wife, etc etc), but of children of today's and future gen when they only have opportunity to called someone MUM before 9 am and after 7 pm several times a week for much of their childhood.<br><br>Now, that is painful, coz there is no CHILDREN's CHARTER.</span><br><br></div>
