But one must also understand that if a gal starts to behave like this, there must be certain reasons. Either she's not interested in you, or she's having mood swings, or she's playing mind games with you, or she's a complete heck-care type, or she's uncomfortable with you getting closer to her to know her more, or she feels that she's not prepared to have a relationship at the moment.... many many other reasons.<br><br>It's true that a guy should be presistent in courtship. But if such a case happens, it's always good and considerate enough to take one step back to allow some space for the girl to move abt and to think things over.

She told me her job is busy recently (maybe) and I called her last night and to my surprise, she did not answered my call and when I call her the 2nd time, she shut down her HP!!! When I SMS and call her the 3rd time, she answered by sounds a bit siam sian type.... I did not persist on and I told her that I will communicate with her some other BETTER days.<br><br>In my heart, I have started to forget this person etc. When everytime it always turn out to be like that?? why Why Why why why Why.... I believe there might be some misunderstandings between the 2 of us.........I have been thru this type of nonsense after my NS...It seems that there is no fate at all for me with other gals..I am really really sad. Must I go overSea to get a wife eventually or it is all predestined that I must accompany my Bettas for the rest of my life.... Really giving up...really. Please do not feel sad/sorry for me as I basically do not know the reasons at all.....</div></blockquote><span class="large"><strong>SHE MUST BE HAVING P M S !!!!!! </strong></span>[/b]</div>
