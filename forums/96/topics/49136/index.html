Commitment. You can be really really close to someone but as long as it's not official, there's no commitment. No commitment, no extra stress, less heartbreak etc. She might want to be sure of herself. Esp since she just broke up with her bf. She might want to make sure this is not a rebound. But if this is the case, then I don't thinking kissing (or anything intimate for that matter) is a good idea.</div>

For the past two years, i might consider it a crush, but then it's only this year that i realise that i am really into her... I am really really really into her. One thing that really bothers me is my lowself-esteem... You see... for me, she seems perfect to me... she is the sweetest girl among those i've known.... She is the prettiest, cutest.... what more can i ask for... But since she is so perfect.... she has..... mamy many many many guys going after her....(in my school, that is...) That is why i have no connfidence in myself, since i am not handsome, smart, good looking and stuffs like that.... it just seems that i dun match with her everytime i think about this matter... what should i do...?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ??? ARGH!!!!</div></blockquote>hang in there....but you need to know how SHE feels about you in reality. try asking her how long is her long and see for urself if its sincere. you do need a clear mind of where both of you stand. just don;t make hasty decisions....</div>
