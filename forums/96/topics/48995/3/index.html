You waited for your gal you "dreamed to be with" Like wat u said the rest 2 are not your kinda girl. What about the gal u waiting now? would u think the gal would be happy with u? does she think u suit her? Like the gal said, dun waste ur time. She gave you strong hints. Just forget this girl and move on. Difficult also lan lan try to forget.</div>

She needs time. She's probably protecting herself from any more hurt from you, which is personally what I would do too. If you've not intention of wanting her back, then please leave her alone, and save her the torture of going through an emotional roller coaster. If you truly have regretted leaving her and want her back, you've got to prove yourself with actions.<br><br>But don't expect her to definitely take you back. Once bitten twice shy... be mentally prepared.</div>
