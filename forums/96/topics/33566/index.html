Human are just like that, always refuse to change to adapt the environment. Tell her that 2 years relationship is nothing if that guy doesn't know how to appreciate and treasure her, then he wouldn't worth her love, but then I doubt all these can enter her ears now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>When they are attached, they tend to neglect their friends, so when they are alone again, they will worry that whether their friends will still be there for them again. As a friend, you will just have to play your part by supporting her when she needs one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>From my experience, your friend will just need some times by herself to straighten out her thinking, as she is getting better, try occupy her time with activities so that she wouldn't have time to think of the past, and don't bother to introduce any new guys to he cos its won't help her at the present stage. Some take days to recover, some will take weeks and some may even take months or years. Time can heal her wound <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
