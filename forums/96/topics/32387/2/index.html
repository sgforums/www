We're not as perverted as you think we all are.<br><br>2. No matter what YOU say, your ex-boyfriend IS an ass hole.<br><br>3. We like you to give us hugs and kisses sometimes too.<br><br>4. Don't argue with us when we call you beautiful.<br><br>5. Don't treat us like shit, what goes around comes around.<br><br>6. We know you're pretty, that's one of the reason's we're going out with you.<br><br>7. Don't go into detail about your period. It scares us.<br><br>8. If you have cramps and we ask you what's wrong, just tell us it's that time of the month and nothing more.<br><br>9. If you really liked us for us, you would let us think that our mustache, beard, or sideburns looked cool.<br><br>10. We never shave our legs. So get over it.<br>11. NEVER ask us if you can put makeup on us. It's just wrong.<br><br>12. Don't make bets about us, because one of your friends will tell us, if you don't.<br><br>13. When we tell you that you're not fat, believe us.<br><br>14. We absolutely do not care about the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, or what any other guy looks like for that matter<br><br>15. We may not be able to pee accurately all of the time, but at least we can stand up and go pee.<br><br>16. Just cause you think you're always right, doesn't mean that you don't have to apologize when you do something "wrong."<br><br>17. You expect us to say and do sweet things for you, but it would be nice if you did the same every once in a while. We like to know that you love us.<br><br>18. We can't always be spontaneous, so try to help us make the plans sometimes.<br><br>19. Don't ask us to beat up another guy for you, cause you might get what you wish for.<br><br>20. Never kick us in the nuts "just to see what we would say". That's just mean.<br><br>21. Never pretend like you are going to break up with us and laugh when we believe you.<br><br>22. Pamela Anderson's boobs aren't fake anymore, but we like yours better anyway.<br><br>23. Size doesn't matter, except to idiots who don't want a relationship.<br><br>24. PMS is not an excuse.<br><br>25. If you want us to put the seat down when we're done, you should put it up when you're done.<br><br>26. Don't tell us how cute your ex-boyfriend was. That doesn't turn us on.<br><br>27. And always remember: The way to a guys heart is through his stomach..... and maybe....oh nevermind.<br><br>28. NEVER ask us to kiss other guys. You might be that comfy with your friends, but to us it's just wrong.<br><br>29. We always notice how funny it is after your rip out our heart, stick it down our throat and still want to be friends.<br><br>30. And last but not least: We know you're not always right, but we'll pretend like you are anyway. </ul></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Silver, I said it once and I say it again... follow these rules, and all will be fine!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>&gt; &gt;We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules<br>&gt; &gt;from the male side. These are our rules !<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's<br>&gt; &gt; up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't<br>&gt; &gt; hear us bitching about you leaving it down<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;2. Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;3. Saturday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing<br>&gt; &gt; of the tides. Let it be.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;4. Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more<br>&gt; &gt;attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear<br>&gt; &gt;getting married is that married women always cut their hair.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;5. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to<br>&gt; &gt;think of it that way.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;6. Crying is blackmail.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;7. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle<br>&gt; &gt;hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do<br>&gt; &gt;not work! Just say it!<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;8. We don't remember dates. Mark birthdays and anniversaries on a calendar.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Remind us frequently beforehand.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;9. Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops. What makes you think we'd be<br>&gt; &gt;any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your<br>&gt; &gt;dress?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;10. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost<br>&gt; &gt;every question.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;11. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving<br>&gt; &gt;it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are<br>&gt; &gt;for.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;12. Check your oil! Please.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;13. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an<br>&gt; &gt;argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after<br>&gt; &gt;7 days.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;14. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.<br>&gt; &gt;We refuse to answer.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;15. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways<br>&gt; &gt;makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;16. Let us ogle. We are going to look anyway; it's genetic.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;17. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you<br>&gt; &gt;want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it,<br>&gt; &gt;just do it yourself.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;18. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say<br>&gt; &gt;during commercials.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;19. Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;20. ALL men see in only 16 colours, like Windows default<br>&gt; &gt; settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a colour. We<br>&gt; &gt;have no idea what mauve is.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;21. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that it's genetic.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;22. We are not mind readers and we never will be. Our lack of mind-reading<br>&gt; &gt;ability is not proof of how little we care about<br>&gt; &gt;you.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;23. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like<br>&gt; &gt;nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just<br>&gt; &gt;not worth the hassle.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;24. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;25. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.<br>&gt; &gt;Really.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;26. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are<br>&gt; &gt;prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, the shotgun<br>&gt; &gt;formation or monster trucks.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;27. You have enough clothes.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;28. You have too many shoes.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;29. No NO you really do have too many shoes.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;30. It is neither in your best interest or ours to take the<br>&gt; &gt;quiz together. No, it doesn't matter which quiz.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;31. BEER is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;32. I'm in shape. ROUND is a shape.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;33. Sometimes we just don't want you around. Accept it, if<br>&gt; &gt;we wanted you to come out we'd have invited you.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on<br>&gt; &gt;the couch tonight, but did you know we really don't mind that, it's like<br>&gt; &gt;camping.<br></div>
