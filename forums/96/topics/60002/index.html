Sorry for that.<br><br>Well, I can only say some gals did not appreciate the chances they had whenever there is "someone" out there caring for them. The Gal will tell him "it is best to remain as friend". When this guy decided to leave her, she will try to savage the situation, some cases it work but for other cases, maybe the guys already had someone else in mind and do u think this guy will give up the one that agreed to go steady with him for the one who say "It is best to remian as friend"?<br><br>Gals out there, do think about it. U gals afraid that U meet/commit to the wrong one BUT we guys are also scared that U all wasting our time if U all are taking we guys for a ride.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To NeonTetra,<br><br>Well, im not justifying myself by saying that i "cant get the grapes say the grapes sour" cos infact i've seen situations or rather experienced  cases where girls play hard to get by hinting to the guys to take the initiative but when the guy makes the move, the girl starts acting all funny like you committed a crime or something. Now that's screwed. I am not sure if that falls under the category of playing hard to get. But it's just that there's this attitude thingy in sg girls that they really think too hihgly of themselves, for those who know who they are. But then again, like others said, it's not all of them. I am just pointing that group. Again, we're under the topic of "How a gal reacts when she knew someone is going after her?", and  i'm just giving my honest opinion.</div>

Now that's screwed. I am not sure if that falls under the category of playing hard to get. But it's just that there's this attitude thingy in sg girls that they really think too hihgly of themselves, for those who know who they are. But then again, like others said, it's not all of them. I am just pointing that group. Again, we're under the topic of "How a gal reacts when she knew someone is going after her?", and  i'm just giving my honest opinion. </div></blockquote>Agree ..<br>That's why I think being single is the best .. Cheers ....<br>although u will feel loney and bored, rather then being pulled into this endless game ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To bjork,<br><br>I feel your usage of harsh and crude words in your arguement is totally uncalled for. Again, playing hard to get usually equates to the girl leading a guy on. How often than not is that true? If a girl is just plain totally not interested, she can not lead the guy on in the first place. If she states it clearly in the first place, and the guy continues in his pursue, and he suffers, i wont blame the girl. It's his own freewill.<br>However, upon knowing a guy is after her, and she'snot interested, but continues to allow him to woo her for undisclosed reasons, now that's a bit too much.<br></div>

Ignore u? if she does ignore u wat will u say again. Dao? I believe its the independent choice of one if they decide to woo someone even if she give u the hints or not. Its still ur choice if she decides to reject ur advances. So dun blame them if they not interested yet allow him to continue the chase. It might be his own willingness. If u know at the first place she aint interested in you. get urself out of the game rather then waiting to be shame.</div>
