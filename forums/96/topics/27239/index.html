            <div class='col-md body'>thats why i feel that the best place to enjoy trance is at home and not in local clubs. although there would be a lack of ambiance, if you are willing to spurge on high-end sound equipment, you would not be at the mercy of dj who spins crappy stuff.<br><br>another problem is getting mp3s online. i use to d/l from audiogalaxy, they have the most entensive list of trance music found online, but due to copyrights laws, they dun offer free downloads anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> .   wat i use now is winmx and kazzaa which uses p2p system. but searching for the right tracks are a pain. even when the right track is found, it takes ages to d/l when the user is offline or pple just dun share. sometmes after downloading the tracks, they turn out to be either corrupted, or the quality sucks bigtime.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>anybody can recomend a good place for music d/ls?<br><br>it seems that storm knows his music. i respect that. we need more pple like him in singapore.  switch to trance pple!!</div>

But I gave it up after some time because I realise that it's futile. Singaporeans are generally not ready to switch to this kind of music, because they may be mindset that "trance" music is 1) techno-diu-diu-diu kind of music (alot of my friends think so) or 2) scary (because of the name, trance, like gong-tao like that.)<br><br>Right now, I only preach to those who want to listen. Ai lai, mai sua. To each his own. You like RnB (it's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes... uh uh uh uh....)? Go ahead. You like retro (call me! call me! baby call me NOW!!!)?? Go have a ball. Leave me to enjoy my trance music at home, in my car and with my fellow addicts.</div>

I read the CD cover of one of the Ministry of Sound CDs (Trance Nation 4 mixed by Ferry Corsten - 2000) :<br><br><blockquote>So what the hell is trance?<br><br>Tree-wise it's a member of the techno family of musical genres, but with its roots more firmly esconded in 70's and 80's European systhesised sounds with musical innovators such as Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Giorgio Moroder largely cited as influences.<br><br>Since its current inception as an offshoot of the European techno scene in the early 90's, remember Jam and Spoon, Dance 2 Trance and The Age of Love, trance has extended, branched out and even fused with other musical gene pools to create a whole new species of sound.</blockquote>I'm a fan of Vangelis and J-M-J, and their electronic music is probably the grand-daddy of the trance music that we know of today... Anyway the oldest "trance" song that I can think of is Children by Robert Miles. Anyone can come up with something trancey that's older than that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
