            <div class='col-md body'>Was surfing around and saw this website. Another website with those sad love story. Doing nothing and feeling bored, I decided to read it and past my time. Knowing that I myself is a weak idiotic sucker which can cry easily just by reading those touching stories or seeing those movies. Although fully prepared for it but in the ends the tap run and water roll down my cheeks from my eyes.<br><br>Once again I remember about my ex-girlfriend, those times and memories that I don understand why I am unable to let go. I keep telling myself that I am crying now cause of the story and not because of her. But deep inside me, I knew I am lying to myself cause I miss her so much so much till this day. Whenever I am with friends or people whom I just got to know, I always put on a brave front and seem to be a happy go lucky guy but yet most of times I feel so sad and wanting to cry out whenever I think of her (Guess that makes me a hypocrite). How many times I have said that I will not shed a tear again for her but yet I broke this promise every time whenever I think of her. What makes it more ironic is that we never had an argument and was going smoothly but things changed and don goes your way, which you want it.<br><br>At this moment I don even know why I am typing all this crap out and making so many people in the forum to read it (Story withheld to prevent people to know who am I and even have to register a new nick to post this crap = Timid piece of useless prick). Maybe cause I am scared that I will be laughed at or I don want people to take pity on me. Though it brings much misery after the relationship but never have I ever regretted being with her, for those times of happy fond memories and the way she changed me in my life that resulted in pros and cons (Pros taking up the bigger potion for sure).<br><br>Thanks for putting up with me for these stupid nagging and time but I guess I better stop at here and don revealed else some people might know who I am (In the first place I wondered why I even bothered to type out so much trash and rubbish). That is why I am using another nick to post this shit thing so as to cover myself. Call me a coward, weakling of whatever names but I guess that is just me I supposed.<br><br>Lastly I hope to share this website with you all which really break down my resistance of water from my eyes and remind me of my ex-girlfriend (Just like the guy crying inside the story when he receive the letter).<br><br>Treasure your other half and don abuse it cause if fate come let both of you meet and be together, there is sure to be a reason behind it and don miss it or forget about it. When it is time to regret it will be too late to turn back. Always think of the consequences before you make any decision or say anything, which might just hurt that special someone.<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/haventhink/lovestory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/haventhink/lovestory.html</a><br><br></div>

I don't see why is there a need to even change nick, etc - feeling that people may know who you are and laugh at you.<br><br>Let me tell you something - *nobody* will laugh - just that deep within you there is a gnawing inferiority hidden. You don't want people to realise this, but there is a burning urge for you to speak to someone, because this tension is unbearable. Don't you feel it very difficult when you have to mantain the so called mask - with the exchange of your dead inside? I am not saying you should tell the world about your problem and expect sympathy - you said you don't want. But from your defensive words - you are trying to let pour your woe, yet trying hard to maintain that masculine even in virtual space. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Are you being too hard with yourself? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>A guy who cries doesn't make him a wimp - provided the tears spent is worthwhile.<br><br>A guy who feel insecure doesn't makes him a coward whatsoever.<br><br>Everyone has a regret to be learned in their life - because God wants us to treasure future things that would come into our lives. I am gald that you realise and learn from your past - you have to move on. Tell people about the things that you gone through allows them to learn from you - its a good thing don't you agree? And isn't it what you are doing now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Move on... I would be to gald assist even if the world laughs at you - and I know they won't, at least most of them.

Call me a coward, weakling of whatever names but I guess that is just me I supposed.<br><br>Lastly I hope to share this website with you all which really break down my resistance of water from my eyes and remind me of my ex-girlfriend (Just like the guy crying inside the story when he receive the letter).<br><br>Treasure your other half and don abuse it cause if fate come let both of you meet and be together, there is sure to be a reason behind it and don miss it or forget about it. When it is time to regret it will be too late to turn back. Always think of the consequences before you make any decision or say anything, which might just hurt that special someone.<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/haventhink/lovestory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/haventhink/lovestory.html</a><br><br></div></blockquote>u certainly r a sentimental 1 but bro cm on brace up the world is full of green pastures, the sky alway blue look at the bright side cos u might never wat surpises r waiting 4 u with tis encounter u have gained something precious .....experienced ... isn't this is wat life abit and that the beauty of it ........... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
