But I guess in a relationship honesty is the best policy...<br><br>AiTaiYUan, some guys are honest some are not. Some girls may be insecure, and some of their bfs may give them a reason to feel insecure. It would be easy to say just leave their bfs, but you should know that many relationships are not as simple as that. Some people may have right reasons for visiting forums, but there definitely exists a certain percentage of people who do come on here to jio girls (whether they are attached or not). Well well, honesty is still the best.<br><br>Anyway this was meant for informative purposes, not to start a debate... hehe.</div>
