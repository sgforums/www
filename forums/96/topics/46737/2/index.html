I did not say that just because I think that way, that others have to think that way too. And I agree that are alot of ways of cheating, visiting forums is not cheating, but it can move on from there IF one has the intention to cheat in the first place.<br><br>And my concern wasn't about cheating. I just asked whether people would tell their partners... cos I think some people just won't tell, to save the trouble of explaining if the gf kicks up a fuss or something like that.</div>
