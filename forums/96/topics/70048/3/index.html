            <div class='col-md body'>i knew of this guy fren of mine some years back so damn unlucky. he wasn't rich nor handsome and is very quiet not much fren. but ppl like to pick on him and use him as an agenda or tool to achieve their goals. because he is hardworking and usually care less about office politics, bosses like to use him as their agenda to push other employees in the company to work faster and harder and quote the poor fren of mine as an example. as a result he is the item of jealousy and complaints within the company. there was this lady colleague (her superior) who interviewed him and as a result many other ladies in the company tried to get his attention not because they like him but because they all want to challenge each other to see who can get his attention is the winner. siao all perverts man. then the news about this guy being so 'cool' coz he never talk much spread like wild fire and whenever he take the train ppl will want to take a look at who this guy is and even take photos with their camera and mms to other until the world knows man. what a bunch or crap i bet this poor guy is more like an idol where girls want attention from (even old hags, fat hags, ugly lian hags, and bangls hags) and every other guy want to beat him in any other way deem fit. some guys went to the extend of collaborating with a kid to show the ladies in the MRT that he likes kids more than that poor fren of mine! even when he surf net got people try to monitor and track him down and in chatroom also. he always hang the t-shirt he will be wearing for the next day over his window and his neighbour and passer-by will surely report strength and the next day all wear the same color like him. what that fren of mine do all will follow. one thing is for sure girls want many things out of guys and will do anything to achieve that and guys want attention from girls and will do everything silly to chieve that too.<br><br>know what that guy fren of mine told me? he said he like his galfren and will-be wife to be full of charisma - his type of charisma, and someone who truly understands him. he wants someone commited in a relationship and someone who is not jealous of others and speaks with an open heart and without malicious thoughts.</div>
