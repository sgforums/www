            <div class='col-md body'>Read the following &amp; think for yourself. It's something I find very true. Dont ask me stupid questions again coz I'm not the author.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Singapore girls have become so materialistic that they are driving themselves into their own tombs. They want this and want that from their bf that they dun realised that they are hurting our feelings, as their bf, we ALWAYS do things to make them happy and give them what we can offer but if that is not enough, then I will tell them "take a hike". To me I dun lose out if i lose them, of course i will be hurt by what the event of breaking up. But i tried and it's still not enough then, what else can i do ? sell my soul to the devil? So many women wants their bf to have a car to drive them around, to give in to their tempers and buy things to make them happy. But I wonder when they are getting all these from us, do they ever ask themselves whether we are going thru pains to get all this "affection" for them ?<br>They want a car, but they dun even know how to top up the wiper fluid not to mention calculating the annual losses of maintaining one. They just want it. And they dun even want to get into cheapo models or vans and pickups. Sometimes, it makes me sick just to think about it.<br><br>Yes, it not wrong to ask for luxuries and comfort but if you want to be labelled as a slut or some cheap bitch who will hop into anyone bed just because he has a car, be my guest. For women who are reading this, keep this in mind, men who own big cars and give your luxuries, know that once you get into his car, you are a bitch or slut who just want to look good in a lexus or mercs. And we know how easy it is for us to bed you. And if you are not the type, we just move on and find the next one. Let me tell you, there are guys out there who know that you want things from them and they can give it to you as long as they can bed you. I know because my guy friends are them. And almost every week they pick up different "meat" (they call you that) from pubs. And when we guys sit down and talk, they will always say that there are no more good women in singapore anymore. They are just interested in money and luxuries. That's why until now they are all still single, it's not because they are playboys, they just can't find a good woman with the right principles and virtues anymore.<br><br>I personally know the type of woman that singapore has and is very disappointed. When I was driving two years back, I found that the woman whom I was going out with was not the type that you want to get married with. She was constantly asking me to be a chauffer, and when I asked to get a driving license so that she can drive herself and her friends around, she didn't want to. I was ready to pass the keys to her, then I realised that I was a fool because she was just getting everything out of me. And i decided to call it quits with her because she is not who I wan to spend my life with. I sold my car and told her that i dun intend to buy another to drive her around, and guess what ? She didn't even bother to call me again.<br><br>After that i decided to buy myself a bike, thinking that someone who is willing to sit behind me and dun mind the sun and dust should be someone who is willing to go thru thick and thin with me. And indeed I found someone, I really thght that she was the one, the one I wanted to settle down with and just when I was going to propose to her, I found that she was seeing someone else behind my back, someone who has been sending her to work and back almost everyday for the 3 mths while i was working. And she was really getting used to the comfort and the night we broke up she could tell me that she will find it hard to get used not having someone to drive her around in a car. That very moment I realised that all women are the same. They just want luxuries.<br><br>I decided to stick to my two wheels and just carry on with my own life. My ex used to ask me why dun I apply for a credit card ? I asked her in return why should i ? Call me old fashion but I dun believe in paying in credit. She just want me to flash around with all those plastic ? Does a wallet full of credit cards makes me more attractive ?? Women are just to naive and because of this, it makes them look gullible and easy to deceive.<br><br>Whenever i stop at a traffic light and I see and pretty young thing sitting next to a guy in a flashy car, I always ask myself, is she really loving him as a man or is she just in love with car and the luxuries ?<br><br>I know that flashing my wealth will only get me bitches, so I have decided to be a simple man with a simple life and try to find a woman who will love me for what I am and not what I have. My ex has recently ask me for another chance, I told her, I will think about it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by highflyer:</div><div class="quote_body">Read the following &amp; think for yourself. It's something I find very true. Dont ask me stupid questions again coz I'm not the author.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Singapore girls have become so materialistic that they are driving themselves into their own tombs. They want this and want that from their bf that they dun realised that they are hurting our feelings, as their bf, we ALWAYS do things to make them happy and give them what we can offer but if that is not enough, then I will tell them "take a hike". To me I dun lose out if i lose them, of course i will be hurt by what the event of breaking up. But i tried and it's still not enough then, what else can i do ? sell my soul to the devil? So many women wants their bf to have a car to drive them around, to give in to their tempers and buy things to make them happy. But I wonder when they are getting all these from us, do they ever ask themselves whether we are going thru pains to get all this "affection" for them ?<br>They want a car, but they dun even know how to top up the wiper fluid not to mention calculating the annual losses of maintaining one. They just want it. And they dun even want to get into cheapo models or vans and pickups. Sometimes, it makes me sick just to think about it.<br><br>Yes, it not wrong to ask for luxuries and comfort but if you want to be labelled as a slut or some cheap bitch who will hop into anyone bed just because he has a car, be my guest. For women who are reading this, keep this in mind, men who own big cars and give your luxuries, know that once you get into his car, you are a bitch or slut who just want to look good in a lexus or mercs. And we know how easy it is for us to bed you. And if you are not the type, we just move on and find the next one. Let me tell you, there are guys out there who know that you want things from them and they can give it to you as long as they can bed you. I know because my guy friends are them. And almost every week they pick up different "meat" (they call you that) from pubs. And when we guys sit down and talk, they will always say that there are no more good women in singapore anymore. They are just interested in money and luxuries. That's why until now they are all still single, it's not because they are playboys, they just can't find a good woman with the right principles and virtues anymore.<br><br>I personally know the type of woman that singapore has and is very disappointed. When I was driving two years back, I found that the woman whom I was going out with was not the type that you want to get married with. She was constantly asking me to be a chauffer, and when I asked to get a driving license so that she can drive herself and her friends around, she didn't want to. I was ready to pass the keys to her, then I realised that I was a fool because she was just getting everything out of me. And i decided to call it quits with her because she is not who I wan to spend my life with. I sold my car and told her that i dun intend to buy another to drive her around, and guess what ? She didn't even bother to call me again.<br><br>After that i decided to buy myself a bike, thinking that someone who is willing to sit behind me and dun mind the sun and dust should be someone who is willing to go thru thick and thin with me. And indeed I found someone, I really thght that she was the one, the one I wanted to settle down with and just when I was going to propose to her, I found that she was seeing someone else behind my back, someone who has been sending her to work and back almost everyday for the 3 mths while i was working. And she was really getting used to the comfort and the night we broke up she could tell me that she will find it hard to get used not having someone to drive her around in a car. That very moment I realised that all women are the same. They just want luxuries.<br><br>I decided to stick to my two wheels and just carry on with my own life. My ex used to ask me why dun I apply for a credit card ? I asked her in return why should i ? Call me old fashion but I dun believe in paying in credit. She just want me to flash around with all those plastic ? Does a wallet full of credit cards makes me more attractive ?? Women are just to naive and because of this, it makes them look gullible and easy to deceive.<br><br>Whenever i stop at a traffic light and I see and pretty young thing sitting next to a guy in a flashy car, I always ask myself, is she really loving him as a man or is she just in love with car and the luxuries ?<br><br>I know that flashing my wealth will only get me bitches, so I have decided to be a simple man with a simple life and try to find a woman who will love me for what I am and not what I have. My ex has recently ask me for another chance, I told her, I will think about it.<br></div></blockquote>I know you are not the author, but I have to say - seriously speaking: people who generalise genders as such and such (No good girls around, all guys sux, etc), basically if you people take the initiative and courage to step out of your clouded judgement and walk away - you would have long found a proper partner suitable for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>All the time, energy, effort in lingering in that thought, writing that essay, complaining to friends, debating over with strangers - ALL THESE - can be put to better usage.<br><br>The world is crazy - if you people (noticed I use 'you people' because highflyer isn't the author) simply dislike such woman - avoid them and look for your kind of women that appreciate you for WHO you are.
