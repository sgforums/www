            <div class='col-md body'>i feel that it is the majority of gals that is materialistic, but the majority of the minority of thoses who are not seems to be in this forum.... hahaa.....   anyway just to give my 2 cents view, i also have lotsa gal frds who wan to have big cars to drive them ard... one of my frds even confessed to me that her dream is to find a rich OLD man and marry him . N most of gals also tell me that they also prefer guys to have cars and rich, though they are quick to tell me that  they dun mind plp who dun have.... to me.. singaporeans gals are mostly  materialistic driven, and when they end up with the wrong guy somewhere down the road.... but who is rich and have flings  behind ur back.... u have only urself to blame................ for being too blind when ur young... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ultrapak:</div><div class="quote_body">I am so angry I only want to have a simple love and find a simple girl to love no matter in 21 century or what i think that<br>only simple and pure love would  really make one happy<br>but why singapore girls want to destroy this kind of balance their mind have become so complex that it is so difficult to love them and sayang in this end i chim sim then give up on them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> .Hei ya.All anger or wrath all comes this cycle.</div></blockquote>Difficult to love them and in the end you have to give up on them?<br><br>Since you fell in love with women that seek for materialistic comfort -could you even blame anyone. You *MADE* your *OWN* choice to love someone and since you make that decision - do not rant and label every women in the same bad light. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And how do you define 'simple?'<br><br>Woman who doesn't smoke, drink, club, cares for you and relationship, doesn't seek material comfort, works dutifully or best be house wife and take care of kids?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Hey, the lady in your class/work place seemed fit those category. Why don't you try wooing her? Ohh... I know, the chemistry isn't there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So if you need the chemistry? Strangely enough (I am 95% sure) - those women which induce the love sparkles in you doesn't really fit your required personal character score. But you do love them and forego your initial thoughts right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Summary: Don't generalise everyone - because in the end, you will be left behind while everyone is ahead of you. If you choose to chase/love a woman and she is materialistic, *improve* and *enlighten* her. If she can't improve and alter this negative traits - this shows how much you meant to her. So since its so insignificiant, TRY WOOING SOMEONE ELSE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>People always try to make others fit into themselves - which is sadly a rare occurance for a perfect slot, but you can be adaptable to this society, if thats what you want to be - we should always look into ourselves because if we are sincere and genuine - I can guarantee someone around in this world, *will* appreciate that kind of character that we have.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The more you complain and condemn, the more love wouldn't come to you. Trust me - because simply nobody fits your bill, even if there is one - she is attached, married or doesn't even like you. Widen yourself and you will be surprise from the number of potential ladies you have missed out when you were so shallow in your views.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
