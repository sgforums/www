            <div class='col-md body'>A Christian went to his favorite barber shop for his weekly haircut and beard trimming. In the course of their conversation, they touched upon the subject of God. The barber said: "Look man, I don't think that God exists as you believe."<br><br>"Why do you think that?" asked the Christian.<br><br>"Well, it's so easy; you only have to go out in the street to realize that God does not exist. If God existed, would there be so many sick people? Would there be abused or crippled children? If God existed, there would be no suffering or pain. Would there be murder or even war? I cannot imagine a loving God who would permit ANY of these things."<br><br>The Christian didn't want to enter into an argument and could think of no immediate response to the barber's logic. The barber finished his job and the Christian fellow left the shop. The moment he stepped out the door he saw a man sitting on the curb whose long hair and beard were in need of a barber's attention (It looked so long, dirty and untidy).<br><br>The Christian turned and reentered the barber shop and said to the barber: "You know what? Barbers absolutely do not exist!"<br><br>"How can you say that barbers do not exist?" exclaimed the barber. "Well, I'm here and I'm a barber. I just cut your hair!!!"<br><br>"No!" the Christian exclaimed. "Barbers do not exist; because if they did exist, there would be no people with long hair and stringy beard like that man out there in the street, sitting on the curb."<br><br>"Oh, barbers do indeed exist! What happens is that people first have to come to me. They seek me out and find me!"<br><br>"You are exactly right!"- affirmed the Christian. "That's exactly the point. God does exist, what happens is people don't go to Him and do not look for Him. That's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another barber joke:<br><br>One day, a man popped by a barber shop. Seeing that the barber was busy, he asked, "How long before I can get my hair cut?" "Two hours," the barber replied quickly. Hearing this, the man went off on the road.<br><br>A few days later, the man dropped by and asked the barber the same question again. "Two hours," the barber replied without passing a glance. The man left promptly.<br><br>This happened again and again for the next few months. Until one day, when the man got back on the road, the barber turned to his friend, "Hey Jim, follow that man and see where he's going."<br><br>An hour later, Jim came back to the barber shop, laughing. "He went to your house."</div>
