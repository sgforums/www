            <div class='col-md body'>To: MÂ©+square<br><br>I agree to what you say to a certain extent. My perception of thing are always somewhat sceptic and more reserved. I am more of a pessimist by character. I guess the most important thing my problem is timing. The time of which person came first to my life. The first person who is my very good friend and the second person my girlfriend. Fair or not i don't know. Fact remains that i know my good friend will always have a very very special place in my heart (which BOTH of them will never get to know of course).<br><br>All these thoughts actually came to me in the midst of me planning for my marriage. What i know now is that i must be fair to my girlfriend and that is the right thing to do. Irregardless of how i feel or what i want. I am not trying to be selfless but i feel that as a guy i have to be fair to everybody....<br></div>
