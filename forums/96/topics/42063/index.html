            <div class='col-md body'>aiyoh like that...<br><br>i think patience is the right thing to do. TECHNICALLY, you shouldn't be the reason why she breaks off (if she eventually does) with this "bad" bf of hers. but of course life isn't that simple, no matter wat, u'll be involved.<br><br>i guess i'll urge you both to try to work things out seperately. your reln with her and her reln with her bf are two seperate issues (in theory). she has problems with her bf, let her solve them TRYING not to put u in the picture. in other words, she should be trying not to compare the two of u, if her bf is bad then he's bad, NOT that he's worse than u. see wat i'm getting at?<br><br>on ur part, well, as a friend u can support her, but the thin line is hard to discern. you obviously do want to take care of her and love her, yet for now u can't influence her in such a way that causes her to leave her bf to come to u. hence, no "i'm a better guy why not gimme a chance" statements from u is wat i recommend.<br><br>in such situations, and many others in life, we sometimes have to really pull ourselves away from acting upon emotions. self-control and logical thinking seems to take a back seat when passion and infatuation set in. try not to fall into this trap.<br><br>take care~~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
