            <div class='col-md body'>This topic was very hot in the Kopitiam Forum.. i added my views...<br>basically MLM is hyped up to be like the next BIG THING but then it is just another mode  of distribution of products. For example, milk are distributed by retail stores, insurance are distributed by personal selling by the agents, so these MLM people are just DISTRIBUTORs of these products, they are merely salesmen. Difference? Is that they make it sound like as though u OWN the business. Bull. IF Astral Mag or  Asayo or Nuskin or watever goes  bankrupt, DO U STILL HAVE A  BUSINESS?? NO. So i guess you can call MLM people Glorified Salesmen. Having talk so much, a salesman is still a decent  mode of earning a living. The irritating and the bane of these MLM is the way they go about pushing their business.  They ask u come down to places to give u a 1 hr talk and they are very pushy. You cannot criticise them, they get defensive, like a cult sia.  They keep calling u and telling u how u can get rich when the fact is that only 5% of MLM people succeeded.  Like any sales job, its hard work i dun deny, but if such AGRESSIVE tactics are  used, sadly  i would say, MLM is not gonna survive  long.  The worst thing i ever heard them say, maybe i am a marketing person, thats why i am very sensitive to such things, they said  to me "I am not interested in selling things, i just wanna improve your life." Ya sure, but how? Buy their products. or they say "its ok u dun wanna buy, i just wan u to understand our business concept, then maybe you will see  how good it is and then can join us." Bull. Not interested in selling? So if everyone just joins them but no one buys anything, what they survive on? NOT interested in selling? worst nonsense and worst  attempt at trying to con the consumers.  As much as advertising and marketing is trying to present value to the consumers, i find what most MLM tell me is the lamest way of doing it. To MLM people, we got  brains, you sure  you got yours?</div>

But thats it! you think people change matress like change clothes? My house matress haven change for 5 years! and somemore yours is a $1600 scientifically-haven-proven-magnetic-dun-noe-what-healing matress, you think people really so rich ah change every month.
