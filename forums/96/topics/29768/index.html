            <div class='col-md body'>Women: Look, Listen and Take Heed.<br><br>Have dinner ready. Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a<br>delicious meal ready on time for his return. This is a way of letting<br>him know that you have been thinking about him and are concerned about<br>his needs.<br><br>Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospect of a good meal<br>(especially his favourite dish) is part of the warm welcome needed.<br><br>Prepare yourself: Take 15 minutes to rest so you'll be refreshed when<br>he arrives. Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair and be<br>fresh-looking. He has just been with a lot of work weary people.<br><br>Be a little gay and a little more interesting for him. His boring day<br>may need a lift and one of your duties is to provide it. Clear away<br>the clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of the house<br>just before<br><br>your husband arrives. Gather up schoolbooks, toys, paper etc. and<br>then run a dust cloth over the tables.<br><br>Over the cooler months of the year you should prepare and light a<br>fire for him to unwind by. Your husband will feel he has reached a<br>haven of rest and order, and it will give you a lift too. After all,<br>catering for his comfort will provide you with immense personal<br>satisfaction.<br><br>Prepare the children, take a few minutes to wash their hands and faces<br>(if they are small), comb their hair, and if necessary, change their<br>clothes. They are little treasures and he would like to see them<br>playing the part.<br><br>Minimise all noise. At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise<br>from the washer, dryer, and vacuum. Try to encourage the children to<br>be quiet. Be happy to see him.<br><br>Greet him with a warm smile and show sincerity in your desire to see<br>him. Listen to him. You may have a dozen important things to tell him,<br>but the moment of his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first -<br>REMEMBER, HIS TOPICS OF CONVERSATION ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURS.<br><br>Make the evening his. Never complain if he comes home late or goes out<br>to dinner or other places of entertainment without you. Instead try<br>to understand his world of strain and pressure, and his very real need<br>to be at home and relax.<br><br>Your goal. Try to make sure your home is a place of peace, order and<br>tranquility where your husband can renew himself in body and spirit.<br>Don't greet him with complaints and problems. Don't complain if he's<br>late for dinner or even if he stays out all night. Count this as minor<br>compared to what he might have gone through that day.<br><br>Make him comfortable. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or have<br>him lie down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink ready for him.<br>Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in a low<br>soothing and pleasant voice. Don't ask him questions about his actions<br>or question his judgement or integrity.<br><br>Remember, he is the master of the house and as such will always<br>exercise his will with fairness and truthfulness. You have no right to<br>question him.<br><br>A good wife always knows her place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no i find many butches hypocritical. they claim they hate guys becoz of their ego/actions/behaviours etc etc, and yet they try to pass themselves off as one. i've ever seen an arguement where a butch was called ger, and the fucker die die wanna argue that she is a boy, not a ger, it was a very heated debate, to be put nicely.<br><br>and the thing about gays.<br>a guy being effiminate is a guy being effiminate is a guy being effiminate. BUT, a guy claiming he's a real lady and "it's natural". that's just disgusting. real women are not borned to behave watever way they behave, they were brainwashed by society to. you don't learn to clamp your knees shut from birth, nor do you walk around chest up butt out, keeping your elbows close to you, doing the cat walk, bat your eyelashes, pout, etc etc.<br><br>real ladies have dignity. even prostitues have their pride as a woman to dress appropriately in public, they get fucked for money because they have no other alternative. transvestites run around taking off their clothes, screwing every man they can find. that is not dignity. that is not being a woman. that is being a man with a sick horny demented mind trying to live a fantasy.<br><br>to claim that they are born as a woman in a man's body, and that they act the way they do is because they are born that way. that is 110% utter bullshit.<br><br>they are wat they are because they choose to be. no excuses.<br>just because you lock a man in a room full of monkies does not make him a monkey.<br><br>and then there's the age old arguement about thinking out of the box. how the fuck is homosexuality thinking out of the box? in wat way is shoving a dick in another guy's ass creative? how is open-mindedness and liberalism related to such perverse acts?<br><br>being open-minded is to accept new ideas, different methods of implementation, to be willing to accept a new culture. but it does not mean yesterday's morales become tomorrow's legends.<br><br>pitiful is someone who is forced into a circumstance. homosexuality is a choice of life. it is by no way pitiful. no one is forcing them to screw each other except themselves. using pitiful on them is throwing insult at people who are truly pitiful.<br><br>truly pitiful people do not want pity or sympathy. they only want a chance to change their lives.</div>

As you had said, they may be pitiful but i dun think they are as pitiful as the African refugees. And i dun care much abt the refugees though(haha, may seem cold-hearted here).<br>1. They may have suffered some emotional pain before but i don't thnk that's the reason for them to change their whole outlook into 'guys'. I mean if they were deeply hurt in a r/s b4, they wun even enter a r/s, needless to say one with a gal. Gals do dumped guys also, they are not tt much diff from guys..<br>2. Yap, they know what a gal wants therfore some gals will choose them. Yah, it's true but the gals being 'targetted' are always chio, nice personality, good background. Then sometimes when they r sick of the gals, they break up. Although there dun seem to hvae much of a happy ending, the gals will still treat them as a long time partner. Thus, when they breakup, these gals also was emotionaly hurt, and they either refrain fr r/s or become a butch themseves. So wher does that leaves us guyS??<br>In Short, i dun like them.</div>
