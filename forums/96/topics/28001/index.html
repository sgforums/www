            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Straits Times JAN 6, Life! Section<br>Singapore women fierce? So what?<br><br>Sumiko Tan<br><br>Singapore women are too argumentative, say some Singapore men. So would there be fewer single women if we were more gentle and accommodating?<br><br>'I'M so tired of Singapore women,' a male friend lamented the other day.<br><br>'Why can't they stop arguing? And must they always ask so many questions?'<br><br>The way he sees it, Singapore women - especially those who are well educated - have become 'hard'.<br><br>They should learn to be more feminine, more accommodating and, yes, less career-driven, he said. If they are career-minded, they should choose mates who are not, so that the men can play house-husbands. But then, career women obviously don't want losers.<br><br>'Two highly-stressed spouses can't add up to a peaceful home, with children well brought up,' he said.<br><br>My friend is a Singaporean in his early 50s. Although he has had his fair share of girlfriends - mostly Singaporean - he has never married.<br><br>Recently, he began dating women from China. Clearly, they have made a big, and positive, impression on him.<br><br>One, in particular, is not only young, but also 'stunning', gentle-mannered and plays a mean guzheng.<br><br>She can not only read the Chinese calligraphy scrolls in his apartment, but also provide the context and stories behind the poems, whereas we Singapore girls burst into giggles trying to decipher the scrawls. And she's not a university graduate.<br><br>Women from Malaysia, especially those from Sabah and Sarawak, my friend observed, also out-score Singapore women in the feminine/gentleness stakes.<br><br>They are also content to be housewives, tending to the kids while their Singaporean husbands work. And when the men come home, these women will not bombard them with 101 questions about their day.<br><br>He is not the only Singapore male to make this observation.<br><br>Recently, Xiewen, who writes the fortnightly He*Mail column in Life!, spoke of 'very attractive Malaysian girls' who would 'hold their partners' arms over dinner and feed them. And look so totally contented'.<br><br>He also related how a friend had this to say of Singapore and Chinese women: 'Singapore women are no match for their Chinese counterparts because the latter know how to be feminine without being fawningly subservient, do take care of their male friends' feelings and are not out to put them down as if they need to prove something.<br><br>'A Chinese girlfriend will, without asking, peel prawns for you at dinner without even being self-conscious about it. She will not regard it as lowering herself, or pandering to the male chauvinist ego.'<br><br>And, these men insist, these foreign women are not putting on an act to entrap Singapore men for their money.<br><br>The columnist spoke of attractive, financially-independent, professional Malaysian, Filipino and Japanese women who know how to pamper their Singaporean male friends.<br><br>The column triggered a response from a Singapore male reader who wrote in to Life! complaining about how 'local women don't cut it'.<br><br>He even gave his rating of women in Asia: 'Malaysian gals are friendly and down-to-earth. Thai gals have grace and are charming and caring. Filipino gals have talent and are devoted. Indonesian gals are also charming and musically talented. Japanese gals have grace and spunk. Vietnamese gals are also graceful and devoted.<br><br>'And Singapore gals? Only look good on the outside because they'd use a tonne of make-up which gets washed off in the rain.'<br><br>Well, well, well.<br><br>I HAVEN'T had much dealings with women from other Asian countries, and so I wouldn't dare pass judgement on them.<br><br>But, yes, the Singapore woman - especially if she is better educated - is a confident and assertive creature.<br><br>She is pragmatic and, hence, materialistic. (Money talks, right? Both Singapore women and men know that).<br><br>She is articulate (well, more so than the Singapore man) and will fight to defend herself and her loved ones.<br><br>She goes out to work and tries to excel in her career because (a) it is expected of her; and (b) the money she brings home makes life easier, for herself and those she loves.<br><br>She is frank and has no time for mind games, making her, in fact, naive at times. There is little pretence and guile. What you see is what you get.<br><br>She is also a product shaped by her society.<br><br>Singapore is small, cosmopolitan and competitive. There are no fields or farms where uneducated women are relegated to toil in.<br><br>Instead, much stress is placed on education - for both sexes - because every pair of hands counts in the urban workplace.<br><br>In school, girls are encouraged to go all out and compete with boys (think Raffles Girls School vs Raffles Institution). There is open competition, and open ranking.<br><br>When they go out to work, women are judged by the same standards as men. In fact, one of Singapore's earliest female role models is Mrs Lee Kuan Yew, the wife of the Senior Minister, who has proven to be a successful lawyer.<br><br>And because homes and cars are so expensive, women have to work - and work hard - if they (and their husbands and families when they get married) want to enjoy the finer things in life.<br><br>Can you blame us, then, if we tend to be businesslike and are uncomfortable with displaying more feminine traits like flirting, or feminine skills like prawn-peeling?<br><br>I, for one, can't see myself peeling prawns for anyone at a public meal, except perhaps my niece, who's small and helpless.<br><br>I mean, why does a man need a woman to do that for him if he can do it himself? Unless he is out to prove to others around him that he has control over her, that she is 'his woman'?<br><br>And why would a woman want to peel prawns for an able-bodied man unless she wants to make a show that he belongs to her?<br><br>Either way, the mind games being played here turn me off.<br><br>It's another matter if the prawn-peeling is done in the privacy of the home, of course, for couples do share all kinds of intimate displays of affection, be it the woman putting on the man's socks or the man fetching her a cup of tea or the newspaper.<br><br>So, yes, the Singapore woman may not be the most charming and flirtatious of women, and she may not always make her man feel good.<br><br>Still, if you think about it, Singapore women show they care for their men by going out to work and helping to bring home the bacon, and often a large slice of it, too.<br><br>And when they are upfront about their feelings, they are actually showing respect for their men, for they are being honest. They are not treating men as idiots by trying to fool them through saying one thing and meaning another.<br><br>Now, if this isn't good enough for Singapore men, can you blame some Singapore women for turning to foreign men who can appreciate them for what they are<br></div>
