            <div class='col-md body'>just seeking a bona fide potential relationship , not fooling around, though i have a decent youthful pleasant look , i am not looking for a gal with  a  decent innocent  face a mummy gal look , i am looking more a woman with personality feminine as well as  some kind of   sensuality about her   in her who is able to be confident of her dressing  who has male friends, i can accept if she has male friends but not more than that ,however if she has problems issues, i would prefer if she share it with a close female friend but it its a guy  childhood platonic friedn is ok   or issues with me to talk things, i can talk about feelings emotions strenghts and weaknesses,<br>i can accept if she has male friends but in a relationship there is commitment, so if a gal were to come to ask me whethe ri am involved , if i am i will say yes ,the same goes for the gal and if a guy wants more than friends and ask for her number she should know how to handle the issue  well just want to be fair and square.</div>
