If you like a girl, suan her only when you are alone so that she can suan you back, this can be fun. As for me, i only suan a girl when i find her not to my liking. No hiding my true feelings.<br><br>As for your case, the solution is very simple. Do you like this girl, or do you even want to give yourself a chance to get to know her? If any of the above answer is 'yes', then you should go ahead with it, but be ready to face rejection if it should happen. If you really have no feelings of any kind for her, then there is no need for you to do anything. Just get on with your life and accept her actions for what they are. But from your words, i guess you must have some feelings for her, else you would not even bother to bring out this incident.<br><br>Good luck. </div></blockquote>hee....i tot if u like some1 will automatically suan tt person..esp in public?hee....<br>yah i guess if u dun hv any feelings at all 2wards her..then juz 4get it..she'll realize tat shez had e wrong idea bt u in time... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
