I practise non-interference, unless they step on me first (and many of them have).<br><br>Everyone has their own preferences and fetishes.....this, we have no right to judge them on.  However, when they openly discriminate against me, I get pissed off.  I've faced this kind of discrimination by SPGs in the air and on the ground here.<br><br>I wish there was a way for us to unite and ostracise such people.  Make life unbearable for them.  But it seems that some local guys are so girl-crazy that they've even criticised me for critising SPGs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, its not dat western men are more attractive, richer, fitter or whatever, its just the general thinking from OUR girls dat these guys are better... And even though, the women here have also said that guys here are not persistant enough... Personally, you would even think of asking twice after being told 'no' ending up its like harrassment. So, WTF does these girls want? And one more noted thing is that the foreign men, asians, often say, 'i'd never date a s'porean gal, noe why? simply cos <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span>, of them are extreamly materialistic...' and being a s'porean that has been working/studying abroad for a period of time, i'd might have to agree with these guys... 'i will never date a s'porean gal, unless... her thinking is more open', which as most other people would agree acceptable. and or the record, the less local they were, the better it'll be.<br><br>Ray<br>raynardll@gmail.com<br><br>p.s.  when i was in brunei, i noticed the same thing, <strong>white</strong> men, are getting the more attractive ladies of the community. and that the women were infulenced by the men into feeling 'comfortable' in skimpy outfits. however, noting the leniency of the brunei law, the local gangsters took it into their own hands. and you can imagine what happened... soon americans and the brits were getting trashed on the streets...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting topic. Being 'ang mo' myself I hope you don't mind if i share a few thoughts on the matter. Now before anyone decides to bite my head off, let me say that this is what i have been told by  Singapore ladies on a number of occassions.............. it comes down to, manners, conversational technique and more open mindedness. I can almost hear the knives being sharpened in the background as I type! For some odd reason, the ladies here seem to think of Singapore men being ill mannered in their presence, lacking in anything interesting to say and less open in their thinking. Let me say that I find this  very strange because most of the expats I know basically only like to show off and make total fools of themselves in public! Go figure huh. Oh well, there you have it chaps. My conclusions on the matter are thay the local guys are safe and should have no problem with the fairer sex in Singapore or elsewhere for that matter.

Perhaps I should add that the men I have met are through dealings at work. The occasional 'ang mo' may be alittle touchy-feely or come up too close to you while in conversation but when you move away, they back down. Local men, however, tend to be more pushy.<br><br>But I have seen the other type of expat outside of the office environment and they are major turn offs. Perhaps it's because certain places are well known "pick up joints" with skimpily clad Asian girls out in prongs and proper behaviour just flies out the window for everyone. I don't think anyone - caucasian, local or otherwise - cares what's coming out of either parties mouths because the purpose is clear. It would be silly to go to these places to look for masses of nice local women to marry and all the sillier to base observations on how Singapore girls prefer westerners on these night spots.<br><br>That said, I don't feel these skimpily clad, 'ang-mo' hungry women are a huge, worrying percentage. And it can't be that the women I know are a small, dying breed. We prefer our local Asian men, despite their being slightly less polished, despite their idiocyncracies, because it's a part of their charm and something the 'ang mos' will never have.<br><br>No offence intended, pinksnorkel2000 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>BTW, what's "cmi"?</div>
