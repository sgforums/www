If u love him 4 a particular reason, then it is not true love. U love a person because he/she is who he/she is, not because of something he/she posesses (be it of material or character base). That is, if you can say "I love u because u r who u r" instead of "I love u because u r caring, kind etc.", then i believe that your feelings can be termed <strong>true</strong> love. Ask yourself if u can accept him for who he is, for what he is. If u can accept him the way he is, then ask yourself if you love him for who he is. Be honest with yourself.

His ego and possessiveness. However what do you mean by *everything*? You mean theres more? Which brings me to the next point.<br><br>Barring the above factors, would you still go back to him?<br><br>Have you ever made known to him about his possesiveness? Is he aware of it? Have you spoken your true feelings on this? Or it just erupts into quarrels the moment this matter is brought up? Has there been any steps taken to minimise this?<br><br>Could YOU be partly to blame for it? You are more outgoing, more GUY friends? Stuff like that.<br><br>Possesiveness is also a form of love, although in a bad way, like negative reinforcement.<br><br>If you have feelings for him, you should go back to him, but 1st you guys should trash things out, and come out with exactly why you people did not make it in the 1st place and how to resolve it.<br><br>Tell him your needs, fears and give him your assurance. Similiarly, ask the same of him. And stick to it this time.<br><br>I am going against most of what people have proposed, as I believe you should trust your heart in these issues sometimes. Unless of course that guy isnt worth it. (which we do not know yet)<br><br>As for that dark guy...unless you can really banish all feelings of love for your ex, you will never be able to truely love this dark guy<br><br>Keep us updated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>peppermint does have a point, esp about sometimes just follow ur heart... however we all know too well that the heart is the cause of illogical and irrational diecision making. the heart is definitely where love and care and kindness and all the good things come from, but when shaken it is a poor defender.<br><br>this is where our logical brains come in to counter attack for our hearts. often time, this counter attack is made weak yet again by the very very very strong emotions from the heart. sometimes we have to let our brain take over and let it decide. and worse still.. sometimes try as we may, our brain can never take full control.. i guess that's where our frens and family come in to push us along.<br><br>well either way we are all hoping that things work out for the best.. if u refer to my other posts (can't remember where) i mention that no matter how failed any reln (or anything in life for that matter!) it is imperative that we learn from it, to make us better pple. those that make mistakes aren't failures, but rather those that refuse to learn from them.</div>
