She thought that i was 14 but i was 12 yrs old then. Was quite embarrassed by her comments..coz it was a big difference then, being a primary school kid and a teenager(coz i probably looked more mature and knew MORE things than my peers) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Anyway back to the topic, 'the sillyest thing'..<br>To be a monk, to evote myself to contemplation and prayer.
