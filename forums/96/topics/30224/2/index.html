            <div class='col-md body'>The stupidest thing I have ever done for a guy... is to waste so much time on him, even after knowing that he will not change no matter what I do.<br><br>There was once this guy I liked very much. It's not the normal like-like... But I guess, what you would call, LOVE. Even though we did not spend alot of time together, as in, just the two of us, we went through alot of difficulties (spiritually just the two of us). That's because we were once in the same group for some project, for two years. In that two years we worked together, he made alot of mistakes in life and was punished several times. He never seemed to learn, and always seemed to drop crocodile tears whenever he got into trouble and was reprimanded.<br><br>But I never stopped caring about him. I guess that's because he was like a light in a dark tunnel to me. Among all the people around me, he was the only who would lend a listening ear to me whenever I ran into problems. But come to think of it now, I wonder if he ever really listened. But I got quite a bit of consolation from him.<br><br>Then there was once everyone around me was speculating if the girl he liked was me... And then that was when I realized my feelings for him...<br><br>Even after we separated after the project ended, I never stopped to be concerned about him.<br><br>Then one day, when I heard that he ran into some huge problem again, I wanted to ask him out but was too shy. So I asked another friend along. I SMSed that guy to ask if he wanted to come, and he never replied. Wah lau, it's damn rude lor. If somebody asks you something, and you don't want it, at least tell the person you don't want it right??<br><br>Aiyah, anyway, I think it's never worth it to do anything for any guys unless they are really nice to you. Even if you love a guy with all your heart and he doesn't give a damn about you, what you should do is kick his ass and slap his face. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> We women can be independent right?
