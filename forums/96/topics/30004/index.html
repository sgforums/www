            <div class='col-md body'>i'm in contact with all of them except the most recent one. and yeah she wanted to be frens. i didn't decline verbally but i guess i did in actions.<br><br>anyway she's overseas so there's not much to contact. when/if she comes back then say lor. it's been over a year liow. let bygones be bygones and we can always catch up and "fu yan" each other. i wouldn't mind spending a few dollars to buy her coffee.<br><br>as for REALLY being frens.. i guess none of my exes are GOOD frens. on good terms yes, but not all.<br><br>i feel it's hard to be frens after a break-up, especially a tough, NON mutually consenting break-up. but after a while (long long while) it should be ok.. but as for bosom buddies kind of frens, i haven't experienced it. i'm not saying it's impossible, i'm saying it hasn't happened to me.</div>

Breaking up must also be gentlemanlike, even though i know it's impossible...After some time, the feeling will nvr be the same again, &amp;very  mild chances of getting back. But if she's still contacting you even having a new bf now, what shes doing is just trying to forget u &amp; let go the feelings slowing, at the same time boast ( &amp; all the comparing) is to make u jealous..telling you that she already found someone new but u have not..or u r still single but i've found someone better than u..<br>Hey ,so wise up man, all these things are simple &amp; u should interpret &amp; make sense of it .. dont get fooled</div>
