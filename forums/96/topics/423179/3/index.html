              <p>There was a similar case recently what, and no, not all such cases benefit the woman.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was one particular case around 2 years ago about this 32 year female teacher, being charged for having sex with a 16 year old boy, isnt it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She had sex with him on 6 different occassions, in some chalet or something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then later she wanted to break up with him, but he refused and threatened to hurt her. She reported this to a fellow colleague who went to report this to the authorities. What a sabo king man. Thats a best colleague loh, can give him Backstabber of the Year award. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here, the authorities instead of protecting the lady here who was genuinely threatened, she was instead charged for having sex with a minor, not for raping him leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But here is a screwed up system we got lah, the lady gets threatened, yet does not get protected, instead goes to jail for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the boy is not a willing party, how would he have done it with her so many times?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The boy gets to enjoy the sex and doesnt have to suffer any consequences, what the hell loh ..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come to think of it, i quite envy this boy loh =P</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, i have quite boyish looks myself, sometimes i find middle aged ladies looking at me. Eh please, i not talking abt ugly ones hor. Those er xin ones i dun want to think abt it. I still want to keep my appetite ok?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So sometimes i will fantasise a bit, wah if i can be like that boy horrrr ...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You'll have to define rape. There are plenty of cases in SG of a bigger girl anally-penetrating a smaller boy with a foreign object against his will. Do you define this "rape"?</p>
              <p>Usually girls who sodomize boys have the assistance of grown men to help them rape the boys.</p>
              <p>In SG, child molestation is prosecuted only if it is male-to-female. Male-on-male child sex abuse is never prosecuted and is often supported by the culture -- no offense.</p>
              <p>Girls also develop faster than boys. Normally at the ages of 10 to 13, girls tend to be bigger and stronger than boys of the same age. Such a girl is also likely to sexually-abuse a boy around her age and cause him serious injury with the help of bigger men -- even if the boy does not provoke her.</p>
              <p>It's not just girls who are culpable but also the adult men who encourage these girls to brutalize boys.</p>
              <p>It is common in SG schools for male teachers to sexually-molest a boy as a disciplinary measure or simply for the pleasure of ruining the child's life.</p>

              Girls should rape boys because it is a place of attraction for multifacet goodness. In view of their wisdom and good breed of graciousness, they should merge and bring forth their grace and wisdom for a better hybrid of society on love, joys and compassion. May I wish Singapore and all female rapists of Singapore - Happy Birthday - a young nation that stands by its policy of accomodative for a multiracial, multilingual, multi-economic on the basis of love, compassion and biased rape laws.

              <p>If a woman is being raped by a man, the sperm will be injected

              Fallopian tube and find the egg there and fuse with it but it will
              die within 48 hrs if not fused, they can check out whether she was

              also serves as evidence to trace out the rapist.</p>
              <pre>But if man/boy got raped by women/girls, they are helpless and cannot do anything like reporting it. If the boy/man report it to the police is futile as the girl can defend herself by saying that is she who was being raped .

              <p>Ok. What would happen in SG if a 16-year-old boy molests a 6-year-old boy in a public place? Let's say the 16-year-old thinks no one is looking and acts on his perversity but a group of people DO catch him in the act. What will they do? If the 16-year-old boy goes to prison and the inmates find out he is for molesting a 6-year-old boy, will they single him out for abuse?</p>
