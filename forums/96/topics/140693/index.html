            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, this forum rocks. It is really interesting to read and quite different to many other forums I have read.<br><br>Anyway I would be interested how sggirls think about man from europe and what the general opinion about these people is. Are there any special nicknames for these kind of western people? Are western people known to be very outgoing or for some other character attribute?<br><br>Just tell me how western man are perceived in singapore.<br><br>Thanx!<br><br>P.S. if anyone knows a good topic for a documentary about something in singapore let me know. at the moment i think about making a documentation about ah beng and ah lians or something like that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I guess there's cultureal differences that can account of the behaviour differences.  The environment here and the scenery is vastly different therefore, the pictures you see are different.  In the art forms of the west, you see a lot more vibrant colors, a lot more people, expression and such. In eastern arts, its mostly more on plants, people in their daily lives, abstracts, colors are subdued.<br>One thing about west and east is the cultural context and the level of communication and little things.. ie the subtle way eastern people do things or communicate.  But I know singaporeans are losing their heritage, values and culture with Mc-culture.<br>I had a old (literally) friend in Munich, and he takes photos too. I recall back then his pictures were put up in the Post Office. I think he's still taking pictures and he owe me one...<br><br>Photodocumentary...  Is there such a thing as good or no good?<br>Its just is. Start one with your pics ...  Perhaps there's a theme or some common threads of the pictures. But its just your personal expression to capture the pictures in that instant and present in the manner you see most fitting.<br><br>Anyways, some of the members post pictures and update us on their locations<br></div>
