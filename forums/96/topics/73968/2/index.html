            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kawa:</div><div class="quote_body">My girlfriend also dont like me to jack myself. She thinks that its a pervertic act.<br>However, she do like me to masturbate her. She feels very "song" aka terrific sexual sensation. Indeed, this is also a before-sex warm up., which will make her "watery" down there.  She feels that gys who jack themselves are akin to gays who play with each other (sodomy). But she wouldnt mind if it's a girl who masturbate the guy, which the gal must be her and the guy is me.<br><br>She said that UFM 100.3 "sex in the air" mention that guys like you should sit down and talk with the girl to understand more about her feelings. And that this kind of thing cannot be forced. Sometimes, i do feel the urge.... So I take the pressure off by looking at SGgirls website and sg forum to laugh off at the weird threads and funny response.<br><br>There was once that i was really "sexually excited" at night while asleep. i dreamt of a beautiful girl on top of me, and at that moment, made me had a wet dream! It was then that I truly knew what is "wet dream", spontantenous ejaculation without any physical motion. That was the one and only I had till now. I guessed it's because I was sexually derived for more than 4 weeks.<br><br>Hence, you may try to have wet dream instead loh! This is a loop hole, right?<br><br>About the thing that your girl dont like you to do her too, maybe it's because she is conservative, and that in her mind, she feels that this is not morally right and against nature. Catholics preach no masturbation as it is not "procreation". But I ask myself this question: Why do the beings in the animal kingdom masturbate? I.e. Dogs mount onto the legs of girls or even male owners to "rub" their parts, my chinchilla use its mouth to "tug" and "pull" it's erected penis, dolphins "rub" onto surfaces of "i cant remember what" to satisfy their desire. WHY WHY WHY then is it against nature? Animals dont have religion, dont have laws, and that they only have this needs: Eat, Sleep, Forage, Play, Procreation, Sex!!!!<br><br>Conclusion: Masturbation is good! and it's not wrong lest you urself feels that it's wrong! Gals, if you dont want him to do it, help him do it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  wah ......<br><br>/clap hands</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think masturbation is a normal thing to do. All guys masturbate. It's not perverted, just a way of letting off steam. Just because u dun understand doesn't mean masturbation is perverted. Guys n gals are different, physically and hormonally. We have different needs. We find masturbation enjoyable but that doesn't make us perverts or lose interest in sex. Sometimes we do it becos it's more convenient than to engage in sex as sometimes our partners may not want it.<br><br>Men cannot understand women when it comes to shopping, like buying shoes or bags when they have enough to set up a shop. But we dun call them perverts rite? It's just that we dun understand them but we realise that ladies have such a need. So pls understand that men who masturbates are not perverts. Unless he stares at men photos and jerks off.....then maybe u should get worried.<br><br>Any man who denies that he masturbates has no self confidence. We all do, I can assure u ladies. Even if by now u still think masturbation is perverted, u can't help it but still love men rite?</div>

How to have a healthy relationship when you can't trust each other!?!?<br><br>Haiyo.. and speaking out for religion: Masturbation is bad not because of what you do. But what you think. When you masturbate, you are lusting after a girl(or a guy) and that is unhealthy.<br><br>Do you know why you guys keep feeling pressure building up when you don't masturbate? Because you keep thinking about it, because you have gotten used to the sexual pleasure involved.. Lemme ask u this, what is the difference in withdrawal symptoms between drugs and masturbation? None, admit that you have cravings and yearnings for masturbation after you've stopped for a few days.<br><br>Try to involve yourself in vigorous activities that leave you too tired to masturbate, or have accountability with your partner. Then, you'll either forget about it after awhile and your conscience will help you stay on the right track. Seriously, I know you all are supporting it because it is something you love and can't bear to have torn down, but think about it... Is sex for you to enjoy? Or issit to create more children for God.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Your body was created by God and belongs to Him. Does your soul belong to him too?</div>

So...you had to masturbate with her in your mind, but you felt guilty and have to confess to her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
