            <div class='col-md body'>My girlfriend also dont like me to jack myself. She thinks that its a pervertic act.<br>However, she do like me to masturbate her. She feels very "song" aka terrific sexual sensation. Indeed, this is also a before-sex warm up., which will make her "watery" down there.  She feels that gys who jack themselves are akin to gays who play with each other (sodomy). But she wouldnt mind if it's a girl who masturbate the guy, which the gal must be her and the guy is me.<br><br>She said that UFM 100.3 "sex in the air" mention that guys like you should sit down and talk with the girl to understand more about her feelings. And that this kind of thing cannot be forced. Sometimes, i do feel the urge.... So I take the pressure off by looking at SGgirls website and sg forum to laugh off at the weird threads and funny response.<br><br>There was once that i was really "sexually excited" at night while asleep. i dreamt of a beautiful girl on top of me, and at that moment, made me had a wet dream! It was then that I truly knew what is "wet dream", spontantenous ejaculation without any physical motion. That was the one and only I had till now. I guessed it's because I was sexually derived for more than 4 weeks.<br><br>Hence, you may try to have wet dream instead loh! This is a loop hole, right?<br><br>About the thing that your girl dont like you to do her too, maybe it's because she is conservative, and that in her mind, she feels that this is not morally right and against nature. Catholics preach no masturbation as it is not "procreation". But I ask myself this question: Why do the beings in the animal kingdom masturbate? I.e. Dogs mount onto the legs of girls or even male owners to "rub" their parts, my chinchilla use its mouth to "tug" and "pull" it's erected penis, dolphins "rub" onto surfaces of "i cant remember what" to satisfy their desire. WHY WHY WHY then is it against nature? Animals dont have religion, dont have laws, and that they only have this needs: Eat, Sleep, Forage, Play, Procreation, Sex!!!!<br><br>Conclusion: Masturbation is good! and it's not wrong lest you urself feels that it's wrong!

She thinks that its a pervertic act.<br>However, she do like me to masturbate her. She feels very "song" aka terrific sexual sensation. Indeed, this is also a before-sex warm up., which will make her "watery" down there.  She feels that gys who jack themselves are akin to gays who play with each other (sodomy). But she wouldnt mind if it's a girl who masturbate the guy, which the gal must be her and the guy is me.<br><br>She said that UFM 100.3 "sex in the air" mention that guys like you should sit down and talk with the girl to understand more about her feelings. And that this kind of thing cannot be forced. Sometimes, i do feel the urge.... <span style="color: red;">So I take the pressure off by looking at SGgirls website </span>and sg forum to laugh off at the weird threads and funny response.<br><br></div></blockquote>My hubby does tat too... N i definitely dun like... Makes mi feel tat he's a despo or pervert... Imagine him makin love wif mi, but his mind is tinkin of all e big breasts in sggirls... Sux!</div>
