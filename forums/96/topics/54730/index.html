            <div class='col-md body'>Hi pple~~<br>Jus recieved an e-mail regarding a fraud~~!! be careful~~!<br><br>***********************************************************************************<br><br>"Elma Yeo wrote:<br>IÂ’m here just to share my bad experiences with you all and advised you to be extremely careful.<br><br>This company is actually called DW Group (Biomagnetism) Pte Ltd. When I was first approach by them to do a survey about half a year ago, I was told that they are selling things like biomagnetic mattress and pillow. At first I was not very convinces because I think, how to sell things that cost a few hundreds and a couple of thousands of dollars. Can you imagine their<br>mattress along cost $800++?<br><br>And so they invited me to their briefing and interview. After the<br>briefing, I was fascinated by the benefits of the products and I was promised that IÂ’ll earn quite an amount of commission because the selling of the products is shared by profit sharing. I realize that the product can really help people. At that time, all I wanted is to let everyone know about this wonderful product and also earn some big bucks for myself.<br><br>I then join them under a probation trainee. At first, I went to almost all my relativesÂ’ places to promote. Since my family and my relatives are very close, theyÂ’re willing to fork out the money to buy from me without a second thought. My parents also help to buy a few also. From there, as IÂ’m able to hit over my quota, I was promoted to an A.E. (Associate Executive) in just a month time.<br><br>As things are getting splendid for me, nightmares come. One day, my elder uncle dashed into my house and throws the mattress at me. He shouted that there are problems with the stuff. So I take a look and saw he actually cut a hole into the mattress and there is a thin sheet of metal rusted inside.<br>He told me he discovered this when my grandmother found a small hole on the mattress and itÂ’s powdered with flanks of rust. So he cut it open and was shocked by it. The next day I went back to office with him because there is a 3 years warranty for the mattress. My manager straight away says they are not responsible because my uncle has cut the thing open. The rest of<br>the conversation was hell.<br><br>My uncle was so furious that he went to complain to all the other<br>relatives who bought the products from me. Calls after calls from relatives demanding their money back. My father supported me then by telling them off that they bought the stuffs willing and I didnÂ’t forced them to buy. Since then, my family and the relatives are in bad terms. I feel so guilty about it. IÂ’ve also quit from DW since. I never realize that it was a fraud all along.<br><br>So friends out there, please beware of this company, DW Group<br>(Biomagnetism) Pte Ltd. IÂ’ve learnt my lesson and I hope that there wonÂ’t be any more people or their loved ones being cheated by them. Please help me to forward this to as many friends as you can. There is this fraud out there and we must put a stop to it!"<br><br></div>
