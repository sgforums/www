            <div class='col-md body'>As i was looking through many of the sgGirls' photos, quite many of them ain't Singaporeans, most of them posted are photos of stars. I have also looked through the critics and comments given by people. Some of the pictures of girls(which are usually singaporeans) who don't really look that pretty, were condemned, sadly, if they were to view the page, it won't be something nice rite?<br>I myself ain't a pretty ger, had my picture posted and allowed it to be there. One of the thread said: "Some of the Sggirls do not allow their pictures on sggirls.com" i think, if the critics were to be alittle more careful, probably pretty gers won't mind having pictures up. Not many pure ( meaning no history of mixed blood)Singaporeans are pretty. Not that you would have to say she looks gd when she doesn't, but try not to post up views which will hurt or are too harsh.<br>Girls are all pretty, just how pretty they are, but characters play a part too rite?<br>Just my opinion, no offence to anybody  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
