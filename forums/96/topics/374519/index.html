              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Want to be a social escort? You need a degree first</span></span></strong> <br> <br>THE quality of female social escorts or professional companions has gone up, say agency owners and managers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Clients, they added, have become more discerning and demanding: They want degree-holders.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The usual going rate for escorts is around $200 to $250 for an hour's work, while overnight rates usually hover around $1,000.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>But undergrads or graduates can command up to $500 an hour.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The agency operators insist that the world of the entertaining industry - as they would prefer to call it - is not as shady as it is often made out to be.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Mr Ernest Ting of MS Promotions told The New Paper on Sunday: It is often misunderstood.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">'Think, why would someone want to pay so much, if all that is on your mind at the end of the day is sex?'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A cheaper option, he offered: 'Head down to the red-light district and get your fix there. It'll cost you less than half of what you'd have to pay.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Another agency manager, MsGlenda, claimed: 'There is often a misconception. Many times, the clients who hire social escorts or who can afford to do so, are not your Ah Gongs and Ah Peks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">'They are respectable businessmen who have to entertain their associates who could be in town for a few days.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For this reason, added a manager of three agencies: 'Surely you'd not want to send the wrong message out to your clients?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">PERSONALITY COUNTS</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">'They'd want someone who can dress up properly, carry themselves well and are able to hold decent conversations without stuttering, spluttering or making sheer fools of themselves.'</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">The trend in the past two years has been to recruit women who are in their mid-20s and more highly-educated.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Demand has been good, said MrTing.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">He added: 'Of course the other problem we face is that these girls can work as freelancers.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">'As such, they could be working for more than one agency. If we relied on just the number at hand, we could find ourselves short of manpower.'</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Except for one, all the other agencies claimed that there has been a 40 per cent increase in the number of undergrad and graduate escorts.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">One agency owner, who only wanted to be known as Ms Kimoi, said: 'But many of our graduates have been with us since they were undergrads.'</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">She also revealed that these undergrads 'had initially entered the trade because they needed to pay their bills or fees'.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ms Glenda claimed: 'Many of them later realise how lucrative or easy it is to make a fast buck and they become reluctant to leave the trade.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">'But they are usually in only for the short haul. Some do quit after a couple of years.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A major international business conference last year had also seen an influx in the number of escorts for some of the agencies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Yet all the agency owners reiterated that escorts were not required to offer sexual services.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But, added Mr Ting: 'We can't control what is negotiated privately between the escorts and their clients.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The managers and owners insisted that they do not get a cut of the 'extra services'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Said one agency manager: 'Prostitution is not illegal in Singapore but soliciting is. We're not going to risk paying a fine, going to jail or losing our licence.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The offence carries a $1,000 fine. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $2,000 and jailed six months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But summing it up best was Mr Ting, who said: 'It's a matter of feeding the right type of meat to cater to the right palate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">'We supply you with what you want. Simple.'</span></p>

              <p>If the way you look at me is flirting, then I will be sorry to tell you that you are wrong and you seem to be shallow minded, perhaps you have an exotic ego?</p>
