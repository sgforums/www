Take consolation in the fact that most of what you have written so far have quite a high percentage of accuracy.<br><br>In your six years of studies, I'm sure you have also misjudged something, or people make bad comments.

What XLN meant perhaps was yours was more to the point, short and sharp, whereas, Spear's one is more detailed. So maybe yours was not that *interesting* to read.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, Qoo~<br><br>IÂ’m sorry it took so long for your post to be ready. I just thought that I need a longer time to interpret your chart better.<br><br>This time, I must admit first that even IÂ’m not that sure of whether my analysis is correct. In fact to be honest, IÂ’m even hoping that this particular analysis might not even be accurate.<br><br>Just forgive me if thereÂ’s any part that ainÂ’t accurate okay? IÂ’m after all just a beginner doing this for recreation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>IÂ’ll be more than happy to receive pointers, should there be anyone be kind &amp; gracious to offer them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>OkayÂ…<br><br>*take in deep breath*<br><br>Here goes nothingÂ…<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Star groupÂ….</strong></span><br><br>The 2 stars that govern your Ming gong are Ziwei xing &amp; Tian Fu xing. Your ming gong is situated in the Yu gong, &amp; it overlooks the Yin gong opposite where you have Qi Sha xing sitting there. In addition, thereÂ’s also a dim Hou xing present, and that typically spells into short but very bad bursts of anger every now &amp; then.<br><br>The luminance of the Ziwei xing is bright and Tian FuÂ’s one is average, while the Qi Sha in the opposite chamber bears the brightest luminance.<br><br>In short, you have what we call a Â’Zi Fu ShaÂ’ group.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Star FormationÂ….</strong></span><br><br>There is one formation detected. This formation is known as Â‘Xing/2 Yi/4 Jia/2 Ying/3Â’. Literal translation is Â‘Confinement Negative Clasping SupportÂ’. Technically, itÂ’s not too good a formation to haveÂ…<br><br>In case u dun understand what the numbers beside stand for, itÂ’s the identification of which sound to use for han yu ping ying.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On your characterÂ…..</strong></span><br><br>Qoo, IÂ’m beginning to understand why you sounded so depressed. Just gimme a second &amp; IÂ’ll explain. I need u to understand on some basic fundamental of Ziwei Doushu before you can effectively continue &amp; understand what IÂ’m gonna tell you.<br><br>As introduced above, Ziwei &amp; Tian Fu xings are the zhen xing in your Ming gong. Juz to expand on your understanding about what that implies, both stars are actually the core focus of the entire Ziwei Doushu legacy. In particular importance, the Ziwei Xing itself.<br><br>With the concept of Ziwei Doushu being functional entirely on the concept of understanding and interpretation on the numerous chain reactions formed over specific interactions of different stars in certain specific orders( eg. 4x3 directions, Â‘chongÂ’ &amp; Â‘heÂ’ gongs, Â‘JiaÂ’ gongs, etc), there are over a multitude of nearly over one hundred stars that are further classified into Alpha, Beta, etc categories by their levels of importance, involved within this complex passage of interaction.<br><br>In summary, these stars may be also be alternatively classified by their locations in heaven. The three primary category used on this effectively allocates the stars, especially those of Alpha &amp; Beta levels, into Bei Tou (North Dipper), Nan Tou (South Dipper) &amp; Zhong Tian (Middle Heaven).<br><br>The leader of the North Dipper is the infamous Ziwei Xing, while the leader of the South Dipper is being led by Tian Fu xing.<br><br>Now you beginning to get the picture?<br><br>The 2 zhen xings in your Ming gong happens to be the leaders from two areas in the big, big sky above. With Ziwei xing being the Emperor Star &amp; Tian Fu being the Treasury Star, there are no Â‘helpersÂ’ in your 4x3 directions to forward their assistance.<br><br>That means you get a picture of an emperor shouting for something but nobody respondingÂ…<br><br>Hence in face of the super bright Qi Sha &amp; Wu Qu with Hua Yi, some of the sha can still seep through and affect you, even though Ziwei xing has the original capability to contain &amp; suppress on most negative influence.<br><br>Personally, IÂ’m not a MCP &amp; I definitely donÂ’t believe that girls are in anyway inferior to us guys. But based on past recorded theories, this powerful combination produces too powerful a fusion even for guys to handle, let alone a young and tender girl like you.<br><br>Because of the tremendous strength in the 2 stars, you are highly likely to exhibit 2 significantly different set of characteristics at different times.<br><br>And no, IÂ’m not referring to that particular form of mental illness that you may be thinking of.<br><br>Rather, IÂ’m just saying that you have a side that is very much aggressive and constantly striving on pursuit for excellence and achievements. When this side of yours surface, you become something like a little tyrant or dictatorÂ…<br><br>Having bright ideas, emphasizing precision in whatever you do, seeking to lead a pack, being clear headed on matters, harboring on grand objectives or plans, but sometimes appearing to become over dominating over others.<br><br>You live &amp; swear by your principles. Under the threat of disagreements, you would rather drink cyanide &amp; die rather than adopt any seeming nonsensical Â‘chap pa langÂ’ ideas that any other may propose to you.<br><br>On the other hand, whenever the softer side of you surface, you suddenly transform into a gentle and soft spoken lady. Dropping down your previous set of armor and throwing away your sword, you suddenly become the UN ambassador for peace. You become mild in character and easy to approach.<br><br>Autocracy is suddenly past forgotten as you instantaneously transform into an avid believer of democracy. Going only the way of the majority &amp; seeking everyoneÂ’s consents, even if the final outcome defies your liking at times. And u often become more calculation as compared to the other more generous side of u.<br><br>If IÂ’m correct, then the aggressive side of you should be the side which has the higher tendency to surface.<br><br>You may feel that your surroundings are full of hostilities, and that that there will be matters which are constantly bugging you, and upsetting you time and after time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Qoo~'s analysis part 2 continue...<br><br>There just seemed to be so much uncooperative people around you, depressing matters that affect you. Everything just seemed to be so tough and serious, forcing you to grow up fast and to surrender into the general conformity.<br><br>So much dejection and lonelinessÂ…, but where are the ones who can truly stand by youÂ…<br><br>The sequential rotation of your two distinctive characteristic sets must have made you to be quite confused even over yourself at time. Hence, you must expect and understand on the possible impact that they might also have onto the people who surround you.<br><br>Eventually you may even find yourself to become confused over questions such as, what is it that you truly wantÂ…, how do you genuinely wish to live your liveÂ…, and perhaps, a very important question to almost every female that I am still unable to comprehend, when will you ever be truly loved by someoneÂ… (This is my guess, Not too certainÂ…)<br><br>Your depression would probably come also from the possibility that you feel neglected or unloved by your parents. From the understanding gathered from the star chart, it is possible that the relationship between you and your parents is not really entirely a cordial or happy one.<br><br>Your inner thoughts is likely to be ravaged by strong emotions which are constantly shifting, a lingering sense of loneliness, that remote sense of helplessness amidst your ocean of hardship, and that little dash of self pity.<br><br>Occasionally from time to time, you might experience an urge to rebel, to overturn &amp; to correct your world. You want to set back what has gone wrong &amp; to extract back whatever that should be rightfully, or fairly yours.<br><br>There is also the Â‘higher-than-usualÂ’ urge for *ahem*, sexual intimacy too?<br><br>(This part I dunno. Dun think I wanna know too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> You alone know then okay liaoÂ… Juz dun say it out here. Me conservative oneÂ… face will go red <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On careerÂ….</strong></span><br><br>As derived from your stars, youÂ’ll probably have the habit of switching jobs rather frequently in the future. This really adds on greatly into the complexity of trying to read out accurately on what your ideal direction should be.<br><br>Under this type of circumstances, my personal suggestion is that you can probably refer to ZackÂ’s reading on your career, since the possibilities listed there are probably feasible alternatives that you can consider.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In SummaryÂ…</strong></span><br><br>Qoo, my guess is that at the end of this analysis, youÂ’re probably gonna cry yourself die cos you might be thinking that youÂ’re having a very bitter life.<br><br>But if you can read thru my words carefully, you should be able to see that for most of my wordings, IÂ’ve portrayed the scenarios into a relationship of you as you attempt to respond to your environment.<br><br>To put my words simply, I have been telling you about how youÂ’re probably been looking at the things that are taking place in your life.<br><br>But, that may not be how the same things are really happening in the objective reality.<br><br>Maybe IÂ’ll just ask you like thisÂ…<br><br>What do you think you would see, if you can look at the world around you without the burdens from your emotions, for just one day?<br><br>You might probably realize that things may not really be as depressing they had appeared originally.<br><br>True, not all of your problems would disappear this way of course.<br><br>For people born with similar stars arrangements as you have, it is typically unavoidable that they would have to experience or feel a Â‘bitterÂ’ beginning first initially in the earlier stage of their life.<br><br>Nevertheless, if you could have a look at the arrangement and understand what sort of programming Â‘bugsÂ’ are also inherent in your original program and the nature of influence that they hold over you, chances are that you would have come to realize that your own perception &amp; approach of looking into things may have actually contributed more than they should on times, and hence mentally altering or exaggerating onto the severity or graveness of a real and existing condition.<br><br>And if it could make you feel to be in better control over your life, the two sha xing, Hou Xing &amp; Jing Yang xing can actually also be contra off against each other within their appearance in the 4x3 direction of your Ming gong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The same applies to the Tou Lou xing &amp; Ling Xing in your Fu De gong, or Â‘Inner ThoughtÂ’ chamber.<br><br>But you have to understand one thing thought, in the process of countering each otherÂ’s negative influences off, you have to be both mentally strong and brave enough to overcome this initial phase. And if you were to ask me how to do all these, I will give you my humble suggestions:<br><br>1)Read up on books that introduces you towards positive thinking to help steer you away from the prevalent negative thoughts.<br><br>A good classical example that I always like to use, is to remind yourself that there are 6.5 million people in North Korea &amp; 30 million people in Africa dying from hunger, and that people are getting sniped dead for no reason in Bosnia while children are getting blown up by landmines in Afghanistan.<br><br>ItÂ’s a sick example, but it should get the picture clear to youÂ…<br><br>2)Get yourself exercising to make yourself physically drained (so that youÂ’ll be too tired to even think about ur problems. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>3)Approach your close friends and rant to them about your problems even if itÂ’s without invitation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> This should effectively help to minimize on the degree of loneliness that you may be feeling. Alternatively, you may also want to try &amp; rant out your frustrations here.<br><br>After all, we dun even know how each other looks like. Juz think of it as a novice way of breaking the ice around this jointÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Eventually, you should be able to enjoy a much better life. Maybe in your early thirties, if the theories are accurate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And this marks the end of this analysis for you. I dunno if itÂ’s accurate anotÂ…<br><br>And also, a note on parents, Qoo~Â…<br><br>Try to love your folks more. Everybody only have two of them in their entire lifetime. Â‘Hurry while stocks lastÂ…Â’ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
