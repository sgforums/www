In fact to be honest, IÂ’m even hoping that this particular analysis might not even be accurate.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: darkred;">aiyo, like that die liao lor... </span><br><br>The 2 stars that govern your Ming gong are Ziwei xing &amp; Tian Fu xing. Your ming gong is situated in the Yu gong, &amp; it overlooks the Yin gong opposite where you have Qi Sha xing sitting there. In addition, thereÂ’s also a dim Hou xing present, and that typically spells into short but very bad bursts of anger every now &amp; then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: red;">in my own words i will wan to call it PMS~!! nuren de quan li!! </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>The luminance of the Ziwei xing is bright and Tian FuÂ’s one is average, while the Qi Sha in the opposite chamber bears the brightest luminance.<br><br>In short, you have what we call a Â’Zi Fu ShaÂ’ group.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]Star FormationÂ….</span></strong><br><br>There is one formation detected. This formation is known as Â‘Xing/2 Yi/4 Jia/2 Ying/3Â’. Literal translation is Â‘Confinement Negative Clasping SupportÂ’. Technically, itÂ’s not too good a formation to haveÂ…<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On your characterÂ…..</strong></span><br><br>cus of the entire Ziwei Doushu legacy. In particular importance, the Ziwei Xing itself.<br><br>That means you get a picture of an emperor shouting for something but nobody respondingÂ…<br><br>Hence in face of the super bright Qi Sha &amp; Wu Qu with Hua Yi, some of the sha can still seep through and affect you, even though Ziwei xing has the original capability to contain &amp; suppress on most negative influence.<br><br>Personally, IÂ’m not a MCP &amp; I definitely donÂ’t believe that girls are in anyway inferior to us guys. But based on past recorded theories, this powerful combination produces too powerful a fusion even for guys to handle, let alone a young and tender girl like you.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: brown;">that's y i say my ming very ku one.. haiz... is all fated</span><br>Because of the tremendous strength in the 2 stars, you are highly likely to exhibit 2 significantly different set of characteristics at different times.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><span style="color: green;"> ya.. i think so at times too</span><br>And no, IÂ’m not referring to that particular form of mental illness that you may be thinking of.<br><br>Rather, IÂ’m just saying that you have a side that is very much aggressive and constantly striving on pursuit for excellence and achievements. When this side of yours surface, you become something like a little tyrant or dictatorÂ…<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> <span style="color: olive;">recall when doing project that time... hahaa.. super KS one..</span>Having bright ideas, emphasizing precision in whatever you do, seeking to lead a pack, being clear headed on matters, harboring on grand objectives or plans, but sometimes appearing to become over dominating over others.<br><br>You live &amp; swear by your principles. Under the threat of disagreements, you would rather drink cyanide &amp; die rather than adopt any seeming nonsensical Â‘chap pa langÂ’ ideas that any other may propose to you.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">so serious ar??</span>On the other hand, whenever the softer side of you surface, you suddenly transform into a gentle and soft spoken lady. Dropping down your previous set of armor and throwing away your sword, you suddenly become the UN ambassador for peace. You become mild in character and easy to approach.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: darkblue;">yeah.. esp when if my bf,......</span><br>Autocracy is suddenly past forgotten as you instantaneously transform into an avid believer of democracy. Going only the way of the majority &amp; seeking everyoneÂ’s consents, even if the final outcome defies your liking at times. And u often become more calculation as compared to the other more generous side of u.<br><br>If IÂ’m correct, then the aggressive side of you should be the side which has the higher tendency to surface.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: indigo;">sad to say, could be due to surrounding circumstances</span><br>You may feel that your surroundings are full of hostilities, and that that there will be matters which are constantly bugging you, and upsetting you time and after time.<br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Spear:<br><strong><br>There just seemed to be so much uncooperative people around you, depressing matters that affect you. Everything just seemed to be so tough and serious, forcing you to grow up fast and to surrender into the general conformity.<br><br>So much dejection and lonelinessÂ…, but where are the ones who can truly stand by youÂ…<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> where are all of you!??!?!?!<br><br>Eventually you may even find yourself to become confused over questions such as, what is it that you truly wantÂ…, how do you genuinely wish to live your liveÂ…, and perhaps, a very important question to almost every female that I am still unable to comprehend, when will you ever be truly loved by someoneÂ… (This is my guess, Not too certainÂ…)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: red;">ya no need to guess spear.. they are right.. in fact i ask them almost every day?? </span>Your depression would probably come also from the possibility that you feel neglected or unloved by your parents. From the understanding gathered from the star chart, it is possible that the relationship between you and your parents is not really entirely a cordial or happy one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: orange;">ya.. generally, i dun like them... </span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]In SummaryÂ…</span></strong><br><br>Qoo, my guess is that at the end of this analysis, youÂ’re probably gonna cry yourself die cos you might be thinking that youÂ’re having a very bitter life.<br><br>But if you can read thru my words carefully, you should be able to see that for most of my wordings, IÂ’ve portrayed the scenarios into a relationship of you as you attempt to respond to your environment.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> thank you spear..<br>To put my words simply, I have been telling you about how youÂ’re probably been looking at the things that are taking place in your life.<br><br>For people born with similar stars arrangements as you have, it is typically unavoidable that they would have to experience or feel a Â‘bitterÂ’ beginning first initially in the earlier stage of their life.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> does that mean i xian ku huo tian??<br>Nevertheless, if you could have a look at the arrangement and understand what sort of programming Â‘bugsÂ’ are also inherent in your original program and the nature of influence that they hold over you, chances are that you would have come to realize that your own perception &amp; approach of looking into things may have actually contributed more than they should on times, and hence mentally altering or exaggerating onto the severity or graveness of a real and existing condition.<br><br>And if it could make you feel to be in better control over your life, the two sha xing, Hou Xing &amp; Jing Yang xing can actually also be contra off against each other within their appearance in the 4x3 direction of your Ming gong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The same applies to the Tou Lou xing &amp; Ling Xing in your Fu De gong, or Â‘Inner ThoughtÂ’ chamber.<br><br>But you have to understand one thing thought, in the process of countering each otherÂ’s negative influences off, you have to be both mentally strong and brave enough to overcome this initial phase. And if you were to ask me how to do all these, I will give you my humble suggestions:<br><br>1)Read up on books that introduces you towards positive thinking to help steer you away from the prevalent negative thoughts.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">/me start going to kinokuniya to stock up all self help books... hehehe<br><br>2)Get yourself exercising to make yourself physically drained (so that youÂ’ll be too tired to even think about ur problems. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: green;">its doesn't work.. i tired before.. instead i get more tired coz in the end i can't rest.. keep thinking abt problems</span><br>3)Approach your close friends and rant to them about your problems even if itÂ’s without invitation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> This should effectively help to minimize on the degree of loneliness that you may be feeling. Alternatively, you may also want to try &amp; rant out your frustrations here.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: olive;">ya.. i doing it.. look at my post.. they are all my problems i guess...hhehe i hope u guys dun mind</span>After all, we dun even know how each other looks like. Juz think of it as a novice way of breaking the ice around this jointÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Eventually, you should be able to enjoy a much better life. Maybe in your early thirties, if the theories are accurate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span style="color: blue;">hopefully...</span>And this marks the end of this analysis for you. I dunno if itÂ’s accurate anotÂ…<br><br>And also, a note on parents, Qoo~Â…<br><br>Try to love your folks more. Everybody only have two of them in their entire lifetime.
