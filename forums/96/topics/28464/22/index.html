            <div class='col-md body'>This one is on Evian-san. So sorry for the delay... Sumimasen.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Star GroupÂ….</strong></span><br><br>Evian, your Ming gong (Life Chamber) is in Ji gong. The zhen xing in your ming gong is Tian Tong Xing, &amp; its luminance is at its brightest. (Time to put on ur shades, ger) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Together with the Tian Liang xing &amp; the Fu Chun xing thatÂ’s in the opposite gong (Hai Gong), you have a Â‘Tian Tong &amp; Tian LiangÂ’ group.<br><br>Coincidentally, I also had a look at PilgrimÂ’s star chart juz before I worked out yours. An interesting point to note is that you two share a great deal of similarity when it comes to you twoÂ’s character &amp; friends.<br><br>The others things (eg. Money, spouse, health, star formations etcÂ…) are of course, different.<br><br>Anyway, back to the topicÂ…<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Star FormationsÂ….</strong></span><br><br>On first view, there appears to be one star formation present. This formation is known also as Â‘Shuang Lu Chao YuanÂ’ (Literal translation = Double Â‘LuÂ’ Towards Wall). Basically, the Â‘LuÂ’ is the same word as in Â“Fu Lu ShouÂ’. And you have two of them shining into your Ming gong.<br><br>You lucky ger siah.<br><br>This is the first time IÂ’ve actually seen it in someoneÂ’s star chart apart from theory. Technically, it means that you might get to enjoy both of what I presume to be a quite reasonable amount of material riches and happiness. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Take joy also, in the fact that you also have some pretty good combinations in your star chart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>IÂ’ll explainÂ…<br><br>From the 4x3 directions, we see the Â‘Tian TongÂ’ meeting up with the following stars;<br>1)Tian Liang wif Hua Ke &amp; Lu Chun from ur Travel chamber,<br>2)Tian Ji, Ju Men &amp; Ling xing in ur Career,<br>3)Tai Ying &amp; Tai Yang borrowed from the Wei Gong into Chou Gong together with the Left wif Hua Ke &amp; the Right stars that are already in Chou.<br><br>Altogether now, we see six major zhen xing coming out into play within your 4x3 directions. The majority of the six stars are also in bright luminescence, indicating a further flaunting of their positive &amp; beneficial properties.<br><br>Although thereÂ’s also the duo presence of Â‘Kong JieÂ’ present in ur ming gong, given the ultra bright luminance of the Tian Tong xing within the same chamber, your star is well able to handle any minor sha from the two stars mentioned. The reason is due to the interaction of 7 lucky stars (Left, Right, Hua Ke, Hua Lu, Lu Chun, Tian Ma &amp; Tian Shuo) When Tian Ma meet Lu Chun, it becomes Â‘Lu MaÂ’ &amp; bring good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On your characterÂ….</strong></span><br><br>Tian Tong xing is basically a non aggressive star, which manifests into Fortune. Hence in conjunction with the Lu Chun &amp; Hua Lu stars, you are probably a very lucky young extrovert lady who has the luck to enjoy a great deal of wonderful things in your life.<br><br>Incidentally, the primary emphasis in your life is not to merely pursue the endless comforts in this world blindly as commonly expected.<br><br>Rather, though the wanting of material comforts are important to you, I believe that you actually seek greater joy from taking in contentment, the people and things that are around you in your everyday life. On this, you can actually easily become quite contended through this Â‘mysticalÂ’ method of gaining happiness, which I dun think I can really understand personally at this momentÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Compassionate, forthright and of a gentle nature, your mind harbors the thoughts and ideals of high nobility (eg. Want to save all the poor &amp; hungry people in the world?).<br><br>YouÂ’re probably something like a modern Cinderella or Snow WhiteÂ… lifting the skirt up a little, singing along &amp; dancing around with birds who automatically go &amp; friend youÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Basically, I would say that for most of the time, you are a rather composed person whoÂ’s usually at peace with yourself. However, you do appear also to be indecisive at times when decisions have to be made, mainly because of your softer nature. On a further note, you also have the tendency to be more of a follower rather than the leader among your little bands of friends.<br><br>And when you become agitated from time to time (which I believe you would experience a little often every now &amp; then as derived from the Ling xing), you can also really rant about itÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Interestingly, you appear to be the type of girl who is constantly dreaming of endless romantic scenarios whereby your loving hubby will one day marry and pamper you into to nice &amp; happy Tai Tai for the rest of your lifeÂ…<br><br>Being a pampered housewife might be a possible dream that you may be gleefully hiding inside your heart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As a general rule, I dun normally disclose what general characteristics that your future hubby will have.<br><br>IÂ’m making a rare exception today. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hint:<br>Your future hubby is likely to be someone like a strategist (Tian Ji) &amp; whoÂ’s very good at teasing you and making you happy with his mouth (Ju Men). His approach is somewhat aggressive(Ling Xing), but thatÂ’s probably only limited to his pursue of goals in life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And now, onto Pilgrim-san...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Star GroupÂ…</strong></span><br><br>Pilgrim ( interesting nickÂ…) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> , your ming gong is in Hai gong. The stars inside is Tian Tong xing &amp; Wen Chang xing. The star in the opposite Ji gong is Tian Liang xing &amp; Tou Lou xing. Hence, you have what is known as a Â‘Tong LiangÂ’ group.<br><br>This grouping is something similar to EvianÂ’s, though there are some significant difference between the two of you.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Star FormationsÂ…..</strong></span><br><br>There appears to be no extraordinary formations present.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On your CharacterÂ…</strong></span><br><br>The existence of both Tian Tong &amp; Wen Chang xings in your Ming gong denotes that in similar areas as with Evian the Lucky (if I may call u so, mÂ’am <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), you are also a typical happy little chap who is usually feeling quite easily contented with your immediate surroundings or circumstances. Like Evian-san, you also live your life with a golden rule of Â‘I wanna be happyÂ’ as your primary principle in life.<br><br>Peace loving, pretty humorous, curious &amp; interested in many fields at once but changes your focus frequentlyÂ…<br><br>Differing from Evian, your stars also meet Wen Qu in your Career. Coupled together with the Wen Chang xing in your Ming gong &amp; the Tian Liang xing which also comes with Hua Ke, you possess 3 stars in the 4x3 directions which all share a common attribute and clearly points out the fact that you are an intelligent person.<br><br>In conjunction with the Tian Ji xing which I see in your career, I further guess that you must be someone who enjoys strategizing &amp; engaging into various sorts of mentally stimulating activities (eg. Playing combat stimulations games such as Warcraft, or Command &amp; Conquer series or other brainy stuff?)<br><br>Due to the existence of Tou Lou, Tian Xing &amp; the fact that the Wen Qu star has Hua Yi accompanying it, I dun really expect the passage of your studying life to really come as easily or as smoothly as most students would really hope it would be.<br><br>On a more optimistic note, you can be reassured however, that as seen from your chart, the initial hard work is unavoidable. What comes after that is the sweet fruits, which is usually available to people with Wen Chang in their Ming gong after they have managed to overcome their initial obstacles. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I gather that in addition to the tendency of experiencing regular bouts of gloom or loneliness every now &amp; then, you are also somewhat feeling fluttered by the hectic pace in your lifestyle er, comrade? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Either always physically or mentally on the goÂ… So much things to do but yet so little time to do them all er? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Fortunately though, quite often as you are feeling down, you can also juz expect there to be one or two person around you who will then suddenly pop out of nowhere &amp; offer you their assistance.<br><br>OkayÂ…, so they may not really be able to help you out all the time, &amp; in every aspect. But hellÂ… at least they would be doing something constructive, either thru the form of counseling or coaching for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On CareerÂ….</strong></span><br><br>Very clearly, you might want to consider trying for a job that would put your precious brains into best use.<br><br>In order for me to not insult your intelligence, may I suggest that you go for those really damn challenging onesÂ… be your education either in engineering, legal or what so ever, perhaps you would enjoy taking pride in doing something which the more common group of people might not be as capable in.<br><br>If its possible, why not settle for a career in the legal or civil service side? Policy planning work might be a good channel for you cos it allows for a great &amp; diverse arena for constructive ideas to be put &amp; launched into public benefiting actions (Personal opinion only though...). Or maybe you can also try a lecturing post?<br><br>The career chamber of any person is usually a very challenging section for anyone to decipher really accurately. This is because in the context of Ziwei Doushu, one star can also have many other possible manifestations at the same time&amp; in the same chamber. This makes the work of accurately pin pointing out exactly what your ideal career option to be a really, really very challenging task.<br><br>Also, from my own personal experience on my own career reading, I think I should add that whatever the stars reveal us to be suitable for, the options suggested may also differ in quite big contrast to those other options that we may really like.<br><br>Hence in summary to this section, I think I can only tell you this, Pilgrim.<br><br>Dun waste your brain juice over small peanut issuesÂ…<br><br>If youÂ’ve got the nuts, flaunt it. Go for something challenging, provided that you like it, &amp; that itÂ’s not illegal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Money issuesÂ…</strong></span><br><br>Money matters is basically okay, probably around the middle or middle-high average kind of range. From the looks of it, your money is also quite hard earned, so again as I usually tell people, spend only on what truly needs to be spent.<br><br>YouÂ’ll probably be thinking (given your clever brainsÂ…) that ainÂ’t this a fact that money doesnÂ’t come easy?<br><br>To be honest, it is.<br><br>But then again, from the theories, its also equally possible that there are people who may be born with the destiny of so getting much wealth that he or she may actually need not live by the common manÂ’s rule of earning money thru the typical laborious way &amp; spending it wisely.<br><br>But such people are only a handful, so its really more advisable to drop the fantasy part aside &amp; focus more on the reality part.<br><br>Again, your intelligent mind would probably be wondering why IÂ’m bringing in all this crap about someone elseÂ’s destiny when IÂ’m currently analyzing only yours here.<br><br>Well, I dun really like to break this to you comrade, but apart from the Tai Yang &amp; Tai Ying stars that are borrowed into your Monetary Chamber from the Chou Gong, thereÂ’s also the Jing Yang xing present in the original Money chamber in Wei Gong. So IÂ’m juz trying to alert you to this aspect.<br><br>Since Jing Yang xing also known as Â‘Jie YangÂ’ and viewed upon as a mental visual of a Â‘small knifeÂ’, IÂ’m juz wondering if it might (touch wood) interpret into an encounter with a financial sham, a break-in, or other possible money losing events for you.<br><br>On the bright side, the Jing Yang xing is Â‘ru miaoÂ’ (shining in its brightest, hence minimizing negatives &amp; maximizing positive attributes), so maybe my interpretation could also juz be a false alarm or the event might just pass itself off as a small &amp; harmless event such as a friend forgetting to pay back a small loan from you. (stuff like thatÂ…)<br><br>Anyway, this concludes my brief analysis on your star chart.<br><br>Hope most of itÂ’s accurate, cos I suddenly realized that its already 10.27 hrs nowÂ… meaning IÂ’ve been pouring over EvianÂ’s &amp; your charts since about 2am something last night after IÂ’ve drawn them upÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Btw, feedbacks, flaks or queries are welcome from you or any members of the public <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Sumimasen. </strong><br><br>It's ok, better late than never, coz I was beginning to wonder if we lacked the 'fate', heh heh.<br><br><strong>On your characterÂ….<br><br>Rather, though the wanting of material comforts are important to you, I believe that you actually seek greater joy from taking in contentment, the people and things that are around you in your everyday life. On this, you can actually easily become quite contended through this Â‘mysticalÂ’ method of gaining happiness, which I dun think I can really understand personally at this momentÂ…<br><br>Compassionate, forthright and of a gentle nature, your mind harbors the thoughts and ideals of high nobility (eg. Want to save all the poor &amp; hungry people in the world?).<br><br>YouÂ’re probably something like a modern Cinderella or Snow WhiteÂ… lifting the skirt up a little, singing along &amp; dancing around with birds who automatically go &amp; friend youÂ…<br></strong><br><br>Yep, this one I'll hafta agree... Doesn't take much for me to be happy... Pple who know me always have the same comment: that I'm bubbly,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> but pple who don't know me also 'kena' the other end of the spectrum, coz I look very 'dao'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Compassionate? (tick) Forthright? (tick) As for 'save all the poor and hungry people' thing.. true also, I'm very idealistic but your example abit exaggerated sia!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> As for the Cinderella example, I find it interesting coz I was described as the deer Bambi which happily trots about in the forest looking for its friends, sometimes gets into trouble doing so, but each time being able to laugh at itself and move on again. That analogy was from an <span style="font-style: italic;">angmoh</span> astrology website. Wah I think I 'chope' all the Disney characters liao... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>And when you become agitated from time to time (which I believe you would experience a little often every now &amp; then as derived from the Ling xing), you can also really rant about itÂ…  </strong><br><br>Yah loh, we have to be realistic, Cinderella cannot be giggling all the time right... Rarely get angry, but when really angry can be quite fierce also.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong>Interestingly, you appear to be the type of girl who is constantly dreaming of endless romantic scenarios whereby your loving hubby will one day marry and pamper you into to nice &amp; happy Tai Tai for the rest of your lifeÂ… </strong><br><br>Yah, I'm very good at conjuring romantic scenarios... That's why I always think I'll be a casanova if I were a guy... But coz I'm a girl I always end up disappointed. Oh well...<br><br><strong><br>On your CareerÂ… </strong><br><br>Actually, truth is, I also haven't decided what I want to be. And in reply to zacken, I'm not studying business...Me doing science. heh heh. But admit, the interest is there lah... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>But another thing I would like to enquire about is, do the stars say anything about intelligence? Or am I destined to be a bimbotic tai tai? *horror*<br><br>And another thing, I rem you guys saying rain_tree is general, then both you and zacken are guards or something... wah, so 'wei feng' leh, then what is my star about?<br><br><strong><br>PS: I dun mind being your sweet heart in the highly unlikely event that u are unattached.</strong><br><br>Wah, then hope you also don't mind telling me the reason. Coz you wanna learn from me the 101 techniques of making oneself happy or coz you wanna take up challenge of pampering me...

Like Evian-san, you also live your life with a golden rule of Â‘I wanna be happy?as your primary principle in life.<br><br><span style="color: orange;"><span style="font-style: italic;">correct .... mi quite contented with life easily ... too lazy to work hard ... life is too short to be unhappy with stuffs ... all accurate ...</span></span><br><br>Peace loving, pretty humorous, curious &amp; interested in many fields at once but changes your focus frequently?<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">HAHAHA .... absolutely correct .... about me curious in many fields at once and changing my focus ... mi currently in interested in Hifi, DVD, LOTR and stuff ..... and loses focus easily. I used to be (still is) interested in I Ching. Got to know to knw 2 guy who is into I Ching but lose contact so couldn't learn much from them. mayb zack n spear can zi dian zi dian xiao di agn  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></span><br>Differing from Evian, your stars also meet Wen Qu in your Career. Coupled together with the Wen Chang xing in your Ming gong &amp; the Tian Liang xing which also comes with Hua Ke, you possess 3 stars in the 4x3 directions which all share a common attribute and clearly points out the fact that you are an intelligent person.<br><br><span style="color: orange;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Can't say myslf is intelligent   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> but LAZY and a SLOW learner i am.</span></span><br><br>In conjunction with the Tian Ji xing which I see in your career, I further guess that you must be someone who enjoys strategizing &amp; engaging into various sorts of mentally stimulating activities (eg. Playing combat stimulations games such as Warcraft, or Command &amp; Conquer series or other brainy stuff?)<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Warcraft 3 last time not now (lose focus lah) more into LOTR TCG right now. Does that counts as enjoying strategizing &amp; mentally stimulating activities? </span></span><br><br>Due to the existence of Tou Lou, Tian Xing &amp; the fact that the Wen Qu star has Hua Yi accompanying it, I dun really expect the passage of your studying life to really come as easily or as smoothly as most students would really hope it would be.<br><br><span style="color: orange;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Currently having exam right now .... not doing well at all ..... hmm .... always dun do well at those crucial exam PSLE ... 'O' level lah  .... so mst be correct. </span></span><br><br>On a more optimistic note, you can be reassured however, that as seen from your chart, the initial hard work is unavoidable. What comes after that is the sweet fruits, which is usually available to people with Wen Chang in their Ming gong after they have managed to overcome their initial obstacles. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hope that's happen .... but me too lazy so no hard work done .... so that must means no sweet fruits for this lazy pig.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </span></span><br><br>I gather that in addition to the tendency of experiencing regular bouts of gloom or loneliness every now &amp; then, you are also somewhat feeling fluttered by the hectic pace in your lifestyle er, comrade? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="color: orange;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Yup once in while whn i am alone lah .... hectic dun think i have a hectic life cos i take thing too easily ....</span></span><br><br>Fortunately though, quite often as you are feeling down, you can also juz expect there to be one or two person around you who will then suddenly pop out of nowhere &amp; offer you their assistance.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Pretty accurate ... friends are always there for me</span>.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Career?</strong></span><br><br>In order for me to not insult your intelligence, may I suggest that you go for those really damn challenging ones?be your education either in engineering, legal or what so ever, perhaps you would enjoy taking pride in doing something which the more common group of people might not be as capable in.<br><br><span style="color: orange;"><span style="font-style: italic;">no offence taken ... currently me doing engineering right now ... so mi not wasting my brain juice lah. HAHAHA!! Hope there's something more challenging for me like wat u say. but i can't even cope with my study right now .... engineering is really challenging me right now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span></span><br><br>If its possible, why not settle for a career in the legal or civil service side?
