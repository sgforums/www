            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, Peppermint, this is what I've worked out from ur stars using ziwei doushu.<br><br>Take it wif a pinch of recreation &amp; humor okay? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Star Grouping </strong></span><br><br>Ming &amp; Shen gong in Yu. No zhen xing in ming gong. Star group is Tai Yang &amp; Tian Liang borrowed from the opposite mao gong.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Formations Present</strong></span><br><br>Based on the presence of Tai Yang &amp; Tian Liang in Mao gong, which is also known as the Zhen gong (as in the bagua trigram), aka Â‘LeiÂ’ men (Thunder door), you posses what is known as a Â‘Ri Zhao Lei MenÂ’ from your 4x3 directions. Literal translation is Â‘Sun shinning on Thunder GateÂ’.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Your characterÂ…</strong></span><br><br>In the 4x3 directions( commonly known as Shi Zhen San He), we see Hou xing &amp; Ling xing present. As Sha xings, the two stars indicate that you might be a person of harsh temperament &amp; moderate aggression.<br><br>Because Tai Yang has an alternate manifestation as Authority while Tian Liang is often also associated with a feel of nobility, the fusion of the two stars borrowed from your Mao gong indicates that the primary emphasis in your life is to seek either popularity or influential powers, or to gain acceptance &amp; authority for your talents and skills. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And often perhaps, as a result of your emphasis on your individually held views or private principles, you might often find situations whereby in your quest for acceptance on your contributions, you might find that you often encounter many debates over your propositions first before others might be willing to be win over.<br><br>IÂ’m not too sure if there are often times when the need to defend your ego have gotten you into potentially avoidable situations. Nevertheless, juz try to keep it in check more often. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Back onto the two stars in your ming gong, due to their positions in the Yu gong, the luminance of the two stars also paled in comparison as they would be when they were in Mao.<br><br>As a result, thought you may posses a lot of drive and initiative in the onset or the pre-commencement of a project, often you might suddenly find yourself to be gradually drained of energy as the project commences on. Maybe you can visualize on the followingÂ… YouÂ’re like the Sun, trying to shine onto every micro inch in this world. But the hour is evening when the Sun is setting. So although wif grand ambitions, power is not enough to achieve ALL 100% of your established goals.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Monetary IssuesÂ…</strong></span><br><br>Take on an active saving program comrade<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> Your money ainÂ’t really gonna come quite easily. Every cent is like a drop of blood, gathered only after you have sweated for it. So even though you may have unlimited wants, clearly identify out which is really your clear needs before you spend. DonÂ’t rattle out your savings like a rifle on auto modeÂ…<br><br>Due to the presence of the Jing Yang Xing &amp; the Tou Lou Xing clipping on your Monetary Gong from both left &amp; right, I would advise you to be extra vigilant &amp; avoid all Â‘get rich schemesÂ’. Even should you be contemplating on proven investments, eg those offered by commercial banks, try to go for those on a low risk basis instead of those high risk ones. Reason is because I think I've identified a rather low threshold for you to take on unneccessary financial risks.<br><br>Maybe you should also avoid taking out huge loans over unneccessary stuff, eg. condo... One step at a time and vigilantly too, after sums have been calculated too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On CareerÂ…</strong></span><br><br>The presence of Ju Men &amp; Tian Dong Xings in ur career gong indicates that your job next time might have something to do wif a lot of talking, explanation or consultation. Something that involves extensive interaction with people. My own guess is that youÂ’ll probably be doing sales or marketing of some sortsÂ…, maybe on specialized products or contracts.<br><br>Try not to be too gruffy &amp; grumble about othersÂ… You grumble then maybe others grumble back at you.<br><br>(Maybe ur default approach is too aggressive for the others to takeÂ… Advise = Take it easyÂ….<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>There might be the tendency to take on short cuts during the passage of your career, since you might feel that you would probably deserve more money given the degree of effort that you might have put in.<br><br>Try not to do that.<br><br>As mentioned earlier in your monetary gong, you would have realized that you actually have quite a low threshold for taking on monetary risk. IÂ’ll strongly recommend that you stick on to the traditional path of Â‘slugging it outÂ’, rather than to quit a steady job and jump straight into another field which might look more appetizing on the external surface.<br><br>In face of your rather low levels of risk threshold, I would suggest that you avoid solo startups on your own. Note, this doesnÂ’t mean that you should avoid being an entrepreneur all your life. Should you ever encounter someone whom you feel might have more expertise and foresight in working wif to form a start up biz, by all means go ahead. The avoiding part refers only to you carrying it out alone. And if you ask me why, I think a possible and realistic explanation that I can offer, is due to the fact that you might have the tendency to lose your drive halfway thru a projectÂ’s commencement.(See Character section).<br><br>Okay, thatÂ’s about it. I ainÂ’t really a professional you knowÂ… Juz learning this for recreation purpose only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, accurate or not, hope that you can point out &amp; let me know. Like that then I can learn more about the analyzing part also. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Hope I never maluh too much in front of all the viewers... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, juz to clarify on a few of ur queries mentioned above...<br><br>Basically in ziwei doushu, an individual's star chart is made up of 12 fixed chambers. The postion of these chambers or 'gong' is in accordance wif the 12 'Di zhi' or 'Earthly Branches'.<br><br>These 12 di zhi are known as zi, chou, yin, mao, chen, ji, wu, wei, shen, yu, chien, &amp; hai. Same names they use in the Chinese oriental zodiac. The names of these branches serve mainly as location markers on the chart, though they also serve other functions as well.<br><br>The other set of terms, ming (Life) gong &amp; stuff, is basically another set of identification that identifies, what aspect of ur program that the stars in a particular chamber influences on.<br><br>Juz as simple as that... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Btw, why did you say that u dun have any good points?<br><br>U have the 'Ri Zhao Lei Men' formation inside mah... Juz that the stars in the Yu gong radiates out less luminance, so maybe tend to make u lose drive when carrying out projects a little...<br><br>The above is only ur default 'nature' program, so now that u are more or less aware of the areas where improvements can be made, go ahead &amp; 'nurture' that aspect loh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>After all, life this kind of thing also quite funny one...
