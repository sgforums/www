I for one am not familiar wiith the Rules of the Sea or with the radar systems on board the ship. Maybe the RSN Courageous had the right of way. Maybe not. Maybe the cargo ship was not following its route. Maybe it was.<br><br>#2 As mentioned, we don't know the radar system well. Maybe there are limitations like a blind cone that the radar cannot see, therefore forcing the ship to do a jinking maneuver once in a while just to clear that blind cone. Maybe the radar was down for maintenance. Maybe there was something happening on the ship that needed the immediate attention of the crew that was awake.<br><br>Bottom line is, <strong>WE DON'T KNOW</strong>.

            <div class='col-md body'>go^4,<br><br>as I said, you don't know. Don't jump to conclusions. For all we know, the Courageous was sitting still in the water in some supposedly "safe" area and the cargo ship strayed off course and hit it. Yes, I agree with you, there should be a crew on the bridge keeping watch at all times but I'm not sure if there's a requirement to man up the radar console 24 hours if they are not on heightened alert. I mean, you can imagine how boring it gets to start at a radar screen that shows blips moving at 10 miles per hour... and sometimes nothing at all. Maybe (yes, another maybe. there can only be maybes until the results of the report come out) the operating procedures dictate that there was no need to man up the radar console and only the bridgewatch crew was necessary?<br><br>The ship was not on exercise. It was not looking out specifically for something. The alertness state of the crew is low at 2330h. Does that absolve them of responsibility? Probably not.<br><br>Bottom line: <strong>WE DON'T KNOW</strong>. now, calm down and wait for the investigation report.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><blockquote>Well, lots of 'maybes'. We can go on talking here but one thing is for sure. There may well be a good explanation for this incident. The security of the Singapore waters relies very much on the guys doing patrols out there. Those selected personnel better be the right ones. 'Coz there will be other servicemen and women doing the same job later and if they were to come under the command of someone less responsible or less competent for the job, then there might be Hell again.</blockquote></strong><br><br>I'm sure every organisation tries to recruit the best people that it can get. Whether it's the best out there is questionable of course. But in a country full of people who will pack up and leave at the slightest hint of trouble, and people who complain and talk non-stop but do not contribute anything positive and tangible, it's pretty hard to man up <strong>all </strong>our ships, tanks and airplanes with chest-thumping, enthusiastic men and women who will sacrifice everything for the country. Being in the force, I must say that <strong>MOST</strong> personnel are dedicated and professional. But there are bound to be black sheep, as with any organisation. These get weeded out of the system with time, but sometimes they cause damage before they can get removed.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Blind spots from radars? My dear, the APVs should be decommisioned. They cannot even detect and evade a slower moving vessel at sea. She cannot evade a vessel that is of non-combat nature.</strong></blockquote>Why not? Why can't there be a blind spot on the radar? Maybe a mast is in the way, and that degrades the radar return from that sector. Yes, it's not probable that a modern ship like the Courageous has a blind spot still, but I was just throwing up examples to show you that you do not know all the details.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Radar's down? Well hope the radio's not down. And if the former was the case, i am sure the Naval HQ will be informed of the breakdown. That should be clear on paperwork once the investigation reports are out.</strong></blockquote>Yes, I'm sure HQ RSN will be in the know if the radar is down. So, wait for the report! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Some people might hang. Maybe not. But whatever it is, 4 personnel died on duty. Yes, there might be countless cases of other "covered up" incidents that the public does not hear about, but these who died in silence are no less worthy of our gratitude than the 4 women who died.<br><br>[/ramble]<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
