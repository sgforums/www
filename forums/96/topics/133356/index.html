The recent report of SgGirls showcase of school girls behaving intimately, and has been featured in the news as well. This certainly has blown out of proportions.<br><br>Ok own up...<br><br>What has happened to our moral code of conduct, certainly these girls are just trying to have fun with poses. I wondered after this report, the girls would be ashamed, well the poses are nothing provocative, not even sexy at all. The report is due to "a few" concerned parents that are paranoid with their "little ger" pictures on the net.<br><br>Certainly they are more than just paranoids, to make a mountain out of a molehill.<br><br>And the report is out.<br><br>Its a fact that all girl schools, girls become bold and tomboyish, but lesbiansim? What are they saying, a lesbian would in no way do that pose, and they are just trying to make the matter complicated. Even though I have no idea on the phase of developement for teenage girls, there is something that girls wun talk about, they just go for the fun factor.<br><br>Time for show<br><br>While we are still a conservative society, I think this report really has gotten far as to "dealing" with lesbianism. So much for the gay nonsense, now we has another one on lesbiansim. Shutting down the website is cartainly making more seeds for growth as history shows, that not even something illegal and media ought to have resolve with the schools invlolved, what can MOE do about the matter anyway?<br><br>Just I thought that there is a quiet and peaceful weekend, this "hell" break loose and we would have another "crisis" to handle.</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Com'on, as we all know, lesbianism is a phase tt is very prevalent in schools, esp girl schools. Parents r juz living in denial tt their kids r still their sweet innocent babies. Sb should juz educate the parents wat is exactly going on so tt there will be less reports abt sggirls in the news.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Sunday Times, 22 May 05 Â– talk Â– page 40<br><br>Sex, youth and education<br><br>Upon reflection of Ms Chua Xi MinÂ’s letter Â“Give sex education at a younger ageÂ” (ST, May 16) which speculated that only a small number of young people have casual sex, I question how these adolescents made their decision to have sex prematurely.<br><br>The young today are exposed to an endless stream of information via the Internet.<br><br>Unlike generations before, they realize very early there is a world outside of what they are familiar with.<br><br>Also, with confidence gained from the Internet, they dare to question the perceptions of their elders.<br><br>How can sex education be presented to them so they gain a healthy perception of sex?  We can let the young know that people have sex for different reasons, but the healthiest reasons are for love or having children within marriage.<br><br>Of course, people also do it for pleasure, money or gratification.  Sheltering the young from this may make them think there is a Â“dark sideÂ” to sex when it is just the other side of sex.<br><br><strong>However, we need to let them know there are consequences to having sex in a careless or unhealthy way.</strong><br><br>By teaching them how casual sex or promiscuity can lead to sexually transmitted disease like HIV, we can help them understand the frailty of life when it is not valued.<br><br><strong>Let the young make their own informed decisions for better or worse.  We need to create a next generation who take responsibility for their deeds, be it good or bad</strong><br><br>by : Jueliana Tay Huimin (Ms)<br></div>

A few intimate photographs between girls and more front page of sggirls.<br><br>Then the documentary centered on a teenage girl who was found posting intimate photos of her with her girl friend on the website by her father.  The view points from the girl and the father were featured.  Then the view points by the public, including house wife, Ah Gong and Ah Ma, student, educator, and counselor were featured.<br><br>The view points centered as to why a teenage girl is interested with another girl instead of opposite sex.  Is this behavior wrong or just a passing phase of life!  Is this behavior popular or growing popular amongst the teenage girls!  Should this behavior be arrested!  How this behavior is being viewed by the educators and counselors etc!<br><br>The view points expressed by the educators and counselors were most encouraging.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am very sure the girl made those poses and photographed them for fun only. I doubt she was romantically interested in the other girl she was photographed with. What did the counselor and educators have to say about the whole issue? Was it blown out of proportion?</div>

The relationship between boys and girls will be more normal from then onward.<br></div>
