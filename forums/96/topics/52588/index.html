            <div class='col-md body'>The Female is the deadlier of the species... if there wasn't enough proof read this article from News.com.au<br><br>==================================================<br><blockquote>Marriage 'tames' geniuses, criminals<br>From correspondents in Paris<br>July 10, 2003<br><br>CREATIVE genius and crime express themselves early in men but both are turned off almost like a tap if a man gets married and has children, a study says.<br><br>Satoshi Kanazawa, a psychologist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, compiled a database of the biographies of 280 great scientists, noting their age at the time when they made their greatest work.<br><br>The data remarkably concur with the brutal observation made by Albert Einstein, who wrote in 1942: "A person who has not made his great contribution to science before the age of 30 will never do so."<br><br>"Scientific productivity indeed fades with age," Kanazawa says. "Two-thirds (of all scientists) will have made their most significant contributions before their mid-thirties."<br><br>But, regardless of age, the great minds who married virtually kissed goodbye to making any further glorious additions to their CV.<br><br>Within five years of making their nuptial vows, nearly a quarter of married scientists had made their last significant contribution to history's Hall of Fame.<br><br>"Scientists rather quickly desist [from their careers] after their marriage, while unmarried scientists continue to make great scientific contributions later in their lives," says Kanazawa.<br><br>The energy of youth and the dampening effect of marriage, he adds, are also remarkably similar among geniuses in music, painting and writing, as well as in criminal activity.<br><br>Previous studies have documented that delinquents are overwhelmingly male, and usually start out on the road to crime in their teens.<br><br>But those who marry well subsequently stop committing crime, whereas criminals at the same age who remain unmarried tend to continue their unlawful careers.<br><br>Kanazawa suggests "a single psychological mechanism" is responsible for this: the competitive edge among young men to fight for glory and gain the attention of women. That craving drives the all-important male hormone, testosterone.<br><br>After a man settles down, the testosterone level falls, as does his creative output, Kanazawa theorises.<br><br>The study appears in in the August issue of the Journal of Research in Personality, published by the Elsevier group. </blockquote></div>
