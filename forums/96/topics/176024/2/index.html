            <div class='col-md body'>its always good to look your best, and then the girl might come or when you interact with them they will be a bit more shy shy  thus give you a upper hand. But if we are talking about those super hot model type gals they will not come to you if you just stay handsome. Firstly everyday there are so many guys kissing their ass and also because gals like to throw test at men to see if he is a real man or just a handsome boy.<br>So be ready for the test.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
