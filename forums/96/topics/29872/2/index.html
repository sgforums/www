As for the second gal, i tink its jus a crush, u can forget her.. looks are not impt, as long presentable can liao and wat most matters is yr personality and heart.. dun dwell on yr looks too much, dun lets girl bully u!! mus be a man... Maybe someone will appreciate u, dun waste time on one-sided luv...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Wen^Chu,<br><br>Stop being pessimistic and start gaining some confident. Ugly so what?<br><br>Being presentable is the first stage of gaining self confidence.<br><br>culture ur inner self to tolerate(I believe u've done that), love and show empathy towards others, even animals.<br><br>ur crash on the girls is a normal part to ur life, an episode in ur fate to learn how to appreciate, love and give ur feelings to an opposite sex. u cannot possibly give love to every girl u met, there must be a "most important person" in ur life.<br><br>A girl with boyfriend simply means :<br><br>"a person whom she adores offers protection, understanding, tolerance, acceptance and love to her."<br><br>if u think u can offer more than the above, no harm trying.<br><br>of course, mutual chemistry is important.<br><br>cheer up, and look far.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, some advice here. Take it or leave it.<br><br>I used to be like you, very shy. Never started a conversation with a girl. If girl talk to me, sure blush one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Coming from an all boys school, don't know how to act around girls.<br><br>got a lot of crushes before, but never act on them, also felt that I'm quite ugly, therefore no confidence.<br><br>I changed when I had to live overseas for some time. I started seeing myself in a different light. So my advice for you is ...<br><br>a) start building on your self confidence. You think you are ugly. but I bet you that there are some girls who will think you look good. Also, don't harp on your looks too much. Think abt what else you have to offer, like sense of humor, kindness, a big heart, etc. You'll find that your character is more impt than your looks<br><br>b) widen your circle : increase your social circle. Join in some activities to get to know more friends. This is expose you to more people, esp girls. With more interaction, you'll find yourself more open and less and less shy. You might even be able to talk to girls more  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>A little tip : girls like guys who are a bit more confident, esp former shy guys !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>since they then to be good listeners and more attentive, and they work harder for their gfs since they believe they are not too attractive.<br><br>soon, you'll find that you begin to feel more at ease with the oppposite sex and able to interact better. Also, don't dwell too much on those girls. Since they have bf already, just be normal friends with them. Move on in your life.<br><br></div>
