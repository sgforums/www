            <div class='col-md body'>There was a girl, who never had a bf before. When one day, a guy she knew well proposed to her to be his gf, she smiled and gladly accepted him.<br><br>But day by day, she began to feel a little stressed and worried. The guy had been good to her, but strangely she can't make herself commit to loving the guy. She felt bad in her heart. Alas, when she could hold no more, she brought the guy out, and asked for a break-up.<br><br>The guy was shocked. He tried his very best to salvage the relationship. He tried to console the girl that things can be worked out. But the girl replied with red watery eyes, that she felt it was unfair for him, and it made her felt guilty and heavy.<br><br>Finally, when the last shimmer of hope was gone, both of them parted hands, with a promise, to remain as friends.<br><br>Yet day by day, the guy thought of the girl, wondering secretly, if there'd ever be a miracle. But he knew that, it'd be up to the girl.<br><br>Qn : If you were the guy, what would you do?</div>

You know it deep within you that 99.99% nobody could last their first relation to the end of time - you must realise that your arrival in her life is not just because YOU wanted to be together - rather you came into her life - taught her the meaning of love and what its actually is - that's the most important thing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She learned, she grew - you must and should be happy for her because she grow along with you until when its time to move on.
