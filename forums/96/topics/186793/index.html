            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, my colleague and I went to a pub after our work. The female staffs there are pretty and they dress skimpily. TtÂ’s exactly what I like abt it. Hahaz..<br><br>We get to know 3 of them. I asked the 3 of them the same qns. I asked them for their age. The 1st and 2nd gal asked me to guess their age and managed to know their ages. However, when I popped the qns to the 3rd gal, <strong>she was turned off completely and started to give attitude.</strong> I was kinda offended by her attitude..<br><br><strong>Is this the way she treats her customers?</strong><br>Even if she dun wanna ans my qns, she dun have to give attitude. Her job is to entertain customers and I dun think sheÂ’s doing her job.<br><br><strong>Or did I ask the wrong qns??</strong></div>

It could lead to humour or tension. It all depends how well you know the person you're speaking to.<br>You obviously don't ask a girl on the street what's her Cup size do you?<br>But if you've a gal buddy, i'm sure she'd take your question lightly and answer you.<br><br>2i) Age is not a secret. But everyone have the right to protect themselves. of their personal identity/details.<br>2ii) Yes, question about age to some women is as sensitive/offensive<br><br>as if you're asking about her panties she wear<br>OR her makeup don't look good on her.<br>OR how are her parents (her parents died)<br><br>3) If she didn't want to answer you, let it go.<br>She is under NO OBLIGATION to lie to you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the comments. I really appreciate it.<br><strong>I think tt the problem is with me and I would like to apologise to u guys.<br>Sorry abt tt..</strong><br><br>Anyway, currently IÂ’m a part-time waiter in a restaurant and I know tt itÂ’s definitely wrong to give attitude when IÂ’m offended by customers. Even if we are really pissed off by unreasonable customers, we still have to put on smiles on our faces and shld never ever give attitudes. In F &amp; B industry or rather service line, not only we must never offend our customers, but we must also provide our best services to them. I know tt the 3rd gal is offended by my qns, but she does not have to give attitude rite? Yes, she has the rights not to serve me, but I would appreciate if she can jus smile and walk away rather than ignoring me and giving attitude..<br><br>Seriously, I must really think carefully b4 I speak or ask any qns cus I seems to have offended ppl with my words..<br>Once again, sorry guys..<br></div>

But IÂ’ll answer the qns cus question about age to me, maybe to most men, is definitely not sensitive/offensive.<br><br>1 more thing, silv3rgal, may I know ur age?? (Here comes my habit again. Sorry..)<br>Cus looking at ur post. U sounds rather mature..<br></div>
