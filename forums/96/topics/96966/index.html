            <div class='col-md body'>Dear  friend,<br><br>A little checklist for yourself Â… now is the time to discover yourself Â– what kind of person you are.  You may be in either in one of the category as listed<br>A Fact-Denier, a Risk Taker, a doubter or a believer.<br><br>Just give yourself a few minutes Â… to answer all this questions.<br><br>Q1 Do you believe that World War II ever existed ? Ask yourself what is the reason for your answer.<br><br>Most people would say that they do believe based on the facts.<br><br>Q2 Next, if you are born in the Year 4004, would you ever believe that World War II ever occur in 1939 Â– 1945 ? Since the event has happened more than 2000 years ago based on Year 4004.<br><br>Most probably, by the Year 4004Â… there could be three groups Â– those who believe, those who donÂ’t believe and those who are unsure. This partly because due to changes in environment ( E.g. New building, or removal of historical sites) The question is which group would you be in. People donÂ’t realised that even if they donÂ’t believeÂ… that doesnÂ’t mean the event didnÂ’t actually take place at all.<br><br>Over here those who donÂ’t believe are classified as a fact denier or a doubter. Those who believe are classified as a believer since they wouldnÂ’t have much evidence to proof what they believe in unless they have relevant evidence.<br><br>Q! Do you believe in supernatural ? I mean do you believe there is GOD out there that govern the universe ? Yes, No or Unsure.<br><br>Q2 Done a survey recentlyÂ… people are unsure of where they are heading  after they depart from this earth. Yes, No or Unsure.<br><br>Q3 An interesting question is that people purchase insurance as a SavingÂ’s plan and also as a backup source for their family whom they love dearly. But they have no interest in where they are heading. Yes, No or Unsure.<br><br>Now if someone knows what is out there after death, would you believe him or not ? If he tells you that there is a heaven and hell out there, would you believe him ?<br><br>Before you dump this paper, please refrain and read on.<br><br>There are many who has a near Â–death experience. Some went to hell, some experience terrible darkness, some experience awesome light, some encounter JESUS.<br><br>Some people might think these people who claim to have these experiences are telling lies.<br><br>Now this is the question. To disbelieve it or simply ignore it like as though itÂ’s another unknown mystery on earth . LetÂ’s be honest with ourselves. Deep in our heart, we want to know if these are true about life after death. If there is a heaven and hell, no one in his right mind would choose hell. If you says that you donÂ’t bother, that is the most absurd answer.<br><br>If a person really doesnÂ’t bother, then why bother to study, why bother to work, why bother too eat, why bother to live when you know everyone has to die. LetÂ’s us be honest. The reason is because we want to live. We have to know the truth.<br><br>Nobody in his right human mind would want to go to hell if there is one. People who had experience near-death, went to hell didnÂ’t see anyone enjoying being in that place. ItÂ’s dark and hot as they described it.<br><br>I am just one of you who want to know if these are true. I read the articles by different authors. The description of the experiences have something in common about hell and JESUS. If these people are telling lies, they would have to sit down together at the table and write a similar experience. But these people are from different ages, different races , different countries and from all walks of life.<br><br>Is what the bible described about JESUS, heaven and hell are true ? Honestly, there are three answers to this question. Â“No, it not trueÂ”, Â“Not SureÂ” or Â“Yes, it is trueÂ”<br><br>LetÂ’s assume itÂ’s not true.<br><br>Then why are there miracles happening relating to JESUS on earth. People who got miraculously healed. These people who had their near-death experiences Â– why do they see JESUS and furthermore they are hardcore non-believers ( People who donÂ’t believe in JESUS). Why not see other religious gods. Some only see light but they believe is JESUS when they woke up from death. Question is why JESUS and not other gods ? They know itÂ’s HIM. Are all of them telling lies What are then their objectives ? Money, fame, playing a prank ? All of them ? ( millions of believers in JESUS on earth are all blind ?) WowÂ…it harder to believe this conspiracy than winning a lottery.<br><br>Refering back to the bible then, JESUS says that He is the light of the world (John 9:5). These people doesnÂ’t know the bible well but they know the light is from JESUS.<br><br>For your information, donÂ’t even think hell are only for bad guys and ladies.<br>Please read the true account of these who are highly educated professional people. They are not murderers nor what the world define bad guys are. Good deeds doesnÂ’t qualify us to be in heaven. If that is a criteria, how many good deeds must you do to be in heaven and how many good deeds to cover for each wrong doing ? If that is possible, I can cover up my murder by doing good deeds. If good deeds can get us to heaven, then there is no reason for JESUS to die.<br><br>http://www.near-death.com/forum/nde/000/88.html<br><br>http://www.near-death.com/forum/nde/000/69.html<br><br>http://www.near-death.com/forum/nde/000/92.html<br><br>They experienced darkness and they donÂ’t know why they are there. One of them is a scientist. You know some scientist doesnÂ’t believe in GOD because to them, evidence are required. He died and enter into darkness. Darkness they described is not what you normally do by switching off the room light. It is darkness where you felt no human presence but only presence of loneliness and fear.<br><br>Therefore, we have to made a choice Â– ( I donÂ’t believe, or I believe it and what shall I do about it )<br><br>JESUS came to world to die for our sins. No one in this world is sinless. He wants us to believe in Him. Ask a friend who is a christian what is meant to believe in Him. It may seems simple but yet there are many who refuse to believe in that name. You may think this is a cook-up fairy tale. Ponder again. Fairy tales are dead tales. It has no power. I can make up any name (Example, Henry) and say Henry is the Son of GOD. It wonÂ’t cause millions of followers to believe in Henry.<br><br>While you are alive, letÂ’s made our choice wisely. Not everyone has a second chance to return to earth alive.<br><br>"For the wages of sin is death." - Romans 6:23a<br>"And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." - Revelation 20:15<br><br>"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." - Romans 5:8<br><br>Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." - Acts 4:12<br><br>"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" - 1 Timothy 2:5<br><br>"That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." - Romans 10:9<br><br>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name" - John 1:12<br><br>You can right now pray to receive JESUS by simply asking Him to come into your life.<br><br>God knows your heart and is not so concerned with your words as He is with the attitude of your heart. The following is a suggested prayer:<br><br>"Lord Jesus, I need You. Thank You for dying on the cross for my sins. I open the door of my life and receive You as my Savior and Lord. Thank You for forgiving my sins and giving me eternal life. Take control of the throne of my life. Make me the kind of person You want me to be."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, put it this way, i'll be living in paradise and you'll be sufferring too much to even care about the person next to you. Dun forget, you can't die again so you'll probably be so desperate, i'll bet you'll eat the person next to you if you could.<br><br>In anycase, dude, this is not the way to reach out to non-believers. That's how you preach in a church. If you wanna reach out, pray for them. Because it doesn't matter what you say or do, it all matters on how willing they are to open up. And that, you gotta let God do it. Remember, as Christians we are there not to force other people to convert, but to reap God's harvest that he has already sown. So be patient and wait.</div>
