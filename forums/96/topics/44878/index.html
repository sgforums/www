            <div class='col-md body'>Here is a real life account:<br><br>I have got to know this girl, named L through my best guy-friend, named A. Girl L used to be his girlfriend, but have already broken-off for years, yet he is still interested to get her back. My initial impression of her ain't good and definitely not a girl I would be interested.<br><br>However, as we got to know each other better, a bond developed since we can really "click" well. Knowing her to be a flirt, I never did have any intention to go after her at all. But fate has it the other way, she was hot over me, calling me everyday, keep asking me to meet her, etc etc. And in the end, I give in and started a relationship with her. But at the same time, after my best guy-friend found out, I lost our friendship.<br><br>Well...there is a long story to continue but I will stop here...I lost both, friendship with my guy-friend, and relationship with girl L. Now, girl L and I are still close friends, friends who understands each other really well. And I also found out, she was interested in me initially because of the fact that no guys have ever given her the cold shoulder I gave her, no guys have ever not look at her, admire her beauty.</div>
