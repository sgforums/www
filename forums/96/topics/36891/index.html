            <div class='col-md body'>Comprehending Engineers - Take One<br>Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said,<br>"Where<br>did you get such a great bike?" The second engineer replied, "Well,=20<br>I<br>was<br>walking along yesterday minding my own business when a Beautiful=20<br>woman<br>rode<br>up on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her<br>clothes<br>and said, "Take what you want." The second engineer nodded=20<br>approvingly,<br>"Good choice; the clothes wouldn't have fit anyway."<br><br>Lesson: Don't bother to drop even the most obvious hint, they can't<br>catch<br>anyway.<br>(This is a reality!  If you don't believe, test them!)<br><br>Comprehending Engineers - Take Two<br>To the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the=20<br>glass<br>half<br>empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to=20<br>be.<br><br>Lesson: There is no philosophy to talk abt but calculations and<br>calculations...<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Three<br>A pastor, a doctor, and an engineer were waiting one morning for a<br>particularly slow group of golfers. The engineer fumed, "What's=20<br>with<br>these<br>guys? We must have been waiting for 15 minutes!" The doctor chimed=20<br>in,<br>"I<br>don't know, but I've never seen such ineptitude". The pastor said,<br>"Hey,<br>here comes the greens keeper. Let's have a word with him." "Hi=20<br>John.<br>Say,<br>what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't=20<br>they?"<br>The<br>greens keeper replied, "Oh! , yes, that's a group of blind=20<br>firefighters.<br>They<br>lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we<br>always<br>let them play for free anytime." The group was silent for a moment.<br>Then the<br>pastor said, "That's so sad I think I will say a special prayer for<br>them<br>tonight." The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact my<br>ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for=20<br>them."<br>The<br>engineer, after much thought said, "Why can't these guys play at<br>night?"<br><br>Lesson: No emotions please, only practicality works here.<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Four<br>What is the difference between Mechanical Engineers and Civil<br>Engineers?<br>Mechanical Engineers build weapons; Civil Engineers build targets.<br><br>Lesson: They build and build and build and build and... to=20<br>compliment<br>one<br>another.<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Five<br>Three engineering students were gathered together discussing the<br>possible<br>designers of the human body. One said, "It was a mechanical=20<br>engineer.<br>Just<br>look at all the joints." Another said, "No, it was an electrical<br>engineer.<br>The nervous system has many thousands of electrical connections."=20<br>The<br>last<br>said, "Actually it was a civil engineer. Who else would run a toxic<br>waste<br>pipeline through a recreational area?"<br><br>Lesson: All of them have their own theories.  None for believing!<br><br>! ;Comprehending Engineers -Take Six<br>"Normal people believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.=20<br>Engineers<br>believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features=20<br>yet."<br><br>Lesson: They are complicated and twisted.<br><br>Comprehending Engineers -Take Seven<br>An architect, an artist, and an engineer were discussing whether it=20<br>was<br>better to spend time with a wife or a mistress. The architect said=20<br>he<br>enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid foundation for an=20<br>enduring<br>relationship. The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress,<br>because of<br>the passion and mystery he found there. The engineer said, "I like<br>both."<br>"Both?" "Yeah," replied the engineer. "If you have a wife and a<br>mistress,<br>they will each assume you are spending time with the other woman,=20<br>and<br>you<br>can go to the lab and get some work done."<br><br>Lesson: Gals, NEVER fall for an engineer!!!<br><br>Comprehending Engineers - Take Eight<br>An engineer was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to=20<br>him<br>and<br>said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess." He=20<br>bent<br>over,<br>picked up the frog and put it in his pocket. The frog spoke up=20<br>again<br>and<br>said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I<br>will<br>stay with you for one week." The  engineer took the frog out of his<br>pocket,<br>smiled at it and returned it to the pocket. The frog then cried=20<br>out,<br>"If you<br>kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess I'll st! ay with=20<br>you<br>and do<br>ANYTHING you want." Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at=20<br>it<br>and<br>put it back into his pocket. Finally, the frog asked, "What is the<br>matter?<br>I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for=20<br>a<br>week<br>and do anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?" The engineer=20<br>said,<br>"Look<br>I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend, but a TALKING<br>frog, now<br>that's cool!<br><br>Lesson: Once again, gals, NEVER fall for an engineer!!!!!<br><br>=<br>=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=<br>=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=<br>=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br><br>Now we know why so many engineers are single.  ahahaha...<br><br>Engineers,<br>please don't be offended, this is just a joke, we all know you are<br>great<br>people. 8-)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A mechanical engineer, a electrical engineer and a civil engineer got together for a discussion on the greatness of their work and speculated wat kind of engineer God was.<br><br>The mehcanical engineer said: God must have been a mehcanical engineer for designing the best pump that can last so long without needing maintenance, the human heart.<br><br>The electrical engineer beg to differ: Nope, God must be an electrical engineer for masterminding the concept of the brain using electrical pulses in the most incredible way.<br><br>The civil engineer then quipped: You are all wrong.
