            <div class='col-md body'>Hello people sorry to interrupt i need some advice pls. Well i recently broke off with my gf of 2 yrs plus and i still felt that i liked her. She wanted this break up and i found out there she is seeing another guys now. The problem is she still acts innocent in front of friends especially those whom she and I knew. Even her closest friends say she's very ungrateful because of the things i did for her during these past 2 yrs. u see i met her while she was real down and i actually consoled her that time before we actually went into this relationship. She depended a lot on me and i made her realize how strong she should be but in e end this is what happens after all that i had done for her. What should i do? I still have to see her once a week or twice maybe damnit.... Many others say forget it. Show her u can live w/o her since she has the heart to do this. If she can do this to do she will do it to others too and she will regret finally.. I really need advice and not some brothers playing a joke or a fool thanks a lot.</div>

She did depended alot on you and you bring the best out of herself and regain her steps again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So what if when her wings healed and she decided to fly away? Does it really matters since in the first place she desire to free herself from this relationship?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In the first place does she really loves you during these 2 years period and not because she just 'NEEDED' someone to be there when she is low? - There are significiant differences and impacts.<br><br>Well, maybe you have already sort all that out - but she chose to leave you on the assumption that she lost the original feeling and chemistry for you. Regardless of what you might do - when her feelings is gone, its rather difficult to win her back, because she <strong>wants</strong> to leave.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let her go... because the both of you did learn from this relation - which is more important than physical togetherness that speaks nothing of feelings inside.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br></div>
