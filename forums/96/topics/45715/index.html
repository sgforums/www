You have no patience for flirting and can't be<br>bothered with someone who is trying to be coy, cute, demure,<br>and subtly enticing. You are an up front person. When it<br>comes to sex, it's action that counts not obscure hints.<br>Your mate's physical attractiveness is important to you. You<br>find the chase and challenge of the "hunt" invigorating.

A person must be<br>intellectually stimulating or you are not interested<br>sexually. You need a friend for a lover and a companion for<br>a bedmate. You hate disharmony and disruption, but you do<br>enjoy a good argument once in a while it seems to stir<br>things up.
