But since he was happy with his job,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;he<br>&gt; &gt;had no<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;immediate plans of going home.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;One day, he received a wedding invitation. His girlfriend was<br>&gt; &gt;scheduled to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;be married.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;To whom? To the mailman bringing regularly the letters of her<br>&gt; &gt;boyfriend!<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Indeed, distance does make hearts flounder. The poor boyfriend<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;surely explained, "What went wrong? I sent her letters,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;chocolates, and<br>&gt; &gt;flowers."<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;When relationships go wrong, the list of things given and done for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the person usually crops up. We say, "I have given you this and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that... I<br>&gt; &gt;have<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;done these things for you." It seems that love is simply proven by<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the bestowal of gifts and favours. But while presents are<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;important, love demands what is: 'presence of the beloved'.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I have observed for instance, the orchids of my mother's. When<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;she's<br>&gt; &gt;away<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;for a long time, they are unhealthy and many of them wither. But<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;when<br>&gt; &gt;she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;is around, they bloom with beautiful flowers. My mother does<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;nothing exceptional. She just spends much time talking and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;caressing them. I<br>&gt; &gt;guess<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;persons all the more require a caring presence.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Love is fundamentally a commitment to a person. We may be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;committed to<br>&gt; &gt;our<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;business, job, hobby, sports and clubs, but strictly speaking,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;they<br>&gt; &gt;cannot<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;love us back. Only a person can love us in return, and for that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;matter<br>&gt; &gt;the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;highest commitment as human beings is spending time with those<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;persons<br>&gt; &gt;we<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;love. And since people need affection and nourishment, material<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;things<br>&gt; &gt;can<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;only help up to a certain degree in fostering love. But it can<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;never replace the greatest gift of presence because everyone needs<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;someone -<br>&gt; &gt;be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it friends, parents, siblings or simply that 'special' one.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Being there for someone need not necessary mean having to say a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;lot.<br>&gt; &gt;Words<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;are sometimes redundant. Remember that 'presence' (to be there for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;someone)<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;is more than enough.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>i like tis story...</strong><br>They have been married for two years. He loves literature and often posts his work on the net, but nobody ever reads them. He is also into photography, and he handled their wedding photos. He loves her very much and likewise with her. She has a quick temper, and always bullies him. He is a gentleman, and always gives in to her. Today sheÂ’s been Â“wilfulÂ” again.<br><br>Her: Â“Why canÂ’t you be the photographer for my friendÂ’s wedding? She promised sheÂ’d pay.Â”<br>Him: Â“I donÂ’t have time that day.Â”<br>Her: Â“Humpf!Â”<br>Him: Â“Huh?Â”<br>Her: Â“DonÂ’t have time? Write less of those novels, and you will have all the time you need.Â”<br>Him: Â“IÂ…someone will definitely recognize my work some day.Â”<br>Her: Â“Humpf! I donÂ’t care youÂ’ll have to do it for her.Â”<br>Him: Â“No.Â”<br>Her: Â“Just this once.Â”<br>Him: Â“No.Â”<br><br>NegotiationÂ’s broken.<br><br>So, she gave the final warning: Â“Give me a Yes within three days, or elseÂ…Â”<br><br>First day. She Â“withheldÂ” the kitchen, bathroom, computer, refrigerator, televisionÂ…Except the double-bed, to show her Â“benevolenceÂ”.<br>Of course, she has to sleep on it too. He didnÂ’t mind, as he still has some cash in his pocket.<br><br>Second day. She conducted a raid and removed everything from his pockets, and warned, Â“Seek any external help, and you bear the consequences.Â”<br>HeÂ’s nervous now. Night. On the bed. He begs for mercy, hoping that sheÂ’ll end this state. She doesnÂ’t give a damn. No way is she giving in, whatever he says. Until he agrees.<br><br>Third day. Night. On the bed.<br>HeÂ’s lying on the bed, looking to one side.<br>SheÂ’s lying on the bed, looking to the other side.<br><br>Him: Â“We need to talk.Â”<br>Her: Â“Unless itÂ’s about the wedding, forget it.Â”<br>Him: Â“ItÂ’s something very important.Â”<br>She remains silent.<br>Him: Â“LetÂ’s get a divorce.Â”<br>She did not believe her ears.<br>Him: Â“I got to know a girl.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s totally angry and wanted to hit him. But she held it down, wanting to let him finish. But her eyes already felt wet. He took a photo out from his chest.<br>Probably from his undershirt pocket, thatÂ’s the only place she didnÂ’t go through yesterday. How careless.<br><br>Him: Â“SheÂ’s a nice girl.Â”<br>Her tears fell.<br>Him: Â“She has a good personality too.Â”<br>SheÂ’s heartbroken, because he puts a photo of some other girl Â“close to his heartÂ”.<br>Him: Â“She says that sheÂ’ll support me fully in my pursue for literature after we get married.Â”<br>SheÂ’s very jealous, because she said the same thing in the past.<br>Him: Â“She loves me truly.Â”<br>She wishes to sit up and scream at him: Â“DonÂ’t I?Â”<br>Him: Â“So, I think she wonÂ’t force me to do something that I donÂ’t want to do.Â”<br>SheÂ’s thinking, but the rage wonÂ’t subside.<br>Him: Â“Want to take a look at the photo I took for her?Â”<br>Her: Â“Â…..!Â”<br><br>He brings the photo before her eyes.<br>SheÂ’s in a total rage, hits his hands away and leaves a burning mark of a slap on his face.<br>He signs. She cries.<br>He puts the photo back into his pocket. She pulls her hand back under the blanket.<br>He turns off the light and sleeps.<br>She turns on the light, and sits up.<br>HeÂ’s asleep. She lost sleep.<br>She regrets treating him the way she did.<br>She cried again, and thought about a lot of things.<br><br>She wants to wake him up.<br>She wants to have an intimate talk with him.<br>She doesnÂ’t want to push him anymore.<br>She stares at his chest. She wants to see how the girl looks.<br>She slips the photo out. She wanted to cry, and she wanted to laugh.<br>ItÂ’s a nicely taken photo of herself. A photo he took for her.<br>She bends down, and kissed him on his cheek.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.</span><br></div>
