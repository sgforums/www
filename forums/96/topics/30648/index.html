            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mr_cool:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear Frens, It's worth reading ....<br><br>A man and his girlfriend were married. It was a large celebration. All<br>of<br>their friends and family came to see the lovely ceremony and to take<br>part of<br>the  festivities and celebrations. A wonderful time was had by all.<br><br>The bride was gorgeous in her white wedding gown and the groom was very<br>dashing in his black tuxedo. Everyone could tell that the love they had<br>for<br>each  other was true.<br><br>A few months later, the wife comes to the husband with a proposal: I<br>read in<br>a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage." she<br>offered. "Each of us will write a list of the thingst hat we find  a<br>bit<br>annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix<br>them<br>together and make our lives happier together."<br><br>The husband agreed. So each of them went to a separate room in the<br>house and<br>thought of the things that annoyed them about the other. They thought<br>about<br>this question for the rest of the day and wrote down what they came up<br>with.<br><br>The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would<br>go<br>over their lists.<br><br>"I'll start," offered the wife. She took out her list. It had many<br>items on<br>it. Enough to fill 3 pages, in fact. As she started reading the list of<br>the<br>little annoyances, she noticed that tears were starting to appear in<br>her<br>husband's eyes.<br><br>"What's wrong?" she asked.   "Nothing" the husband replied, "keep<br>reading<br>your list."  The wife continued to read until she had read all three<br>pages<br>to her husband. She neatly placed her list on the table and folded her<br>hands<br>over top of it.<br><br>"Now, you read your list and then we'll talk about the things on both<br>of our<br>lists." She said happily.<br><br>Quietly the husband stated, "I don't have anything on my list. I think<br>that<br>you are perfect the way that you are. I don't want you to change<br>anything<br>for  me. You are lovely and wonderful and I wouldn't want to try and<br>change<br>anything  about you."<br><br>The wife, touched by his honesty and the depth of his love for her and<br>his<br>acceptance of her, turned her head and wept.<br><br>In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and<br>annoyed. We don't really have to go looking for them. We have a<br>wonderful<br>world  that is full of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in<br>this<br>world looking  for the bad, disappointing or annoying when we can look<br>around us, and see the  wondrous things before us? I believe that we<br>are<br>happiest when we see and praise the good and try our best to forget the<br>bad.<br><br></div></blockquote>this is sent to me by an internet pal.there is still some more.if you all like it i can post it here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>L O V E - A Journey<br><br>Why hold someone back... when u know u don't love them...<br>&gt; &gt; Why keep them to yourself... when u know you won't wanna have them?<br>&gt; &gt; Why let them miss other chances...when they can have them? If you really<br>&gt; &gt; don't love someone....le them go...hurt them NOW... not later...for a<br>&gt; &gt; longer relationship builds stronger emotions...<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; A good relationship isn't a game you play or an ego trip you take. It is<br>&gt; &gt; about love and two people.<br>&gt; &gt; Loving someone can give us the greatest joy we can ever know and it can<br>&gt; &gt; hurt more than we can believe too.<br>&gt; &gt; When it does not really hurt when that person did something<br>disappointing<br>&gt; &gt; to you, but really hurts when you see that person in pain and sadness,<br>&gt; then<br>&gt; &gt; you know you truly love that person.<br>&gt; &gt; Loving someone means you should be ready to experience heartache and<br>&gt; &gt; happiness at the same time.That's the reward and that's the risk. Unless<br>&gt; we<br>&gt; &gt; are willing to experience it, we will never really know what it's like<br>to<br>&gt; &gt; love and be loved.<br>&gt; &gt; Sharing love is probably the most valuable and meaningful experience a<br>&gt; &gt; person can ever have.And there's a difference between being in love with<br>&gt; &gt; someone and loving someone.<br>&gt; &gt; It's the difference between a love that's fickle,wild and short-lived<br>and<br>&gt; &gt; one that's tender and passionate,nurturing and lasts a long time. The<br>&gt; first<br>&gt; &gt; is easy.<br>&gt; &gt; The second, the one that really matters to all of us,takes work because<br>&gt; &gt; it's about keeping a relationship.<br>&gt; &gt; Loving someone takes efforts. We have to be able to communicate with<br>each<br>&gt; &gt; other. Nobody can read anyone else's mind. We always presume that our<br>&gt; &gt; partner knows what we think and feel. Maybe in time we might be able to<br>&gt; &gt; predict or sense each other's thoughts but it's<br>&gt; &gt; never perfect and takes time to develop. Getting the chance to love and<br>&gt; be<br>&gt; &gt; loved by someone is blessed.<br>&gt; &gt; Respect him/her for who he/she is, and not what you want him/her to be.<br>&gt; &gt; Everyone is pretty and special in his/her own special way. No one is<br>&gt; &gt; perfect.<br>&gt; &gt; It is true love which closes the gap of imperfectness to form a smooth<br>&gt; &gt; surface of acceptance for each other.<br>&gt; &gt; True love sees and accepts a person for who he/she is. It is also true<br>&gt; love<br>&gt; &gt; which makes a person change for the better. The power of true love to a<br>&gt; &gt; person is undeniable.<br>&gt; &gt; A relationship needs commitments too. What is love without commitments<br>&gt; from<br>&gt; &gt; each other anyway? It's like principles and values. Everyone has them<br>but<br>&gt; &gt; they only mean as much as we are willing to stand for them.<br>&gt; &gt; The same goes for our commitments to relationships, and the person we<br>&gt; love.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; "Love is like an antique vase. It's hard to find,hard to net, but easy<br>to<br>&gt; &gt; break."<br>&gt; &gt; Every day everywhere, people fall in love ... but just how many of these<br>&gt; &gt; relationships are self-sacrificing love, and not just relationships<br>which<br>&gt; &gt; are formed only for the intense! feeling of falling in love? I know<br>&gt; &gt; hundreds of friends who say the magical words "I love you"... but more<br>&gt; &gt; often than not, the truth is just I am IN love with you.<br>&gt; &gt; There is a difference between being in love with someone and loving<br>&gt; &gt; someone. If a person says he/she is in love with you, he/she means that<br>&gt; &gt; he/she likes you for who you are now and he/she fell in love with you<br>&gt; &gt; because of the present you. This kind of love is<br>&gt; &gt; temporary and lasts only as long as the fairytale lasts.<br>&gt; &gt; When fairy godmother comes in at midnight to whirl us back to reality,<br>we<br>&gt; &gt; see the heartache of such a relationship... where both were only IN love<br>&gt; &gt; with each other. But if a person says he/she loves you, he/she means<br>that<br>&gt; &gt; he/she loves you unconditionally for who you are now, who you were in<br>the<br>&gt; &gt; past and who you might be in the future.<br>&gt; &gt; When he/she says he/she loves you and really means it,you have to ask<br>&gt; &gt; yourself if you love him/her too or if you're in love with the idea of<br>&gt; &gt; being in love. It is very hard to see the difference through logical<br>&gt; &gt; thinking. Let your heart guide u. May you be blessed<br>&gt; &gt; on your soul-searching journey = for your soul mate.<br>&gt; &gt; ARE YOU REALLY IN LOVE? ASK YOURSELF!<br>&gt; &gt; Is this true love? Do I really love him/her? Or izzit just another<br>&gt; &gt; infatuation? R U willing to give? Even though you may not get back the<br>&gt; &gt; same amount you gave?<br>&gt; &gt; R U cheating yourself? Thinking that you really love him/her and not<br>just<br>&gt; &gt; taking him/her as a substitute for your ex-boyfriend/girlfriend?<br>Friends,<br>&gt; &gt; let today be the day....... you truly understand love.......<br>&gt; &gt; If after reading this and answering all the questions,you are very sure<br>&gt; &gt; that you love him/her,tell him/her that. Let him/her know how much you<br>&gt; love<br>&gt; &gt; him/her and that you are willing to take the risks of being hurt by<br>&gt; him/her<br>&gt; &gt; in the course of the development<br>&gt; &gt; of your relationship with him/her. This is a love that's sacrificial, R<br>U<br>&gt; &gt; ready for it? If you accept someone's philosophy that is simply their<br>&gt; &gt; rationalisation to justify their failure, you accept their failures!"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; **The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.** If<br>&gt; you<br>&gt; &gt; think something will make you happy, go for it.<br>&gt; &gt; **Remember that we pass this way only once.**<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; YoU cAn'T mAkE sOmEoNe LoVe YoU, aLl YoU cAn Do Is Be SoMeOnE wHo CaN bE<br>&gt; &gt; lOvEd, ThE rEsT iS uP tO tHe PeRsOn To ReAlIzE yOuR wOrTh~<br></div>

This is a love that's sacrificial, R<br>U<br>&gt; &gt; ready for it? If you accept someone's philosophy that is simply their<br>&gt; &gt; rationalisation to justify their failure, you accept their failures!"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; **The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.** If<br>&gt; you<br>&gt; &gt; think something will make you happy, go for it.<br>&gt; &gt; **Remember that we pass this way only once.**<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; YoU cAn'T mAkE sOmEoNe LoVe YoU, aLl YoU cAn Do Is Be SoMeOnE wHo CaN bE<br>&gt; &gt; lOvEd, ThE rEsT iS uP tO tHe PeRsOn To ReAlIzE yOuR wOrTh~<br></div></blockquote> v meaningful esp the 1st &amp; the last 2nd one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
