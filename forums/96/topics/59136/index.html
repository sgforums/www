Reality therapy.<br><br>In "Ideal Fantasy Land", we're all born equal.<br><br>But here in reality where most of us spend our days, MEN PURSUE WOMEN... and women are in control.<br><br>Men are, in fact, the WEAKER sex because of it.<br><br><strong>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE WEAKER SEX</strong><br><br>It's probably because u used to be the POSTER CHILD for the weak, Wussy, ass-kissing guy who wanted women's approval... and u've lived through so many painful situations with women that u should be given an honorary GOLD MEDAL in the sport.<br><br>My guess is that ur own weaknesses,insecurities, and failures with women freaked u out and wounded ur inner child so badly<br>that u had to become a dating guru just to overcompensate them.<br><br>Here's how I see this particular topic:<br><br>1) Everything that men strive to achieve is somehow connected to attracting a gal. Underneath it all, attracting women is at the core.<br><br>2) Men pursue women. They behave as if a single,attractive woman is a rare and valuable thing that deserves special attention. They carefully take every step as they pursue a woman because<br>they fear that she'll reject them.<br><br>3) Men are clearly obsessed with ultimately getting women "into bed". They give away much of their power in the hopes that it will help them "get laid".<br><br>4) Men believe that GETTING APPROVAL will ultimately give them a higher chance of HAVING SEX.<br><br>5) A man's powerful drive to ultimately have sex is his "Achilles Heel"... it's his greatest weakness... and most men allow it to<br>be used against them.<br><br>6) A woman INSTANTLY recognizes one of these men who lives in the FANTASY WORLD that I've just described. And women are NEVER attracted to men who want to hand over their power in<br>exchange for approval.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bum Ble Bee.....</strong><br>did u read the title of the topic properly? i said WAYS TO SHOW someone you love HOW MUCH u CARE and LOVE<br><br>what i just posted isn't about pursuing and courting, its about showing ure appreciation and love for her. And i had a gf before, so yes, i have courted before. Ppl learn from their past mistakes and experience to mature. Thats one way to make ure future relationship blossom and grow into something more fruitfull than a short term relationship.<br><br>you seem to have ure view fixed that all men are practically nothing more than a bunch of brainless hormonial hunters who always expect something out of a girl in return for their "good treatment" on women.<br><br>NOT all men are sex-weak minded as you think. Because of what they(weak-sex minded) did, u should not blame and judge others (commited-honorable) without getting to know them more properly.<br><br>You know what you are? a SEXIST. I bet u believe in girl power and those thrash. (i'm not insulting or anything, i believe women are capable of doing things that men couldn't do too) but i wish you would broadened ure mind about us men. You shouldnt judge us so fast because of what you've seen in others.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Here is a quote from you</span><br><br><strong>1) Everything that men strive to achieve is somehow connected to attracting a gal. Underneath it all, attracting women is at the core.<br><br>2) Men pursue women. They behave as if a single,attractive woman is a rare and valuable thing that deserves special attention. They carefully take every step as they pursue a woman because<br>they fear that she'll reject them.<br><br>3) Men are clearly obsessed with ultimately getting women "into bed". They give away much of their power in the hopes that it will help them "get laid".<br><br>4) Men believe that GETTING APPROVAL will ultimately give them a higher chance of HAVING SEX.</strong><br><br>i'm quite dissapointed with your opinion on us. NOT all men are like these. I myself believe in inner beauty and marriage before sex. I believe sex is something special and sacred that should only be shared btw a husband and wife. I hope what i said would change ure view on us =/<br><br><strong>bus &amp; hitakogi </strong>- usually a relationship is a two way thing.

            <div class='col-md body'>very interesting post.  however, i agree that not all things are possible in the list.  if you want to know more, do try reading allan and barbara pease's book, why men lie and women cry.  it's a book about the differences between men and women.<br><br>the thing with women is that you've to remember to do the small things.  guys, here's a tip for you, if u want to score points with your gf, do the small things.  like tell her daily that you love her, buy a rose for her fortnightly, constantly look out for her well being, walk side-by-side with her, hold her hand, never be too distant, always listen when she's had a hard day, but remember to tell her also if you're having a hard day and would like some time to yoiurself before you talk to her. everything u do only gives u 1 point, more sumtimes, but usually 1 point.<br><br>Ladies, the only difference between a man and a boy is the price of their toys.  guys love their toys, the bigger the better, like a car, a super computer (*drools*), and stuff. if u want to score points, remember that guys keep points differently from gals, they count things according to how 'big' it is, like work, it might score 30 points or so for them but only 1 for women. so the difference between giving them a car and a toy car would be like many many points apart. if you want to talk to a guy, get straight to the point, guys have mono tracking minds and can only keep track of 1 thing at a time. make an 'appointment' with them when u want to talk to them about your day.<br><br>Guys, just listen, go ummhmm or yes dear or something like that. but make sure that u know at least what's being tlaked about.  if the girls go into multi tracking talk, juz sit for the ride and DON'T TRY to fix anything.  listen emphatatically.<br><br>Well, guess that's it for now. all this coming from a psych student should b taken more seriously...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Lifetimes apart<br>Eons for this heart<br>To heal<br>To seal<br><br>Away the pain<br>Of life insane<br>Destruction<br>Elimination</div>
