Think of what she likes alone, and be romantic and original.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Follow her when she goes shopping (even for women's clothes) and don't stay outside the shop and wait. Be earnest and patient, and tell her your opinion on what looks good/doesn't suit her.<br><br>9) leave love notes/poems in her handbag/bag without her knowing<br><br>10) Don't give excuses when u make a mistake (eg: late for a date), but apologize and tell her how inconsiderate you are and that you'll never do it again.<br><br>11) Whenever you have an argument, try to be understanding and considerate, and NEVER bring up PAST mistakes that might help you prove your point/<br><br>12) Always be there for her when she has a problem or going through a tough time (eg: someone close died, studies isn't going to well),  but give her enough space when she wants to be alone.<br><br>12) When she/he is sharing you her/his problems, sit quietly and patiently and hear them out. If you went through similar problems, share with her/him on how u felt and what u did to deal with it.<br><br>13) When she/he has alot of work/assignments to do, lend her/him a hand. (eg: help her/him in research, run an errand)<br><br>14) Everything you do, do it because you love her WITHOUT expecting something in return<br><br>15) NEVER pressure for sex. Respect her and her decision (This is especially for the guys  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )<br><br>These are some of my ways, but if you wanna add in and share other ways pls do so.
