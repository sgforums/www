Now here are the rules<br>from the male side. These are our rules !<br><br>1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down<br><br>2. Sometimes we are not thinking about you. Live with it.<br><br>3. Saturday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.<br><br>4. Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair.<br><br>5. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.<br><br>6. Crying is blackmail.<br><br>7. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!<br><br>8. We don't remember dates. Mark birthdays and anniversaries on a calendar.<br>Remind us frequently beforehand.<br><br>9. Most guys own three pairs of shoes - tops.
