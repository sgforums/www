            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Michael Bloombird</span><br><br>The Gahmen has told disgruntled Singapore Airlines pilots that if they dislike the proposed amendment to the Trade Union Act which reduces their bargaining positions, they should consider being at the helm of alternative aerial vessels.<br><br>The Prime MinisterÂ’s Orifice made the statement after the Air Line PilotsÂ’ Association Â–Singapore (ALPA-S) expressed outrage at the proposed legislative amendment which removes the right of union members to have the final say in any negotiations with the management.<br><br>Right now, ALPA-S leaders must submit negotiated terms to the unionÂ’s members for their approval before concluding any agreement with the airlineÂ’s management. Other unions have to abide by whatever deal their leaders conclude with the management.<br><br>The proposed amendment is seen as a move to curtail the pilotsÂ’ powers after they booted out their union leaders, when they felt they got stuck with a sucky deal under which many pilots were let go or had their pay drastically cut on the basis that this was necessary for the national carrierÂ’s survival, only for Singapore Airlines to report a massive resurge in profits shortly thereafter.<br><br>Deputy Minister of State Mr. Ng Eng Cock said, Â“If the pilots donÂ’t like it, then they shouldnÂ’t fly planes. They can always go fly kite instead.Â”<br><br>Mr. Ng also chided the pilots for their confrontational attitude. Â“This kind of in-your-face approach is not Singaporean. When dealing with higher management, Singaporeans cannot come face to face, but must approach with humility, with a bottom-up approach.Â”<br><br>Said ALPA-S spokesman Captain Phang Puay Kee, Â“Is the Minister suggesting that when it comes to negotiating for jobs, we must be blow-overs? And whatÂ’s all this crap about Singapore pilots doing Singapore in? Eh, weÂ’re the ones who kena pay cut or let go, so whoÂ’s doing who, man! Â”<br><br>Captain Phang also said he was unsurprised that the Gahmen did not sympathise with pilots. Â“TheyÂ’re too atas to appreciate the on-the-ground issues faced by the airline industry.Â”<br><br>Mr. Ng denied this, saying the duty of the Gahmen was to maintain a Â“helicopter viewÂ”, even when it came to an industry of 747s.<br><br>Besides, said Mr. Ng, the moves were simply to bring ALPA-S into line with the rest of SingaporeÂ’s labour movement.<br><br>Â“A more collaborative approach works,Â” explained Mr. Ng. Â“Look at the Ministers Union, to which I belong. When we felt we deserved a pay increase, we didnÂ’t go to the press shouting that we wanted more money. Rather, we sat down and discussed the matter in a reasonable and calm fashion, and trusted our superiors to raise our salaries on our behalf. And we got what we wanted without having to go and get it approved by everyone.<br><br>-from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
