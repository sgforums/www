            <div class='col-md body'>Feng Shui For Romance<br>This is specially Tips &amp; Hints For those who are busy searching for a life-partner.<br><br>Never place your own single photo in your bedroom. Most singles like to do it. It is always advisable to remove it as soon as possible if you are at the age of marriage.  This seriously causes "sha" qi in your romance life. You stay and sleep in your bedroom every night and the "sha" qi to your romance became an object.  This causes a loneliness and tiredness in your romance. You always feel either unsafe or afraid of getting to start a relationship.<br><br>Never hang your own photo above your bed on the wall. You will never have the good feeling over any opposite sex. Hence, you will never have a good relationship. If you like to place a photo, you can choose to place a group photo, family photo or a photo taken with friends or siblings. You will soon have a chance to change it to a photo taken with your lover or husband.<br><br>Never put on a red colour bed sheet. (Refer to those only red colours without any floral designs or pictures) This usually works well with couples and creates more romance between the two of them. However, this reduces your chances for an opposite sex to fall in love with you. Or worst, they dislike you.<br><br>For those who are very eager to find a life-partner, it is always advised not to place any ornaments that is odd in number (eg.1) It would be encourage to place them in a pair.<br><br>Never ever place fish tank in a bedroom. It is not advisable to do that.<br><br>Never sleep in front of a mirror. It reflects your image. This will lead to an unsuccessful relationship where your partner may change his/her heart easily.<br>Never place any sharp objects on the writing table or anywhere in your bedroom when sleeping. It is advised to keep them in your drawer. When you are sleeping, your "yang" qi is lower; the sharp objects will damage or lower your "Yang" qi the next day. Hence you will always look restless even you have an 8 hours sleep. You properly do not have the mood or energy to woo at girls. For the ladies, you properly lose your mood to pay more attention at the guy that you admire. Soon, you will lose the motivation of starting to get to know him/her more.<br><br>For those working, it is advisable to take a bath on every morning before you go to work. You will look fresh and most of your "yin" qi will be washed away by the water element. Hence, you feel much happier, neat and confidence with yourself when wooing at the opposite sex. You will attract more attention from the opposite sex. This also base on those people going out for a first date. You will have a higher chance of getting more chances to get more attention from a lady/man. So take that in mind, Bath yourself well.<br><br>Never place slippers in front of your bedroom door. Kick them aside. It blocks your way to your success in your relationship.<br><br>For the gentleman: It is advice not to paste any sex related material like sex related posters etc. in your bedroom. You will properly lose your "yang" energy if you face these materials too much. The more "yang" energy you have, the more you can attract opposite sex. For man, it is very important to have the "yang" qi with you.<br>In Feng Shui and Astrology, than stronger the man has his "yang" qi, and the stronger the lady has her "yin" energy, the "yin yang" gathers and balances the romance life.<br><br>In Feng Shui, colour is also an important aspect in romance related topics. For instance, green colour is always not advice to paint on the wall of your bedroom. You will never succeed to make a man/lady love you no matter how hard you tried. Or rather I say, you better give up on him/her. Paint your bedroom wall with light and bright colours. Light sky blue colours will create a peaceful and stable relationship. Light pink or violet colour will create a romantic and loving relationship. Pale off white colour will create a fresh and successful relationship. Never paint red colour in your room unless you are getting married. It ends your chances to find a suitable life-partner.<br><br>There are always things not advisable to place in a bedroom. However if you follow my tips above, you probably will have a better relationship sooner. Feng Shui starts with the feeling. If you feel very comfortable to place something in your room, then it's okay. If you got a feeling of uneasy, frustration, confused or worried, you properly got an objective. It's always strongly advise to check out more with your local Feng Shui adviser.<br><br>Lastly, it is also worthwhile to clean your wardrobe often. Throw away unwanted clothes, shoes or towels often. Clear at least 3 to 4 times a year. It somehow means that you will only have a brand new relationship only if you can throw away the old/bad or unsuccessful one. Don't just leave everything in your wardrobe for thousand years and just don't bother of clearing up your wardrobe. You properly end up with tones of rubbish inside. You might as well choose to remain alone forever in your life. Your heart is filled with too much objectives that bothers you. That's properly the reason why you always feel bothered or frustrated or even get jealous easily whenever you heard the news that another of your good buddies is getting married soon. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? CLEAN UP AND TIDY UP YOUR WARDROBE TODAY! FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN HAPPINESS NOW!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
