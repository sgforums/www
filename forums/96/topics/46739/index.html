How U all counteract loneliness/bordom when most of your friends are attached/married?</div></blockquote> I am 32 now, a guy , I never gives up hope bec. I don't think I hv really go out to know girls for the past yrs , busy with work since Uni graduation, then took up my master very busy as well &amp; same time start my own biz even busier . But , never let the word " Busy " gets in your way. If you are keen to start a family you shd hv a positive attitude towards marriage &amp;o I believe one day the right girl will come along .  In S'pore nowasdays it is very common - many guys &amp; gals @ this age still single for many reasons some are of good quality in term of character, appearance ( not very beautiful/handsome kind but moderate or avg.) Some chose to remain single, like my close friend - handsome, talk , Bizman in IT service, own a car, goes golfing, k'oke, diving, roller-blading , muscular brainy, American Uni. graduate but simple afraid to commit but still goes on dates with unknowing girls ( Poor Girls - they don't know he will never commit &amp; get married) . But, most Pp are too busy with work, shy , little chance to meet guys/gals if work environment  doesn't  provide or never goes out to meet them ----------- so many reasons , stressful life style also plays a very ompt. role. And, best of all the society today expects so much out of everyone .<br><br>To fight boredom, take a sport that gets to meet Pp , volunteering is a good idea,</div>
