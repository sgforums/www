            <div class='col-md body'>And to think that local girls are passive. Kudos to you, herself, for your daring approach. I'm impressed. I think most girls would rather saw off an arm and a leg than make a cold approach.<br><br>The fear of the unknown has given many of us second thoughs of being the brave one. Girls are afraid of being tagged as sluts and we men as desperate dicks. But what the hell. Thats society's perception, not mine.<br><br>Let me tell you my little story.<br><br>A few years back, i've always wanted to experience approaching a lady on the street. But due to my nuts being the size of peas, i gave myself 101 excuses as to why i shouldnt.<br><br>I got so sick of backing out till i made it a point to approach at least 4 ladies a week for 2 months. I know its weird but i needed a blueprint for success.<br><br>The first time i did it was simply nerve wrecking. I was mumbling, fumbling and perspiring. I cant remember what i said but i think i came across like some MLM salesman. We did talk for awhile and ended on a happy note. After a few more approaches it became a natural process. I dont always approach the pretty ones. As long as theres a chance for conversation, i'll talk. If she seems interesting enough than yea, i'll get her number.<br><br>I dont think i'm some gorgeous stud who thinks he's gods gift to women. Ok, maybe i'm a stud  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But honestly, i'm just your average Joe who is not ashamed of my sexuality and interest in women. I had so many fantastic encounters during those 2 months. I had  my fair share of bad ones as well.<br><br>So guys, next time you find yourself sitting on the fence, dont hesitate. Gather your guts, stomach in, chest out and throw yourself in. Be a man for once.<br><br>Remember, "He who hesitates, masturbates."<br><br>Lets get it on, baby.<br><br></div>

My 5 cents worth would be: since you two talk on the phone, and would have by now discussed topics along the lines of likes and dislikes, focus on something that is common, e.g. Art, plays,(sex not included at this stage... but it is probably a given) etc. then organise something along the lines of that (better yet if there are common artistes whose music you both enjoy, double bonus if that particular artiste is in town!!!, it would I suppose, have to be on the pretence that.... since it is something that you both enjoy doing ... it is technically not a "date" date, but rather 2 people going to do something that they mutually enjoy and coincidently are happening to be doing it together by prearranged means (am I making sense here??!!).<br><br>Or:<br><br>"Hey whateverhisnamesis my parents are out tonight so would you like to come over to my place and  jump on the good foot to do the bad thing?...

Despite that, my faith in fate is Fate helping me meet right people. But i think leaving absolutely everything to fate is rather haphazard. Approaching girls on the streets in public view is a sub-topic in the opinion i'm trying to put across. I am not promoting "love-on-the-street" or insta-luv. Maybe its because i'm younger, and i know more immature(mentally--what were you thinking? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ) guys. Maybe i'm not blessed with a vast social network like you. I think there is no such thing as love at first sight. In this i'm on the same side of the fence as you. However, i simply feel that i need to widen my circle of aqquaintances, for the mere purpose of <strong>knowing</strong> them. Be it girls or guys. I got to know this girl in the toilet when i had trouble getting a butterfly out of my hair(really. the butterfly just got in. I imagine i smelled like nectar.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ). She helped me, and...haha the rest is history. So i earned myself one great girlfriend in the "ad hoc" manner you are seemingly against. Am i right to say you're against it?<br><br>Yes, jOhO, it would be wrong if you just tapped someone on the shoulder when they're rushing to the nearest toilet with legs squeezed convulsively in the middle. What i had meant was, like you mentioned, in a social setting where everyone was bored to their stinking socks,you spot an interesting person and decide to just start talking. Not gorgeous, or exceedingly attractive, but a person who looked <strong>nice to talk to.</strong> Agreeing with Scorpius, it has to be spontaneous, not like you memorised some lines or anything. You don't go, "have you met Mr. Right? I'm Mr. Right-now." Slap positive, that one.<br><br>No one should approach every girl they see. That would be insane. Girls you deem "potentially-interesting", yes. For example, you see this girl at starbucks every morning. She smiles at you because she noticed that you're a regular too. And she greets you in a friendly manner, say something along the lines of "Mocha latte again?". So if you yourself think she's worth knowing, you take a step further.<br><br>In addition, I also have guy friends telling me they like so-and-so (whom they already know as friends) but are afraid to take the so-called plunge to depart from friendship.<br><br>Basically i can't pinpoint if guys are gut-less or anything. I only want men to show it like it is, and say it like it is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It all depends on your intentions. Some people do it for sex, some for romance, some do it for fun, some dont see a reason for such an approach at all.<br><br>No one is wrong. Whatever floats your boat.<br><br>But as herself has mentioned, you know where you stand when put in a conducive enviroment for meeting people. A friends party, a new class, etc... We have to cut the bullsht and admit that the only measures we have of a person in such a situation are their physical attractiveness and body language.<br><br>So you say "Ok, she looks interesting. I wana get to know her." You then hope that she'll initiate contact with you. Come on guys, that aint gona happen. (It might differ if you're eyeing Herself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) This law of evolution still stands. And that is we as men have to make the first move. The quicker you accept this fact, the happier you'll be. I've joined quite a few courses/classes like dancing, cooking, french and at all times the girls were always so quiet. If i didnt open my mouth to say "Hi" i wouldnt have gotten to know anybody.<br><br>The art of conversing with strangers is a pretty good skill to have. It has helped me tremendously in my social and working life. After a while you realise that everybody wants somebody to talk to.</div>
