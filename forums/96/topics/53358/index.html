He cited health reasons and an usually high increase in terrorist activities around his paliament house as his main reasons, but nothing is really concrete as of this point of time. The government has not objected as apparently they have an ideal candidate in mind to fill in his post if Dr Iam Ani Diot is to confirm his decision." - South East XenobiaTribunal<br><br>I believe that you people would have guessed by now that the ideal candidate is none other than me. I need to confirm that the Government of South East Xenobia has indeed offered me a 6 years contract at US$3.8mil P.A. excluding bonuses. These kind people have also offered me to reside in their royal palace with their princess's hand in marriage. Please rest assured wonderful sgForumers, because I will still be posting here and sharing my life experiences.<br><br>"I am absolutely flabbergasted yet elated at the prospect of 'demon'strating my authority with such a talented and promising army in such an 'interesting' state with a huge tradition for war and civil unrest.

I gladly appreciate the Government of SEX for their foresight and I believe that my track records in RISK and C&amp;C Generals speak for themselves. The fact that I have been a dictator since I can remember, helped to tip the scales in their favour.
