Will u tell her u like her ? pls give me some comments.....thanks</div></blockquote>What should I say? It's a dog eat dog world out there.<br>If her boyfriend treats her that bad, it seems that he doesn't have any more feeling towards her. THIS, is a heaven-given chance for you to express to her what you felt all these years about her.<br><br>Yes, there is some risk that you may ruin your friendship with her. She may not feel the same about you. But Carpe Diem! Forget about the risk calculation, keep that for your calculator. This is your heart we are talking about!, not some Math problems. If you don't say out what you really feel, how will you know how she really feels???<br><br>How long is many years? must be more than 2 years, maybe 3 or 4 years? Have it ever occured to you that one day she may leave you for good (as a friend of course). Nowadays more and more singaporeans are relocating, migrating to other countries, because let's face it, singapore is small and too competitive to live in, anyway back to the topic. It will be too LATE for you to do anything. Have you tried long distance relationship before? Let me tell you, out of 5 ldr cases that I knew of, 3 broke up within 6 months of separating.<br><br>Spend more time with her these few weeks. Show to her that you really cared about her, more than usual friendship. Let her know that you will always be there for her. One of the reason why she's still clinging to her current boyfriend may well be because she is feeling insecure! Eventually, find a good time to admit your feelings to her.<br><br>If she doesn't respond the way we would like her to, don't give up! What you really want is for her to be happy right? If you are unable to give her the happiness she wants, maybe someone else can, but he's definitely not her current boyfriend.<br><br>Hope I am not making you more confused than you already have, wenchu. Just that I have seen this scenario too many times, where a guy and a girl play this waiting game. Hoping to get as many indication of affection from the other party, before attempting to show his/her true feelings. Sadly, life is no cinderella story.<br><br>Enough said. Got a question, is there any other faster way to see new post to the topic rather than reloading the page every few minutes?<br><br></div>
