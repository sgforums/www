A few times the guy came look 4 her in the U, luckily mi friend ard...once that guy wanted to hit the gal, but stopped in time by mi friend...and the gal kissed mi friend in front of the guy to show that she has no more feelings for that guy.<br><br>A few are still together now, some did not make it that long after that.<br><br>It is up to u.  Give her strength to stand up to her rights to choose. If it has to, let her know your feelings abt her and support her all the way.<br><br><img src="http://www.dianafreedman.com/images/Dollz/Girls%20Dollz/Heads/hflipblo.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>love is blind, love is also dumb and deaf!<br><br>knew tis gal 1ce... her bf is the typical mcp, treated her like shit. i really liked her and we went out together wenever we could and i treated her like a princess. Slowly our affections grew but the day came wen she went overseas to study and her bf went too.... cnt count the numerous long distance calls i made to hear her sobs and trying to console her... at the end of the day, my reward was to get a phone call from her telling me she would be marrying him....<br><br>My advice, If you wana treat a gal nice... go ahead. but if she's attached and doesnt wana give up her bf for you... u give it up!!! you are just being played with.</div>
