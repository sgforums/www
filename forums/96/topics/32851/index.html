Will u believe?<br>Tis is the whole story:<br>After leaving from Newsroom on sat, we went to Boat Quay to find ppl.. After tat, We headed back to his house.. When we are at his house, his hp rang.. The way he tok to tat person is god damn sweet.. After he put down the fone, i asked him who call..(normally i dun ask him wan) He told me is a guy from his camp.. I dun belive him at all.. But i dun wanna quarrel wif him.. So i juz keep mum..<br>But the next day, i can't control myself but to ask him who exactly is the person who call him.. He confessed and said tat it's his ex.. So i quarrelled wif him for not telling me the truth.. He kept explaining himself.. Den he said a excuse which i simply can't believe... He told me the gal is married..
