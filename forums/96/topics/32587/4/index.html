            <div class='col-md body'>hiyaz aHGer^83, though i may not know ya for a long time neither tok to ya b4 i am juz browsing thru and saw that u were down. dunno if the prob is still persisting but juz so to sure my views with ya.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For a r/s to work out fine wifout any hitches is for both to be emotionally involved (2 hands to clap) and guess u should noe tis. sometimes knowing is not enuff u haf to understand and put into use. from wat i can see.. like some of ur frenz here have mentioned u are truely aware of wat u are going through and just think that the r/s is moving on.. but wat i can see frm wat u mentioned was that the r/s had come to a stop. he is obviously taking ya for granted u see? why do he wanna u stay when u wanna leave the gambling place? it can becoz of 'face', the pride in him... showing his frens he has got a gf wif him, or becoz he tot by asking u to stay means he had accompanied you for the day and he knew u loved him so hes sure u will do it and this boosted his ego and for men its like luck is shining on him when hes got his ego boosted up. if this r/s has been broken once or twice, the crack cannot be mended back, things will be difft, taking a broken vase for eg. even if u glued the pieces back, there are still cracks, its more vulnerable and tend to break again even when u are juz holding it in ur hands. the vase will look difft right? all these are very simple logics and i think most of ur frens haf told ya these things. actually when it comes to r/s probs not many of us can help ya becoz wat we are going to say are the same old things again u will hear on every separation. u will find it tired one day and the most impt is to find ur most understanding fren to accompany ya let u cry it out if u can... ur best fren will not say anything becoz she noes wateva she says will not get into your mind. and tml again u will tell urself get over it but den again not long u will go back to him. so u haf to pick ur courage up, i am sure u are a sensible gal, ask yourself a few qns like, are feeling worse wif ur present bf than to breaking up? is the prob only lying within gambling? how good is the r/s progressing so far after the crack and will it be worth to cry over it? do i haf to put all the blame to myself? ask urself wat haf u contributed in this r/s? and wateva qns u can ask urself becoz i dunno u well.<br><br>i saw in one of the post u pushed the blame to yourself and thinks that u did not treat him well enuff and tts why hes now changed into a difft person. even if part of u played the fault i dun think its totally all urs. he too.. bottom line is tat needs both hands to clap. now the third party is gambling that is coming between ya u think... and he do not want a proper conversation over this prob. u are very bothered by the whole thing and is making u really unhappy. and so ask urself do u wanna leave in this darkness foreva and one day to find out u had taken the wrong path and lost another potential one? u are not old and can be considered very young ya noe? if u cannot walk out alone from this darkness, no one can help ya becoz u are all alone in tis situation, you haf to tell urself that u can do it and bring out all ur confidence in you, be brave and face the reality that u are lost, dun try to cheat urself anymore when u noe the real problem. the mind belongs to you and the ppl ard u cannot understand the mind of urs becoz its something special each and every one of us own. even if the ppl can influence your thinking the final decision is still yours. so walk out by urself from the darkness but of coz wif the directions your frens had given and the final decision is all yours when u had chosen one of the directions given.<br><br>i dunno if u understand wat am i trying to put across to you... anyway i think i am brain dead at tis time.. when i haben slept trying to finish my ppt slides. if i can think of anything else to help ya i will.. but i shall give ya an eg of my account hopefully it will help ya in the end.<br><br>take care gal, everything is not the end of the world yet dun leave in sorrow but leave in happiness in pride.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

(not a curse hor... juz telling frm experience) but so be it... sad and get it over in a day after doing the fav thing u wanted to do most when u were wif him and did not get the chance to do it... it will brighten up ur day and everyday is a difft day.. u will not noe one day u will juz get married and u will think back how silly u haf been in the past.<br><br>so cheer up gal...! i am sure u can do it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>good luck to ya! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

(not a curse hor... juz telling frm experience) but so be it... sad and get it over in a day after doing the fav thing u wanted to do most when u were wif him and did not get the chance to do it... it will brighten up ur day and everyday is a difft day.. u will not noe one day u will juz get married and u will think back how silly u haf been in the past.<br><br>so cheer up gal...! i am sure u can do it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>good luck to ya! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  </div></blockquote> me pat pat wendy. sorry to heard dat. . .but then gald u r strong to overcum all tis!<br>dun ever get tied down by all tis coz ard u dat always ppl who cares &amp; luv u. . .if u did foolish things they gonna b devastated.<br>i sure dat r alots more guys who will treat u v gd &amp; appreciate u!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Eg, when you go into a new relationship, how do you know if the relationship will turn out? You have to take a bet on that person rite? The key point is to gamble smartly and know when to cut loss.<br>Another  important thing is to have very strong discipline and dun place all your bet in a single gamble.<br>The same goes to study. How do you choose which course to study? You have to based your bet on what you think is the prospect of your major. Even for exam, you need to make a smart gamble on what topics to study.<br>I remember someone mention that he will never find a partner who is a gamber to do business. Let me ask him, which business is garantee to earn money. If you dun take any risk? how to make money?<br>By the way, my current job require me to make smart gamble (sort of) frequently.</div>
