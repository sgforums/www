Since it is deep within you - your conscious never brings it up. You said you went back to him after breaking then now he seemed like a changed person. Let me tell you something - after every crack, after each break, nobody would be the same again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>He has changed? - Has he really changed or your preception in him changes? If you wished for the old days like when he was so lovey lovey - answer is - those days are *forever* gone. People don't call it old days for nothing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>You know why? I spoke about it before and i will do it again. What's used of a relation that has undergo this breaking and returning period when actually most things - in fact virtually everything - could be solved when both of you are still in relation? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The lazy man/woman way out is to break, regret, heart soften, go back together. In this way, Nothing is solved, nothing is done. You said that now you both are together, he everyday go gamble never pei you - you now doubt his sincerely when he wanted to patch -which means now he words actually has little worth to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me attempt a bold statement - you so *sure* you went back to him because you believe that things has gone for the better and he has proven himself to contribute and work even harder for this relation OR because it was just an overflow of emotions that leads to a blind irrational decision made? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You don't have to answer me - you answer yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
