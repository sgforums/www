What's used of a relation that has undergo this breaking and returning period when actually most things - in fact virtually everything - could be solved when both of you are still in relation? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The lazy man/woman way out is to break, regret, heart soften, go back together. In this way, Nothing is solved, nothing is done. You said that now you both are together, he everyday go gamble never pei you - you now doubt his sincerely when he wanted to patch -which means now he words actually has little worth to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me attempt a bold statement - you so *sure* you went back to him because you believe that things has gone for the better and he has proven himself to contribute and work even harder for this relation OR because it was just an overflow of emotions that leads to a blind irrational decision made? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You don't have to answer me - you answer yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>hey wait...i din say we broke up and patched...and we NEVER broke up...</div>

You may be feeling down and low because of this point - he may be oblivious to your feelings and thoughts. Tell him, put reasons and force empathy from him. In that case, when he feels in your shoes - he would be more likely to understand your situation better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't keep saying that you will be single again because if you do... you *WILL* be.

It is not being single after a break - but rather breaking without a proper solution to work things especially when things are still workable (provided feelings is still there). You can't escape communication, neither now nor future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Remember: If somehow problem couldn't be solved and causes a break.
