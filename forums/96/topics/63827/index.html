Though my mum is half Japanese (My maternal great great grandad was the LAST samurai). I'm born in Germany, but raised in S'pore since 7. I was afraid of the stigma, but it was totally untrue. My friends have been wonderful to be with and I have friends from all walks of life &amp; social segregations. Girlfriends who share the same "mixed blood" parentage and are constantly scouted by modelling agencies. Life has been great! After serving NS and graduating from NSU made me realise how proud I should be as a SINGAPOREAN!!! Long Live LKY!!!<br><br></div>
