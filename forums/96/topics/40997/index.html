            <div class='col-md body'>That girl's name is Kristin Kreuk, a rising starlet from Canada. So you may question me: why are you fascinated by her, and why are you so obessed with talking about her?<br>Frankly speaking, that is her unique and exotic Chinese look that mesmerised me. On closer inspection, you can find out she is endowed with strong westerner face features, with the straight, sharp nose as the compelling evidence. Yet overall, her look also reminds us of her undeniable chinese ancestry. Maybe she looks like a white girl more, but it is the chinese element in her genes that indeed embellishes and enhances her look. She has a subtle friendliness in her eyes, so innocent so untainted by evil spirit.<br>Some people say she is an angel, dipatched by god to give us pleasure and enjoyment. well, the creation of Kreuk is a miracle itself, by the marriage of a Dutch man and a chinese woman. That is extraodinary enough to suggest God's divine intervention in the birth of this girl. She is young, with a promising future ahead of her journey of life. So don't forget to watch her on smallville on wednesday( i have to say she was the most beautiful in Snow white)Kristin, don't disappoint us, and with all you have, you can be a renowned global star.<br>Written by Johann Sebastien Bach, greatest composer of all time, to let you know more about Kristin" Angel" Kreuk"</div>
