            <div class='col-md body'>Hello! I posted this at Chit Chat but maybe can warn more people here also.. BHI has been cheating so much $$ from unknowing females. spread the word to protect the girls in sg!:<br><br>Hi! Did anybody here get intercepted on the streets b4 by some teenage looking girl telling you they're looking for fresh faces and asking if you'd be interested in being a freelance model for this talent agency called BHI?<br><br>If you have, the following might be familiar to you:<br><br>They look for girls aged 19 and above and you're asked to go down to their office at takashimaya tower A for an interview.<br><br>Then they show you this folder of pretty pictures saying those are assignments given to BHI and they'll say you're one of the 20 who've been selected from a 100 people to attend their 6 day grooming course which costs over a $1000 held at pan pacific hotel. But to show their sincerity, they'll fully subsidise the course. Ofcoz in return, you gotta buy this particular brand of professional make up either from them or at other stores (so far nobody ahve seen them anywhere else). The make up costs more than $500.<br><br>So some will pay for the extravagant make up and go through the course. Some students (normally aged btn 18-21) will get calls from the office asking if they're interested in a part-time job as a talent scout, the pay being $2.50 per name so it's supposedly ez $$ (juz wait (and wait) till pay day comes)<br><br>Some (same age group) will be asked if they'd be interested in teaching the course at $30 per day. Some never even attended the course but were also asked if they wanted to teach (week 1-how to stand one 2 legs and make funny faces, week 2-how to walk on heels, week3-demonstration on how to put on makeup, week 4-put on day makeup, week5-put on night makeup, week 6-walk around in heels infront of a a row of ppl)<br><br>Others who go through the course normally end off with a pretty certificate and never hear from BHI again.<br><br>Reason y i'm writing this is there's alot of discontentment and alot of ppl have marked this company as a scam for selling cosmetics. Their office has no logo or watever sign of their company name. They claim to be a talent agency but that seems like their secondary concern. I mean they've got a database of pretty girls anyway, y let it go to waste right? y not pick a random girl to send off to audition which models who received proper professional training from other agencies will attend as well and take a 50% cut if they happen to land the assignment?<br><br>Their main concern is to scout a target of 60 new names per day. Their 'contract' to attend the course has no letterhead watsoever. and asked y they dun scout for guys? (coz guys generally~ dun wear cosmetics?) they say they've got others (invisible scouts) doing it<br><br>y girls 19 and above? they say they want matured faces. thats so lame. some 17 year olds can look more matured than a female in her 20s. As a legitimate company, they should also know that all contracts signed by minors below the age of 21 is void.<br><br>So if you get approached, dun spend that $500 so easily...<br><br>anybody with experience from BHI wanna share?</div>
