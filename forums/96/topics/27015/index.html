            <div class='col-md body'>The passengers on the bus watched sympathetically as the attractive young<br>woman with the white cane made her way carefully up the steps.

Then she settled in,<br>placed her briefcase on her lap and rested her cane against her leg.<br><br>It had been a year since Susan, 34, became blind. Due to a medical<br>misdiagnosis she had been rendered sightless, and she was suddenly thrown<br>into a world of darkness, anger, frustration and self-pity. And all she had<br>to cling to was her husband, Mark.<br><br>Mark was an Army officer and he loved Susan with all his heart. When she<br>first lost her sight, he watched her sink into despair and was determined to<br>help his wife gain the strength and confidence she needed to become<br>independent again.<br><br>Finally, Susan felt ready to return to her job, but how would she get there?<br>She used to take the bus, but was now too frightened to get around the city<br>by herself. Mark volunteered to drive her to work each day, even though they<br>worked at opposite ends of the city.<br><br>At first, this comforted Susan, and fulfilled Mark's need to protect his<br>sightless wife who was so insecure about performing the slightest task.<br>Soon, however, Mark realized the arrangement<br>wasn't working. Susan is going to have to start taking the bus again, he<br>admitted to himself. But she was still so fragile, so angry - how would she<br>react?<br><br>Just as he predicted, Susan was horrified at the idea of taking the<br>bus again. "I'm blind!", she responded bitterly. "How am I supposed to know<br>where I am going? I feel like you're abandoning me." Mark's heart broke to<br>hear these words, but he knew what had to be done. He promised Susan that<br>each morning and evening he would ride the bus with her, for as long as it<br>took, until she got the hang of it.<br><br>And that is exactly what happened. For two solid weeks, Mark, military<br>uniform and all, accompanied Susan to and from work each day. He taught her<br>how to rely on her other senses, specifically her hearing, to determine<br>where she was and how to adapt to her new environment. He helped her<br>befriend the bus drivers who could watch out for her, and save her a seat.<br><br>Finally, Susan decided that she was ready to try the trip on her own. Monday<br>morning arrived, and before she left, she threw her arms around Mark, her<br>temporary bus-riding companion, her husband, and her best friend. Her eyes<br>filled with tears of gratitude for his loyalty, his patience, and his love.<br>She said good-bye, and for the first time, they went their separate ways.<br>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... Each day on her own went perfectly,<br>and Susan had never felt better. She was doing it! She was going to work all<br>by herself.<br><br>On Friday morning, Susan took the bus to work as usual. As she was paying<br>the fare to exit the bus, the driver said, "Boy, I sure do envy you." Susan<br>wasn't sure if the driver was speaking to her or not. After all, who on<br>earth would ever envy a blind woman who had struggled just to find the<br>courage to live for the past year?<br><br>Curious, she asked the driver, "Why do you say that you envy me?" The driver<br>responded, "It must feel good to be taken care of and protected like you<br>are."Susan had no idea what the driver was<br>talking about, and again asked, "What do you mean?" The driver answered,<br>"You know, every morning for the past week, a fine<br>looking gentleman in a military uniform has been standing across the corner<br>watching you as you get off the bus. He makes sure you cross the street<br>safely and he watches until you enter your office building. Then he blows<br>you a kiss, gives you a little salute and walks away. You are one lucky<br>lady."<br><br>Tears of happiness poured down Susan's cheeks. For although she couldn't<br>physically see him, she had always felt Mark's presence. She was lucky, so<br>lucky, for he had given her a gift more powerful than sight, a gift she<br>didn't need to see to believe - the gift of love that can bring light where<br>there is darkness.<br></div>

They'll not recongise you. In the past where they used to say love you miss you and cried for you, now at that instant, can change faster than cold blooded animals....<br><br>So what's the moral of the story ??</div>
