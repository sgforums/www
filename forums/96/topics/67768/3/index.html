The trend seems to be like more SG girls are like HK gals.. like you've said, material driven and stuff.<br><br>But thinking on the other hand, why do they have to be material driven if they have security? One point may be that to those material driven girls, their men cannot give them security in a lot of sense that's y they turn to materials.<br><br>They are alot of reasons for their behaviour, some good some bad?
