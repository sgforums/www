You need to have car and money...and career. Only then you can get a girl nowadays. Another way is you are damn yandao...and you don't need to bother to get car, money and career lah. You don't even need to talk a lot, girls will talk alot of c.o.c.k to you.

Sometimes when their bf is not successful they may feel malu.<br><br>I know a gal who always laugh at other people's bf being not as good or so and so bf is very rich and so on....<br><br>I really pity her. She is still single, I think hard for her to get a bf, she is short, a bit plump and looks so-so only. Most guys will not give her a second look.<br><br>Personality also not fantastic.... and with such a twisted mindset, how to get a 'good" bf. Also most guys will not want to go after her also.<br></div>
