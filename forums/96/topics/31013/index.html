            <div class='col-md body'>Sharing love is probably the most valuable and meaningful experience a person can ever have.And there's a difference between being in love with someone and loving someone.<br>It's the difference between a love that's fickle,wild and short-lived<br>and one that's tender and passionate,nurturing and lasts a long time. The first is easy. The second, the one that really matters to all of us,takes work because it's about keeping a relationship.<br><br>Loving someone takes efforts. We have to be able to communicate with each other. Nobody can read anyone else's mind. We always presume that our partner knows what we think and feel. Maybe in time we might be able to predict or sense each other's thoughts but it's never perfect and takes time to develop. Getting the chance to love and be loved by someone is blessed.<br><br>Respect him/her for who he/she is, and not what you want him/her to be. Everyone is pretty and special in his/her own special way. No one is perfect. It is true love which closes the gap of imperfectness to form a smooth surface of acceptance for each other.<br>True love sees and accepts a person for who he/she is. It is also true love which makes a person change for the better. The power of true love to a person is undeniable.<br><br>A relationship needs commitments too. What is love without commitments from each other anyway? It's like principles and values. Everyone has them but they only mean as much as we are willing to stand for them. The same goes for our commitments to relationships, and the person we love.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Love is like an antique vase. It's hard to find,hard to net, but easy to break."<br>Every day everywhere, people fall in love ... but just how many of these relationships are self-sacrificing love, and not just relationships which are formed only for the intense! feeling of falling in love? I know hundreds of friends who say the magical words "I love you"... but more often than not, the truth is just I am IN love with you.<br><br>But if a person says he/she loves you, he/she means<br>that he/she loves you unconditionally for who you are now, who you were in the past and who you might be in the future.<br>When he/she says he/she loves you and really means it,you have to ask yourself if you love him/her too or if you're in love with the idea of being in love. It is very hard to see the difference through logical thinking. Let your heart guide u.<br><br>**The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.**<br>If u think something will make you happy, go for it.<br>&gt; &gt; **Remember that we pass this way only once.**<br></div>
