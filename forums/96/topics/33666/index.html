Most girls after some time, seeing that the  guy not responding will get  the hint, most girls are afterall quite shy, so they may not persist that long.<br><br>BUT...if she is the persistent kind, then u gotta watch the situation.  If she keeps calling you, it is still ok, means she is not that deep yet, but if she starts to ask u on a ONE to ONE date..ah....thats when u need to take action liao.<br><br>ACtion. What actions? Most Effective choice though can  be disastrous: tell her directly.<br><br>Alternative choices : In casual conversations, bring up the topic, for example:<br><br>Girl: Hello, ah wee in or not?<br><br>Wee: ya ya u who huh?<br><br>Girl: Me lor, pretty girl lah.<br><br>Wee: *shit*<br><br>Wee: Oh oh hi.<br><br>Girl: How are you....<br><br>*Then convesation goes on and on*then......<br><br>Wee: So sian huh, weekend coming liao, no where to go, where u going? go out with BF ah (at this pt MUST laugh)<br><br>Girl: No lah i where got bf, cant find a good guy leh.<br><br>Wee: aiyah dun bluff lah..<br><br>Girl: you leh, no GF ah?<br><br>Wee: No lah, I not ready for GF yet, i dun wan a relationship now, so i dun wan  to think abt it.<br><br>*gets hint*<br><br>Girl: Oh ok...i call u another day.<br><br>AHEM, THERE!! the trick is to just die die must bring up the topic abt gf and bf lah...then u can indirectly tell her lor, pretend u dun noe  she  likes u!!!<br><br>IT  WORKS!<br></div></blockquote>ha ha ha ha.... i think it's more of a joke than an advice. sorry, please pardon me, but u really made me smile for a moment.<br><br>first, i treat her as a friend, not an unwanted attention. i'm not the kind who play mind games by not initiating call to her and let her do so all the time. i enjoy her company, frankly speaking, but not the romantic kind. i treasure all friendships regardless of gender. i'll look like a jerk if i were to give her such treatment.<br><br>second, the conversation u drawn up very comical, it did cheer me up for a moment. but then, i can't imagine both she and i having such a conversation. we juz doesn't fit into ur scenario loh. furthermore, both she and i already know that we're unattached liao. thus the last part of the conversation that u have drawn up is not relevant loh.<br><br>but thanks for ur advice. it did lead me to an another idea...</div>
