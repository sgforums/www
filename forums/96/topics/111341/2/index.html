He appeared to have taken his own life. A police spokesman said that police had taken possession of a belt found at the scene and had also taken five different kinds of prescription drugs from the room. All would undergo forensic examination. They included the anti-depressant Prozac.<br><br>There were no suspicious circumstances or evidence of foul play.<br><br>Hutchence, 37, had arrived in the country earlier in the week to prepare for INXS' 20th Anniversary tour due to kick off in just a few days time.
