            <div class='col-md body'>I agree guys are looking out to foreign wives (my friend just married a Vietnamese Wife 22 years of age only but he is in his 30s) as the EXPECTATIONS of local gals are very high.... Whether it is plain Jane or babes, their expectation is almost the same. Normally foreign wives(those from rural areas)'s expectation is lower BUT U need to support them if they are married over here.<br><br>1. Stable job/career<br>2. have as many as the 5C the BETTER<br>3. high car(there is a thread posted by me earlier on) the BETTER<br>4. Well educated (there is a threas posted ny me as well)<br><br>As for gals, some choose to remain single because they can't find the TYPES of men they want. Some prefer to wait etc...some goes to SDS/SDU/marriage agencies for help.<br><br></div>

Unless he is out to prove to others around him that he has control over her, that she is 'his woman'?<br><br>And why would a woman want to peel prawns for an able-bodied man unless she wants to make a show that he belongs to her?<br><br>Either way, the mind games being played here turn me off.<br><br>It's another matter if the prawn-peeling is done in the privacy of the home, of course, for couples do share all kinds of intimate displays of affection, be it the woman putting on the man's socks or the man fetching her a cup of tea or the newspaper.<br><br>So, yes, the Singapore woman may not be the most charming and flirtatious of women, and she may not always make her man feel good.<br><br>Still, if you think about it, Singapore women show they care for their men by going out to work and helping to bring home the bacon, and often a large slice of it, too.<br><br>And when they are upfront about their feelings, they are actually showing respect for their men, for they are being honest. They are not treating men as idiots by trying to fool them through saying one thing and meaning another.<br><br>Now, if this isn't good enough for Singapore men, can you blame some Singapore women for turning to foreign men who can appreciate them for what they are? &lt;-- weeeeeee-U-weeeeee<br><br></strong><br><br>Yeah.. great article, which was dated Jan 6th, 2002, and I kept it...<br>So <strong>U GO GIRL, SINGAPOREAN BABES RULZ!!! </strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>But, yes, the Singapore woman - especially if she is better educated - is a confident and assertive creature. </blockquote>Agree. Environment shapes us. But not every women though.<br><br><blockquote>She is pragmatic and, hence, materialistic. (Money talks, right? Both Singapore women and men know that). </blockquote>True. Money is vital, but it's still not the only most vital aspect.<br>Being too materialistic makes everyone sick. Me too.<br><br><blockquote>She is articulate (well, more so than the Singapore man) and will fight to defend herself and her loved ones. </blockquote>True. Men have problems with this throughout history. We were made this way i guess... But this is redundant.<br><br><blockquote>She goes out to work and tries to excel in her career because (a) it is expected of her; and (b) the money she brings home makes life easier, for herself and those she loves. </blockquote>This is becoming more common in Singapore. Men are suppose to be the bread-winner, and the women are made to look after kids if any. But with the economy crisis, it's an excuse. Think about it this way, who are gonna look after the one child in the house? Maid? then who are going to give attention to the kid? No wonder couples own dogs instead.<br><br><blockquote>She is frank and has no time for mind games, making her, in fact, naive at times. There is little pretence and guile. What you see is what you get. </blockquote>Hahaha... very funny. Women are still women. No matter what, they'll still have time for mind games. Some would even still play hard-to-get.

There are no fields or farms where uneducated women are relegated to toil in.<br>Instead, much stress is placed on education - for both sexes - because every pair of hands counts in the urban workplace.<br>When they go out to work, women are judged by the same standards as men. In fact, one of Singapore's earliest female role models is Mrs Lee Kuan Yew, the wife of the Senior Minister, who has proven to be a successful lawyer. </blockquote>...REDUNDANCE...<br><br><blockquote>And because homes and cars are so expensive, women have to work - and work hard - if they (and their husbands and families when they get married) want to enjoy the finer things in life.</blockquote>Homes and cars are expensive. Hence the men have to be stable to get married, or else stay single and move around. In fact, owning a stupid car in S'pore isn't worth it. COE's a mad tax-collector of this one. Of course, everyone hopes to get the best in life. But think about this, will good communication in a relationship overwhelm &amp; out-do all this fine luxuries? If a couple can sort things out, life is MUCH finer.<br><br><blockquote>Can you blame us, then, if we tend to be businesslike and are uncomfortable with displaying more feminine traits like flirting, or feminine skills like prawn-peeling? </blockquote>For your info, madam, not all guys expect their gals to peel prawns for them, some r even allegic to them! Like me. And how do u define feminine traits? Flirting is not a trait, it's a verb. Maybe these are the guys u or ur fren has observed, but have not observed the whole Earth.<br><br><blockquote>I, for one, can't see myself peeling prawns for anyone at a public meal, except perhaps my niece, who's small and helpless.<br>I mean, why does a man need a woman to do that for him if he can do it himself? Unless he is out to prove to others around him that he has control over her, that she is 'his woman'?<br>And why would a woman want to peel prawns for an able-bodied man unless she wants to make a show that he belongs to her? </blockquote>Blah, blah, blah.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>Either way, the mind games being played here turn me off. </blockquote>Save your opinion to yourself. That's your problem.<br><br><blockquote>It's another matter if the prawn-peeling is done in the privacy of the home, of course, for couples do share all kinds of intimate displays of affection, be it the woman putting on the man's socks or the man fetching her a cup of tea or the newspaper. </blockquote>Are you trying to teach us men how to behave towards women? As if the whole population of men in S'pore doesn't know a crap about it? C'mon!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br><blockquote>So, yes, the Singapore woman may not be the most charming and flirtatious of women, and she may not always make her man feel good. Still, if you think about it, Singapore women show they care for their men by going out to work and helping to bring home the bacon, and often a large slice of it, too. </blockquote>Firstly, I don't like flirtatious women. I don't like them to flirt with me. I like them decent. Maybe u flirt, i dunno... but i guess so. Next, it's true they still show their care and concern by going out to work to bring in extra cash for the family. Duh, u finally got this one right. Good job girl...<br><br><blockquote>And when they are upfront about their feelings, they are actually showing respect for their men, for they are being honest. They are not treating men as idiots by trying to fool them through saying one thing and meaning another. </blockquote>Upfront? Yes, for some. Some are even foolish enough to play around with feelings or doing it in an indirect way which turns people off. As I said, you've seen half of the planet, &amp; not seen the other brighter side. And when some women play mind games, some words cannot be believed. Hmm... I'm starting to question ur gender...<br><br><blockquote>Now, if this isn't good enough for Singapore men, can you blame some Singapore women for turning to foreign men who can appreciate them for what they are? </blockquote>SIGH! This can be a little tough, but lo, there're thousands of reasons for this. It could be money that most of the foreign guys are settling for, or perhaps just a play thing to them? Heck, we never know the reasons or the sad/happy endings of such cases!<br><br>Talking about acceptance in a relationship, everyone can do that, not only foreigners. In conclusion, it's the attraction, communication, and preferences that sums it up.<br><br>However, it's not that many of us S'pore men do not like about many local ladies. I'm sure it applies the same way to the women as well, who expects us to be super romantic and stuff...</div>
