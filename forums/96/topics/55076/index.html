            <div class='col-md body'>Been through that but of coz, without the drinking part( $$$ ) Wat was your purpose of drinking ?( learned from chinese dramas?) if u wanna get your mind off this sad period, juz do something that you enjoy doing... that way, your mind would be occupied. Of coz you have to keep doing it, sooner or later, the hurt and sadness would be easier to tame. (btw my longest sad period was 3 mths plus)<br><br>Always say this to urself, no point being sad. It would not help change the situation. When ur sad or drinking, is she sad too ? dun think so rite ? she might be out there enjoying herself. So take this chance and change urself, transform urself into a better person, this way you will have a higher chance of finding a better gf in future.<br><br>Cheer up</div>

It doesn't seem like they have found their true lov and then got married. It takes Two hands to clap to even make relationship last.<br>[b]True Love could be Cheng Qin Yong You or Tian Chang Di Jou.</strong><br>My parents commited to the latter one. Did they meet their true love and got married at a young age of 21?<br>I don't know about you. I don't know about karma love stuff.<br><br>I only know that i lost someone very special and have learnt to treasure her alot.<br>[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Well, certain things are beyond our control and all you can do is open up ur heart and give her your blessings.That way,both sides will feel better.Since she gave u these golden words,then u shld remember them and let ur next gf feel happier...<br>These two criteria may be the ones u missed this time, but treat this time like a lesson learnt...and never repeat the same mistake again...the next time, U won't missed them anymore.<br>True,when u look over at the "greener pastures" you won't find true love just yet.However,give urslef more time, lower ur expectations; Ooh la la... perhaps there's someone who's not up to ur standards but loves u more than u noe...<br>To me, I feel that be it "zhi zai hu ceng jing yong you" or "tian chang di jiu", u shld focus more on reality. wat's the point of hanging on to a love that is so passionate but won't last long? Do u wish to have a spouse who won't be there for u thru out ur life in days of sufferings?My parents once said,you can't survive only on love,....so one muz be rather realistic... I agree that it takes 2 hands to clap...all things do.To make a relationship last,both sides have to be doing their part.<br>But if given a choice,would u rather choose a gal who loves u more than u love her or vice versa? Perhaps ur parents' case is this? I would definitely choose one who loves me more than the otehr way round cuz i'll be happier this way,although i might onli have a little feelings for him.<br>For me, I've learnt how to let go...though devastated.If things can't be forced,then y do it?</div>
