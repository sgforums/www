            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> sorrie i hav to disagree u on this...things dun just come like tt is in nature......btw i dun support evolution...... </blockquote>Things don't just come like that in nature? What makes you so sure? Do you even know the concepts behind evolution before you just reject it outright?<br><br>I suppose you are going to say that the human body is so intricate that it had to have a maker, just like a watch has to have a maker ... and for a human being to be created out of sheer randomness is just like saying a blind watchmaker can make a watch.<br><br>BUT... life is not like that. We are living creatures, not an inanimate object like a watch. The very thing that makes us living creatures enables us to adapt and change to suit the environments. I know you will not be bought over by this short argument, and I have no desire to launch into a whole thesis on this subject in this forum, but I implore you to spend more thought and study into the scientific principles behind evolution and you will realise that creating a human being out of the primordial soup that is prehistoric Earth is not a miracle, but an imperative.<br><br>(Last sentence) Besides, evolution does not occur over a thousand years nor ten thousand years. It occurs over hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of years. Do you know what a million years feels like? Human lifespans are measured in decades. Can the human mind appreciate what a hundred thousand decades feels like? Imagine, if your lifespan was measured as 6cm, the time span at which evolution occurs is ten kilometers. That's the distance between Orchard and maybe say... Ang Mo Kio. That's the SLOW, CONSTANT pace at which evolution occurs...<br><br>References:<br>1) The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins<br>2) Vital Dust: Life as a Cosmic Imperative by Christian de Duve<br><br>Open your mind!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

There are a ton of different religious traditions out there, and different cultures worship Me in different ways. But the basic message is always the same: Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Shintoism... every religious belief system under the sun, they all say you're supposed to love your neighbors, folks! It's not that hard a concept to grasp." </strong><br><br>PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH!!!!!<br><br>The essence of all religions is the same -- to awaken our spiritually. I'm not religious but i'm spiritual. God does not exist out there, but in our hearts. It is we who by our actions determine Heaven or Hell or Earth. If all religions understood this, all this BLOODY SHIT will not have happen, and neither will this argument appear here.</div>
