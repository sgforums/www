            <div class='col-md body'>Fr wat i observe, i seem to know why younger women r interested in older men. Coz the younger men can never u/stand till they get older (older men then) that women juz need more love, attention, u/standing &amp; a listening ear from them. Maybe young men have been all along mistaken abt women r interested in men for $$$ only (in general)</div>
