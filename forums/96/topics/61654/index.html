(or smses)<br>- He says he has to meet clients or friends at weird hours, but when u question his friends they didn't know about their meeting<br>- U start smelling perfume or see lipstick marks on his clothes<br>- see a love bite that does not belong to yours<br>- You see reciepts for expensive gifts ("accessories", dresses, etc) and you didn't receive any of them<br>- He becomes very angry and protective or nervous when you start asking questions of his whereabouts.<br><br>2) sound him off? whassat?<br><br>3) - sometimes men doesn't like to be tied down to only one woman.<br>- having sex with different women is different<br>- maybe he's having problems/stress in work? or in ure relatioonship?<br>- got seduced by the slut<br>- some men easily "fall in love"<br><br>4) is the marriage worth saving? If he still loves you, and you still love him then make him dump the other woman.<br>- Don't accuse him and bring up the past everytime ure in an argument<br>- Try to trust him one last time (dont be so nosy - asking where he went everytime, etc)<br>- Try being a more understanding, caring and loving wife (if ure not)<br><br>- and mostly PRAY alot</div>

Please tell me the most common things men do when theyÂ’re cheating. Thanks</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Suspicious</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Suspicious</span><br>While I donÂ’t know what your husband is doing to make you suspicious, itÂ’s clear youÂ’re uncomfortable with whatÂ’s going on. Maybe youÂ’ve picked up signals that your husband has already cheated. Or perhaps your feminine intuition tells you that heÂ’s restless even if he hasnÂ’t yet strayed. At least youÂ’re not in denial and youÂ’re willing to face the possibility that he may be having an affair and to deal with the situation, whatever it is.<br><br>Usually someone senses infidelity before becoming consciously aware of it. There are almost always signs - I call them black flags - that indicate thereÂ’s something wrong. These are the typical symptoms of cheating:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <strong>Your partnerÂ’s sexual behaviour changes:</strong> He doesnÂ’t want sex as often; he wants it more often; or he introduces new sexual techniques.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <strong>Your partnerÂ’s emotional pattern changes:</strong> He starts getting angry with you for no good reason; he becomes distant and sometimes doesnÂ’t listen to you; or he suddenly becomes incredibly sweet and ingratiating.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <strong>Your partnerÂ’s physical habits change:</strong> He starts working out regularly at the gym; he spends much more time taking care of his body; or he goes on a healthy, or not so healthy, food binge.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <strong>Your partnerÂ’s lifestyle changes:</strong> He begins to have regular unexplained absences from home; he routinely works late at the office, when he has rarely done this before; or he frequently leaves the house on the pretext of Â‘doing something for work or with a friendÂ’.<br><br>A sexually, emotionally, or physically absent partner is likely to be getting fulfilment somewhere else.</div>
