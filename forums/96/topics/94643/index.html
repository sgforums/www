She was rushed to a government hospital after the accident.<br><br>Ms Young's rags-to-riches life story was an inspiration to many budding entrepreneurs in Singapore.<br>According to a traffic police spokesman in the city famed for its terracotta soldiers, the rear of her car was badly smashed in. She was in the back seat at the time.<br><br>She was on a business trip in China. She had flown there a few days ago from the United States, where she had also gone on business.<br><br>Her husband Eugene Lim, Mil-Com's senior vice-president, and its managing director, Mr Michael Leung, caught the first available flight to Beijing early on Tuesday morning and reached Xian in the afternoon.<br><br>Mr Lim, 49, immediately rushed to the hospital to identify his wife's body.<br><br>Well known for her rags-to riches life story, the petite 1.52m-tall businesswoman was a role model and inspiration to budding entrepreneurs in Singapore.<br><br>Born the sixth child in a family of six girls and a boy to a shipping superintendent and housewife, she gave tuition as a 14-year-old to neighbourhood children to earn pocket money.<br><br>She started out as a minute secretary at the Singapore Island Country Club after her A-levels.

The bigger/flashier/more expensive their vehicle, the longer, louder and more repeatedly they press their fucking horns.<br><br>I really want to smash their f****ing skulls and crush their c***B** fingers sometimes!!!! and drink-driving/ mobilephone-driving, and smoke-driving can all be DONE at once, can u believe it ?!!??!?! a 3hit combo !!<br><br>THESE BRAINLESS COMMIE MUTHAF***KERS can make Uturns anywhere, run red lights, park over any kerb without coupons/meters and get away with it !!! THOSE WHO COMPLAIN ABT SG TAXI DRIVERS don't noe nuts abt their PRC counterparts.... they are all Fujiwara Takumis!!!!<br><br>i've had this SON OF A BICTH TAKE ME FROM PUDONG AIRPORT (shanghai) to the city centre at 1am half asleep !!! and on the highway exit he was doing 150kmh, he scraped his right rear section(above the wheel) against the F**KING BARRIER !!!!!
