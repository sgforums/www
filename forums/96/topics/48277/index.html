            <div class='col-md body'>Janice Wong is one of the reporters for STREATS Newspaper. All her article are actually "Suaning"/making sarcastic remarks about local guys<br><br>1. No standard lah<br>2. Must be rich lah, cannot make it go Vietnam lah<br>3. Expect guys to pay for al the things when go outing with gals as gals take time to make up for the outing and it is "tian jing de yi" that guys pay!!!!<br><br>She was again "K" by a lot of guys in Sammyboys Forum. I just wonder the world will be a better place to live in if there is no existence of such person....<br><br>She used to be an air-stewardess............</div>

Imagine a gal going out with a idea tall guy(with V-Shaped Figure) but the 2 cannot click as their thinking/common interests are different, Do U this relationship will last??<br><br>Well, no human beings are perfect as planned by gods and it is up to the individual to make/compromise all these imperfections into a "perfect" relationship!!! Agree with me?<br><br>Well, I am still looking for the right gal that will add that special sparks to my love life as I believe there will be gals that can cherish the internal beauty of a gal.
