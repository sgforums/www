            <div class='col-md body'>I read the Jancie's article on the height of guys but not her other articles. I can't comment on her previous articles, but honestly I find that the points made in her Men's height article is correct.<br><br>It is easily for taller men to find dates and henceforth life-long partners.<br><br>Ladies by nature (geneic programming) will then to seek out taller men. There are women with shorter men but that is a minority.<br><br>There is no gurantee that a taller man will give the woman you greater happiness compared to a shorter man, but still woman will look for taller man. Partly because of:<br><br>a. genetic programming to look for taller (stronger men)<br>b. peer pressure, people will stare or laugh if date is shorter than her<br>c. taller man with marginally shorter lady looks "normal". have you ever seen a TV advert whereby the lady is taller than her "date".<br><br>So give that Janice lady a break. What she said is quite true.<br><br>If you don't believe what she said, go and talked to some ladies and they will tell you the truth.<br><br>That also apply to why women marry men who are better educated (or equirvalent) compared to themselves and also look for men who are more successful compared to themselves.<br><br></div>
