I have a few meandering thoughts on this subject. Please excuse me while I dust off my soapbox and state my thoughts on this. (These are just my thoughts, and I could be wrong.)<br><br>First off, I have been married for almost 5 years to a man that I consider to be a good husband. He puts the kids and I before himself, and I know that he will eventually make it possible for us to reach the amazing dreams that we have for our future. It's not like I am drop dead gorgeous or anything, and I have a few (maybe more) personality flaws.<br><br>I watched a friend of mine treat her boyfriends like crap for years. I always thought that she was so fortunate to have these guys do anything and everything she wanted and then was horrified when she treated them like dirt. None of these guys were perfect, but they were genuinely decent people and it really bothered me to see them treated in that way. Perhaps it is we, as women, who take the good ones, use them up and then spit them out. If being the good guy isn't going to get the job done, then who can blame some of them for being jerks? I am not saying that it is okay for guys to treat women poorly, but maybe if we weren't so caustic and callous with guys, perhaps some of them would still be good guys. Look at it this way, if you kept getting smacked every time you smiled, sooner or later, you'd stop smiling.<br><br>With this in mind, I've come to these conclusions:<br><br>Guys, my advice to you is this, never let a woman treat you badly. (Okay, the exception to the rule is when she is legitimately mad.) Don't let your girlfriend walk all over you, stand up for you rights, not as a man, but as a human being that deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. Treat her like a princess, even if you don't have the money to get her everything she wants, let her know that she is your number one priority. Pay attention to the things that she likes so that you will know how to please her.<br><br>Girls, some of us need to cut guys some slack. If you want to be his princess, then you have to give something in exchange for being treated like royalty. Appreciate him. Let him know that he has pleased you and the next time he makes you mad, say your piece and move forward. Trust me, it is worth it. My husband may not buy me everything I want right away, but he has made it a habit to know what I want and then get it for me when he is able to. One of those things happened to be a big fat diamond ring on our fourth anniversary, in case you are into that kind of stuff.<br><br>I think that most guys want to take care of their women. Being that this is the 90's, it doesn't necessarily mean that women have to stay home, clean the house and be barefoot and pregnant while the man goes out to earn a living. But, as a woman, I think that we need to let down our guard a bit and allow ourselves to be taken care of, at least a little. I think there are still some good ones out there.<br><br>Having said that, just be good to each other. It is not so much a man vs. woman thing as it is a human/human thing. Treat each other the way you would like to be treated. Incidentally, my friend is now married and I know that neither of them are particularly happy. She still treats him like crap.</strong></span>[/b]</blockquote></div>
