            <div class='col-md body'>Dear starbaby,<br><br>I assume that the guy is your bf. Well, the crux of the story is you have invaded his privacy. One pet peeve of some guys is when his gf/spouse tries to invade his privacy either by looking at his emails, sms or diary etc.<br><br>Either way you go, you aren't going to lose him. But what do you want? What do you really want? You to be with him or him to discover himself? And who says you cant have both? You guys can still be together and you can help him to find himself. You two will get a lot closer that way too. You'll be building trust and communication skills which is great.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But also you have to find out what he wants. Does he want to be with you? Does he want to find himself? It's hard. So you two are just going to have to have a talk about your relationship together.<br><br>Think about it together!. It might be one of the toughest things for you to do but letting him go shows how much you really care for him. See but you dont have to unless he wants to and thinks he should. Your boyfriend is one lucky guy for having such a caring girlfriend. You're amazing. Whatever you choose to do, make sure you support him because that's what friends are for. I'm a hopeless romantic so I truly hope you two will last forever.<br><br>I know that you're hurting right now and that the man you think you are in love with is probably someone who doesn't love you in the same way. It's going to be hard but you just have to tell yourself to be strong.<br><br>Cheers</div>
