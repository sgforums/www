            <div class='col-md body'>Here is a personal view:<br><br>Yup, I agree that on the general, local girls are harder to please due to the fact that their expectations and demands are higher, and constantly increasing. However, there are nice girls around, who will stick with you and believe that being in a relationship (be it BGR or marriage), it is about two human beings being together and thus should work towards a better future, believes and hopes the two of them shares together.<br><br>Girls keep complaining that guys change after marriage and tend to be less sensitive towards them. Well, give it a thought. Girls change after marriage too. They become so dependent and more unwilling to put in effort to work things out, to care for her guy and manage the marriage together. They tend to find the easy way out, divorce or look else where to satisfy their expectations, their demands thus the sharp increase in girls having affairs nowadays ( increase in number of married girls having affairs is a fact, go check out the statistics).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why do girls have to be submissive in the first place?? Equally humans rite? hehe However I would say education and living standards play a part in this place we call home.<br><br>Which girl doesn't want a man who is able to provide for her? Well I would say only some black sheeps of the ladies community that makes u guys feel that girls are hard to please.<br><br>Try reading Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus.. hehe..<br><br>Some men are hard to please as well.. but do u see gurls complaining?? Maybe there are.. but not tat much.. Most gurls are  tolerant of their bfs or hubbies.<br><br>It takes two hands to clap. Maybe both sexes should do some thinking before coming to a conclusion. The battle of the sexes is hard to come to an end.. keke  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

People nowadays think that marriage is just a customary and they can cohabit together without e need to marry. Afterall, most ladies nowadays want to be a career woman and some may not want to get tied down cos' of that. Another impt reason to me is that woman find it hard to stay in a relationship.. eg: unfaithful bf/husband, insecurity etc<br><br>I've seen my own family suffer cos of some of e factors listed and i myself sometimes also think that marriage is nothing unless u truly find the right person to share it with.<br><br>3) no comments<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
