            <div class='col-md body'>i think that ger is not interested in getting to know him.. she could be so boring at office so she is nice and polite when sending him e-mails... you know what i mean? cos' you see e-mails mah, she dun see him so she can type whatever she wants. just like now me and you can chat very long but when i see you on the streets, i avoid you.. but back to here i chat with you as normal... so conclusion, she's not willing to be with your friend. I got such experience too. I used to know one ger from internet. After chatting with her, she date me out... She date me out, not me... After the 1st date, then i date her out again... she still go out with me... after that, she never reply to my calls again... no matter how much i page her. when i page her using a diff phone, she reply back immediately.... so you tell me why is she behaving like that?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bus:</div><div class="quote_body"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>There is another story from my friend regarding someone he knew.<br><br>There is a gal in his company(different dept) who my friend knew thru some functions. Both of them are single but this gal had a very strange behaviour<br><br>She is very "nice &amp; polite" to my friend when sending company emails to him but my friend told me there are several occasion where my friend met her up on the way face to face. guess what: this gal behaved like she NEVER KNEW my friend by hiding from my friend (look away, pretend nothing happened), when taking the bus at the bus-stop, she will walked into the crowds so as to prevent my friend from seeing her (her actions were monitored by my friend &amp; this gal thought she is very smart) &amp; get up the bus very very fast<br><br>In his anger, my friend remove her email addresses from his company's email. He told me the whole situation &amp; I supported his actions as<br><br>1. We do not know why this gal behaved like that<br>2. I find that there is NO POINT to associate with this Craps<br><br>Agree with me? Anyone met such a person before? Care to share his/her experience?</div></blockquote></div>

It seems that all these gals have yet to learn their lessons that there are complain being made in the paper that local gal's demand are getting unreasonable that some of the guys are marrying foreigners!

For your case, it is so obvious that when U paged/called her using different HP, she replied... If I am U, I will used this opportunity to "K" her up before slamming down the phone...I will not give face to this gal as there will be chance that guys will do the same to her. People never think that in life there bounds to be 2 ways --&gt; what U have done, people will do the SAME to U one fine day. Agree?<br><br>As for my friend, he had forgotten her liao.... will U waste your time on this crap? That gal is just around 22 years old - so young already behaving in this crap ways.. hopeless.

Not everytime talking bad about you lah... I dun know whether you call it no dignity or not...but some gers like to do that... they think that it's normal for their b/f to buy things for them.. you're now wooing me so you have to make me happy.. make me happy then buy me this expensive bag, clothes.... and the guy, you know what they want in return.... it takes two to clap mah...<br><br></div></blockquote>Ok, then I must be an exception... I dun stare at other pretty girls...<br>IF i see a babe, I just look casually.. to admire her beauty &amp; see if i can get a pointer or 2, from her dressing style or what make-up she used.. etc..<br>I dun see the point of being jealous... unless she's flirting with my BF!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>As for no dignity, I mean, like selling to your body to strangers for $$$, so that u can afford branded goods... tht's jus an example  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
