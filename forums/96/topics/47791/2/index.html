All her friends are just "plain Jane" that we see on the streets every now &amp; then<br><br>2. Normally educated...some "O" level, "A" Level &amp; Poly Diploma holders but she made it that they are very highly educated......KNN, Buay Tahan<br><br>Sometime I just wonder why local gals STILL behaved/think in this way that we guys really dispised them(Sorry to all gals out there but we guys are actually losing our patience). It seems that all these gals have yet to learn their lessons that there are complain being made in the paper that local gal's demand are getting unreasonable that some of the guys are marrying foreigners! Something is very wrong with our society. Maybe this is one of the MAIN reasons that why more &amp; more single gals around.<br><br>Some "plain Jane" wanted to have the SAME shares with those "beautiful Babes"!!! Really lah, wake up</div>
