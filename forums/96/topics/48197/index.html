            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, this is my first post in this forum. Just wondering how do the pictures make it to ''best of sggirls''?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>I don't think it is the no of hits over time as I have seen pics that are over 1000 hits  but still did not make it there.  I have seen pics with less than 200 hits that have make it to best of sggirls, so I think it is the moderators that decide??<br>Another question is about the ranking of members, I have a friend who joined earlier than me but is still a junior member, so I guess when how long you have joined does not determine your status. I have also seen junior members who post a lot of pics but is still junior but there are people who did not post that much but with a few ''quality'' pics becoming ''member'' faster. So I think how ''active'' you is not the factor. Or it is the moderators that decide who move up the rank.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  At the moment I have only seen a few senior members in sggirls.<br>Any comments anyone? Not sure if this is discussed before  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Thanks</div>
