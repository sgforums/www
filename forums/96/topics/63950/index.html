            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by K.K. Cheow (with thanks to Maomao2)</span><br><br>Singapore has declared the recent outbreak of people performing oral sex to be an epidemic, and is taking immediate remedial action. Said Ministry of Health spokesman Dr. Fillay Teo, Â“We have learned from SARS how dangerous an orally-transmitted disease can be. So weÂ’re not taking any chances with Sexual Oral Relations Syndrome (SORS).Â”<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/Sarssheblows.jpg"><br><br>Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Singapore General Hospital have both been put on Â“blue alertÂ”, and emergency crews all have protective masks on to prevent them from suckumbing to SORS.<br><br>The following symptoms are believed to be signs of SORS, and anyone who believes they have contracted it should report immediately to the Communicable Disease Centre at TTSH:<br><br>1) Oral temperature of more than 69 degrees Fahrenheit<br>2) Recent travel to Singapore or any of its police posts<br>3) Recent contact with any 16 year old chicks with big mouths<br><br>Â“No one is sure how or where SORS began,Â” said Dr. Teo. Â“Some believe it jumped from cats to humans, when a 16 year old sex kitten performed fellatio on a police sergeant. Others believe it came through the ingestion of infected suckling pigs.Â”<br><br>There was panic amongst parents as the Ministry of Education banned all students from sucking on their pencils, fingers, thumbs, etc. during classes, causing results to plunge.<br>As Convent of the Holy Cow Girl School student Ai Kou Jiao told our reporter, "If I don't suck on something, I sure fall asleep during class."<br><br>Meanwhile, the World Healthy Oral Relations Examination Society (WHORES) has declared Singapore to be a sucky destination.<br><br>MOH has implemented a nationwide campaign to educate the public on the dangers of SORS. The public is advised to cover their mouths throughout the day with protective masks except during meal times until we are off WHORES' SORS list.<br><br>Ice cream companies such as Marigold, Haagen Daz and Walls are withdrawing all popsicles to prevent unnecessary sucking by the public. IMH, IMCB and NUS have also been tasked to research the use of pacifiers by babies, which is suspected of causing a desire to suck to persist into teen and adulthood.<br><br>However, unlike SARS, SORS has had some economic benefits. Supermarkets like Carrefour have reported a fourfold rise in sales of sausages, especially German ones, with the bulk of customers reported as being housewives, tais tais, sarong party girls, male members of the local theatre community and even some civil servants.<br><br>The Gahmen is urging people not to over-react or criticize official actions, in case this has a negative impact on our economy and tourism. In particular, it is curbing the media to ensure a reduction in the number of wagging tongues. Said Dr. Teo, Â“When it comes to orally transmitted conditions, Singapore believes itÂ’s best to keep your mouth shut.Â”</div>
