People always want to protect the ones they love, but have zero regards for themselves. Sometimes this happens from the roots of selfishness - I can cheong, you can't kind of thing. Reason being: you are a girl and if you drunk, kanna touched by guys, I dun like it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>** This is a classic case of how the mind and heart works. The mind being the rational one will tell you how bad the situations is, how suxy your bf/gf is, how tired you are in the relation, etc. Friends aren't love, therefore your mind is controlling the situation when you are speaking to them.<br><br>You heart will always think emotionally (since your a woman, more if you are negative sign astrologically, even more if you are water-based sign.), about how long you have been with him, how the good old days is, how you feel when he hugs you, cuddles you, etc. When you sees him, the emotional mind takes over because he/she is your love. You lips speak from the emotions, not from the rational. Therefore this explain the behavior. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>*** If you trust your partner, you would ask how do you trust your partner if he is faithful anot. Trust is a yes or no thing - no such thing as a half trust. If you do, you believe in him and his actions. If not, you don't. Regarding trust, always communicate to speak about your insecurity - often you are being unfair because of your mis-preceptions. So do speak up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
