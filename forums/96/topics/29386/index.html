            <div class='col-md body'>for me..<br>i guess these two factors r real impt in a r/s bcoz it needs the effort of both parties to keep it going.

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway tis is my long story...(try to cut it short)<br>we've been tog for 1+ yrs, definitely haf gd &amp; bad memories...but as time past, started to quarrel more often.<br>reasons: mainly becoz he goes clubbing every wkend...no objection to tis but what i'm angry was tat he's in NS &amp; he spent too much $ on clubbing. Whenever we go out, i paid for most of the expenses. Help him abit in getting his license too. Bought N8310 for him when he lost his hp, another N8250 when he lost again. Its alrite if he really broke but i dun see any reason y he shd spend most of his $ on clubbing. Moreover whenever he's out wif his frenz he'll like MIA makes mi feel so insecure. And sometimes will becoz of clubbing dun wanna meet.<br>Eventually he initiated a break-up coz he said he can't take all these quarrellings (after a major quarrel abt something tat happened at a bbq--another long story haiz). He said he wanted freedom. So i let him go but in fact i was still waiting for him...<br>When we not tog i heard tat he quite close with some girls where i'm keeping away from others guys becoz i tot there's still a chance...<br>When i've decided to try to forget him he said he wanted a patch-up. I asked why he said becoz 'ying wei xiang zai yi qi'. Den patch lor...but after 3 days MIA until now. Msg him nv reply so i tot i got the hint &amp; dun haf the courage to call him &amp; asked clearly. Felt so 'ai wan' coz dunno the reason why it happens. Haiz...<br></div>

Whenever we go out, i paid for most of the expenses. Help him abit in getting his license too. Bought N8310 for him when he lost his hp, another N8250 when he lost again. Its alrite if he really broke but i dun see any reason y he shd spend most of his $ on clubbing. Moreover whenever he's out wif his frenz he'll like MIA makes mi feel so insecure. And sometimes will becoz of clubbing dun wanna meet.<br>Eventually he initiated a break-up coz he said he can't take all these quarrellings (after a major quarrel abt something tat happened at a bbq--another long story haiz). He said he wanted freedom. So i let him go but in fact i was still waiting for him...<br>When we not tog i heard tat he quite close with some girls where i'm keeping away from others guys becoz i tot there's still a chance...<br>When i've decided to try to forget him he said he wanted a patch-up. I asked why he said becoz 'ying wei xiang zai yi qi'. Den patch lor...but after 3 days MIA until now. Msg him nv reply so i tot i got the hint &amp; dun haf the courage to call him &amp; asked clearly. Felt so 'ai wan' coz dunno the reason why it happens.

Will you still be able to trust your boyfriend/girlfriend if she always goes out without telling you where and who avoids your questions? Or someone who openly flirts with other girls/guys especially behind your back?<br><br>To make someone trust you, I believe that one should be completely honest with the other person and be <strong>transparent</strong>... no hidden agendas, no secrets. Your actions must be constantly reinforcing the other party's trust in you, and therefore you must think before you do anything... It may take months or years to build up the trust, but one stupid action to destroy it all...<br><br>Trust cannot be blind. Faith cannot be blind. At least that's what I believe.</div>
