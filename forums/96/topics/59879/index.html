Now you've got one. Read on for common guy statements -- and their real meanings.<br><br>Hidden Meaning<br><br>Technically, you and your man both speak English. And certain phrases -- "Would you pass the salt?" "Do you know where the remote is?" -- can pass between you without ambiguity. But let's face it, the language of love can sometimes get confusing. We've compiled a list of some of men's most cryptic statements, as well as questions that will help you uncover the real deal.<br><br>What He Says: "My home phone isn't working, so call me on my cell."<br>What He Could Mean: "I don't want you calling my house."<br>What You Should Ask: "Are you already in a relationship with someone else?"<br><br>What He Says: "You have to be able to ride out these little corrections."<br>What He Could Mean: "I lost everything in the stock market."<br>What You Should Ask: "Do you consider yourself a gambler by nature?"<br><br>What He Says: "My marriage is essentially over."<br>What He Could Mean: "I want to have an affair."<br>What You Should Ask: "Does your wife know this?" "Have you taken formal steps toward divorce?"<br><br>What He Says: "Women are too picky."<br>What He Could Mean: "Women don't like me."<br>What You Should Ask: "Why didn't your last relationships work out?"<br><br>What He Says: "I'll have to check my schedule for next Saturday."<br>What He Could Mean: "I'm waiting to see if a better offer comes along."<br>What You Should Ask: "Would you rather wait and get together when you're not so busy?"<br><br>What He Says: "I'm afraid of commitment."<br>What He Could Mean: "I'd like to continue sleeping with you, but not if it means I have to stop seeing other women."<br>What You Should Ask: "Do you want to try and overcome this fear?"<br><br>What He Says: "So it's me. I'm calling you."<br>What He Could Mean: "I don't particularly want to talk, but I want to get credit for calling."<br>What You Should Ask: "Would you rather talk another time?" or "I get the feeling that you're calling because you think that you should and not because you want to, is that true?"<br><br>What He Says: "So my parents are having this barbecue, and I was wondering if you'd like to come."<br>What He Could Mean: "I'm madly in love with you."<br>What You Should Ask: "Have you told your parents about us?"<br><br>What He Says: "That guy is a big phony."<br>What He Could Mean: "I'm totally jealous that you were talking to that tall, handsome man at the party."<br>What You Should Ask: "Were you upset that I talked to him for so long?"<br><br>What He Says: "It's not you, it's me."<br>What He Could Mean: "It's you."<br>What You Should Ask: "Have we been moving too fast?" or "Have you met someone else?"<br><br>What He Says: "I'd like to cook you dinner at my place."<br>What He Could Mean: "I'd like to dazzle you with what a caring, nurturing renaissance man I am, so that you'll have sex with me."<br>What You Should Ask: "How important is emotional involvement to you prior to being sexual?"<br><br>What He Says: "I need some space."<br>What He Could Mean: "I'm about to break up with you" or "I've realized that I'm crazy about you and it's freaking me out."<br>What You Should Ask: Nothing. Give him his space, and let him figure it out.<br><br>What He Says: "My children are very important to me, and I need to be with a woman who understands that."<br>What He Could Mean: "My children are my first priority."<br>What You Should Ask: "Can you imagine a woman being your top priority while you're still raising your children?"<br><br>What He Says: "You're not a feminist, are you?"<br>What He Could Mean: "I'm threatened by the fact that you don't act like a complete doormat."<br>What You Should Ask: "Do you have a problem with independent women?"<br><br>What He Says: "You remind me of that girl from Sex and the City."<br>What He Could Mean: "... and I'm really hoping you share her same liberal attitude about casual sex."<br>What You Should Ask: "What do you think of that character?"<br><br>What He Says: "How long ago was your last relationship?"<br>What He Could Mean: "Please give me your entire relationship resume, so I can determine if you're a worthy candidate."<br>What You Should Ask: "Why is that important to you?"<br><br>What He Says: "I just want to be friends."<br>What He Could Mean: "I don't find you attractive anymore."<br>What You Should Ask: "Would you kindly remove your stuff from my apartment?"<br><br>What He Says: "You look great in that dress."<br>What He Could Mean: "The party started half an hour ago, can we please leave already?"<br>What You Should Ask: "Are you just saying that to get me out the door?"<br><br><span class="small">Source : Ladies Home Journal</span></div>
