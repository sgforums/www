There is a forum which I went to always criticised about local gals. Some compare local gals to china Babes &amp; said that local gals belong to class 3 standard (meaning low standard in terms of looks) of china Babes!<br><br>I feel that the causes of all these are<br><br>1. Local gals feel that they are "Made in singapore" products so it must be high end product as the country always come 1st in some areas at International level and so become proud and self-centred.<br><br>2.

Financial stable and so becomes less tolerance to the opposite sex and feel there is no need to get married and rather remain singles if he/she cannot meet the right ones.<br><br>Any comments?</div></blockquote>Woman here are more independant in this aspect of their life - if you are looking for a docile kind or the kind where woman stand 'lower' then men - feel free to go overseas looking for your bride. But going overseas looking for bride isn't without its risk - I am sure you heard of stories, which I need not have to go in details, about cheating deceptive brides coming over just to get the PR here. Then how do you know whether your overseas wife loves you for who you are and not for your Singaporean Status?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If my wife were to better off than me in this aspect - It should serve me as a friendly motivation to prove myself and work harder - afterall, there must be improvement and if you are less qualified in your cert - you should work doubly harder than others to prove yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Guys prefer woman less intelligent than themselves because of the ego problem and the fact that smart ladies are more scheming. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
