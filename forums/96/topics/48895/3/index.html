There is DEFINITELY a danger of getting a foreign wife due to many factors being reported in the paper e.g interest in PR status rather than the guy etc. But marrying a local gal does not guaranteed happiness as local gals demands are much higher than a foreign wife! Agree with my statement?<br><br>But in a relationship, there must be someone who will lead and the other who will follow right? If the 2 cannot see eye to eye with each other, can the relationship last regardless of what the guy has right?</div>

You want to find someone who is rich, highly educated but what makes you think rich+highly educated=good? Even if you did land a good catch what makes you think you can keep it? As years go by and you age and yur beauty not so nice anymore won't other younger women also want to take the "catch" from you as well?<br><br>I know of this young highly educated woman who married this angmo guy a few years ago. She thought she got a good catch. They came to singapore to work, then he started drinking &amp; screwing everyday .. not with her of course, almost every month he would go to thailand/indonesia and overseas "business" trips, he even suggested having a threesome to his wife and neighbour. Good catch issit? mmm go ahead do the same ..<br><br>In this world there is such a thing called balance, every strength has a weakness likewise vice versa. Don't you think a man without high qualification will be more determined to try to make it?<br><br>In my view a degree doesn't open doors, it just buys you more time.A man with a degree in the coporate world is good for up to age 30yrs maximum 32yrs, if he cannot perform or produce results, how many degrees u hav also no use u are just as useless, dead after 32.<br><br>I'm 31 this year &amp; still single, I dun have a degree or even o level or any training diploma but I work in the IT industry as a senior systems engineer amazing? I have done system projects for national computer board, SIA, SAF, DSTO, PSA, PSB, OCBC banks, american defence contractors and countless other companies ... I built the first online unit trust banking system in singapore and many more.<br><br>I will say compare myself to most graduates I better them many times over, currently I earn abt 3.5k p/m, my take home however could be 4-5k + allowances and overtime, financially I can take care myself, if tomorrow I kanna retrench for the next 3-4 years I will be v.comfortable.<br><br>So I don't agree with your statement that a guy without degree cannot make it because in my book I know my determination is much stronger &amp; time will sort out everything.</div>
