              <p><br>Thanks for informing them the consequences of their actions. I am already in the process of collecting evidence so that all the criminals here can be duly prosecuted for their actions. It will only be a matter of time that the relevant authorities take actions against those who have infringed on the laws. Ignorance of the law is never an acceptable reason to absolve one of their crime.</p>

              <p>You might be over 16 now. But according to your first post, you were 15 when you had sex with your boyfriend. With or without your consent, your bf has already commited the offence and he might be jailed and/or fined. Depending on when you turn 16, all those boody sickos who have/had preyed on you before you hit 16 will also be charged under the Child and the Young Person act. Of course, they might be jailed and/or fined.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i need to inform you that even if this was a hoax and a lie, you as the TS may be liable for a charge also. Do note that any actions promoting the act of paedophilia constitutes a crime also. That includes you faking as a 15 years old girl and trying to promote or portray a 15 Years old minor as a sex object in a public forum. This is pretty obvious from all the comments you got, and of course you might need to justify in court why did you fake yourself as a 15 years old minor in the first place. You might be jailed and or fined for this also. You might also have commited the misuse of computer acts. So i hope you understand the seriousness of this issue.</p>
              <p>As for WahahaT, it seems to me that you are not remorseful for your crime at all. Let's see if you can continue your haha in the court or when you are inside a jail. I can tell you that the crime you have commited is one of serious nature and it seems like you really don't take a serious view towards the law in this country. Well, rest assured that a formal investigation will be carried out by the authority soon. Or who knows the relevant authorities have started their investigations and are already monitoring the going-ons here?</p>
              <p>I need to highlight the seriousness of the nature of this crime. It seems like you all will only understand the gravity of this issuse when the time comes for you all to face the harsh penalty of law.</p>

              <p>Well, WahahaT, don't think that if TS was lying about his/her age and gender. That would absolve you of all the legal responsibility. The fact that TS has made it explicitly clear that she was 15 in her first post (13 DEC 09) and you knew pretty well what you have posted over here during this period.</p>
              <p>Seems like you are an avid follower of this thread from day 1 up till today. Are you really that eager to go into a jail? What's wrong with you for trying to prey on a minor? Don't try to justify your actions because whatever you are going to say is only going to make things worse for you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>actually, does it really matters to you? LOL, yup i believe we have to follow laws, but now it their personal life? why are you getting into this? she is just sharing her stuff/experience, this is a open forums, not for you to start a lesson. if you are that good in tell laws, try talking to gangster, asking them to leave gang... No offence...</p></div>

              <p>Shoomburger, do you understand the seriousness of this issue? You said that it was their personal life. Fine and entirely legal if it was consenting sex between two adults. You don't see justice_kang or myself going other threads telling others what to do with their life and warning them about the laws etc. But damn it, this thread is entirely different. Someone claimed that she was 15 and had sex with her bf in an OPEN forum. Of course if that person were to keep mum about it, nobody is gonna to be able to do anything about it. To make things worse, we have bloody perverted paedophiles going around openly preying on this minor. Whether TS is really a minor isn't really that important. The fact that some perverts were trying to procure or attempts to procure the commission of obscene/lewd acts with a SUPPOSEDLY minor is already a crime. Watch out to people like WahahaT who seems oblivious to the law in this country. </p>
              <p>Keeping quiet or pretending not knowing anything with only allowed the further propagation of paedophilia. It is only right that any reponsible and upright citizens highlight this to the authorities so anybody who is guilty can be duly dealt with by the law. Not to worry, I will surely do my part and so will justice_kang in the fight against paedophilia. Let's see who will be the first one getting called up for investigation and subsequently being sent to jail. WahahaT, be prepared.</p>

              <p>1st: Yarh you are right that they said they have sex or what in an open forum, but have you ever think it a story? i also can say a story that is good for all readers here. what if she is just sharing a story which happen to her friend? you never knows. yup law is to take action to those who offenced people. But sorry, now it a talk, A TALK AMONG PEOPLE...</p>
              <p>2nd: Did she now meet ppl up and offer sex to them? Did she even say she is going to meet ppl? if you want to take action to other ppl i don't care, but she is a girl, are you treatening a girl now? tell her she is getting her bf into trouble? what if because of your word she goes into depression? are you going to pay her parent a child? can you even give birth to a 16 year old girl? you can't, well then stop treatening her, to the WahahaT, whatever you want to do i can't get involve in it. just leave the girl alone. she does not deserve this</p>

              <p>Message to Justice_kang and Francis Yap: Although you are trying to do your part in this society, i'll like to highlight that this is a girl forum, and you tend to find things like this, do not be over justified. Forums such as this are created for communication between netizens. This question was placed in an OPEN forum for the simple reason of getting results for everyone. Yes, it is possible to put it in a PRIVATE forum, however we may not be able to get the results we want. Similar to advertising. Think about that.

              <p>Oh. So you are now claiming that all this has happened because of a research for a GP topic? What an interesting question for a GP paper. I have never expected such kind of GP question during my time. TS, mind revealing which college set this question for their students? For your informtion, there is a guideline set down by the MOE when it comes to setting of exam question. This question has apparently touched on the OB (out-of bound) area.</p>
              <p>If this was meant to be an innocent research,why were photos being put up to fuel the imagination/fantasy of sex predators? Anyway, i find it ridiculous that because it is a 'girl' forum, we will usually find things like this? What is meant by a 'girl' forum? Tell me where else can I find such threads where people openly preys on minor? I am more than willing to highlight such threads for necessary actions to be taken.</p>
