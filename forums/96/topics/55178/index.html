            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, bear wif me pls<br><br>i got this fren of mine, he is a nice guy blessed wif good looks and has been compared to several celebs but he is a pretty poor fella, gets bout $50 a wk frm his parents as pocket money<br><br>He is funny and easy goin around his mates but gets all stiff around girls, especially the ones he likes, he got no experience in chatting gals up and is afraid to try<br><br>In fact he'd probably jump around the ledge of a 20th storey balcony than go up and ask for a girl's number and name<br><br>Some say his expectations too high but he claims it isn't and i've seen him rate girls, its a bit high but not unobtainable.<br><br>His last and first relationship was 2  yrs ago when he was 19, i think it was short but i don't think it was very sweet, he probably got hurt big time and tats probably why he so apprehensive now for new relationship even ones laid out in front of him<br><br>He always come up wif some reason like he don't think they are compatible for long term and we go clubbing he don't chat girls up, and when they get introed he just have trouble expressing himself and even if he likes a gal and another guy chats wif her, he just backs off without trying.<br><br>I think he is too under-confident (if there's such a word) and he definetly ain't no gay. He just got trouble expressing himself and feeling at ease around girls he like... if this goes on any longer he might just become a bachelor for life<br><br>How to help him overcome his problem? Just such a big shame that a nice good lookin guy like him has trouble getting relationships</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well being him would have it's perks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>but i'd quite comfortable wif myself now thank  you<br><br>so just give me the benefit of the doubt for the time being<br><br>as for the pic i'll need to ask him first... wouldn't want posting them wifout his permission u noe<br><br>Bear; well don't think they are cattle, but i think ppl are allowed to judge others aesthetically and have abit of fun whilst their at it, granted it's between my mates and we don't go around "hurtin"<br>and criticising others on their looks either, i'm sure alot of females do the same exact thing and if u have a problem wif rating then i think u might have a problem wif alot of ppl on this forum and board...<br><br>c'mon don't tell u never clicked on one of those thumbnails and seen the comments left by other users, each and every one of those pictures posted are rated by at least one user and plus comments to boot too.<br><br>So if u wanna have a problem wif dat, then ur gonna have some serious issues mate. Why don't u tell tat to everyone? or u can start ur own thread stating how and why it's unethical, state the points behind ur argument instead of just shooting someone down in their thread asking for some advice and opinions on an issue</div>
