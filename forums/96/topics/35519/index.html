She might not wanting to waste her time just waiting for one fine day when you have the guts to express to her you know. My suggestion is that if she know and you expressed your love to her but she still go for other guy, then you 4get it! If you never expressed before and she oso has doubt that you like her, then you should give it a last blow.... ONE LAST ADVICE for you, bro, gals really dun goes for look that much---- or a handsome guy will never lonely!!! Trust me. Good luck for your endeavor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
