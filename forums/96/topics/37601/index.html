            <div class='col-md body'>To forgive and forget doesnt mean coming out of a bad situation. It is to be able to forgive and forget despite of that situation. Forgiving is simply forgetting and giving another chance. Forgetting here doesnt mean literally "forgeting" but a choice to be able to look at the person and say "hey i remember wat u did to me, but i not gonna  use it against u" giving the person another chance is not to give him another chance to hurt u, but its when u look at the person and say "I wun look at u with a tainted record."<br>Forgiving is ultimately beneficial to urself. Holding a hurrt and pain and grudge for TOO long is unhealthy.<br><br>A feather may be light. But if u hold it with ur arms raised for the next 1 hour, u will feel the strain sooner or later.</div>

Maybe you are rite... abt the theory of forgiving and forgetting... But I suppose i cant do it... or should i place it this way... this guy seems to be the one who should feel guilty that he can actuali say such things to me but im the one who cant face him... im juz afraid to face him that's all...</div>

Do you have anything that happen to you that you simple tot that forgive and forget will solve everything??? Me???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> I used to have someone who told me how much he cant do without me and in the end, he used to leave me for another gal coz he find too much faults in me... This guy even lied to me over something which he know i cant accept for a very long time... At first, i tot forgive and forget is something which everyone can do it as long as he/she have the determination to do it... But guess what??? I was wrong!!! Although this matter happened so long, I still cant do it... WHY??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Kind of like ur way of expression oso... I think to do till the stage of really forgiving and forgeting is not so simple... Cos afterall, we are the ones getting hurt instead of others... To forgive a person who has hurt u may not be so easy.. much less to say forget..<br><br>I used to haf a best fren in my sec sch days... I became best frens with him becos i felt his character and hobbies are quite close to mine and i tot he understands me well... but turned out that he took away the ger i love so much then.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I felt betrayed... Its a simple case of best fren taking away the one u love but the consequences are not so simple.. So in my case, i tried my best to forgive him becos of the ger i love... When we left sec sch, i tried to forget him... but seems hard to do so.. cos here i am toking abt him... To forgive and forget now is meaning less to me as i haf suffered the consequences... nobody but me myself has to bear it all...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>forgive and forget doesnt solve everything. i think it only makes the person feel better... less guilty... But whos going to comfort the person doing the forgive and forget?<br><br>Guess the most impt thing is to be happy.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
