No wonder my friends keep pestering me to stop making fun of bastards. I am so sorry. If I knew that you all are that poor, I shouldn't have say all those things.<br><br>However, bastard you invaded my privacy by posting my pictures without my permission. Do you think I will let this matter rest so easily just because you have apologized to me? Do you think that I am so naive? Hear me, I have nothing but plenty of money and time. This game is so interesting. And I will carry on. I will not let this matter rest. Bring it on. Those who dare, see me face to face in person.

And pls do not use the same email for friendster and other social networking website. Secondly, blame your friend. My search for you could be in vain. But your friend are so tempted. $400 and I can have your phone num instead of you having mine.<br>You and your friend better have a bad fight. You know what, your friend betrayed you because of money. You must hate me a lot. Hate all you want. Address me as Beyotch. By the way, beyotch = bitch(American slang). I have neither gain nor loss. I'm not going to be the one on movie screen. There's nothing I fear off. I wont upset even if there are lots of people hate me.<br><br>because my only sorrow is that he left me. Other than him, I meet no one else. To me, I can address him as a real man, because he is Singapore's best paddler. Although he left me for heaven.

Poor thing.<br><br>I can buy it as and when I like it. And so sorry, you bastard said I "carri" LV. By the way, it's HERMES. Those who are branded lovers should know how much that ONE bag costs. Ten times the price of LV.<br><br>I am very shocked by the language you people use. You all really are non-educated? You people take penny from your parents? I really cant imagine that. Won't you all feel embarrassing? I really look down on you all. Especially the poor. No wonder my friends keep pestering me to stop making fun of bastards. I am so sorry. If I knew that you all are that poor, I shouldn't have say all those things.<br><br>However, bastard you invaded my privacy by posting my pictures without my permission. Do you think I will let this matter rest so easily just because you have apologized to me? Do you think that I am so naive? Hear me, I have nothing but plenty of money and time. This game is so interesting. And I will carry on. I will not let this matter rest. Bring it on. Those who dare, see me face to face in person. I have everything I want, including using money to throw at bastard faces. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It's YOUR parent's money NOT yours, so do your a favour and stop trying to sound correct yea? I didn't know having lots of money will make one's brain slow down faster than normal.<br><br>If I were your parent, seeing such behaviour from you, I would rather give all my money away or your other siblings.
