Tell people say both still an item, never ask for patch already instead acts as a good friend. You still love him.<br><br>Reason of breaking? Not stated.<br><br>Firstly, your ex is just being execising the human guy nature of selfishness. You may ask what the hell does it got to do with selfishness - I am going to explain it now.<br><br>When he ask for patch and you didn't - you heed your womanly instinct because your inner self TOLD you not to. This confusion and delusion is there and you know that history is most likely going to repeat itself if you re-accepted him again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There are two reasons why he never ask for a patch anymore.<br><br>1st reason (18% prediction): He gave up - reason against it is that if he gave up, he would gave up contacting much with you - but he didn't.<br><br>2nd Second (82% prediction): He already lost that kind of feel and passion of wanting a actual relation with you. The next best thing is being a good friend - he acts like a bf to you - flirt with his words saying that you are still his gf, holds your hand. In the Art of Seduction - seducing process, third law - he is sending mixed signal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>So what the hell does it got to do with selfishness? Think about this: you can't let go - and he enjoys the best of both world - being single and knowing that someone would be out there for him - a mistress (to me it means not real gf - xiao laopo kind of thing). He says when you get a new bf must tell him, then if any quarrel he will come console you. He can go xian girls - you can't complain/rant a single shit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Trust me in this - if you get a boyfriend, you will have to go through one problem i already foresee in you - your ex hurdle. On the surface, it seemed he never do anything, but you will definitely have feelings for him because of his *actions* and it will never die unless you kept minimum contact with him. Problems will rise because of him indefinitely and it will *seemed* as if your relation have problem (but of course it is because of him partially) - you will end up even worst than your present situation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Consider properly about the course you want to steer and the decision you want to make. Don't just go blindly with emotions that will *kill* you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers.</div>
