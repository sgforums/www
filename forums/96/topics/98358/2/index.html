            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if she is justifying her cheating ways as you being not open-minded enough, I really suggest you move on, especially if you have concrete proof.<br><br>It's not the guy's fault as a rule. Girls make mistakes too. In this case, I guess she does not have the guts to admit it, or either that she doesn't want to drop the bomb and wants you to make the move to break up.<br><br>Well, I can't stand it if my guy is screwing around, but I will not go around destroying things to vent my anger. If you have done everything constructive that can possibly save or mend the relationship and she is not being cooperative, maybe its time to move on. Better that you invest your feelings on someone who appreciates it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Happy job hunting <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess many pple muz have had the same exp. I'm no exception. Better still.. my first relationship. As wat pple say, the first cut is the deepest. Anyway, as wat elindra has mentioned, the most impt thing is to find out if ur gurl apologetic and serious in the relationship. If not, there is no point to carry on or even pretend as though nothing has hap. True, it hurts now. But in the future there will be many more times ur trust and love will be exploited. Ur heart is not a toy ya. From wat i observe, ur gurl ( or now maybe ex le) dun seem to be one bit remorseful or show any consideration for ur feelings. In my opinion, leave her. Dun live in denial. Pasture is greener on the other side.<br><br>But of course, sometimes it may not be entirely her fault. It could be due to ur inadequacies as a bf, tt's why she turn to others maybe. Den again, she could juz be a big flirt. Nonetheless, that does not justify her extracurricular activities.<br><br>In the case of my 1st gf was, in my opinion, extremely fickle-minded. She flirted with another guy during an overseas exchange trip. When she returned, i sensed sth was amissed. However, i juz swiped it off. Tot i was oversensitive. Well, in the end she came clean and initiated a breakup. At least she was honest. LAter, she ask to get back tgt again. After some tot, she's no longer worth it man. Dun of course she3 bu4 de2 la. But it's the best soln made. As time went by, she had a long-list of had-been crushes.<br><br>Though occasionally i do reminsce and think abt her, but i believe tt was the best decision for myself. So i do URSELF a favour.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
