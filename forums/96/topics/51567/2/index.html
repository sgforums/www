            <div class='col-md body'>kurt .. if you really really think is really worth to woo her .. do it . Even if she has a boyfriend , to me i will fuck care him and i will fuck him upside down for going stead with the person i like. Okay .. an matured girl( maybe shan cai ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) will not tell the person she likes that she like him . Because if she do so , then she will be the one wooing you and not you woo her .. as in liu xing hua yuan , you see dao ming si keep wooing shan cai and why shan cai and not those super models in the party and why not those people who sincerly make an cake and have the guts to tell him but still kana the cake in the face ? Dao ming si is an human .. means he have feelings . Well other people may say he is really like an cold blooded animal sometimes ( dont care for other people feelings) but this also could be his way of expressing to her to forget him as soon as possible . An matured person like Dao ming si also will not tell others what he feels in his heart but maybe to only people like shan cai . Why would he do that , because shan cai is the only one that can turn him from a cold blooded animal to some one with ehem .. feelings? remember last time jerry was called Bao long .. Now call xiao bai tu ? can you guess what it means . Why Dao ming si love shan cai so much is because ( remember the time dao ming si wanner rape shan cai and that time he was so ready to kill some body and when he sees shan cai cry , he also lost his mood to become ke siao ) it is not easy for a person who becomes ke siao then in few seconds , the anger just burn away which is usually when you see the person you love smiles , face , facial expression thats why such people even is not so chio or sexy (shan cai )deserved to be liked and love by dao ming si .Ehem so end of story , pal if you think she is so worth your love , why dont you put all your courage and woo her . Dont become like me , regret after my Teng Tang Jing Left and now i dont know where she is ... I regretted alot for not bucking up my courage to tell her i love her when i had the chance .. I hope i can meet her again some day ( sniffing )</div>
