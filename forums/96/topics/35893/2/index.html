            <div class='col-md body'>Red roses were her favorites, her name was also Rose.<br>And every year her husband sent them, tied with pretty bows.<br><br>The year he died, the roses were delivered to her door.<br>The card said, "Be my valentine", like all the years before.<br><br>Each year he sent her roses, and the note would always<br>say, "I love you even more this year, than last year on this day.<br><br>My love for you will always grow, with every passing year."<br><br>She knew this was the last time that the roses would appear.<br>She thought, he ordered roses in advance before this day.<br><br>Her loving husband did not know, that he would pass away. He always liked to do things early, way before the time.<br><br>Then, if he got too busy, everything would work out fine. She trimmed the stems, and placed them in a very special vase.<br><br>Then, sat the vase beside the portrait of his smiling face.<br>She would sit for hours, in her husband's favorite chair.<br><br>While staring at his picture, and the roses sitting there. A year<br>went   by, and it was hard to live without her mate.<br><br>With loneliness and solitude, that had become her fate. Then, the very hour, as on Valentines before  The doorbell rang, and there were roses, sitting by her door.<br><br>She brought the roses in, and then just looked at them in shock. Then, went to get the telephone, to call the florist shop.<br><br>The owner answered, and she asked him, if he would explain, Why<br>would someone do this to her, causing her such pain? "I know your<br>husband passed  away, more than a year ago,"<br><br>The owner said, "I knew you'd call, and you would want to know. The flowers you received today, were paid for in advance.<br><br>Your husband always planned  ahead, he left nothing to chance.<br>There is a standing order, that I have on file down here, And he has paid, well in  advance, you'll get them every year. There also is another thing, that I think you should know, He wrote a special little card...  he did this years ago. Then, should ever I find out that he's no longer here.<br><br>That's the card that should be sent, to you the following year."<br>She  thanked him and hung up the phone, her tears now flowing hard. Her  fingers shaking, as she slowly reached to get the  card.<br>Inside the card, she saw that he had written her a note. Then, as<br>she stared in total silence, this is what he wrote...<br><br>"Hello my love, I know it's been a year since I've been gone, I hope it hasn't been too hard for you to overcome.<br>I know it must be lonely, and the pain is very real. For if it was the other way, I know how I would feel.<br>The love we shared made everything so beautiful in life. I loved you more than words can say, you were the perfect wife.<br>You were my friend and lover, you fulfilled my every need. I know it's only been a year, but please try not to grieve. I want you to be happy, even when  you shed your  tears.<br>That is why the roses will be sent to you for years.<br><br>When you get these roses, think of all the happiness.<br>That we had together, and  how both of us were blessed.<br>I have always loved you and I know I always will. But, my love,<br>you must go on, you have someliving still.<br>Please...try to find happiness, while living out your days. I<br>know it is not easy, but I  hope you find some ways.<br><br>The roses will come every year, and they will only stop,<br>When your door's not answered, when the florist stops to knock.<br><br>He will come five times that day, in case you have gone out. But<br>after his last visit, he will know without a doubt, to take the roses to the place, where I've instructed him, and place the roses where we are, together  once again.<br><br>=====================================================<br><br>Sometimes in life, you find a special friend; Someone who changes your life just by being part of it. Someone who makes you laugh until you can't stop; Someone who makes you believe that there really is good in the world.<br><br>Someone who convinces you that there really is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it. This is Forever Friendship.</div>
