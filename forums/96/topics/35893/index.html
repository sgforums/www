            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>When I see couples with their love ones together, I envy, whenever people ask me what is love? Have I ever met someone I love or do I ever experience true love,  I would say I have a true love once, and it goes like this :-<br>I am just an ordinary guy in my early twenties, I am a conservative and cautious person where love is concern, I had a girlfriend who was about the same age as me, everything was fine until this girl came into my life...<br>Let's call her Joey. Joey was a ordinary looking girl and was a few years my junior. She was very lively, cheerful and fun loving, the type of so called "sunshine girl" that would be ideal girlfriend for most guys but not me. I always look upon her as a very shrew and easy girl because of her amiable character .<br>Beside I am already attached, why confused myself with another girl who I think might have more than one boyfriends with her all the time. So whenever I was with her, I will distanced her mentally and emotionally because I don't want to get myself burnt by her.<br>Of course she was still good to me despite knowing I am attached, I began to have this feeling that she likes me, to think that I am actually in such a great demand ! I began to feel proud with myself, physically and mentally, boasting to my friends, although they make no comments, I can tell from their eyes that they were jealous, their heart filled with envy.<br>Joey would called me now and then and we would always go out together ,actually I enjoy her company too, what I can say was I treat it as a form of leisure. I am very certain and told myself, she was only a friend to me and nothing else just because I am attached and she knew it ! If she is still fond of me, it can't be help.<br>Although she never express to me her feeling before, I just knew confidently that she likes me, hence I often compare my girlfriend with her and critisied her.<br>To me I treat it as a comment and I don't think she will feel bad, awful or embarrassed because she don't seems to bother with my remarks at all and gave me a silly wide grin instead. So she was unserious and uninterested in what I say! Of course that certainly<br>convinced me she just treat me like one of her boyfriends and I dare not put too much of my feelings too. So life continues and this goes on and years passed so quickly before we even realised.<br>Then one day, I realised that she hadn't called me for weeks. I began to panicked. What is there to panick? You may ask, well, what I mean by panick is not I am scared but I have the kind of fear that I am afraid I will be losing her, everytime I want to pick up the phone, I just don't have the courage to call her, perhaps  it was my ego, she used to call me, I was in great demand, I can still have my girlfriend to call thinking she was throwing tantrums at me, why should I initiate. Why will she be angry when she likes me in the first place? Better still, so I can concentrate on my girlfriend, I convinced myself.<br>My ego stood me for about two months that I finally melted down because somehow,deep inside I missed her, maybe, something has happened to her that discontiuned her daily routine, persuading myself with valid reasons to suppress my ego inorder just to give her a call.<br>The person who pick up the call was her mother, "h..ellooo.."? I stumbled, fearing her mother knew who I am.<br>"Yes, who are you looking for?" she reply in mandarin".<br>"Joey please" I answered.<br>"Joey? She has gone abroad to further her studies one month ago! Are you her friend? How come you don't know?"<br>The news struck me. She didn't even bother to tell me<br>about her trip, I thought we were so closed and she was fond of me all the while. Why did she leave without a word?<br>"hello...?" came the voice from the other end that interrupt my thought "yes, I am listening..." I replied.<br>"do you know someone by the name of Steve?"<br>"yes.....I...am." I stumbled once again.<br>" she left a letter for you the night before she set off, can you come and collect? "<br><br>When I got the letter from her, it read,<br>"Hi Steve, I did not tell you about my decision to further my studies because I don't know what you treat me as.<br>I afraid you will cause me to abandon my thought to the<br>States, wasting my parents hard earned money and continue living a meaningless life as someone you have been taken for granted.<br>It took me so long to make this decision because I couldn't bear to leave you. But there is nothing much more I can do to salvage the situation since you did not make any effort.<br>The reason I did not tell you I am fond of you is because I don't want to put you in a difficult position understanding your present situation. But by being so considerate is as good as killing myself, I suffer all the grievance and anger in the end without you<br>realising. You always give me this feeling that you will leave me one day, and I hate to feel that way.<br>Seeing couples together makes me so envious and depresses my moral wondering who your mind is always with. Words that you say hurts me yet I have to put a strong front because I don't have anyone to fall back on. What I want you to know is I am only just an ordinary girl having normal feelings like others do.<br>Please spare a thought for me, I hope I am making a<br>right decision to stay away for a while, maybe if we are fated to meet again someday, we will be together, last of all, there is something I have always wanting to say and have no courage, I hope that it is not too late, " I still love you".<br><br>Take Care,<br>Joey<br><br>Upon reading that letter, I felt the sharp pain in my heart, she makes me realised that I am fond of her all this while, it was a fact that I refused to admit. She was right, I have taken her for granted all this while. She was a great person to be with actually, the feeling with her was so different, it can't be found in anyone, not even my girlfriend. I shouldn't have treated her so distantly.<br></div>
