            <div class='col-md body'>I have been pondering this as civilisation-old question for a long time.<br>And I haven't been able to come at a satisfactory conclusion...<br>I mean gals ask to be treated the same as guys rite?<br>in terms of what? OK fair enough if the ask for equal opportunities in their career, in terms of demolishing stereotypical household image of women, as well as that of weak, meek and protection needy mammals. So now they get it. Now what? In times of war men are the ones to pick up the rifles and face the bullets and landmines. In times of disaster, men are the ones called up for duty, be it flooding by the Yellow river or fighting forest fires that threaten vast populations in south africa. And may I add that consistently throughout history of advancement in many areas which have ulitmately led  to our current (desirable)state of life, men are the ones who stand out in contribution.<br>If we argue that men and women are different species of an animal, then it is easy to see what would have happened had men not been created. Rampant disease, widespread poverty due to technological standstill at the cartwheel era...<br>Sure there may (MAY i say)be less war going on, but it desn't necessarily mean less people dying.<br>What I am trying to say is that things in history went the way they did not without a reason. Women are lower down the rung in the society due to inherent relative incompetence. Pure and simple.<br>Would the world be what it is not had women been the dominant species? I doubt so. No medical breakthroughs(not as much anyway), no internet, not space programs, no hollywood(how many successful directors are female in Hollywood?), no cars perhaps( we know that the inventors of automobile and air vehicles are all male, and given the ignorance of female in such areas...). Hell the poitical rallies will actually be catfights and verbal attacks on the opponents' dressing , and matters are settled based on decisions made by the heart not the mind.<br>Simply said,don't ask for something you cannot swallow.<br><br>Please...
