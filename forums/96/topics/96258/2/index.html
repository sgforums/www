I broke my heart sobbing in this cold impersonal hospital bathroom, but it was too late to turn back now. I wanted to die.<br><br>But the nurse said there's still more to come. I was numb. I wanted to go home and be with my children, but I couldn't.<br><br>As the hours passed by, others who had had the procedure done were leaving, but I was still there. The bleeding wouldn't stop, and there was still tissue to be passed, I didn't leave until 18.30 hrs.

I resisted. I was 22 years old, and other than a little inconvienence, had no reason to terminate this pregnancy.<br><br>He continued to hound me, even taking time off of work to ensure that I couldn't have time to think, and clear my head.<br><br>It came down to, that if I kept the child, I was to move out of his house, and live alone.<br><br>I had recently lost my job, and had no prospects lined up, my car was older, and about to break down, I had family, but they were not in a position to help me out. I felt trapped and, hence, to make a long story short, granted his requests.<br><br>I'll never forget it.<br><br>It was October 12, 1988. We lived in Tacoma. We drove to Seattle, to the clinic. I refused to fill out the paperwork, and therefore he did it for me.<br><br>I was taken to a dark room, and asked to drop my trousers, and lay on the table with my feet in stirrups. I did. The nurse came in, and held my hand. The Dr. came in, and began her work.<br><br>I felt a sharp pain. I took a breath, I heard a machine turn on, and saw blood coming from my body through the clear tube and into the machine.<br><br>The nurse was trying to speak with me, and was telling me about her kids. The Dr. told me about her kids.<br><br>They turned the machine off, and the Dr. left the room with a plastic bag filled with my blood, and my disassembled fetus, while telling me not to move, she had to be sure she got "all" of it.<br><br>She returned, with the OK to go home.<br><br>My boyfriend came in, and was estatic that I had gone through with it. As we drove away, I felt like I had forgotten something, or left something behind.<br><br>We returned home, and his promise to me to be there with me, was totally false. He left me there alone.<br><br>At first, I was relieved that it was over, and then I was hit by the most overwhelming, tremendous grief I had ever experienced. I was also experiencing very bad cramps.<br><br>Four days after the abortion:<br><br>I got up to go potty, and felt that something was not right inside.<br><br><span style="color: red;">When I wiped, I glanced down at the wad of toilet paper in my hand, and saw, my 12-week old fetus. It's head was smashed, and it's eyes were on either side of it's head. It's body was attached to the head, and only the right arm and hand remained.</span><br><br>I was shocked and horrified by what I saw.<br><br>My boyfriend saw it to. He was standing in the bathroom shaving, while I went potty. He heard me say "oh my gosh", when he turned to see what I was holding. He ran out of the bathroom, and kept repeating, "I didn't see it, I didn't see that, I didn't see the dead baby."<br><br>I just sat there, with tears streaming down my cheeks, as I held my baby's hand on my pinky, trying to find words to say, of why I failed this innocent child.<br><br>I had tuned my boyfriend out, to where he was just some noise in the background.<br><br>I later phoned the Dr.'s office that performed the abortion, asking them to clarify what I had seen. They criticized me, because, "a baby does not form until the last trimester". They deceived me when they initially told me that. It does not take a rocket sceintist to figure out what a miniture hand, with four fingers and a thumb looked like, or to know what it was I held in my hand that day.<br><br>I sunk into a deep depression for two years, attended post abortion counseling through new hope church, where I was mostly made to feel guilty for "murdering my baby," and "disappointing god."<br><br>At night, I'd lay awake in bed, sobbing quietly, so not to wake my boyfriend, who had turned from demanding, to insensitive and unsuportive, and couldn't deal with me, given I simply just couldn't "get over it".<br><br>My relationship with him ended. My experience did not benefit my life, only damaged me. If I had been fully aprised to the full impact, risks, etc., my position would have been different, homeless or not.<br><br>I believe the abortion doctors deceive a person, for a couple of reasons: one, to control the population; another, is to sell our fetuses to labratories for beauty creams, and other medical things.<br><br>I have so badly wanted to tell my story, ever since it happened, but have not found anyone willing to listen, who cared, or wanted to help another to validate their grief.<br><br>My hope, is that my true story will bring enlightenment to another, so when another decision is made, they can have ALL the info to make an informed decision regarding a very life changing decision. My life has not been the same since.<br><br>Thank you, for letting me tell my story.<br></div>

That happens in year 2000.<br><br>They went for private hospital for abortion so that the girl will not have any records. But of course private hospital cost about $2,000 to $3,000. And they broke up eventually.<br><br>During the past 4 years after abortion, my schoolmate have change so much. He looks very anxious and always wann go back early. His face is always pale greenish.  He doesn't behave he use to be. Now he is in Woodbridge and not sure he is out or not because his hp number is not in use. We are unable to contact him.<br><br>Our group of friends last meet in April 04 and he told us that there was this little girl keep following him around for the past 2 years but never speak to him. He always heard baby cried after the abortion 4 years ago.<br><br>Don't ask me about the girl as we did not keep in contact since after they broke up.<br><br>I think many people will said that I am talking cock. But anyhow, better be safe than sorry. Do practise protected sex.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL  Me being pro-choice, I don't think Maia's got any reason to sound righteous just because she didn't abort.  From the way she answered the question, I think she was just being defensive.<br><br>And it's ironic that while you criticise Maia for generalising about "loose" girls and abortions .... you also make a sweeping inference that well-endowed girls are airheads  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dotaro:</div><div class="quote_body">"There are so many girls out there who are loose but they don't have kids--they have abortions" Maia Lee<br><br>I dunno how waht was asked for her to blurt out this quote, but it shows that she's nuthin but a airhead chao ah-lian.<br><br>Is she condemning all loose girls or is she condemning girls who abort are loose? There are so many heart-wrenching situations which leads to abortions. That doesnt mean they are loose?<br><br>Or is Maia "Tow Hong" Lee trying to defend herself being a single mother?<br><br>Well, Straits Times Life! did not put any reason behind her quote, I'll take it that she blurt it out thru her airhead, thinking it's cool to be quoted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>That's why I prefer a-cup sized girls... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dotaro:</div><div class="quote_body">"There are so many girls out there who are loose but they don't have kids--they have abortions" Maia Lee<br></div></blockquote>Actually, from the above statement, I can't see how Maia is saying that girls who have abortions are loose. My understanding is that she is saying that there are many girls who sleep around and get pregnant, but they choose abortion over having the baby.<br><br>I guess Singapore is still a pretty conservative society. I don't see anything wrong with her being a single mother, as ultimately it is her choice and I think she is very brave to do so considering the implications and stigma she has to carry in our society as seen from the various posts so far.<br><br>Anyways if I were to vote for Maia, it will be for her singing/talent and her private life is really none of business and I won't take that into consideration. Its either you can sing or you can't. I mean think abouto those Hollywood stars who are famous because they can act but their private lives are in shambles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think everybody got his/her perceptions in life. I feel that we're wrong to judge ppl by their mistakes. Everyone can see and tell that Maia is an ah lian, but then again, she has her talents. Maybe 1 thing she need to take note to is stop emphazising the purpose of this contest is because of her son.</div>
