            <div class='col-md body'>I have a really close girl friend of more than 12 years I am still crazy about.<br><br>I was in love with her since day one. We like the same music, read the same authors and we both love cats. The minute we met we were like soul mates. And we can talk for hours about all kinds of things or just sit quietly reading without saying a word but still feel comfortable.<br><br>She's gorgeous, intelligent, but tomboyish and eccentric.<br><br>Since I met her we each must've gone through about 5 different relationships with other partners.<br><br>I've told her how crazy I was about her many times but she always skip over the whole subject like it never happened.<br><br>It got very awkward many times but she still accepted me as a close friend after I got over my broken heart and smashed ego. As if nothing happened.<br><br>She would just go: "Oh, you've gotten over it already? Let's go shopping!"<br><br>I'm still very much in love with her today and we're both still unmarried. I now have yet another gf and she has just broken off with boyfriend no. 5, 6 or 7 - I lost count.<br><br>We've been on holidays together just the 2 of us or with other friends. Slept together in the same hotel room etc but we never even once held hands! It's torture!<br><br>I'm now 38 coming 39 and she must be 35, and I still feel like a teenager every time I see her.<br><br>Do I regret that I've never aggressively  pursued her? Yes and no.<br><br>Yes, because, she don't know what she's missing.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>No because, I am very glad that though her many boyfriends have come and gone, our friendship is still as deep as ever. Had I become her bf our relationship might last only a short time and then be finished forever.<br><br>And our time together has given me lots of sweet memories to last me a lifetime.<br><br>But as fate would have it, we now live in different countries thousands of miles apart. We've both left Singapore to pursue our very different career paths.<br><br>We still make plans to go on holidays together but it is getting harder with a busy workload and new relationships etc.<br><br>And if ever we live in the same country again one day - hey, who knows?</div>
