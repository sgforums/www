              <div id="post_message_222707" class="vb_postbit"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><strong>Dear Gals, </strong><br><br><strong>WATCH OUT FOR a lawyer talking about "Law of Attractions" and uses that on ur body!!!</strong> <br><br><strong>Or, to be exact, this lawyer molests his female clients in the name of physical healing. </strong><br><br><strong>I am just another victim. </strong><br><br><strong>After knowing his true color -- a womenizer who seduced many women utilizing his profession and authoritive image, I decided to post the story to this forum so that no more girls become victims.</strong><br><br>Read this post and forward it to ur friends, esp guys who dunwan their girls to get into this in a bad event. But, treat ur girl well, don't make her have to go for a lawyer.<br><br>Watch out if u r:<br>- a <strong>good-looking Chinese</strong> gal<br>- a <strong>young chick </strong>in men's eyes, fresh, or maybe mid-age but attractive<br>- In a <strong>highly unstable emotional state </strong>coz of unfaithful husband or lover. <br>- <strong>u totally break down and r totally lost.</strong> u r thinking of suiciding or killing someone else. Anyone who listens to you and comforts you is a great savior in your life. u need help.<br><br>Watch out for this lawyer <br>It could be him if<br>- He asks u to come for <strong>late night appointment </strong>and <strong>first consulting session FOC</strong>. (u will go... u r desperate... u r probably short of money... u r not sure if the lawyer is good...)<br>- He is very nice n patient on the phone (u start to like him..)<br>- A big office and definitely Gentleman-looking (believe me, you won't think he is a ******* until you see the true colors). <br>- He talks about psychology and mysterious things like <strong>fortune-telling </strong>by looking at ur palm and touching ur skin etc (u start to like him... all women love that sort of things... u r interested in fate coz u were juz played out by ur fate)<br>- His questions getting personal including ur <strong>sexlife and history </strong>(u may tell him.. coz u r so lost and u hate ur man so much...)<br><br><br>Be extremely cautious if he starts to talk about "Positive Thinking", "Law of Attraction" books, CD, and "body-work" workshops. In fact, now it should be the time for u to walk off. Run gal run away don't be like me so stupid we thought we r taking revenge on our man but this is a disgusting trap... run gal run he's not a humanbeing<br><br>Kick him on the *** if he asks u to close ur eyes and <strong>meditate on his chair</strong>. Remember u came to him for <strong>legal advice</strong>, <strong>not Phychic healing</strong>. But dear gal, after talking to him, u r so hurt and sad, u burst into tears, u feel at bottom of the world like hell... and <strong>this gentleman, a lawyer u respect a lot</strong>, is simply asking u to take a rest on his office chair, close ur eyes, deep breathe and meditate... No of coz u won't reject him, will u? u hv lost all of ur life energy in the recent events and the length conversation with him.<br><br>If u dun do nothing, he will start to touch ur body: arms, legs, then closer and closer to breast... everywhere...till u object... he touches in a "professional" way like a physical or mental doctor. I mean, not with a meaning of sexual. He starts to tell u which part of ur body is not right, and by the way u hv beautiful legs / breasts / eyes. <strong>He says he's examining "the flow of energy in ur body". Then he will diagnose.</strong><br><br>Who r u? u r a helpless girl in bad shape, u juz suffered emotional / financial damage, u r so lost, u need help. <br><br>And Who is he? A lawyer has the superior authority in ur and my eyes. a savior listens to ur bad relationship, bad life, a savior who will help u to do all legal proceedings, a savior who gives u clues for ur problems and teaches u how to calm down by meditating and move ahead in life! He's not only ur lawyer, but ur superior, ur friend, ur psychologist counsellor, ur mental and body doctor.<br><br>Dear gal, on normal days, u will never even allow a stranger touch ur back. But deal gal, u r not urself now. u r lost. u gave ur total trust to this man coz he's ur lawyer, hv listened to all ur problems and will represent u to solve all these problems. <br><br>Oh u r so grateful he's dirtying his hands to do some healing for u, massaging u, instructing u to breathe slowly n notice ur energy flow. He even helps to arouse u asking u to throw out all ur painful feelings by doing that. <br><br>Yes gals this is indeed stupid. Millions and Billions of stupidity. But I don't blame u, I don't blame myself, coz this someone, has carefully planned and taken advantage of ourselves skillfully, in our weakest and softest moments. I do excuse myself. But do not excuse urself coz u r now WARNED. Forward it to ur friends.<br><br>Walk off when he starts to talk about fate! Run when he asks about ur sex life! Call police when his fingers touch u! Inform the lawyers' association if he invites u to hotel for a "MENTAL HEALING"!!<br><br>Because, this LAWYER will continue to be "the dawn of ur life" and the best friend. Out of gratitude that "The secrets" teaches us, u will want to give him a retreat at his request. <br><br>There are many many other ugly and disgusting things after the first encountering. I am too disgusted to mention those here. What I can do is to stop u from going to him, or make u able to escape from his office. If not, at least never go back to him after the first "HEALING" session he gave u. <br><br>If u r, up to today, still going to budget hotels with him now and then, my deal gal, believe me, he has many other women on his base for roster. u r not the first one, not the last one, coz he is continuously RECRUITING young, fresh ladies who r hurt by other men.. dear gal, STOP that for ur own good.<br><br>Wake up Gal... if he's a lawyer but he wants to heal ur soul by touching ur body... <br><br>If u hv similar story, share ur story, DONT be SILENT VICTIM!!! <br><br>Gals... Let's throw this devil back to the hell and we will live happily with all the good things we well deserve.</span></div>
