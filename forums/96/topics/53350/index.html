            <div class='col-md body'>A girl in love asked her boyfriend...<br><br>Girl (g): Tell me... who do you love most in this world?<br><br>Boy (b): You, of course!<br><br>(g): In your heart, what am I to you?<br><br>(b): The boy thought for a moment and looked intently in her eyes and said, "You are my rib."<br><br>In the Bible, it was said that God saw that Adam was lonely, during his sleep; God took one of Adam's rib and created Eve. Every man has been searching for his missing rib, only when you find the woman of your life; you'll no longer feel the lingering ache in your heart.<br><br>After their wedding, the couple had a sweet and happy life for a long while. However, the youthful couple, due to busy schedule of modern life, the never ending worries of daily problems, began to drift apart and their life became mundane...<br><br>All the challenges posed by the harsh realities of life began to gnaw away their dreams and love for each other... The couple began to have more quarrels and each quarrel became more heated...<br><br>One day, after the quarrel, the girl ran out of the house... At the opposite side of the road, she shouted, "You don't love me!" The boy hated her childishness and out of impulse, retorted, "Maybe, it was a mistake for us to be together! You were never my missing rib!" Suddenly, she turned quiet and stood there for a long while... He regretted what he said but words spoken are like thrown away water, you can never take it back... With tears, she went home to pack her things and was determined in breaking-up.<br><br>Beforeshe left the house, "If I'm really not your missing rib, please let me go...? she continued, "It is less painful this way... let us go on our separate ways and search for our own partners..."<br><br>Five years have since gone by... He had never remarried but he had tried to find out about her life indirectly... She had left the country and back... She had married a foreigner and divorced... He felt anguished that she never waited for him...<br><br>In one dark and lonely night, he lit his cigarette and felt the lingering ache in his heart... He couldn't bring himself to admit that he was missing her...<br><br>One day, they finally met... at the airport, a place where there were many reunions and good-byes...<br><br>He was going away on a business trip. She was standing there alone, with just the security door separating them... She smiled at him gently...<br><br>(b): How are you?<br><br>(g): I'm fine. How about you... Have you found your missing rib?<br><br>(b): No.<br><br>(g): I'll be flying to New York in the next flight.<br><br>(b): I'll be back in 2 weeks time. Give me a call when you are back. You know my number... nothing has changed.<br><br>With a smile, she turned around and waved good-bye...<br><br>Good-bye... is it forever not meeting each other again?<br><br>One week later, he heard of her death... She had perished in New York... in the event that shocked the world...<br><br>Midnight... Once again, he lit his cigarette... And like before, he felt the lingering ache in his heart... He finally knew, she was his missing rib that he had carelessly broken...<br><br>Sometimes, ppl say things out of moments of fury.... most often than not, the outcome(s) could be disasterous and detrimental.... We vent our frustrations 99% at our loved ones.... And even tho' we know that we ought to "think twice act wise", it's often easier said than done.<br><br>Things happen day by day which are beyond our control... Especially at this moment of the century when the most undesirable event is happening at the other end of the world..... Let us treasure every moment of our lives and everyone in our lives.....<br><br>"Tomorrow never comes; give and take what you have today"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the very beginning, girl's family objected strongly on her dating this guy, saying that it has got to do with family background, &amp; that the girl will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.<br><br>Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrelled very often. Though the girl loved the guy deeply, she always asked him: "How deep is your love for me?" As the guy is not good with his words, this often caused the girl to be very upset. With that &amp; the family's pressure, the gal often vent her anger on him. As for him,.. he only endured it in silence.<br><br>After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated &amp; decided to further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?"<br><br>The girl agreed, &amp; with the guy's determination, the family finally gave in &amp; agreed to let them get married. So before he left, they got engaged. The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails &amp; phone calls. Though it was hard, but both never thought of giving up.<br><br>One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down by a car that lost control. when she woke up, she saw her parents beside her bed. She realized that she was badly injured. Seeing her mum crying, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all<br>that could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. she had lost her voice....<br><br>The doctors says that the impact on her brain has caused her to lose her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming out from her, she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides silence cry,.. it's still just silence cry that accompanied her. Upon reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the ringing tone of the phone. Which pierced into her heart everytime it rang. She does not wish to let the guy know. &amp; not<br>wanting to be a burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not wish to wait any longer.<br><br>With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent millions &amp; millions of reply, countless of phonecalls,.. all the gal could do, besides crying, is still crying.... The parents decided to move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything &amp; be happy.<br><br>With a new environment, the gal learn sign language &amp; started a new life. Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her friend came &amp; told her that he's back. She asked her friend not to let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore news of him.<br><br>A year has passed &amp; her friend came with an envelope, containing a invitation card for the guy's wedding. the gal was shattered. When she open the letter, she saw her name in it instead. When she was about to ask her friend what's going on, she saw the guy standing<br>in front of her.<br><br>He used sign language to tell her "I've spent a year to learn sign language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise. Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he slipped the ring back into her finger. The gal finally smiled.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then you'll know how to Give. Treat every moment as is it's the last day, then you'll know how to treasure. Treasure what you have right now, or else you will regret one day...:Ãž</span></div>
