So that no one can look at her. Better yet why don't you just ask your girlfriend to stay at home. Afterall she can work or study online. Food can be delivered.<br><br>But I forget, she could also get abused in chat rooms, not to mention online pornography. And if she comes across a virus.. thats it. Can't work online, can't order a food. So in the end she might need to leave her home after all...<br><br>Don't tell me this is the first time you guys have ever heard of such things... you act as if this is like a sudden outbreak of SARS.... oh oh lets go get some surgical masks.</div>
