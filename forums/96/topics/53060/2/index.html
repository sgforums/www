I do not actually say 'Pi$s off'.<br><br>And here's what i think of you:<br>1) Someone who cannot handle a bit of criticism frm a female<br>2) Obviously not a man.

            <div class='col-md body'>You wrote this,<br><strong> Â“I dont give a FLYING FCUK what u've got to say.Â”<br>Â“On a side note, blah blah blahÂ”<br>Â“You are making a pathetic attempt to save yourselfÂ”</strong><br><br>All along my point is that you are a b!tch and a complete waste of time, which you generously agreed and tell me to look at your signature. So how have I been proven wrong? And when did you see me trying to speak up for myself?<br><br>Yes my dear, IÂ’ve once again being proven wrong. I thought you are just a regular b!tch that has no manners and enjoys talking out of your @ssÂ…but now youÂ’ve proven to me how u are a dim-witted parrot that struggles to find your own language and expressions all the time.<br><br>Fix a date, join that ah beng for his English lessons.<br><br>And more desperate attempts to defend your nonsense, despite you repeatedly saying that you donÂ’t see the need to justify your actions:<br><br><strong>Â“I do not actually say those things out loud, maybe that's the impression that u had, but rather, what i would be thinking in my head. I do not actually say 'Pi$s off'.Â”</strong><br><br>Talking out of your @ss again. So now u suddenly remembered that you didnÂ’t say anything at all?? Is your silly image on the internet so important to you? Ask me nicely, I might let you talk your way out of it all. Anyway, this will be my final reply cos IÂ’m not interested to know whether you are lying anymore.<br><br>And finally the parrot tries to end her speech in a supposedly light-hearted manner :<br><strong>Â“On a side note, if ur dog has better manners, maybe u should consider putting him in a dog show. I'm sure the judges would be impressed.Â” </strong><br><br><strong>????????? </strong><br><br>I appreciate your effort but listening to your lame jokes is as interesting as watching the paint on the wall dry.<br><br>I couldnÂ’t believe for the past few days, I wasted so much time replying to a woman who is a b!tch with no manners (yup! SheÂ’s so proud of it she makes it her signature), a dimmer who has no logic, and a p!ss poor comedian who tries too hard to be funny but will never make the gradeÂ…all rolled into one.<br><br>I must be bored. Goodbye.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why dont u stop trying to save yourself from further embarrassment? Obviously u have nothing more intelligent to say, which is why u must resort to personal insult. A sign that someone realises that he has lost the argument.<br><br>You've realised that u cant say anything else, so now decided to devote a whole post to telling me what a b|tch i am, and how high my intelligence level is. What happened to your original statements? Or did u realise that u were making a big fuss out of nothing? Can u say nothing else to back yourself up? Just because u dont like how i reply some guys who approach me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  I dont see how this affects u at all, does ur world stop revolving or something? In that case, I'm flattered that u care so much. Hmm.. maybe u're one of those guys whom I've scorned in the past..<br><br>Hey.. reminds me of my current fave song.. *sings*<br>"So what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying<br>Are you offended by the message I'm bringing<br>Call me whatever cos your words don't mean a thing<br><strong>Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing</strong>" Lalala..<br><br><blockquote>So now u suddenly remembered that you didnÂ’t say anything at all?? Is your silly image on the internet so important to you? </blockquote>I did not suddenly remember that i did not say anything. Yes, i did reply that I'm not interested rather rudely, and my tone would have said 'Pi$s off' very clearly. If u even know how to read, you'd learn not to take everything LITERALLY. Duh..<br><br>Oh.. and trying to be comedian? Sorry, that job is reserved for you. There's a difference between sarcasm and comedy. But then again, I dont expect u to get that.<br><br>Hmm.. let's see if you'll stick to ur word of not replying anymore. I doubt so. Anyhow, good riddance.<br><br></div>
