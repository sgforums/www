            <div class='col-md body'>hey pal..<br><br>I know you're feeling terrible la... been through this shit myself. But this is THE chance for you to strengthen up and know more about the psyche of women.<br><br>You are being too nice le. Ever give it a thought why bad guys get the gals while the good guys stay at the sideline? Being too nice, giving in to your girl too much and saying too much "I love u" for no good reason only serves to kill off that air of mystery and excitement that being in love creates. You probably have done too much of those "nice stuff" that killed off her interest in you.<br><br>Girls are like that la...particularly young, and/or pretty ones. Once they dun feel that mystery and excitement from you, they simply say they dun have feelings for you and thats it. These girls probably dun have problems finding dates and they have the veto power in relationships. The poor guy is simply left shattered.<br><br>The point is, remember to be a bad guy sometimes. Don't say "I love u" unnecessarily, dun give in to her demands all the time and dun be a wimp. Be the confident and independent man that all women crave for. Make her long for your attention by making your attention to them scarce. Make them "earn" it. Let them take the initiative sometime to impress u instead of the other way round. In short, let them play part of the role of chasing as well. Only that will women think you are the one for them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
