            <div class='col-md body'>Pop quiz hotshot<br><br>What would you do???<br><br>You are driving along in your car on a wild, stormy night, when you pass by a bus stop, and you see three people waiting for the bus:<br><br>1. An old lady who looks as if she is about to die.<br><br>2. An old friend who once saved your life.<br><br>3. The perfect partner you have been dreaming about.<br><br>Which one would you choose to offer a ride to, knowing that there could only be one passenger in your car?<br><br>This is a moral/ethical dilemma that was once actually used as part of a job application. You could pick up the old lady, because she is going to die, and thus you should save her first; or you could take the old friend because he once saved your life, and this would be the perfect<br>chance to pay him back. However, you may never be able to find your perfect mate again.</div>
