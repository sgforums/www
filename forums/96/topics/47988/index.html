I think it is better for you to make things clear before we carry on the discussion. Sooner or later you will come out with something new again.<br><br><blockquote><strong>will u forgive them and remembred the good things they had with u b4? u able to forget the suffering they caused to you? if u can, well, i'm can say u r pretty noble... but i cant do till these stages.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </strong></blockquote>I would appreciate you make your point clear before I answer that. Looks like your answer is definitely a no and wouldn't accept anybody to say yes. Than why bother to post in forum in the first place?</div>

And at the same time the stupid idiot MUST also forget the incident it in order to be TOTAL FORGIVENESS.
