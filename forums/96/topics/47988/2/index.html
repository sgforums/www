People learn as they grow, people learn from mistake. By forgetting everything means there wouldn't be hatred, this type of people are totally hopeless. Mark my words, you are bound to meet into the same problem again if you want to act nobel forget everything.<br><br><blockquote><strong>If you mentioned the above situation then you are missing the whole point.

The topic is just asking as general comment and I believed everybody are giving their general comment. You want detail comment, you give the detail. That is the basic rule of the game. Stop blaming others when you got your co[/b]ck hit on your head. Learn from mistake and not trying to cheat yourself telling the whole world you very nobel you willing to forget everything. When things happen again, you start to cry telling everybody you got hurt again because you didn't remember and learn from the past incident.<br><br><blockquote><strong>There's no point in blaming others and being rude.

He was fond of a gal and was chasing after her. He given bought alot of gifts for the gal &amp; does alot of things jus to let her happy. The gal also like him but didnt want to be his gf. One day, He introduced the gal to his 18 yrs long friend. Never know that, a few weeks later, his friend &amp; the gal hit it off. After that, the 18 yr firendship was broken jus cos of this gal. The two guys seldom talk to each other anymore...<br><br>This tells that not everyone can forgive and forget. It's up to individual thinkins and how's they intend to treat it.

You are just simply wasting everybody time if you can't read and understand my post. Perhaps you should take up basic English class.

Not forgeting means painful?<br><br>I suggest you don't reply if you can't read. Stop making a fool out of yourself again and again.

The topic starter did not state how big or small the issue is and no there is no way for me give a definite answer. I mentioned don't forget doesn't means that I will keep a distance from him, doesn't means I don't talk things over.

Neither I am smart or clever, I don't see the point in bringing to those philosophies. I would appreciate anybody who don't agree with me to come out with better logic and not just come out with something new base on groundless assumption or simply put words in my mouth.
