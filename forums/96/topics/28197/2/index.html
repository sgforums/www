            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like you are experience a teenage crisis or middle age crisis.....and whatever it is, all I can advise is that you will need to think more positively and just make yourselves busy with lots of activity. Activity does not necessary means clubbing or pub maybe some thing more healthy with lots of sunshine and lots of fresh air. Visit mother nature...places like beaches, park or even Bt Timah hill. (I love to visit the beaches when I am not feeling good irregardless of the time.)<br>BBQ at night, badminton game, tennis.....blar...blar.... that you feel that you can relax while working out. Seen a medical research that working out can make our brain produce a kind of substance that give us a good feeling about ourselves.<br>But most important of all, you got to straighten out your own thinking. As everyone have their lows and highs in life , guess this is part and parcel of life and it all depends own how we going to face it. HAPPY or SAD.........To do something about it or sitting there grumping about it. THE CHOICE IS YOURS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Just my 2c worth.</div>

Well...I have my doubt and why not take it as a lesson learned and accept whatever have happen cos. time is irreversible. No matter what had or has happen will eventually come back and haunt you.<br>But if you accept that something begin learned out of it......it may not necessary be of a bad thing.
