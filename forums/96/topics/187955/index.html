When you watch manga translated into English, it's not Singlish. I am not saying you need to write in Cantonese, but if the context of your story in in Hong Kong, your English also need to be correct - that's of course you are capable of writing good English.<br><br>It's not the "big words" I am talking about. It's about the little things in any given sentence. Those are totally wrong.<br><br>If you are serious about wanting to write - which is not wrong - you need to know HOW to write and HOW to communicate your idea. Conversation itself does not convey a lot of background information. Pick up any good novel and you'd see that there is very little conversation. Even in scripts for drama, there are indicators as to what the characters are doing.<br><br>You are obvious upset about my comments, if you are just posting for fun, than it's ok, but if you are serious about wanting to write well, think about what I'd just typed.</div>

Would you believe it's written by my son? In all honesty, what age do you think Cheese cake is when you read the story? A primary school kid? <strong>Well if Cheesy is Primary 1, I'd say the story is darn good. But if she's in secondary school or beyond, I'd say she better work really hard on her composition.</strong><br><br>I did revised her intro by pointing out where the story has gone wrong. I could have done the whole nine yards but I am not that free. Obviously she (as well as your kind self) is totally free to disagree with my amendments.<br><br>The issue about giving feedback: <strong>feedback was asked, and I gave</strong>, the story sucked big time and I said why. Can you point out to me why you disagreed with my assessment, other than the fact that you are happy with what I'd written.<br><br>At least I am able to say exactly where the story has gone wrong. If you wish for me to refresh your memory:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Introduction of the HK element - this may or may not be important to the story because I did not go beyond chapter 1. But by introducing the HK element and not following it up as the story has Singapore elements (ie Singlish, Primary school) the background is already flawed.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Poor grammar, be it the tenses, past and present, and poor sentence structure.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Poor layout: some inverted commas are missing, leading a reader not to know where a conversation started or ended.<br><br>I need to emphasize that all readers are asked to critique the piece of work. It is unfortunate that my assessment of it is less than what some of you think. If a reader does not want her worked to be critiqued, please refrain from making such an invitation.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seeing the above posts, I have to say this. If you really want comments, you must be able to accept not only positive, but also negative comments as well. Making mistakes and recognising them is the way to improve.<br><br>Even though your story's target audience is Singaporeans, it doesn't mean you have to type it in a Singlish way. Note that Singlish sounds nicer being speech than being text. As the previous poster have said, your grammer has to improve and cut down on dialogues. A good story contains minimal dialogues and uses more vocabulary to describe actions, emoticons, thoughts etc.<br><br>May I ask how old are you?</div>
