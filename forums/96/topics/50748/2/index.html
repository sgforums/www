U cant control another's emotions....<br><br>And in the end, It's still up to your gf...<br><br>If she chooses to leave you for another guy, it's her choice..<br>respect her decision...<br><br>Doesnt mean that if she wants to leave you, it must always be becus there was a 3rd party after her...<br><br>Ur remarks make you sound like you're an insecure guy...(no offence at all)<br><br>In a relationship, u must have trust... (of cus, i noe tt u aint in one now tho' but im just trying 2 get my point across)<br>Else what's the point of being together..<br><br>Sure sometimes, we love our partners so much that we fear abt 3rd parties getting in between us... but ultimately, if our partner chooses to leave, there's nothing much we can do..<br><br>As I've said before.. no use begging, since his/her heart is most probably with the new partner and no longer with you...<br><br>What will be will be....</div>
