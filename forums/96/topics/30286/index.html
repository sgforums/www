            <div class='col-md body'>The Do's And Don'ts For All Zodiac Signs<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Aries (Mar 21 - Apr 19)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Aries are naturally active and vibrant people and they tend to like such people too. You will have to increase your pace to be in step with them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;They like and appreciate frank and straightforward persons. With them you can be your true self (but don't try your luck being over frank-they are volatile). If you are in love with an Arien, then you have to show your enthusiasm in all their activities (you can always yawn later!).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Do not tell an Aries that s/he may be wrong. Any such statement may stir a storm in a teacup. Aries are very faithful and passionate lovers.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Do not give air to the smouldering fire within them by making them jealous. No flirtation or fooling around with others in their presence unless of course you wish to write your death wish (you will be granted!).<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Taurus (Apr 20 - May 20)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Stability and dependability characterise Taurus. They like people who can blend and grow with them. If you have a Taurus partner you should appreciate all things bright and beautiful. They have an inherent artistic sense and are fond of colour and music. Judge life with them from a purely materialistic point of view. Enjoy everything luxurious that money can provide. Enjoy good food (better if you can cook to please them) and good drinks with them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Taurus do not loose their temper easily (in fact you may spend the whole life with them and still no spark) but you should not push your luck too much. Being unreasonable or aggressive with them may get you into trouble. Do not press him/her into a corner, and if you do, be prepared for a violent rage. Taurus is capable of violent outbursts though such an event is is very rare occasions. They can be suffocating when they are possessive about you.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Gemini (May 21 - June 21)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Gemini is a highly intellectual and versatile person. If you have a Gemini partner you have to match your wits with his/her wits to keep the zing in the relationship. They want to be mentally simulated so you have to be good at conversing. Your sense of humour will get you a permanent residence in the heart of a Gemini. Be more communicative with them, and if you are good at this, you will never know how hours pass by holding each other's hand.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Gemini's like to do many things at the same time, so if<br>unfortunately you are the type who is looking for stability you may get disappointed. Do not hold back a Gemini or you may lose him/her, as they are restless and need change in life constantly. You should try to adopt yourself with the ever-changing Gemini. Orthodox or conservative old fashion ideas are no-no in their dictionary. Change with the ever-changing Gemini and do not! flow against the current.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Cancer (Jun22 - July 22)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Try to adapt yourself with the changing moods of the Cancer. At one moment they may be laughing and enjoying and in another they may sulk. You may have to adjust with the moody and sensitive Cancer. They are like the tides in the ocean, always tuating. Cancerians love food, so if you know how to cook and can be poetic and romantic (added Bonus) then you know the way to their heart.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Cancerians are very sensitive people and can get easily hurt. So do not play with their emotions and sentiments. They are like tides that can sweep you along. They form emotional bonds with even inanimate things, so do not ask them to discard old caps or souvenirs. Such things hold special meaning to them. You have to realise that the crabs have a soft heart and are vulnerable. Do not contradict their tested line of thought and action, it would only lead to confusion.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Leo (Sep 22 - Oct23)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;If you have Leo partner respect him and his majestic manners. Accept the advice of Leo, the lion, as he is the king of the jungle. It is the sign of a showman, so if your partner does everything in grand style enjoy it. They fall easily for flattery and want to be centre of attraction of all eyes (sometimes they can be quiet theatrical too).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Never ever hurt the ego of a Leo. Pride, ego and vanity are some of the bags Leo's always carry with them. Do not touch these bags. An authoritative Leo is even more difficult to handle in such<br>circumstances.Leo is a sunny sign so they do not like people who are gloomy or depressed. Even if you are crying at heart keep a sunny smile on your lips and then let the lion take charge and remove all worries from your life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;&gt;Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept22)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Virgo's are very methodical and have a great sense of duty. Howver, they are blind to their own faults. So, if you have a Virgo partner emphasise more on their qualities. Take keen interest in what they are doing and you will realise that they will go out of their way to help you. Do rely and appreciate their mental powers rather than their physical powers.They can turn even an unsuccessful venture into a success.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Do not push a Virgo into limelight or on the centre stage unless of course they do so on their own. They are shy and reserved by nature and do not like to be the cynosure of all eyes. Virgo's have secrets that they would not like to bring out in the open. So, even if you have the key to their secret skeleton-closet, hide it; do not even admit that you know anything about it. Virgo, the virgins, do not want to tarnish their public image.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Libra (Sep 22 - Oct 23)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Librans need peace and harmony in all their relationships, so help them maintain that. Venus, the ruling planet, gives them beauty and they have weakness for people who can compliment them about their beauty (you will not have to make an effort to do that anyway). You can help Libra seek union and partnership in life. If you have a Libra partner you can be sure to share beautiful and pleasurable moments together.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Libra is kind and gentle soul but very argumentative. Hence, do not start an argument or discussion unless, of course, you are free and do not know how to pass your time. They hate to lose and most probably during an argument may change sides too remember scales can tilt) and still continue arguing from the other side. Do not push your Libra partner into making decisions. They will keep weighing pros and cons and may still not be able to come to any decision. Have patience !<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Scorpio (Oct 23 - Novr 21)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Scorpio's are full of passion and zest for life. They have tremendous drive that can involve you too. Tune in to their velength and you can enjoy the harmony and music of life with them. Scorpio's are loyal and never forget a kind deed done by you. If you want to enjoy life with your Scorpio lover, share their passion and intensity and you will be fascinated by how beautiful life can be with them.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Scorpio's are very passionate and intense but they are also fiercely possessive and would like to possess your mind, body and soul. Do not let seeds of jealousy grow in them because then you may have to suffer agonies of jealousy and discontentment in life. Scorpio's have explosive tempers be careful how you handle them. They never let anyone know what is going on in their mind till they strike and you may be caught unawares. Do not flirt around in the presence of your Scorpio lover.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Sagittarius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Sagittarius is basically a happy go lucky kind. You can enjoy with them their zest and enthusiasm for life. They bubble with excitement. And if you share the same interests and hobbies, life can be great fun together. They are frank and straightforward so if you want some truthful opinion about anything or anyone go to them. Be optimistic as they are and view life as glass half full.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Sagittarius is fiercely independent and cannot tolerate restriction. Hence, do not try to hold them back in life. Let them enjoy their freedom because if you hold any special place in their heart they will always come back for you. Do not feel irritated by the exaggeration in their speech. They may go on and on, talking about certain things that may not even interest you, but its their way of trying to communicate with you. They are basically frank and outspoken (to the point of being rude), so do not feel offended by their talks.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 20)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Capricornians are strong and dependable. Hence, if you want to put your money on anyone it is of course this zodiac sign. They are practical and conservative in their outlook and they expect you to blend in their colour. They set certain standards for themselves in their life and they will always try to maintain those standards. For them social status and image is very important in life.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Do not expect a Capricorn mate to open his/her heart and pour<br>everything to you. They are very secretive and reserved people. They are very thorough in all their affairs and hate any kind of sloppiness. People born under this zodiac are very tight-fisted and economical. Do not expect lavish gifts from them and if they do give you any gift (that is very rare) it will have some practical use (no romance please) but that does not mean you will be deprived of anything; on the contrary you will be well provided.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Aquarius (Jan 21 - Feb 21)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Aquarius are friendly and fascinating people. They have in-depth knowledge about various subjects and you can converse with them for hours without getting bored. They are capable of giving a lot of love that can be amazing. They have a very broad outlook of life and you can relax in their presence. They will always welcome your ideas and actions about humanitarian causes. To keep an Aquarius lover interested you must possess that mysterious and intriguing quality. Once hooked they will always be very faithful to you.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Do not expect or plan a normal, simple and predictable life with an Aquarius partner. Aquarians are totally unpredictable. They can go to any direction without giving any advance notice. They are basically very restless and get bored easily. Though they are very friendly, do not expect them to reveal their inner most feelings to you (they never will). They can be detached and impersonal, which may seem strange to others.<br><br>Pisces (Feb 22 - Mar 21)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DO'S<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Pisceans are sensitive and charming. If you are looking for someone who is understanding and can understand your feelings then you have met the right person. You should appreciate their feelings too, as in your time of need they are sure to help you. Pisces have a keenly developed sixth sense and have great intuitive powers. Their hunches may usually be right on mark. But they can exhaust their physical and mental energies. They are born dreamers and you can build palaces with your dream lover<br>(only in real life it may become a little difficult preposition).<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'TS<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Pisces are dreamers and you should not expect them to have worldly ambitions. They are not materialistic in nature. It is not that they like living below the poverty line but they have no earnest desire to accumulate wealth. They are very sensitive and you have to be always careful about their feelings. The fishes are ! capable of drowning you in their tears (even men born under this sign).<br><br></div>
