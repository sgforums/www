The guy I was with insisted that we shouldn't finish dinner and he drove me to where she was. I didn't tell him what was wrong, just that I was worried for a fren. He was quite nice about it. Although nothing came out of it but we're good frens now... lol<br><br>But this type of situation should be quite rare lor, I agree that she might just be pushed ard by her frens or something.<br><br>Anyway she apologised so let bygones be bygones. no point getting so angry. lol as stated, so many pebbles out there</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,people to tell you the truth,that is merely a hypothetical scenario.Nothing of that sort happened.I modified this story a lot to see how you guys will react to it.I shall tell you the truth now.<br><br>Last Friday,I was supposed to go out with a close female friend of mine.I have known her for a year now.She is pretty(with makeup,that is) and I know from the start she is attached.Anyway,she is not my type of gal regardless of her marital status so I never have any thoughts of getting hitched with her.Ok,back to what happened.A few hours before we were supposed to meet up,her close girlfriend whom she had not seen for quite some time wanted to hang out with her.My friend was thus in a dilemma,so she called me to ask for my "permission" whether she could meet me another time instead.Since I knew it was her good buddy who was asking her out,I felt that even I said "No",she would not be in the "mood" to be with me.So I relented and let them be together.I was kind of pissed that her buddy who knew she had an appointment with someone else(me) and yet she tried to snatch her away from me.I felt that she is not very "zi dong".I felt that I was the sacrifical pawn for her buddy...<br><br>Anyway,got to rush off...To be continued.</div>
