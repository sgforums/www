              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 48pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I like that I'm called a fake DJ </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 20pt;">Model-DJ Leng Yein says that means people have low expectations of her but she gets the jobs</span> </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Leng Yein readily admits that flaunting her assets gets her more money. </strong>ST PHOTO: MATTHIAS HO <br> </p>

              <p><br><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 64pt;">M</span>alaysian model-DJ Leng Yein does not mince her words and she is not afraid of the backlash when it comes her way.</p>
              <p>   The 29-year-old, who is a former beauty queen and American auto show Hot Import car model, was recently caught in an online spat with another female model-DJ, Singaporean DJ Tenashar.</p>
              <p>   Tenashar, a former FHM cover girl known for her skimpy outfits, is ranked No. 87 on DJ Mag's top 100 DJs poll.</p>
              <p>   Tenashar, 27, had accused Leng Yein of sabotaging her console at a concert at Sunway Lagoon in Kuala Lumpur last month, which sparked a war of words on Facebook.</p>
              <p>   Leng Yein, who denies Tenashar's charges, tells Life! of the online fiasco: "I am like Tenashar because we sell what people like to talk about: free publicity."</p>
              <p>   The DJ, who asserts that it was impossible for her to meddle with Tenashar's set-up before she took to the decks, adds: "But for what she said about me - that I sabotaged her equipment - if you're an F1 driver, you'd know your car well. As a newbie, an unseeded DJ, I was taught to always check my equipment and pay attention."</p>
              <p>   The Miss Malaysia World 2003 winner was last in the news in 2011 for undergoing several cosmetic procedures amounting to more than $100,000, including a nose job and breast enhancement.</p>
              <p>   The busty bombshell, who is single, was far from shy in flaunting her 34F assets in a tight, black corset top and hot shorts when Life! met her for this interview. She will be DJ-ing at Asian-fusion nightspot Neverland 2 as part of the club's new, all-female DJ series which kicks off on Thursday.</p>
              <p>   The club will have sexy female DJs helming the decks twice a month, featuring DJs such as Leng Yein, and DJs Roxy June and Faahsai from Thailand.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 24pt;">1 </span><strong>How did you get your start in DJ-ing?</strong></p>
              <p>I started learning to DJ two years ago on vinyl, and at the end of last year, I started learning to use CDJ and vinyl emulation software Serato.</p>
              <p>   Two years back, a headphone company approached me and asked me if I was a DJ, because all the big-boobed girls are now DJs. I said: "Okay, I have big boobs; I fit that category, if this is what you want, sponsor me and I'll do it".</p>
              <p>   It was just the one time, but I started DJ-ing again about three months ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 24pt;">2 </span><strong>What do you think about people who say you are a fake DJ?</strong></p>
              <p>I like that, because they have such low expectations of me... at least I don't slot in a pre-recorded CD. The joke is that I'm a bimbo or that I look like a stupid DJ but people hire me and the crowds haven't complained... yet.</p>
              <p>   I'm not the best but I won't be the worst. I've been playing piano since I was five, so I have a classical music background, I won't go out of beat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 24pt;">3 </span><strong>Do you feel you have to flaunt your assets to get DJ gigs?</strong></p>
              <p>No, but you get paid so much better, without having to be a top DJ in the world. I earn a comfortable five-figure sum each month.</p>
              <p>   There's always a Lady Gaga or someone really popular in the world that is paid the most, but not many people can be such an icon; 99.9 per cent are just trying to make it like the top 0.01 per cent. I fall into that category. We just try to work and pay the rent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 24pt;">4 </span><strong>So you don't let the negative criticism get to you?</strong></p>
              <p>I get mad, I cry, but I don't smash my stuff because I'd need to pay and buy them back again and I'm not that dumb. It gets to me and I go crazy, that's why I'm a crazy person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 24pt;">5 </span><strong>Are your parents supportive of your career choice?</strong></p>
              <p>My family is conservative but very supportive. They say: "I'd rather you go out wearing a bikini doing what you do rather than strip in someone's room and 'cheat' them of their money", if you know what I mean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 24pt;">6 </span><strong>Is this something you see yourself doing for quite a while?</strong></p>
              <p>I just started actively DJ-ing for three months or so. And I have shows in China, the Philippines and Japan soon. I'm grateful to everyone, whether they look down on me or support me, that they gave me a chance.</p>
              <p>   Whether they come to my show to mock me or to see how well I can do something, at least they come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 24pt;">7 </span><strong>Will you speak to Tenashar if you bump into her in public?</strong></p>
              <p>I'm just going to smile and I need to respect people in the same profession as me, because she is a senior and I'm a junior. My mum always taught me to respect elders.</p>
              <p>   Tenashar is the first female Asian DJ to make it as a world top DJ. I hope one day, she can go up to No. 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #808080; font-size: 24pt;">8 </span><strong>How would you like to be remembered?</strong></p>
              <p>As someone strong, someone who will never be told what to do and live life the way others want her to live. I am my own woman.</p>
