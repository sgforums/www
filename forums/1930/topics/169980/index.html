            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I got some thoughts to share after reading some posts regarding ball drillers that simply amazed me. To me, the bowling business in Singapore is stil very immature. Sometimes when i am bowling at certein bowling centres, i will notice some bowlers that wan to improve their game by purchasing a personal ball, so i will see them walk into the pro shop and buy a ball which they like or can afford, very often a tornado. I will often wonder in my mind that it never come across these customer's mind if the ball driller is really good enough anot.<br><br>Technology in bowling nowadays is really amazing, with new balls like XXXcel, The One Hammer Hawk and so many others. now ball drilling is not just about drilling 3 holes in the ball. Why do you think you are paying $300 plus for a high end ball?? First of all the technology of the ball makes it good, the core, the coverstock etc. but many of you dun realise that in order for the ball to perform, your ball driller need to know how to map the ball correctly!!!! The fact is very clear, most ball drillers and pro shops in singapore are not up to the mark!! Alot of them are not even qualified ball drillers. This is partly due to the education level of these ball drillers. How do you expect a primary school educated person with lousy english to be able to understand terms like Radius of Gyration, Mass Bias, coeff of friction, differential, positive axis point and many many more?? and mind you, these terms are all related to good ball mapping.<br><br>I know some of you feel very passionate about your own ball driller, but i really dun see why ball drilling cannot be discussed openly. Unless you dun really care about what you are paying for. I see many people with 3 or 4 high end balls that are drilled all the same way, ie the pin and pap remains the same!!! that is really a waste of your money.<br><br>So i do advise new bowlers, dun go to a pro shop and buy a ball just because you think the ball is cheaper there or because the guy inside looks charismatic. Make sure the guy really know his knowledge about balls really well. Otherwise you are not getting your money worth. Ask him a few simple questions, like how the mass bias position affects ball reaction, how the balance hole position affects the tie line of your tracks, and frankly, if you already have an existing ball and he doesnt even ask to see the ball tracks of the ball, he definitely is not a good ball driller.</div>

And whether you like it anot, most pro shops are really not professional as they should be!! That is a very different scenario like the US where the pro shops are really very qualified in terms of ball knowledge and stuff, and not just behave like "durian sellers' as some pro shops in singapore do. Telling you this ball good, that ball good, but when you ask them "why good?" they come up with some stupid answers.<br><br>Unfortunately in singapore there is not much choice and bowlers are really at the mercy of these pro shops. I ever went to this famous pro shop at marina south to hunt for a pealised ball (wich is meant for lane heads break down), so when i went in, the guy inside apparently only knows 2 types of ball (shiny and bull) when the fact is there are so many kinds(particle, pearlised, reactive, polyester, particle-pearl...), and mind you, a pearlised ball can be dull!!! So i was looking at this particular ball and ask the guy about the core and stuff, and guess wat he reply? he say"wat you wan is just for the ball to hook less, so the core does not matter". After hearing this i really dunno whether i should luff or i shiould be furious!! i din say i din want the ball to hook, i say i wanted the ball to clear the dry heads, conserving energy and then snap in at the back end!! how unfortunate, and this is suppose to be one of the most popular pro shop in singapore!!</div>

But after many times of ball purchase and pro shop hopping, i get to know the real stuff about bowling. i just think it is unfortunate for bowlers wanabe to just go into the shop and be at the mercy of the ball driller, when some of these drillers are not pro at all. So actually we really need to push for higher standards for these drillers, it will not be very pleasant if the level of expertise remains this low</div>

The next that u can consider is walter at superbowl marina. but he quite attitude sometimes, see people one.</div>

Do not tape the whole thumb!!! that is not recommended. it will reduce friction and hence prevent swelling.<br><br>the reason we should not open the hole too big is this, when the hole gets bigger, we tend to grip even tighter for fear of dropping the ball, it will cause further swelling and in no time u will have to enlarge your thumb hole again</div>
