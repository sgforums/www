Do not tape the whole thumb!!! that is not recommended. it will reduce friction and hence prevent swelling.<br><br>the reason we should not open the hole too big is this, when the hole gets bigger, we tend to grip even tighter for fear of dropping the ball, it will cause further swelling and in no time u will have to enlarge your thumb hole again</div></blockquote>when the hole is too big, thats where the insert tape comes in..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ..<br><br>its actually up to individuals.. some people like it just nice, some people like the hole to be big to have a cleaner release..<br><br>if one feels he/she is dropping the ball, use tape.. when the thumb enlarged, take away the tape.. its the best.. rather than making the hole just nice, and after 5-6 games, the thumb expanded and thats it..<br><br>thats what happened to me, after 5 games, i cant play anymore cos the hole is just nice, my thumb expanded and tats it.. till i got the hole bigger, and i realised my release is much better.. when i find myself dropping the ball, i just use the tape.. it works for me..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

We always recommend the right technique, which is to force yourself not to grip the ball, even thou it takes alot of confidence and a proper thumb fit, not one that is loose. however the use of the insert tape is a good methid too. i just want to stress that opening the hole does not always solve the problem, and it is a irreversible action, so we should not recommend one to enlarge just because of thumb swelling</div>

Anyway coverstock is pretty thick, when you sand the ball, you are really justtaking very very little surface away. You may have heard alot of things from other forums, but that does not mean wat they say is correct, visit any bowling website like ebonite or brunswick, and they will always recommend that you may alter the surface to suit your needs, this fact is official, a fact from the very people that manufactures the ball. sanding will never shorten a ball's life. But anyway, a performance ball lifespan is only about 200 games. As we bowl more and more with the ball, the ball surface will keep changing, so you can either supervise the ball reaction, or simply just adapt to the changing ball reaction, which most leisure bowler's do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A bowling forum is a good idea. But its not easy to get a faithful, knowledgable and mature audience. That's the main reason why the group of us stick to these forums.<br><br>We migrated from SIM/UOL forums when the group graduated and set up this forum as the league team's forum. Here, we've mostly met one another in regular bowling tourneys/gatherings and we know that most advice or opinions expressed here are of certain value.<br><br>When you set up a forum, drop a thread here. I can't speak for the rest, but i'll do my best to support you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
