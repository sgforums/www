            <div class='col-md body'>hi! welcome to the bowling family!<br>well, personally, i think for newbies, the most essential aspect is to build a firm foundation to the fundamentals of bowling, thus i suggest to focus on getting someone good to guide u in ur bowling, and then proceed to getting the equipment. Some brothers here, eg, Kevin Ng and Daryl Quek are the better ones that u can get ur advise from, esp regarding basics and fundamentals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
