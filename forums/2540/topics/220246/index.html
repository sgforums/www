            <div class='col-md body'>Reuters - Fernando Torres will join Manchester United for Â£22m.<br>Atletico madrid have given up trying to keep Spain's hottest prospect; nicknamed 'El Nino'. The deal will cost Manchester United Â£22 million. Torres is also wanted by defending English champions Chelsea.<br><br>Atletico had already splashed Â£15m on another hot prospect; this time it is Sergio Aguero hailing from Argentina. With huge mounting debts; they would need the money; also to bring in a few players.<br><br>Manchester United may well then try their luck and move for Aldo Duscher again as a defensive midfielder. Former transfer target Mahamadou Diarra had already moved to Real Madrid from Lyon for Â£25m and Gattuso was flinging in and out of the crease between United and AC Milan.<br><br>Manchster United are confident they can land their top target Owen Hargreaves for Â£20m. They see him as an ideal replacement for Roy Keane. Currently nursing an injury, Bayern would be hard-pressed to let him go.<br><br>United will also reinstate their interest in a late-bloomer in the form of Argentine playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme for Â£10 million.<br><br>Another fleet-footed wing-wonder slated to join United for Â£5m would be Sporting Lisbon's Nani. Fergie probably thought Nani would complement Ronaldo on the opposite flank.<br><br>Fergie may once again also set his eye on both Argentine misfits currently languishing in West Ham - Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez. The duo are rumoured to move to a big club during the January transfer window.<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is currently in the hunt for Stewart Downing or Joe Cole, as he sees either of them the ideal heir to Welsh wizard Ryan Giggs. Boro may be tempted to sell Downing; but would see United shell out at least Â£10m for their prized prospect who came through the ranks. Chelsea would reject any United approach for Joe Cole, but only if they had Rooney in exchange. Chelsea boss Mourinho had once stated that the only missing jigsaw they had missed out on was Rooney.<br><br>With a Â£10m profit from John Obi Mikel's deal-compensation, Carrick bought for Â£14m and Tomas Kusczak in for a Â£2m loan deal  Ferguson may be tempted to breach the Â£50million mark on his summer transfer spending.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Fergie should go for Tomas Sivok from Sparta Prague and Vincent Kompany from Anderlect. Tomas Sivok is tall and well-built, tackles well, has great determination and positioning, creates goals, has composure and pases well. He's the best replacement for Keane. Fergie could use Kompany as a right-back, since Vidic and Ferdinand had already form a solid parntership in central defence. We need more depth, and Torres should be brought in. This would see Smith leaving on loan to other clubs on a short-term basis.</span></div>
