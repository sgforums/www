Foreign intel agents analysing every topic on this forum would be interesting but not very likely since they can get every information about S'pore's armed forces through Jane's intel, Satelite imaging, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Besides if they need to go through forums like this to get info then they are very lamme.  However, that does not mean your concern is wronged.  Because you should be worried about the likes of Al Queda, Hamas, etc going through this forum for their intel.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There was another thread from a different host in which they had pictures of female soldiers &amp; officers being posted on it.  I highlighted in my post that they had placed on the unknowing female soldiers a great risk to their personal well being.  I got a very immature reply that said that they did not mentioned what MOS these female soldiers were, so it should be safe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Oh! I also got the info that Nee Soon camp has a secret unit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Imagine what terrorist groups might do with this info?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, there definitely are foreign intelligence operatives in Singapore. ISD has caught many of them over the years, and there are certainly plenty more left uncaught. Singapore is also definitely the target of foreign intelligence operations, by both "enemies" and "friends". It is just the way things are done -- everyone spies on everyone.<br><br>You will be pretty shocked at some of the cases ISD has dealt with over the years. SAF officers getting blackmailed. Bugs detected in sensitive installations. All kinds of nonsense. The threat is real.<br><br>Therefore, please keep confidential information confidential. There really is someone listening.</div>
