Â“We are happy to see a new generation of Fighting Falcons now flying for this longtime customer.Â”<br><br>SingaporeÂ’s purchase program includes aircraft, support equipment, spare parts, training, mission equipment and other associated items. The aircraft have components manufactured by Lockheed Martin, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Northrop Grumman and other U.S. suppliers.<br><br>This program is the fourth buy of the F-16 for the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Singapore received its first F-16 under the original Peace Carvin program signed in 1988. Subsequent orders were made in 1994, 1997 and this in 2000.<br><br>The F-16 is the choice of 24 countries....(rest of article snipped)<br></div>

Interesting to see that the Wide Angle HUD on Block 40/42 is being adopted in the advanced version... I thought the Advanced Block 50 has a new HUD altogether. See the following pic:<br><br><img src="http://www.defense-update.com/images/f-16-60-cockpit-large.jpg"><br><br>Extract from:<br><a href="http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/feature-advanced-f-16.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/feature-advanced-f-16.htm</a><br>Cockpit Configurations<br>The standard configuration of an Advanced Block 50/52 cockpit features helmet-mounted cueing system, which allows the pilot to direct sensors or weapons to his line of sight or to help him find a designated target. Head-Up Display and several color multifunction displays and advanced recording and data-transfer equipment is used to reduce pilot workload in every phase of the mission. The cockpit is compatible with night vision goggles. A common configuration includes multi-channel VHF/UHF/HF/Data communications, satellite communication and tactical data link systems (such as the NATO-standard Link 16), in addition. Link 16 provides secure, jam-resistant, high-volume data exchange on a multi-node network. Also standard is the combined friend from foe interrogator/ transponder, which permits autonomous identification to maximize launch ranges of radar-guided air-to-air missiles at distances beyond visual range (BVR).<br><br>BTW, here are a couple of Blk 52+ from Hellenic AF and Israeli F-16I for comparison:<br><br>IAF F-16I<br><img src="http://www.defense-update.com/images/F-16I-2.jpg"><br><br>Hellenic AF<br><img src="http://homepage.tinet.ie/~steven/images/f16pr000310.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.defense-update.com/images/Hellenic-F-16-B52.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.codeonemagazine.com/preview/images/Adv_F16_23_08960a.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.hrvatski-vojnik.hr/hrvatski-vojnik/922003/bpictures/f16block52_greece.jpg"><br><br>It seems that the Greek version of the Blk52+ has the parabrake.<br><br>Furthermore, it has been reported that 10 countries actually bought the advanced 52 version. I can't name all 10. Which are they except Greece, Israel, Singapore, and Chile?<br></div>

I've asked a couple of friends with LM about it, and see what they say.<br></blockquote>I've got the feeling its the Block40/42 HUD as well when I zoomed in the pic. I can't understand why revert back to this HUD whereas the previous Block 52 all have the typical Block 50 HUDs.  An explaination by someone who knows the reason will be most welcome.<br><br><blockquote><br>As for the HMS, would it make sense to get another new type?<br></blockquote>Simple. The DASH-3 HMS used in the Vipers today are only displaying HUD symbology such as targeting cues and aircraft performance parameters. However, JHMCS not only display this, but it can also display IR raster images captured by the targeting pods.<br><br>JHMCS:<br><img src="http://www.defense-update.com/images/jhmcs1.jpg"><br><br>DASH-3:<br><img src="http://www.defense-update.com/images/dash1.jpg"><br><br>I would presume DASH-4 would be as advanced as JHMCS if not even better given it is the same generation as JHMCS. So naturally, when it comes to selecting a new HMS, I would tend to think that it is only logical to choose between the DASH-4 and JHMCS.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Joe Black, redesigning the spine w/o the parabrake housing doesn't involve simply cutting off the parabrake housing. If you've seen the VISTA/F-16I with the the SRS (there exists a pic of an RSAF D with it as well), you'll know how a big-spine aircraft without the parabrake housing looks like. The rear end is quite different from the Suefa and the new RSAF F-16D that has emerged. The required redesign, requalification and retesting the tail of the original F-16 with the spine. And that costs $. And its at least a 6-figure sum. In US$....<br><br>Hornet145, from what I've seen, that logo looks exactly like the the 145 Sqn logos I've seen painted on the Skyhawks, from the white/yellow/black hi-vis days to the one that appeared on A-4SU 941 back in the 98 Open House.</div>
