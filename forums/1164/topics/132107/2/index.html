            <div class='col-md body'>Well, every country that has nukes is currently friendly toward us. The same is not true of our neighbors.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Anyway, don't think that you have to love NS and everything about it. Most Singaporeans don't realize it, but most American soldiers hate serving in their army. Same with the British, Australians, etc. Their armies are also full of screw-ups, unfairness and stupidity, and their soldiers complain about them all the time. This cursing and swearing is perfectly natural. So if you find that your service is full of shit, don't worry, every army is like that.<br><br>The difference between them and us is that they believe in what they do. They might be swearing about how their useless 2LT just screwed them over while kissing his commander's butt, or how their PS is a sadist, or how their high command is full of politicians and scholars who don't understand the troops, or how they have to paint all the stones in camp white to make it look nicer for the visiting general (common in US Army). But even while swearing, they understand that what they do is important and meaningful, and take the difficulties in their stride.<br><br>As long as you continue to understand that NS is meaningful, that Singapore must be for Singaporeans and defended by Singaporeans, everything will be alright. You can and should still sit down and bitch with your comrades -- it is your ancient right as a soldier. It is how the army works, and how the army improves.<br><br>Everything in life is difficult, but that's OK as long as you choose to make it meaningful for yourself. Raising a child is extremely tough, unfair and frustrating, but most parents would not trade it for the world. Every career is hard in some way, but there are happy people in every career. Once you understand that your choices shape your life, rather than the other way around, you will truly grow up. And NS will help you understand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore has the densest air defence network on earth. Our pilots regularly top their cohorts at the US Top Gun academy, so we are protected by some of the best pilots in the world. It will be exceedingly hard for anyone to bomb us. We were also the first country to put long-ranged heavy artillery (52-cal 155mm) into service, and we maintain superiority in artillery systems, making artillery bombardment of Singapore suicidal. The only problem is the Malaysian MLRS system, which we have no publicly announced counter to.<br><br>In any case, Singapore is one of the most bomb resistant locations on earth. The building codes here ensure that most buildings are very sturdy, built out of reinforced concrete with shelter zones within them. Buildings designed by the gov't, such as HDB flats, are also specifically designed for defensibility in urban combat and very hard to reduce by fire. In fact, DSTA tests buildings for their resistance to bombs. Even if we were to suffer bombardment, up to a limited tactical nuclear attack, casualities and damage will be kept low and retaliation will remain possible.</div>
