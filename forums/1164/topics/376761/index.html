But yet, they seemed to have forgotten about their limitations. With this in mind, jopefully there are some tweaks to this. Apparently, they have a good variety form jelly, drink to bars.<br><br>Then again, staying awake and staying alert are two different things.

              <p>If the parents of the noisy pussy are mere pussies as well - do they deserve any "fxxking" human rights ?</p>

              <p>Was the noisy pussy working for the Japanese as LKY worked as an interpreter, and the Ar-Neh Prez worked as a local police for the Japanese Kempetai to deny other Singaporeans of the "fxxking" human rights ?</p>
              <p>No wonder they make such a great pair, with the intepreter taking a modest $3 million in annual wages, and giving the Kempetai slightly more to keep him happy in office.</p>

applications. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; It said two of them, Mr Ooi Boon Ewe, a former tutor, and Mr <br>&gt; Ramachandran <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Govindasamy Naidu, a retired senior store keeper, were rejected due to <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; their lack of qualifications. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "The career <span id="tfTextLink7481358051487572" class="tfTextLink" style="border-bottom: #003366 1px solid; padding-bottom: 1px;

&gt; Presidency," said the statement. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; As for Mr Andrew Kuan, the former Group Chief Financial Officer of <br>JTC, <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; the committee argued that "the seniority and responsibility of that <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; position was not comparable to those needed for the office either". <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Singaporeans by and large were shocked at the announcement and <br>newspaper <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; offices were flooded with calls from irate readers calling on the <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; government to explain the rationale for rejecting Mr Kuan's <br>application. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, online newsgroups and blogs saw tons of angry postings <br>&gt; calling <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the government to allow Mr Kuan to stand for the election. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; A posting on the soc.culture.singapore newsgroup said: "it's pretty <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; obvious the MW ("men in white", here referring to the <span id="tfTextLink6272993926758752" class="tfTextLink" style="border-bottom: #003366 1px solid;

&gt; &gt; government) is NOT READY for the TEST". <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; As the public outcry triggered by a huge scandal at the <br>&gt; government-backed <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; NKF (National Kidney Foundation) is still fresh on many people's <br>minds, <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; the reader said the government was afraid that Mr Nathan could be <br>&gt; defeated <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; at the polls. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking to reporters, the organisers of the protest rally said they <br>&gt; hoped <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Singaporeans would turn out in force to pressure the government to <br>&gt; review <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; their decision to reject Mr Kuan's bid. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "The PAP government obviously owes the people of Singapore an <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; explanation," said the spokesman, who refused to be named. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile, an online petition calling on Singaporeans to support Mr <br>&gt; Andrew <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Kuan for the presidency (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.petitiononline.com/sg050817/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.petitiononline.com/sg050817/</span></span></a>) has <br>&gt; been <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering steam since it was launched by a mass organisation calling <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; itself The Singapore Patriotic Front (SPF) here on Sunday. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The SPF said Mr Kuan's "distinguished record in public service, strong <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; professional financial training and experience" would allow him to do <br>&gt; well <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; as a "People's President", provide "a watchful eye over the <br>Singapore's <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; national assets and foreign reserves", as well as push for "greater <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; transparency and accountability in the Government-Linked Companies". <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The petition also slammed the incumbent, Mr Nathan, for failing to <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; discharge the responsibilities of his office "despite having received <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; close to $10 million in salary over the last five years". <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; It added: "this could be attributed to his lack of financial training <br>&gt; and <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; his being appointed by the Singapore Government instead of being <br>elected <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; by the Singapore citizens". <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Expressing shock at the government's rejection of Mr Kuan's bid, the <br>SPF <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; argued that "if the incumbent, despite his poor performance and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>his <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alleged connections with the Japanese Kempeitai</span> during World War II,</strong></span> <br>is <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; allowed to run for the Presidential Election, there is no reason for a <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; more qualified candidate like Mr Kuan to be denied the 'Certificate of <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Eligibility'". <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "Unless the Singapore Government is trying to manipulate the outcome <br>of <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; the election to suit its nepotic &amp; despotic needs," it added. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; The SPF also took the state-controlled media to task for launching a <br>&gt; smear <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; campaign against Mr Kuan. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; "We demand that the Singapore Government stop treating Singaporeans as <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; fools and manipulating the media to cast the incumbent in the best of <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; light while conducting smear campaigns against all those who are <br>running <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; against the incumbent. This is childish &amp; unconstitutional," said the <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; SPF. <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mr Nathan's office could not be reached for comment Sunday. - APS <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Copyright: Asia Press Service <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; URL: www.asiapress.com <br>&gt; &gt; &gt; email: editor@xxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
