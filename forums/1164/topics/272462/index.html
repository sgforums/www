            <div class='col-md body'>I was wondering about these questions regarding the usage of half-tracks during WW2.<br>According to wikipedia, a half-track is a vehicle with the cross-country capabilities of a tank and the handling of a wheeled vehicle.<br>I was thinking since WW2, tanks have been aroung for so many years and they are full tracked vehicles, so why did the military designers of the yester-years not make a APC with full-tracks instead? Secondly, why all half-tracks do not have armour protection at the top? Most half-tracks are exposed at the top with only a canvas sheet to shield the passenger from the sun. I know some may argue the exposed top allows rapid returning of fire, but during FIBUA or air-burst rds fired upon them, aren't they afraid that the crew might get killed or wounded? Lastly, the British used Bren carriers during the WW2 which is a full tracked vehicle, so what motivates the British in doing so, instead of following the other to produce half-tacks?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The question about half-tracks that still bugs me terribly is this:<br><br>On a tank, the tracks have to move a different speed for the vehicle to turn. Example left track slow down to turn right. Something called "differential".<br><br>So how does the steering on a half-track work? Is it a normal steering wheel?<br><br>If you turn the steering wheel to turn the vehicle, the front wheels direction will change. Fine so far. But is there a track differential taking place as you turn?<br><br>And then there is the Kettenkraftrad... Coolest piece of kit in WW2 - but ...<br><br>"The wisdom behind attaching a motorcycle front fork to a tracked vehicle escapes me, and according to some sources I spotted on the web, it used a Cletrac braked differential for steering, not the front fork, and apparently, the manual recommended not using the front fork on certain terrain. Regardless, it looks awfully cool."<br><br><img src="http://www.dad.incomingwormhole.com/KETT/mc%20Muddin'%20%20Kettenkrad.JPG"></div>

Because they were to be used as transports much like our new 5-tonner with armoured sides but no armoured top.<br><br>Also it was easier to mount motars,AA or even an AT gun on top if there wasnt a roof.</div>
