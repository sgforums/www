              <p>By Adrian Blomfield in Gori <br>Last Updated: 7:55PM BST 08 Aug 2008<br><br>A roar filled the air. Suddenly, from the horizon, two Russian war jets homed into view, their wingtips tilted towards the scrubland of northern Georgia as they screamed through the skies.<br><br>"Take cover, it's another wave," the Georgian commander shouted.<br><br>His men, a company of soldiers deployed on a lonely stretch of road close to Tskhinvali, the rebel capital of Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia, flung themselves to the ground and rolled into the thick thorn bushes that stretched towards the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains.<br><br>Anti-aircraft guns opened fire in staccato bursts before the ground started to rumble as the jets discharged their payloads. From both sides of the road, the soldiers began to fire their Kalashnikovs, a futile and desperate gesture against the might of the Russian Air Force.<br><br>"Russians!" yelled a young soldier, his grimy face streaked with sweat, as he jabbed a finger towards the retreating jets. "Russians," he told me again, more softly this time, as though scarcely able to believe that his tiny country was effectively at war with its giant ex-Soviet neighbour.<br><br>Gradually, the firing began to stop. Soldiers, chests heaving with exertion and adrenaline, rolled onto their backs and began to smoke.</p>

              <p><strong>Russian forces battle Georgians</strong> </p>
              <p>Footage reportedly shows Russian tanks entering South Ossetia</p>
              <p>Russian forces are locked in fierce clashes with Georgia inside its breakaway South Ossetia region, reports say, amid fears of all-out war.</p>
              <p>Moscow sent armoured units across the border after Georgia moved against Russian-backed separatists.</p>
              <p>Russia says 12 of its soldiers are dead, and separatists estimate that 1,400 civilians have died.</p>
              <p>Georgia accuses Russia of waging war, and says it has suffered heavy losses in bombing raids, which Russia denies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili says he is willing to agree an immediate ceasefire<br>Russian tanks have reportedly reached the northern suburbs of the regional capital, Tskhinvali, and there were conflicting claims about who was in control of the city.</p>
              <p>"Now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the Georgian army in the southern region of Tskhinvali," a Russian military official was quoted as saying by Moscow-based news agency, Interfax.</p>
              <p>After days of exchanging heavy fire with the separatists, Georgian forces moved on Thursday night to regain control of the region, which has had de facto independence since a war against Georgia that ended in 1992.</p>
              <p>  <br> I saw bodies lying on the streets, around ruined buildings, in cars. It's impossible to count them now</p>

              <p><br>In pictures: Unrest in Georgia<br>Bitterness turns to conflict</p>
              <p>Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said Russia was at war with his country.</p>
              <p>He told the BBC: "Our troops are attacked by thousands of troops coming in from Russia."</p>
              <p>Mr Saakashvili said Georgia had shot down several Russian planes and accused Moscow of bombing Georgian air bases and towns, resulting in the death of 30 military personnel and civilians.</p>
              <p>Late on Friday, the Georgian national security council said Mr Saakashvili was poised to declare a state of emergency.</p>
              <p>Despite denials from Moscow, the Russian air force has been carrying out air raids in South Ossetia and Georgia itself, says the BBC's Richard Galpin, in Gori, eastern Georgia. </p>

              <p>For the second time in less than 24 hours, the U.N. Security Council has been unable to agree on a course of action to stop the escalating violence in Georgia's breakaway region of South Ossetia. From United Nation's headquarters in New York, VOA's Margaret Besheer has more.<br><br><br>UN Security Council <br>In an open meeting, there was consensus among the 15-members that there should be a cessation of hostilities, but when it came to crafting a statement on the subject there was difficulty in finding agreement on the right words. <br><br>Belguim's Ambassador Jan Grauls, who is council president this month, told reporters that some members need more time. "This negotiation is an on-going process -- it has not come to a halt tonight. And will be resumed tomorrow in the course of the morning," he said.<br><br>Some diplomats also cited the fluid situation on the ground. During the meeting, Georgia's Ambassador Irakli Alasania told the council that he had just received word that Russian bombers were attacking more targets in Georgia and another breakaway republic, Abkhazia. "Right now, as we speak, Russian bombers are bombing the Poti port, which is the western port of Georgia. As well as Senaki airfield, which was bombed numerous times today. And of course -- it was quite anticipated from my side -- that we should have some kind of provocation in Abkhazia as well. We are seeing the bombing of Kodori region of Upper Abkhazi," he said.</p>
