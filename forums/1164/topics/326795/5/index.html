                                Humbug. The reason why the Scandinavians don't like Russia too much, is partly Sweden and Russia were duking out for a good part of the Medieval ages. Excuses include crusades to convert the heathen Russians who practice Orthodox Catholicism etc. The Germans under the Teutonic knights launched multiple invasions into Russia as well. A good part of the Cold War includes anti-Russian propaganda which is still pretty much there. 
              
              Within the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire under the Tsars, there has always been secessionist movements. They were either squashed or controlled but they were let free during the collapse of the Soviet Union. Of course, once the genie is out of the bottle, it can't go back. Not everyone in those states like the way things are and are pro-Russian, which is why you have S. Ossetia. Even the Eastern regions of Ukraine are heavily pro-Russian and would very much like to go back to Russia. Doesn't help that many of them have families across the border.

              <p>Moscow moved Russians into those countries and altered the ethnic composition of their populations, and instead of encouraging the stateless people who haven't moved back to do so, it supports them when they stir shit there.</p>
              <p>Erasing culture? The Soviets suppressed the original cultures and supplanted them with their own. And all the Estonian government did in the events of spring last year was to move the Bronze Soldier and the remains underneath to a military graveyard.</p>
              <p>There is no concrete evidence that Shukhevych and the OUN collaborated with the Gestapo in the Massacre of Lviv, and in February this year declassified documents that contradicted the accusation were released.</p>

              <p>much media about this issue have been pro-georgian right?</p>
              <p>perhaps with the decimation of much of the georgian military equipment, georgia would be able to reorganise their supplies or smth...</p>
              <p>the straits times commented that NATO countries are "weak and poorly armed" to what extent is that true? would NATO be able to react in any significant manner to retaliate against the russians? lets say if they start doing the same to the others too....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sorry for saying so much, its the common test period, so i hardly have time to post... just my 2 cents (though i still read everyday, thank gosh its chinese tml! = nth to study)</p>

              <p>Some of you guys got no sense of history.  This whole S.Ossetia episode is nothing but a re-run of the Sudetenland Crisis in 1938.</p>
              <p>Appeasement policies by good ol' chap Chamberlain marched the world right into World War 2.  Russia is in exactly the same position Nazi Germany was back then.  Strong, but unsure.  It was only after the world collapsed and gave in and handed over Sudetenland, that She decided that that action was sufficient indication of Her strength and ability to intimidate the rest of the free world.  That led to the total annexation of Czechoslovakia.</p>
              <p><br>Yes, sure, lets just GIVE South Ossetia to Russia.  Might as well start digging graves for ourselves and get ready to jump in. Cos when the sh!t hits the fan, we're probably not gonna have time to even put on a radiation suit.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 6pt; margin-right: 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Most of the formal soviet states are coming to terms between modern statehood vs ethnic ties which tag along historical conflict so these states are essentially conflict zone. Georgia has seem its fare share of conflict and coup. It may not be a bad reason to instill statehood by including them into Nato. and let EU nations provide social and govmental restructuring to morden statehood. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>But i think this is just a temporary cease fire i believe this war could spread further into other states.</p>
