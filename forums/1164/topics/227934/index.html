            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I saw a video on the web showcasing the CV90. In the video, the vehicle is armed with a Bofors 40mm L70 gun. The same gun that is used in many AA platforms. Carry a crew of 3 plus 8 riflemen.<br><br>The 40mm gun looked awesome! and if an increaase of 25mm to 30mm of the BX2 resulted in a 50% increase in firepower, think of the firepower of a 40mm gun.<br><br>How many variants of CV90 is there? because i seemed to read somewhre on the web that it is armed with a 25mm gun. Is there a version armed with maybe a 105mm Low-recoil gun?<br><br>Also on the web, there new Korean IFV is supposedly armed with a 40mm gun also and can carry 12 men! i presume including the crew of 3 still can carry 9 men.<br><br>There seems to be a trend for bigger caliber for IFVs?? am i right?? instead of 25mm. now going for 30mm or even 40mm.<br><br>for the BX2, is the turret completely redesigned to accomodate the 30mm gun? or is basically the same turret but put a bigger gun.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THis have been discussed in the tank thread.<br><br>there are various versions of the sweddish IFV.<br><br>* CV9040 - The original model with a 40mm Bofors autocannon<br>* CV9030 - Export version with a 30 mm Bushmaster II autocannon. (Adopted by Norway, Switzerland and Finland)<br>* CV9035 - Armed with a Bushmaster III 35/50 cannon. (Adopted by the Netherlands and Denmark)<br>* CV90105 - 105 mm smoothbore tank turret/gun.<br>* CV90120-T - Has a tank turret armed with a smoothbore 120 mm gun.<br>* CV9040 AAV - Anti-Air Vehicle, fitted with radar and 40 mm AA gun.<br>* CV90 Forward Command Vehicle<br>* CV90 Forward Observation Vehicle<br>* CV90 Armored Recovery Vehicle<br>* CV9040C Made for UN peace keeping forces with add on armour.<br>* CV9056 Trial version equipped with the Bofors RB56 anti-tank missile. Not able to carry any infantry. Project cancelled.<br><br>Since we share info on the subs, there is no telling if we can get info on the leopards and maybe IFV to fit the gun onto the BX..<br><br><img src="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/cv90/images/cv90120tank_10.jpg"><br>CV90120-T - Has a tank turret armed with a smoothbore 120 mm gun<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>CV90105 - 105 mm smoothbore tank turret/gun.<br><br>Hopefully, our new light tank will be similar to this version of CV90.<br><br>Assuming that our new light tank is based on an exisisting IFV hull(most probably BX), is it still necessary to retain its troop carrying capability like in the variants of CV90? After all our light tank is to support the AI troopers in their Ultras and BXs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>A pic<br><a href="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/cv90/cv905.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.army-technology.com/projects/cv90/cv905.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I'm surprised to learn that the 105mm gun is giving problems to the BX chassis.<br><br>I don't think it's economical(not a smart way to go) to re-design or heavily modify existing BX design just to accomodate a particular gun.<br><br>Why must it be 105mm? There are some low recoil designs available(IMI has one). I wonder if these too are giving trouble?<br><br>Is it for Lahat? Practical to see engagement up to 4km here abouts?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think  105 mm  is  the optimum calibre because it is still in widespread use and is  / was a NATO standard,. That means there are a  lot of rounds ( with very wide range of  specialized &amp; versatile ammo  )  out there available. Also, the latest ( although developed many years back ) 105 mm APFSDS rounds are still very potent against MBTs.<br><br>If our future LTs are primarily for fire support, recon etc 105 will be ideal as it delivers a lot of firepower for these roles and also retains an anti MBT capability. Also there is some development of new 105 ammo types ( eg those developed by Israel recently )  which expands the capability of the 105 further.<br><br>Putting a full capability 105 on a small &amp; light Bionix chassis will be tough.  Probably need to change &amp; strengthen  the chassis design somewhat  to accomodate a 105.   No point stressing the existing design if it means stretching design limits - remember the Sheridian LT with the 155 gun ?<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I think the APFSDS from a low recoil 105mm is overrated. Can it really kill a full MBT? Not without a HEAT round since the low recoil gun has a lower muzzle velocity.  An APFSDS may not even kill light armored vehicle in such a case. Penetrate, in and out yes, but may not kill unless it knocks out something vital.<br><br>So why kill ourselves to try n squeeze a long and potentially cumbersome 105mm on the BX or BX2?  If the chassis is not meant for a LT role, then ST should just leave it as it is and redesign a new chassis for that.<br><br>The new rapid fire 30mm with HE rounds is more than adequate to take care of urban and jungle threats.  We don't need 105mms for that.  Soon, we'll have 120mms to take care of heavily armored targets, and fortifications.  Don't forget, there are still Hellfires from the Longbows and the big ol demolition guns from our CEVs.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will say again.<br><br>The sweddish used to develop a number of light tanks for themselves to fight in the forest.<br><br>Hoever, in recent times it looks like they have shifted to focus on a 1 MBT which is the leopard 2A4/5/6. Backing the leopards are the CV90 IFVs.<br><br>So, is a LT needed? Or we would end up like the sweddish?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If 105mm is needed, why not go for Marder/TAM or M8(though I don't think it's cheap). Both will definitely take less time to IOC than building one over.
