            <div class='col-md body'>My personal experience at tekong...........<br><br>Way back in '94, battlion was preparing for exercise in Brunei (1st armour unit to go infantry exercise in Brunei). Pack of the training package was 2 days 1 night training at Tekong.<br><br>1st day, day topo exercise.<br><br>Me and 3 of my men formed a team and went off searching for check points. things were going pretty well as we were able to locate the check points. Somewhere along the way, we decided to bash through the vegetation to reach a check point.<br><br>We bashed and bashed until we came to a small little knoll. On top of this knoll while we were walking, I noticed stuffs like bowls, tea cups, urns littered all over the ground partly covered by vegetation.<br><br>Men were commenting how come all this barang barang were here..... told them not to disturbed them and just moved on..... suddenly we heard crashing noise to our right and through the corner of my eyes, I saw a shadow darting into the vegetation... from the outline of the shadow, it looks like a wild boar.<br><br>But the size of the boar seems to be out of proportion. I stand at 1.7m tall and the wildboar seems to be almost as tall as me. Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me from the fatigue. (from carrying the stupid PRC77 set).<br><br>Nevertheless, we quickly make haste of our stay there and moved off to search for our checkpoint. Along the way, we heard crashing sound along the way. Even though we shout out, no one replied.<br><br>After some difficulties, we managed to bashed out of the vegetation and found out checkpoints and concluded the exercise.<br><br>Spend our night at the old primary school but did not sleep well as was very feeling feverish.....next day, went on with our company ex...and by evening time, was on the way back on the RPL.....<br><br>Next day at camp, no able to get out of bed and need help from fellow sgts to get up. Went to report sick and temperature measured 40 degree C!!!!<br><br>Spend whole day in the medical centre sleeping and bathing. Fever finally subside next day.......<br><br>Fever due to the exhaustion? or something else........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  You decide.</div>

For my BMT, things were mostly peaceful. The only thing i've experienced during my BMT happened in the bunk. We had one spot in the bunk suddenly smelling strongly of vomit. very weird as we tried our hardest to locate the origin of the smell. then it started to spread. soon the whole bunk smelt of vomit. stank like hell. we emptied a whole can of air freshener in futility. 10 min later, the smell slowly shrank back to the spot it started from, then disappeared.<br><br>after BMT i was a Lobo at the old Sch of Signals(now known as Signals Institute). Once brought a recruit to the sports store in the hall to get a table from the storeman who happened to be a BMT coymate of mine. he wasn't around so i hung out with the rec in the store, reasoning that since we could bum around, why not? The hall was all shuttled up that day, since it wasn't in use. u have to access the store from inside the hall, so its right to say the store is an enclosed room within an enclosed place. so there we are, chatting away, me next to the double doors of the store, the rec standing oppo, when he shifts his stare to the door. i turn to see what hes looking at... the double doors were opening very slowly and steadily. then it stops. then, it starts closing slowly and steadily. but right before it closes completely, it suddenly closes with an increased force. shuts with a bang. boy, i grabbed the rec and got the hell outta there.</div></blockquote>Which year at SOS?

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, one more during my GNCC back in 92 on P.Tekong.<br><br>It was during our topo ex. my sect was heading back to the end pt for the nite. Ha all just pass out from SAFINCOs/SISPECs so all still green. Our last check pt b4 end pt was at the west side of the reservoir dam, from there we start to move back to end pt. For GNCC topo ex we not oni have to find the check pt within time given at the same time not to get caught by the instructors as well.<br><br>After check with HQ, we move on. All been there know that the area is pitch-dark even when full moon nite because of the canopy. We move into the vegetation, b4 long all stop because of the thick vegetation slow down our movement. All agree that we will take the risk of walking on the track as time is running out for our team.<br><br>All on track, we start moving. Just b4 we hit the tar track 600m ahead, there used to have a small shrine or temple or just a small hut for the Dau Pei Gong, I think it was and oso a well with a diameter around 2 to 2.5m. The guy from behind start to say;" Hey guys, did your smell something nice, it really smell nice, common let check it out 1st." Shit, I tell myself. B4 he mention it I had smell it way b4 him and the smell had follow us for abt 30min or so.<br><br>No one bother with him but he keep on saying it and one other mate tell him to shut up and move on. He not very happy with it. Btw he is the oni christian in the section. Back to the end pt after report and so on. All of us sit together and tell him what was the smell all abt.<br><br>This has got him freak out ok. The thing is, I am not the oni one smell it, the rest of the section oso smell it and one of the guy say the smell had follow us ever since we hit the track.<br><br>The smell thing is one of the malay supernatural unexplainable thing that I never want to find out at all. It was say that anyone who follow it to the source will not come back as the SAME or never come back at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is my true strange encounter in 1987 during my NS time. I was posted to 21SA based in Kranji camp and belong to HQ company. The battalion quarters is a 5 story building. The first floor is the administration offices while each company occupied the rest of the floor. The HQ company occupied the top floor.<br><br>One day during lunch time, out of boredom, we decided to play the Â‘saucer spiritÂ’, or die xian, that I bought few days ago. Three of us decided to play; my buddy (a Chinese), myself and one Indian while the other just watched. While I had played this when I was in my primary school days, it was the first time for the Indian. He wanted to try the game purely out of curiosity.<br><br>So we spread out the paper that comes alone in the game set and placed the saucer upside down in the centre of the paper. Then we lightly placed our middle finger on the saucer and started chanting as per the instruction stated. After few minutes, the saucer started moving in circular motion. Slowly at first and then gradually increase in speed. Being first time playing this game, ,my Indian friend was naturally amused but he played along anyway. We asked a few questions and got our answer (canÂ’t remember what we asked or the answer).<br><br>Half way through the game, my Indian friend suddenly lifted his finger from the saucer and flip the saucer. He said that he does not believe in the game and that it was us that pushed the saucer around. We didnÂ’t take the incident seriously as well. To us,  it was also just a game after all. We even joked to him that now that the spirit is not able to return to where it came from, it may decide to come and look for him that night. None of us were prepared for what is going to happen that night.<br><br>After completed our training that day,  we had our usual night off that night. All of us booked in before midnight and by midnight all of us were asleep. Then, the strange thing happen. I couldnÂ’t remember exactly what time but think it was close to 3 am in the morning. I was awoke by some noise. It sounded like someone was walking along the corridor outside our bunk and dragging his/her slipper very slowly.<br><br>Our bunk was located on the top floor situated in a corner. There is another bunk just opposite the corridor but it was empty. Furthermore I am sure no one in the right mind would stay awake and take a stroll in the middle of the night like that. I could say why but some how the foot step does not sound normal at all.<br><br>After remembering what my Indian friend did in the afternoon, somehow I had eerie feeling that the food step is not that of a human. I had always boasted that I do not believe in spirit or ghost, but somehow at that moment, I lost my courage to get out from my bed for investigation. I simply laid still in my bed and trying not to make any sound or movement. For that few frightful minutes, I listened fearfully to the foot step as it drag fore and back along the corridor.<br><br>Then out of the sudden, one of my army friend got up and walked to the switched to turned on the lights for the whole bunk. After doing that courageous move, he then quickly returned to his bed. Only then, I knew that I am not the only one who had heard the foot step. The foot step did not disappear but I somehow I am slightly eased with the lights on. Eventually, I was overwhelm with exhaustion and feel asleep.<br><br>The next morning, we realized that most of us heard the dragging foot step along the corridor but everyone was too frightened to go out and investigate. We did find a plastic bag along the corridor. None of us believe it was the cause as the pace of the dragging foot step was consistent and continuous. Luckily, that was the only night that freaked us out.<br><br>Till this day, I have no idea what actually happened that night or what had over come with fright that night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a young teenager and this must've been 1978 and me and some friends liked to go camping in Tekong. This was before the military took over the entire island.<br><br>At the nothern tip of Tekong there is a fantastic strip of beach called Kampong Bahru, I think.<br><br>At low tide you could walk at least 1km out on what used to be water - beautiful.<br><br>That time, we decided to sleep in a broken down house that was halfway up a hill and facing the sea.<br><br>This house was quite big. The first room facing the sea is the living room and all that's left are the walls. The windows and doors long gone.<br><br>So as you enter through the front door there are walls on the left and right at the far end of the rooms are doorways that lead into the back of the house consisting of back rooms and the kitchen.<br><br>None of us dare venture behind even in bright day light. Not even on a dare. The back part of the house is constantly dark and looked and smelt evil.<br><br>At night, we all slept on the ground in a row with our heads against the left wall.<br><br>Halfway through the night, I woke up and heard a lot of voices just outside the house and shuffling of feet.<br><br>We left the pressure lamp on. So I sat up and looked around. Nothing.<br><br>But I still hear all the indistinct voices. It sounded just like a bunch of youngsters like ourselves on a social outting.<br><br>Eventually, to my great surprise footstep stounds of someone wearing flip flops walked into the house entering from the front door. I followed the sound with my eyes but could see nothing. The footsteps walked past our row of sleeping feet and went into the kitchen.<br><br>For some reason I wasn't that scared, looking around at my peacefully sleeping friends. But no - I didn't have the balls to follow the footsteps to the back to check things out.<br><br>I went back to sleep.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In 1984 I was an OCS instructor at the old Safti Pasir Laba camp.<br><br>One platoon from I believe Bravo coy was in-the-field conducting a junior term cadet navigation test, a pre-requisite to Ex. Lancer. In this test cadets move from checkpoint to checkpoint using map, compass, one or none, given bearing and distance, then perform certain tests at each station before navigating to the next station. Timing between checkpoints was also recorded, so cadets basically ran. Cadets perform this test independently. In those days the test area was in LCK area. It was normal for cadets to be running around passing each other along the entire exercise/test area which was probably 3 sq km in size.<br><br>At the end of the day which was around 1830 hrs all cadets formed up at main station and head count was conducted. One man short. Missing man's last known checkpoint ascertained, and several cadets noted they had last seen missing man running off in a certain direction. This direction was counter to the correct direction to the man's required checkpoint.<br><br>Since it was dark and platoon had been in the field all day, the platoon returned to camp for dinner while instructors used their land rovers to search for missing man.<br><br>Around 2100 hrs some of the instructors returned to camp saying they combed the area and the direction missing man last seen headed with no sight of him. They reported the missing man to HQ. HQ turned out all available instructors, requisitioned all available vehicles and everyone returned to the training area to look again for the missing cadet. By day break he was still MIA and everyone was getting somewhat concerned. Some villagers in the LCK area were said to be reporting seeing a soldier running around their properties but running away when approached.<br><br>CO cancelled all training for those coys in camp and the entire OCS conducted a massive search through the area, including all reservoirs, roads, farms, reservoirs, etc. By late in afternoon, Mindef requisitioned choppers and turned out an ops SIR unit to join in the search, which was conducted day and night. Even the drains and culverts were searched day and night.<br><br>By the second night everyone was wondering what could have happened to the cadet, and the rumours of his running around and avoiding the search parties led to speculation he had gone crazy.  A couple of WO's and the CSM were rumoured to have consulted with a bomoh. The Bomoh had apparently pointed to a gnarled and twisted tree close to the last checkpoint he was seen at and said that a bad spirit in the tree had possessed the cadet, and if he could not be found by the end of the third day, he would be dead.<br><br>The search continued through the third day by air and by land with hundreds of men combing all possible territory, hiding locations, ponds, reservoirs, etc...still no sign of the cadet. Everyone was a little spooked by the rumours and even as we checked the drains and other possible shelter areas on the night shift we thought at any minute he might jump out at us.<br><br>On the morning of the fourth day a chopper spotted something floating in a small pond and radioed for the nearest search team to go to the area. It was the cadet. He was floating face down in the pond, his SBO still fully attached. He was pulled from the pond by two officers. He was an only son.<br><br>Strangely enough, the compass which was still attached with black shoelace to his SBO was set to the right bearing to the checkpoint he should have run to, instead he had run in the opposite direction and had ended up in a pond several km away from the checkpoint, the distance of which was known to him from his prior checkpoint, and had been less than 1 click. The pond he was found in had been searched several times during the three day manhunt. Cause of death was drowning, the cadet was not a swimmer.<br><br>****<br><br>Don't have any first hand Tekong experiences and can say I have been over virtually every piece of ground and swamp on the original island. One section a friend of mine led did have one man who did turn into a zombie one night after they had passed through one of the local burial areas, and I did spend some time with this soldier who was one of the platoon's best. He said he had urinated and felt cold then couldn't remember anything further till the next day.<br><br>Can't say I'm a believer in the spirit world, and these events may be readily explained, but they do send a chill up your spine when you recall them in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere.<br><br></div>

Pack of the training package was 2 days 1 night training at Tekong.<br><br>1st day, day topo exercise.<br><br>Me and 3 of my men formed a team and went off searching for check points. things were going pretty well as we were able to locate the check points. Somewhere along the way, we decided to bash through the vegetation to reach a check point.<br><br>We bashed and bashed until we came to a small little knoll. On top of this knoll while we were walking, I noticed stuffs like bowls, tea cups, urns littered all over the ground partly covered by vegetation.<br><br>Men were commenting how come all this barang barang were here..... told them not to disturbed them and just moved on..... suddenly we heard crashing noise to our right and through the corner of my eyes, I saw a shadow darting into the vegetation... from the outline of the shadow, it looks like a wild boar.<br><br>But the size of the boar seems to be out of proportion. I stand at 1.7m tall and the wildboar seems to be almost as tall as me. Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me from the fatigue. (from carrying the stupid PRC77 set).<br><br>Nevertheless, we quickly make haste of our stay there and moved off to search for our checkpoint. Along the way, we heard crashing sound along the way. Even though we shout out, no one replied.<br><br>After some difficulties, we managed to bashed out of the vegetation and found out checkpoints and concluded the exercise.<br><br>Spend our night at the old primary school but did not sleep well as was very feeling feverish.....next day, went on with our company ex...and by evening time, was on the way back on the RPL.....<br><br>Next day at camp, no able to get out of bed and need help from fellow sgts to get up.
