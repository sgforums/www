            <div class='col-md body'>obviously,it could either be mass hysteria,some electromagnetic field afecting the brains of everyone,mass hallucination or a true paranomal event.<br><br>that is,either of the 4 possibilities.I do not know the probablities of either one,but the one about the stature sounds like mass hysteria in any case.<br><br>the 2 incident where each one section is with you could also be attributed to mass hysteria of a sort,though personally,I think those incidents,there was truly something strange going on.</div>

Josh, your close calls seem worse as they come!<br><br>Out of curiousity, was that the camp in LCK that can be accessed thru Jalan Bhetara, passing the back of a school (That's my primary school - Lim Chu Kang Pr Sch)? The one that's nearest to the 4 storey HDBs and market? Stayed in LCK for first 15 years of my life and was paradise for me... That area was the scene of some battles during WW2 (as my now-passed granma could attest then), and had alot of "inhabitants". This is slightly out of topic.. sorry  , but i had my tution at tutor's home which was near the camp, deep inside Jln Bhetara (the place was actually quite densely populated then, contrary to popular belief of rural areas), and where one night, while waiting for my mum to pick me up after a session, saw a "ghost fire" floating near tutor's house. Needless to say, was scared to crap then (only 8 years old mah), and that was the last year i had tution there. Had to come up with some stupid excuse to give my tution teacher b'cos didn't tell them what i saw..<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">that place is neo tiew right?</div></blockquote>ya.. neo tiew is one of the roads flanking the market/hawker centre. my place was inside a now-absent road further up LCK Rd on the right and parallel to Neo Tiew Rd named Lorong Jerun, of which the entrance directly faces my pri. school. My tutor's place where i saw the fiery thingy was at Jln Betera, deep inside what is now Sg. Gedong.<br><br>Used to have fun watching trainees topo thru our property and follow them around on our bicycles. That's b'cos we know which trees had checkpoints and how to get there fastest! My place was also between Lor. Jerun and Neo Tiew, so there's actually a direct path linking these two roads together. My elder bro had such a good time during topo there during his 3rd Guards days and would bring his team to our house to shower, eat and relax, before getting all the checkpoints and still finish ahead of all other teams  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not a ghost story - but definitely a sad one.<br><br>10 years ago my friend used to work for URA in charge of all the old abandoned warehouses along the rivers.<br><br>He'd get keys to go into the warehouses and we'd take a lot of bw photos - a hobby.<br><br>One time he had the keys to a 2 storey shophouse. The entire neighbourhood is now abandoned and boarded up.<br><br>Upon entering, we saw old-fashioned shop glass display cases.<br><br>There were some damage here and there but we still discovered that an unusually large amount of stuff was left behind. From the look of things, it looked like this house had been abandoned more than 10 years - during the early 80's.<br><br>This is what we discovered in the house.<br><br>A plastic bag full of ang pows containing brand new $1 notes - the "bird" series. By then, they were already phased out more than 10 years.<br><br>Entire bw photo collection of the family that used to live in the house. Pictures of one of the son's wedding at the house where the entire neighbourhood turned up. And then their honeymoon in Cambodia - before the Vietnam War! I still keep this photocollection at home, most of them probably 1960's vintage judging from the cars and fashion. There were no colour photos.<br><br>In the kitchen we found their kitchenware etc still left behind.<br><br>Upstairs, the big picture emerged. All the beds in the bedrooms were still there as if someone still slept there - mattresses, pillows and sheets.<br><br>Just about everything not precious was left behind.<br><br>An art-school portfolio bag with an entire art-school porfolio. While this may be worthless to most people, this is a student's 3 years' worth of art school work. I know cos I'm in advertising.<br><br>In the wardrobes, all the family's clothes including underwear were still intact. In one bedroom the roof has collapsed somewhat and there was the dried up skin and bones carcass of a dead cat on top of a bedside cabinet.<br><br>Cheap badminton rackets etc. Anything not resellable.<br><br>In conclusion, to say the family left in a hurry was an understatement. 2 items that were more precious than money is the photo collection and the art school portfolio.<br><br>The ang pows tells us they left during CNY.<br><br>We can only speculate why they did not come back to collect the rest of their stuff. It was especially spooky to look at the photos of the place when it was so different compared to the sad desolation that we found.<br><br>If there was a way to contact that family I would galdly return their photo collection. It must mean a lot to them.</div>
