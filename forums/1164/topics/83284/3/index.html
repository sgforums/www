            <div class='col-md body'>One more on Statue. As all know that back in the late 70s or earlier till today, some camp have a statue to represent the unit. It can be anything from animal to human soldier. Like 4 SIR have a HAWK Statue, SAFINCO has had 2 soldier Statue, SAFTIMI, OCS etc etc.<br><br>Mine was back in 2Guards(closed down liao)LCK camp now where 4 SIR is. At HQ block along the road leading up to coy line where the guard mounting take place infront of the flag pole. There is one lone soldier(the statue)standing. When I 1st posted in in 1993 it was painted in camo colour and din take much notice of it oso.<br><br>Here goes. One day after guard mounting and everything else, i went up to my bunk and found that my radio was on and tune to FM92.4, never really bother with it and just off it and carry on down stair to do my laundry follow by going to mass watch TV. washing done went back up, hmm why the radio was on again? Something not rite i tell myself but din do anything abt it.<br><br>Go OPS room tell the clerk if anything come up I will be at coy line or the mass and if need to look for me. just call there and tell DO I will not be in the OPS room for the nite. As per normal, staff parade, rountine check of coy line blah blah... ...<br><br>At 0355hrs i was at guards house turn out fire picket, all turn out well and good and i carry on proceed to ammo dump to check. On the way, I hear lots and lots crying sound all around me(btw the ammo dump was at the other end of my camp after the MT line) without 2nd tot I turn and head back the way i came passed the guards house heading towards coy line, next i pass the statue and take a look at it, the pair of eyes were bloody red and the statue seem to staring at me. Sh|t, I speed off and reach my coy line in seconds.<br><br>Till that day afternoon I check with the senior guys any 'thing' on the statue not? Guess what, they smile at me, fxck man. It was said that b4 this batch of man come in, The statue was a black all painted black just the eyes red. All the previous batch of men doing the guards duty will complain that the statue is missing or the statue change it standing position or lots and lots chatting sound come from the statue.<br><br>Than one day one Y.S.L. had a dream of something I not sure what it abt and he went tell CO. Than on the very Sunday all regular were called to come back for one ritual. From the CSMs, the master had so call caught some sprite on the statue itself, and some other place in the camp as well. From him that infront of the statue after the road, a stair way leading up to the field was a gate to hell and he say that must be destroy for good. I myself go to the spot with the other new SGT to comfrim. Sure there is some debris of the stair way that was left behind cover up by the grass.<br><br>Arrrrrh... I am lucky that it was the oni incident happen to me, maybe he just want to let me know he is there. same most of the men during my time had compalin abt the statue oso.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Oh!!!

Teammate's reply? "huh? no ar... not dreaming of anything ah". Prata never told him what he heard or happened until exercise cut and everyone back in bunk preparing for RnR.

            <div class='col-md body'>I just remembered one incident that happened when I went for Ex Lancer in 2000. There's this small shrine on top of the slope overlooking the long houses that served as our bunks. We were told specifically NOT to go near the structure.  One fella was possesed and he started shouting and cursing even our wing comd, hardly a rational thing anyone would do since he is the most feared person followed by our WSM. It was so bad they had to take him to see a bomoh. He somehow made it through the incident just in time for the JCC portion of our trip. He later said (when we got back to Singapore) that he saw some children playing at the shrine that night and one of them looked and saw him, next thing he knew he was at the bomoh's place.<br><br>Another incident in Ex Lancer was during one of our training Ex Chindit, Chigger and Sandfly. During an assault, one of the guys lost his fieldpack, which was jettisoned upon contact, and couldn't find it anywhere despite a localised search by the platoon. One guy claimed he saw a little boy picked it up and disappeared into the jungle. Maybe it was one of the ibans but nobody can prove anything. The wing Comd made the decision not to pursue the incident and to rekit the fella when we got back.</div>

No one dared to walk pass the statue unless they really had to. Spec/Officers can siam, but the poor men lan lan have to walk pass it as it's part of the prowling route. But none of them mentioned the stairs that you said was there. Maybe it was already removed then ? Anyway there were no more stories about that particular statue during my entire stay there.<br><br>Btw, The blocks opposite the ammo dump are deserted and it's still damn spooky there at night. Also it seems like Bravo Coy, the block down the road from the MT line, had minor cases of spookiness. Minor sightings, problems with lights but nothing major.

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2 of Ulu Pandan Camp.<br><br>A few months later, one Saturday afternoon everybody has booked out. I was very tired so I cleared the desk of the S2 branch office and I climbed onto it to sleep. I was facing the window and it was a bright sunny afternoon and i could see the swimming pool and the coconut trees swaying in the breeze.<br><br>For some reason I remembered the shadow incident and all of a sudden, in my tiny little office a man's low voice laughed. He laughed in the most "b-grade" horror movie fashion. Damn tacky.<br><br>But I was suddenly frozen. I couldn't move. I could still look around the office and still see the the coconut trees swaying in the breeze. But I couldn't move a muscle.<br><br>Slowly, what seems like eternity, I managed to move my fingers. I tapped them on the table. Slowly then faster.<br><br>Eventually I "broke free" of the spell and I got up. I beat all the records for changing my clothes and getting the fxxk outta the building.<br><br>I'm normally a skeptic with these things and I would even go up to vacant bunks during prowling alone to check toilets and bunks alone when my partner is reluctant.<br><br>Of course, one time I did that, I got spooked. One toilet and bunk was lit in the vacant 3-storey building and I decided to check it alone. With my weapon with bayonet I checked the toilet cubicles opening the doors one by one. Nothing.<br><br>I went into the long bunk that was also lit. It was used to store empty green cupboards. Suddenly, in that windless night, a chill went up my spine even though i wasn't scared. I turned around slowly, and walked out switching the lights off as I went.<br><br>They say don't turn just your head around or your "shoulder lights" would go out and you'll kena something. If you want to turn you must turn your whole body so you face the spirits with your full "force" - then you should be OK.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Someone had a "time-warp" experience in Tekong where time seemed to have gone very slowly. I had a similar experience while a teenager.<br><br>This happened at East Coast while we were having an overnight BBQ. Around 0200hrs it started to rain. We all ran across ECP to the HUDC flats. We all got separated and I ended up with one guy who was one of the school's ace footballer.<br><br>We were at one of the HUDC blocks looking for a way to sleep. We found the stairwell door and we went inside the lit stairwell to find a mahjong table with a chair and a reclining chair made of rattan.<br><br>My friend grabbed that chair and I settled into the other chair and placed my feet up on the mahjong table and we fell asleep almost immediately.<br><br>After what seemed like a long time, I opened my eyes, feeling like I've just run 10km. My friend also awoke simultaneously even though neither of us made any sounds.<br><br>I was weak and had to support myself on the table and chair to get on my feet. My footballer friend also had to use to armrest to push himself up.<br><br>Without saying a word we supported each other and staggered out of the stairwell. Once we opened the door and went out we sat down on the floor against the wall panting like dogs.<br><br>I looked at my watch and we were in there less than 10 minutes. But it felt like eternity. Another friend found us and asked wtf happened to us. We never said a thing to him or to anyone about the incident. Between the both of us we somehow never spoke about it either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, this isn't about military ghost but civilian one. About 3 years b4 I go for NS, I was working with my uncle and so I stay there more than at home. One day, I went home to get something from my mother. And I went into my room to get something. Guess what? Something "moved" in while I'm not around. My sensors are "on", so I can feel it. My home do have a little ghost and my mum told me that me and my elder sis may have played with it when young. But I'm not sure about this one right in my room. So I just put everything down and talk to it using a serious tone. Telling it to get out and never set foot in my room. It worked becos the next time I come back, my room felt back to normal again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hehe, sorry for deviating from the post.<br><br>Surprisingly, Tengah Airbase is quite clean, never heard any stories or encounter anything during my NS there.

That area was the scene of some battles during WW2 (as my now-passed granma could attest then), and had alot of "inhabitants". This is slightly out of topic.. sorry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  , but i had my tution at tutor's home which was near the camp, deep inside Jln Bhetara (the place was actually quite densely populated then, contrary to popular belief of rural areas), and where one night, while waiting for my mum to pick me up after a session, saw a "ghost fire" floating near tutor's house. Needless to say, was scared to crap then (only 8 years old mah), and that was the last year i had tution there. Had to come up with some stupid excuse to give my tution teacher b'cos didn't tell them what i saw.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>that place is neo tiew right?</div>

About 3 years b4 I go for NS, I was working with my uncle and so I stay there more than at home. One day, I went home to get something from my mother. And I went into my room to get something. Guess what? Something "moved" in while I'm not around. My sensors are "on", so I can feel it. My home do have a little ghost and my mum told me that me and my elder sis may have played with it when young. But I'm not sure about this one right in my room. So I just put everything down and talk to it using a serious tone. Telling it to get out and never set foot in my room. It worked becos the next time I come back, my room felt back to normal again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hehe, sorry for deviating from the post.<br><br>Surprisingly, Tengah Airbase is quite clean, never heard any stories or encounter anything during my NS there. But I'm sure 142 Sqn personnel would have stories since they are just across the road from the cemeteries at LCK road towards Sungei Gedong, my old camp. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>TAB no ghost story?<br>i wouldnt says its 100% clean..<br>would like to post some story during my time in FDS TAB..give me some time to sort out the story..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seems like there have been many incidents during outfield and exs... i guess its time to share my experiences. For my BMT, things were mostly peaceful. The only thing i've experienced during my BMT happened in the bunk.

The hall was all shuttled up that day, since it wasn't in use. u have to access the store from inside the hall, so its right to say the store is an enclosed room within an enclosed place. so there we are, chatting away, me next to the double doors of the store, the rec standing oppo, when he shifts his stare to the door. i turn to see what hes looking at... the double doors were opening very slowly and steadily. then it stops. then, it starts closing slowly and steadily. but right before it closes completely, it suddenly closes with an increased force. shuts with a bang. boy, i grabbed the rec and got the hell outta there.</div>
