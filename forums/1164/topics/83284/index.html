            <div class='col-md body'>Well psykor, that's the thing - I started in the old camp and ended up in the new one, and saw jack squat.<br><br>In the old camp, 5 Coy had painted a devil's head as a mascot, and apparently a few odd things started happening after that - rattling chains at night and all.  Apparently, the guys tried getting rid of the painting by painting over it, but the new paint job kept peeling off.  I've seen the peeled paint and the mascot under it, but that hardly counts as a ghost.<br><br>In the new camp, a number of skeletons were discovered when the excavation was being performed at the site of the swimming pool.  It appears that these skeletons were from WW2.  The day after the swimming pool was first filled up, two dead frogs were found floating in the pool, and cracks had developed in the pool floor.<br><br>Okay, stories from my company mates?<br><br>First, I was from 2 Coy, just after the batch where the three guys dies in the helicopter abseiling accident.  During my BMT, one of the blokes said that he woke up one night to see three figures dressed in full battle order, carrying abseiling ropes in their shoulders.  This fellow was living in the bunk that the three guys had lived in, but none of the recruits knew that at the time.<br><br>About a year into our service, a passerby called Battalion HQ and complained that three men were abseiling down the side of our company line.<br><br>During my BMT, one of my section mates was killed in a motorcycle accident.  The night after the funeral, one of my platoon mates woke up to hear someone singing outside the barracks.  My late section mate had often led the cadence when the platoon was marching or running.<br><br>During Chinese New Year, the Indian guys in my company were put on guard duty, and so had to book in the night before the duty.  Apparently, a number of them heard noises from the armskote, and it sounded like the chains were being pulled through the trigger guards of the rifles.  They went down to check, and the armskote was locked up.<br><br>Like I said, I never saw any of this for myself, so please take this as simply a set of accounts that I have related.<br><br>As for guys who have seen things, I had one of those in my company.  It becase the running joke when we would be doing a tactical movement, and this guy would go "Wait!", and the whole company had to skirt around ghosts that only he could see! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>This happened at the a camp in Seletar.<br><br>It started when a few men from my platoon start seeing something at night in their bunk, they sort of sleep together in a big bunk. They are a good, rough, brave and tough bunch, so everyone just wants to write it off as his imagination. Things got worst, as more men see it. Soon Corporals and Sgts all sleep in bunks beside the men, saw it too.<br><br>What is it that they saw ? From the interviews with the men, corporals and Sgts, the story, is something will come into their bunk at night, it will either walk by their bed or stop beside their bed for a while. They can see it as a human shape, but it is a shadow form, which you cannot see it clearly, no matter how hard they try to see.<br><br>At that time, I was one crazy and brave soul, who fear nothing, so I waited outside the men bunks for 3 nights in a roll, which nothing happen. But soon, it started again. Possible reason my Staff Sgt can think of was, blessing by the different religious leaders during my commission parade.  We try to put talisman but none works. We try every thing we can within limits of army rules, but none works also. As the nightly visit still did not stop, the senior officers finally agree to turn a blind eye, what one of the men did was he brought in a small golden Buddha from Thailand which they put in the corridor. Strange the sighting just suddenly stop.<br><br>That the end ?  Â…<br><br>No Â… there is a part 2 to it. You see, after half a year, I was transferred out to another company and my men ROD and the golden Buddha was brought home.<br><br>Soon a BMT platoon take over the bunks. All was fine, nothing strange happen, till the 3rd week of the BMT, and it was a Friday, everyone booked out except the recuits and their instructors. I was the duty officer that day.  At 10.30p.m after visiting the guardroom, I went to check on the BMT platoons. They just finished their night snacks, and are about to turn in, all was fine.<br><br>It was 2.15 p.m. when the phone in the Operation room, rang. On the other line was, the one of the Platoon Commander of one of the BMT platoons, he was panic. He was asking me to activate the guards, and shouting they cannot hold him any much longer. What I got was they seem to be having trouble with someone who went berserk and they just manage to hold on to him with over 10 person and still are having trouble.<br><br>I rush to the guardroom by that time the Guard Sgt already activated the guards. He already got a call from one of the BMT PC for help. I draw out 2 pair of handcuffs in case in need to restrain the person, and I have to unload all the guards from the landrover as the Guard Sgt had arm them with rifles with ammo !!! I told the Guard Sgt, that going into action with a crazy guy with armed rifles is not a good ideal, because we cannot shoot him, but he can if he grabbed one rifles. Well that sure frightened the guards, on the thought of going in unarmed.<br><br>When we arrive, we saw an amazing sight, there is more than 10 person one on top of any other pinning someone to the ground, like a ruby tackle. After looking at the situation, I suddenly have this feeling that everything is ok, donÂ’t ask me how, I just know. I told the PC there to get his folks off that guy, but they all refused, as they are too frightened to do so. I have to scream at them before they unwilling get off one by one, but all ready to pound on top again. He was totally stiffed, he muscles is all contracted and he didnÂ’t even move. I was soon looking into the BMT recruit, there is just something strange about him, I cannot tell why, but I soon know. People say the eyes are the window to a person soul, I was soon looking face to face into his eyes. The strange things is his eyes donÂ’t blink, also they seem hollow, without the type of shine of a normal human eye. I told him, that everything is ok now, we are here to help him. Soon the Ambulance arrive from the medical center, we got him in with 4 huge escorts.<br><br>After the Ambulance left,  I start gather all the information on the ground, the facts on what happened was this recruit sudden just woke up and start banging his head to the cupboard, the rest of the recruit try to stop him, but he is just too strong. Next the instructors try to, stop him but he attempted to jump down from 3rd floor.  So they had to force him down to the ground floor before they manage to overpower him. The strange thing was, this is one of the top recruits, who has no family problem, no girlfriend problem and super fit.<br><br>The recruit was send from one hospital to another, because none found any problem with him. They finally send him to NUS, but they also found nothing wrong, in the end they send him to the Woodbridge Bridge Hospital. No one seem to know what is wrong with him. We even have difficulties in submitting the incident report to mindef, so in the end, we just put it as suspected case of nervous breakdown.<br><br>What happened to the recruit ? He got back out without any recollection of what happen that night.  The unofficial fact is that we got one of the Senior Sgt to informally tell the dad and mum to go and pray for their son, which they did and he became ok a day after that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gedanken:</div><div class="quote_body">Well psykor, that's the thing - I started in the old camp and ended up in the new one, and saw jack squat.<br><br>In the old camp, 5 Coy had painted a devil's head as a mascot, and apparently a few odd things started happening after that - rattling chains at night and all.  Apparently, the guys tried getting rid of the painting by painting over it, but the new paint job kept peeling off.  I've seen the peeled paint and the mascot under it, but that hardly counts as a ghost.<br><br>As for guys who have seen things, I had one of those in my company.  It becase the running joke when we would be doing a tactical movement, and this guy would go "Wait!", and the whole company had to skirt around ghosts that only he could see! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div></blockquote>Ah... so that's where the devil painting had it's origins. 1st Coy had the "joker" and wished i'd gotten their coy t-shirt printed with the devilish joker's grinning bloodstained face while posted there for 3 months. 2 coy was Gargoyle i think, though our newly designed t-shirt comes nowhere close to being unearthly mean.<br><br>In the new camp, there was the story of the bunk beside ours which had one of the previous (very long time ago) recruits commited suicide. That's 2nd level of coy block, the back of which faces the public road outside. I suppose that explains the joss stick and incense rough mini atlar behind the block where the chin-up bars are. Afew of the guys, including the indian platoonmate (who slept in that bunk) i mentioned in the previous post with "sixth" sense, saw the dark figure. Not ghostly, but like a normal person except in full shadow so no features are clear. And almost always beside the bed or rammaging through the locker where his originally was. My indian friend related that he was often tekaned because of being slow, perhaps because he forgotten to bring something and holding the platoon back. And he probably hasn't found that item yet, and was still trying. But he means no harm to anyone.<br><br>Nothing chilling about this story. One probably have more hair-raising sensations patrolling the arc from beside the survival village to the SOC grounds at night during guard duty!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Good thing my indian fren was in SR as well, and we had the least "disturbed" route ready for battalion passage, otherwise, won't be too nice to hold up the entire exercise early in the morning!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The last time i actually saw with my own eyes paranormal activity was in Primary 2, which was waved away by most as pure imagination. Probably good that it's the last, hopefully, though i'm certainly comfortable now with these unfleshed frens around.. harmless ones i mean!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are one of mine own first-hand exeprience, much less frightening, during my NS 20 years ago.<br><br>First one: taking a course at a camp in Alexander Rd that's next to a JC - St Andrew's or something, can't remember if it's an Engineer camp or something.<br><br>At night, 4 chaps decided to play Ouija Board. They use a coin and draw up a piece of paper with the alphabets, numbers, yes/no so the spirit they call up can answer their questions. And a circle for "home".<br><br>Started a about 9pm in the bunk on a square folding table. Being the kiasi and skeptical cynic, I decided to just watch.<br><br>One of the chaps was a very playful fellow. So when, sure enough, the coin started moving, I was sure it was him pushing the coin.<br><br>All their questions were answered promptly. ...Spirit was a girl. One of the chaps will have a gf this year etc etc... But when it was time for supper, the spirit was reluctant to go to the space marked "home".<br><br>(In this kind of game, you cannot lift your finger away before the spirit goes home or you'll sure kena a lot of problems from the said spirit.)<br><br>Again, I thought it was the playful fellow moving the coin. Eventually it did go "home" and all of us went for nightsnack.<br><br>After nightsnack at the canteen, they were back at it in the bunk. This time, the coin barely moved, but it did move.<br><br>Part 2 of the game was very slow going. The spirit didn't answer any questions instead just moved randomly - and painfully slow - over the board.<br><br>Midnight, lights out. Still at it, and the spirit refused to go home. Started feeling cold, being only an observer, I was free to get up to switch off all the fans.<br><br>Everyone else went to bed.<br><br>0100 hrs, 0200 hrs, still at it. This time I was quite sure no one was kidding around. I can sense all were nervous as heck as the coin is still moving slowly and randomly.<br><br>It began to get very cold even with the fans off. They, including myself, started to feel a chill. I got everyone as well as myself wrapped in blankets. In Singapore.<br><br>They were all very quiet and one guy already had dark rings under his eyes. Quite a sight, four of them sitting in the dark wrapped in army blankets with their fingers on a 50c coin. Almost funny.<br><br>By 0300 hrs I cannot tahan anymore so friend or no friend, I went to sleep.<br><br>The next day they were very quiet. Eventually the spirit went home at about 4am, they told me. The guy with the dark rings under his eyes said he was seeing things in the bunk some time during the game. One of the things he saw was a child playing under one of the bunk beds.<br><br>Whatever it was, my conclusion was that something did move the coin and it wasn't any of the chaps. No matter how much of a prankster you are, you won't want to sit with you finger on a coin for almost 5 fxxking hours.</div>
