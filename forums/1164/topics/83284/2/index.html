            <div class='col-md body'>I'll help you guys get back on topic. Chill fellas ...<br><br>This happened around December 2002, in our dear Pulau Tekong. Wasn't a personal experience, but it's close enough i think.<br><br>**********<br><br>I was in an Infantry Bn that was going to P.Tekong for an 5 day exercise. I suspect the sole purpose of the mission was to tekan us sec-coms and the men, for all we did was SBD after SBD, with the occasion platoon mission. At night we would move to another area in FBO to another part of Tekong to dig in and con, then repeat the cycle again next day.<br><br>Mind you my bn was already operational, gone to brunei, and had already done quite a few battallion exercises, so <strong>WHY</strong> the bn HQ had funny ideas of training section movement for 5 entire days is beyond me. Furthermore, in <strong>ALL</strong> my bn exercises right up to my ORD, I had never even once fought in section level, it was always platoon level and above.<br><br>I'm going out of point, anyway suffice to say, we were all very tired by wednesday night having been doing drills since Monday. Now, that night after we finished our drills, we were supposed to move to another area to con, but for some reason, we were held at a training shed till ~11pm. Frankly then, me and my fellow sec-coms didn't care why, we were just glad to get some rest.<br><br>A while later, news filtered down to us that a bravo coy sec-com; let's call him Sgt A had gone missing during his FIBUA mission. Bn HQ was starting to worry and subsequently, the entire battalion was activated to search for him since Bravo coy had not suceeded in locating the Sgt despite having been searching and combing the area since 7pm.<br><br>We took 5-tonners to the BUA village where Sgt A was last seen, and carried out a mass combing. Entire companies were formed up in an extended line, and we moved forward to search, all the while calling out Sgt A's name. However by 2am, our Sgt A was still missing, and we had combed more than 2km from the BUA village. Those unlucky ones even bashed through the vegetation to search for him. All to no avail.<br><br>By this time, us Sgts were joking among one another, cracking jokes. We were horsing around saying Sgt A was hiding somewhere on purpose so we had to search for him, and as a result, the Bn exercise would have to halt. We even made up a mock plan as to who was next to hide, where to hide, and how much rations he should bring in order to sustain a hide till friday when mission would cut. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>At around 2.30am, Thursday early morning, the search was finally called off. Sgt A had been found.<br><br>We didn't carry out our mock plan, and our exercise went on with the exception that we woudn't have to dig in that night as it was too late already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">. We carried out our last mission on thursday afternoon and gathered at the BUA village (where Sgt A went missing) at CO's orders.<br><br>**********<br><br>There, the CO addressed the battalion and told us what happened ...<br><br>On Wednesday evening, Sgt A was point section of his platoon to attack a BUA building. The exercise was a simple one, RV somewhere in the vegetation about 70m away from the building, then move towards it and carry out the usual drills.<br><br>It was getting dark then, and the platioon was lagging slightly. Sgt A told his men he would move ahead and check out the front, and instructed them to wait for the platoon. However, when the platoon arrived, Sgt A wasn't there. Not sensing anything admiss at that time, the platoon carried out the attack without Sgt A. Maybe the PC decided to question Sgt A when he came back.<br><br>It was nearing 8pm, and Sgt A still hadn't come back. The PC ordered the platoon to search for their Sgt. Soon the search expanded involved the Coy, and finally the whole Battalion.<br><br>Sgt A was eventually found at the <span style="font-style: italic;">Malay School</span> by a mortar/scout (details are foggy, don't remember which exactly)section at around 230am. For those who don't know, this Malay School place was some distance away from the BUA village where Sgt A had gone missing. He was unconcious and suffering from mild hypothermia when discovered, and was sent to the BMTC medical center for treatment.<br><br>Sgt A initially refused to tell anyone what exactly happened, but after some time, he finally told his side of the story ...<br><br>That evening when Sgt A went ahead of his platoon alone that evening, he saw a white seemingly female figure. This figure told Sgt A to follow. For some reason, Sgt A felt compelled to follow and couldn't resist. He also mentioned he seem to be viewing everything from a 3-rd person perspective from behind <span style="font-style: italic;">ie. he was somehow looking at himself from behind following the white figure.</span><br><br>Sgt A (and the figure) arrived at the Malay School Tekong. <span style="color: red;">There, the figure asked Sgt A to kill himself.</span><br><br>**********<br><br>Our CO then mentioned that it was fortunate that we train with blanks instead of live rounds.<br><br>Maybe it was pure survival instinct, that Sgt A didn't commit suicide  despite the white figure telling him to. Maybe that particular didn't have enought "power". Or maybe it was the lack of lethal equipment, as he didn't have live rounds to shoot himself with. In any case, it's was fortunate that we didn't lose a life over the incident.<br><br>**********<br><br>For the skeptics out there, if you don't believe me there's nothing i can do.<br><br>If you don't believe Sgt A, please remember he had no need to reason to lie and cause a big hooha that involved the entire batallion of 400+ soldiers. If he was sick he could just have fallen out. I never knew this Sgt A well, as I was a spec in another coy, also, I was from an older batch of specs that passed out earlier. But his fellow coy specs that i was more friendly with told me that Sgt A isn't the "chao keng" type, more of the hardworking type (A was a regular btw).<br><br>And it's highly unlikely that Sgt A got lost in Tekong and invented the story. All Infantry specs spend 8 months "playing" in Tekong and are quite familiar with at least 75% of tekong ground having done exercise/torpor extensively on the island. Sgt A was a newer spec that had passed out of SISPEC not too long ago before the incident. Furthermore, all Sgts have a damn map and compass.<br><br>Lastly, he was less than 100m from the BUA. If he needed medical help, it was 100m away. And it's almost impossible that he got lost in the night. He was 100m away from all the light and noise that the rest of the coy was making in another part of the BUA ...<br><br>Sorry for the long post ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i suppose the malay school's quite a popular haunt!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I haven't heard much stories myself, but it was generally agreed that the malay school, plus the eastern jetty (dunno why - never heard any stories there) and the hot spring area (it certainly looked abit like hell's gate from the entrance, especially when i had to spend nites there twice sleeping on hammocks or gs bench with only another platoon mate waiting for trainees to pass through our topo checkpoint!). My indian platoon mate claims a woman spends time there (hot spring area)... which i doubt. Got a feeling there's more...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>my personal experience... well not very personal, but close enough oso i guess, was during bmt training there. Afew hours after lights off (as if we got lights... haha... should be lanterns off), one of my mates wanted to do some big business... following the set protocol, i accompanied him from one of the classrooms to the drain just outside the window, and stood beside him and looking around while he shat (i don't think we were allowed to shit into the drain, but what the heck). After he's done, we went back to our spot on the ground in the classroom.<br><br>Then he asked me if i heard a woman's voice singing. And i was like... huh? duh? Nope. But he insisted he heard it clear, though not loud, and from one of the trees beside the road. I've no reason to doubt him (since i believe in such stuff anyway, having my fair share of creeps - though not visuals except one), but i just tell him not to think about it lah. We got so many men here, dun need to worry, will be fine in afew hours' time. Then went back to sleep. Dunno if he slept, but nothing strange happen from that incident.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, mine isn't scary at all but it does give me creeps becos it happen at around 2am at 'C' Coy, 46 SAR, just beside a room with a talisman on it. I was in the toilet doing a little business. I'm one of those who can feel their presence but can't see them. But that particular day, my sensors are sort of 'off'. As I'm standing at the urinal, I heard Chinese opera and in a company of 165 men not including specs, I doubt any of them listens to opera especially at that time. I just do it fast and buggered off.

Time check with all and confirm now 2230hrs. In my mind now are;<br>1. Why oni 6min and it seem like 30min?<br>2. How did we move so fast in a pitch-dark closed terrain?<br>3. 1km? why we are still in here? It about 500m to 600m to get out of it.<br><br>Men start to ask why we stopped? I keep quiet... and say, ok from now all will pace 500m and stop. We move on and at 500m we halt. We are still in and the place look alike. Fxcked. by now we had cover almost 1.5km and all know what is going on but none say a words. Time check 2333hrs. I tell myself by 0000hrs if we are still in here, we will sleep here tonite.<br><br>So as a sect comd, I tell my men that we will walk another 500m, if we are still in here, we can oni camp here tonite. all agreed. before move out, i get the guy tie a comd-scour to one of the tree and move on. Another 500m, we are still in, time check, Fxcked again, oni 3min had gone by. I tell my mens let move on till 0000hrs, b4 long, the one with the comd-scour call to me say he had finish the roll. We halt for the last time. by now my section had cover more than 2 click near 3. Time check 2359hrs. Signal set not working so no way to call end pt.<br><br>Me just sleep through the nite, as for my men, none of them able to sleep.<br><br>Day break, we start to proceed back to end pt, by now all should have been back to the school now. b4 we move off the one who tie the comd-scour call me again. Sh|t. it the same tree where he tie the end to when I ask him to do that last nite. All of us move out from that area fast and for less than 300m, we hit T.Keong high way.<br><br>What a nite. It what they call GUI ZER YAN. Till today I still cannot figure why we move in circle. We were back to the pt where my men tie the comd-scour to a tree.</div>
