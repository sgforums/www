            <div class='col-md body'>i think in terms of policy mindef does not haf special policies for these so called white horses, or at least they dun wan to admit to it.<br><br>but we r all working under someone else.. or wif another person.. so inevitably, when we realise this person is some guy high up there's son, there wil be this tendency to try to treat him better, cos even tho u urself believe in fairness for all and equal treatment, u cant be sure tts wat everyone around u thinks. o cos u can still stand up for wat u believe.<br><br>i guess they cant realli make the difference in treatment so obvious. the only thing they can do to avoid all these is to ...take him out of combat service using one reason or another, so that there will be less chances of comparison, unless o cos the son himself wishes to go thru everything. and i believe the son himself does play a part in the kind of treatment he receives. if he behaves like a white horse, he wud most likely get the white horse treatment. if he does not want such treatment, chances r his superior wil be more willing to treat him equally.. more willing doesnt mean will.<br><br>as to where all these sons go, i guess meritocracy still comes in.<br><br>call me naive.. but i like to believe ppl r professional at our military service. makes me feel safer too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not a matter of SAF policy that things are like this. It is just individual officers and WOSEs covering their asses.<br><br>Think for a moment if you were a batallion CO or SM. Your duty in peace is to train your men to the highest standards so that they will survive and prevail in war. However, if everytime you push this particular subordinate who happens to be a "WH" you get hit by shit, would you not be tempted to just ease off a little?<br><br>And so it begins. Slacking off is not confined to lower ranks. The right thing to do would be to push on and damn the consequences, knowing that your duty to your men is sacred and it is in that WH's best long term interest. But war is so far away and the easy path is there.<br><br>Again, the SAF has no official policy that things should be like this, quite the opposite in fact. Individual commanders are simply not doing their jobs. This ranges from unit commanders who do not push the WH's, to personnel officers who assign them to easier tasks. After all, you would not want a minister storming in asking why his son just lost his toes in the Combat Engineers after dropping a bridge section on them or was shot in a live fire exercise. Just assign him to a staff position and keep your career safe.<br><br>To fix this we need officers with backbone. It is not uncommon for a person to be brave enough to assault a bunker, yet too cowardly to open his mouth. Unfortunately, Singaporean culture encourages this. So this shit just keeps rolling.</div>
