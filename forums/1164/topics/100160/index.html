OUCH.<br><br>as for jungle operations, they use the woodland bdus with a boonie hat. not sure if this is SOP but they have their "PASKAL" tab on their right shoulder, at the very top, just like "RANGER", and on the opposite side of the arm is a patch of 'soft-side' velcro.. at the top of thier boonie hat at the very front, is another patch. it's a parachute and in wing and it's colored in olive drab (OD).<br>their boots looks like the vietnam-era woodland boots, with black and od around it.<br><br>they're loadout is the standard m16 rifle. standard iron sights. don't know if they use the full 30 bullets in the mag or the 28 to allow the mag to seat properly. they're issued with a standard combat harness, something like that of our sbo. most operatives in the formation(how many per squad they didn't say) are armed with the m16, with the occasional fn minimi.<br><br>i feel that for a specialised unit, paskal seems to be very lowly equipped.. i don't know if this is their standard loadout or they don't really want to reveal their equipment but yeah, what i see is what i assume, but then again, don't think that they're showing all their stuff..<br><br>for amphibious assaults, they use the zodiacs (rib) and rigid raiders(not shown in picture).. the motor on the rib is a yamaha outboard motor. i think it's the 4 stroke model, f40, i really don't know. the article says that paskal operates in sections of 12 to a rib or 6 to an inflatable..<br><br>well i hope this helps, special operator number 87. once i have access to a scanner i'll try send the photos to you.<br><br>palmerised</div>
