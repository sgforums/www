One such example is the latest Igla AA missile on the M113 platform.<br><br>The M113 have an advantage over the BX, thus instead of replacing all the M113 with BX, some are being upgraded to the Ultra standard.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I thot it resembled an S-300 system... seriously.<br><br>The M113s will continue to soldier on for a long time lar.  Those are liable vehicles capable of multiple roles.
