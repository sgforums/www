These tanks are thus 1' 6" too wide.<br><br>The standard track centres adopted at the time of electrification in Sydney in the 1920's was 12' 0" or 3.66m. Clearly 12' 0" wide tanks are bound to have trouble on Sydney tracks, especially when crossing tanks going the other way.<br><br>However, new double track lines in NSW, including crossing loops, are now normally done to 4.00m centres (13' 1 1/2").<br><br>On the Adelaide to Darwin line, which is almost entirely single track, there are mostly low level platforms, and probably few bridges with girders that are foul of the tanks.<br><br>If there are structures that are too narrow for these tanks, then any upgrading work should be done at the same time as raising height limitations preventing double stacking.<br><br>Whatever the case, a loading gauge test train should be operated to find measure inadequate widths and heights on the network.</blockquote>2.<strong><blockquote><a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=6029" rel="nofollow">An extensive rail study has been undertaken and a request for tender will soon by released to obtain the necessary rolling stock to support the movement of the Abrams family of vehicles in Australia.

Presently, however, there was "an interim arrangement as the vehicles are here and we are not doing maintenance". "We expect the tender to be opened next April," he said.<br><br>Lieutenant Colonel Libby could not say when the tender would be awarded, but it could end up more expensive than the purchase of the hardware itself. It is understood Defence called for expressions of interest from local firms a year ago.<br><br>He said it could be cheaper to send parts back to the US for repair in the short term because of existing production capacity there. "The same work may cost more here but we will support Australian industry and we need to be able to maintain control of our own equipment," he said.<br><br>Opposition defence spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon yesterday accused the Government of taking its eye off the main game of security and safety at home.<br><br>"If reports are accurate that the through-life service contract is not to be granted to an Australian company in the short term, then the Government appears to have backflipped on a major aspect of the original plan," he said. "If the Government had its national security priorities right it would be able to guarantee that the maintenance of military equipment was undertaken by Australian companies."<br><br>The Government has sought to ensure local industry will service the Joint Strike Fighter, Australia's biggest defence purchase. Defence Minister Brendan Nelson is lobbying the US to ensure the $16 billion purchase includes access to the stealth technology required for any domestic maintenance program.<br><br>Lieutenant Colonel Libby said the Government had set a target of having the tanks operationally ready by December 2007 and this goal would be achieved six months early. "In terms of introducing a key new defence asset, the project has been very successful and Australian business is already involved in other aspects of the project," he said.<br><br>Lieutenant Colonel Libby said all facilities were built and the US Government had advised approval to transfer intellectual property to Australian defence contractors last month. "Troopers are training in these tanks now," he said.<br><br><strong>In total, Australia will take delivery of 59 Abrams tanks, seven M88A2 Hercules armoured recovery vehicles, 14 heavy tank transporters, eight refuelling trucks, six advanced gunnery training simulators and one tank driver trainer simulator.<br><br>Lieutenant Colonel Libby also dismissed claims the 68-tonne tanks could not be transported around Australia because they were too heavy for road bridges.</strong><br><br>He said a study had recommended Defence arrange a long-term lease of rail rolling stock for the transfer of the tanks from their base in Darwin to training areas in South Australia during the wet season. "The Abrams can go anywhere the Leopard tank used to train," he said.</blockquote>http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20999669-2702,00.html<br><br></div>

How is it expensive? It is less than $1 million per M1A1 AIM compared to $1.5 Mil Singapore paid for the Leo1A4.</div>
