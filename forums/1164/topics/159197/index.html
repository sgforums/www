Mainly for emergancy landings.<br>Heck the F-117s have hooks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, any aircraft with a thrust to weight ratio of more than 1 to 1, or even NEAR  1 to 1 can streak off the runway at high angles.  As long as its not vertical, they 'd be able gain altitude fast.   Of course, having more than 1 to 1 will allow it to ACCELERATE and CLIMB at the same time.  Where as, those with less than 1 to 1, trades airspeed for altitude.<br><br>Naval aircraft, those that land on carriers are specially designed to endure the shock of carrier landings, the salty spray of the sea.  Imagine if u just take any jet engine and operate near the ocean, sucking all the salty spray... woosh.<br><br>As for the impact the aircraft makes on landing... heh.  Lets just say, landing on a carrier is not really a landing.  Its more like a controlled crash.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paiseh paiseh........came back to tell you guys that the thrust to weight ratio is not 3:1, went to look up the book again which took me 1 hr and realised that I was thinking of the wrong one.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Its more like 1.8:1. Sorry, sorry.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>PS: Regarding the aircraft carrier one, nah.......needs the hook for the catapult and the landing gear is not strong enough.</div>
