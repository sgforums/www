            <div class='col-md body'>There is way too much speculation riding around.<br><br>Frankly, im not joking when i say the SAF is feeling a budget crunch.<br><br>This is info that has filtered down even to the NSFs.<br><br>Their literally ordering the NSFs to put up as many suggestions as possible, and save wherever possible.<br><br>i used to work in a arty unit, and got on well with people.<br>I chatted here and there, and the general state is bad.<br>Officers are not being promoted or accepted into regular service as much as they used to be. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>We believe if we bought the best equipment, we'd have the best army around. Yes, theoretically. But where does the money come from?<br><br>The people in MINDEF have clearer heads than us, that's why they can plan these things. If they believe that the SPH and upcoming projects are enough, it's enough.<br><br>What we believe is right for the SAF, is not what they believe. And what they believe goes.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... Refering to this Budget Crunch Issues, last heard from some senior commanders that our Military Expenses has never being reduced. However due to the 9-11 incident, a portion of the "pie" had been cut and used to fund those Anti-terroism activities and research.<br><br>However, one thing that I cannot tolerate is the way the senior management used the money. One very good example is the SAF Meals Caterer, SFI. Imagine that SAF actually have to pay up to $5 a day for a meal which I can get in the canteen in less than $3 (some more the canteen food taste better.)</div>
