Also, heard over the radio today that Iran is openly adopting Al Qaeda into their country as a base for operations, it actually creates more trouble to the US and bring to the world greater volatility. Coz they have got immunity in Iran ain't it, and the international community can do nuts about it. But unless there's the capability to eliminate foreign heads of states quietly, then the presence of CVs and ICBM armed subs in any region will be less present won't it?</div></blockquote>Quite hard to fathom the alliance btw Al Qaeda &amp; Iran,considering that the former adheres to Sunni Islam while the latter predominantly adheres to Shi'a Islam,and both denominations have long history of disputes with each other. Well,unless both adopts the "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" approach,like Catholic France siding Protestant states against Catholic coalitions led by Austrian House of Habsburg during the Thirty Year's War,</div>

William Fallon, the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, told reporters.<br><br>The carrier group was not engaged in anti-submarine exercises, but if it had, "and if this Chinese sub came in the middle of this, then it could have escalated into something that could have been very unforeseen," he said.<br><br>Today in Asia - Pacific<br><br>Malaysia's leader warns of religious and ethnic tensions<br>In Australia, scandals dog Labor Party<br>Pakistan softens Islamic law in favor of rape victimsFallon, who is in Kuala Lumpur for a 23-nation Chief of Defense Forces meeting, did not give any other details. He was commenting on a report on The Washington Times' Web site that said a Chinese submarine "stalked" the Kitty Hawk and surfaced within torpedo firing range.<br><br>The newspaper said the carrier group was operating close to Okinawa at the time of the incident.<br><br>"It illustrates the primary reason why we are trying to push, to have better military-to-military relationships" with China, Fallon said.<br><br>"Because the fact is that you have military units that operate in close proximity to one another," he said, warning of "the potential for events that would not be what we'd like to see."<br><br>In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu could not say if the incident had indeed occurred.<br><br>"I have not heard of such a report," she said at a regular news briefing Tuesday. "China has always had a defensive national defense policy. We are an adamant force in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the world at large," she said.<br><br>Fallon's disclosure came at the same time the commander of the U.S. Pacific fleet, Adm. Gary Roughead, was in China overseeing the first ever joint exercise, scheduled to start Nov. 19, between the U.S. and Chinese navies.<br><br>"It's a modest search-and-rescue exercise, but it's a start ... so that we can move ahead from what I would characterize as kind of Cold War thinking," Fallon said.<br><br>Fallon has visited China three times since taking office about 18 months ago to boost contacts and reduce the potential for miscalculations.<br><br>Visits between the Chinese and American militaries dropped off after the collision of a U.S. spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet off China's coast in 2001 but relations have improved recently as Washington cautiously seeks to increase exchanges.<br><br>China declined an invitation to attend the Kuala Lumpur meeting, but Fallon said he was hopeful they would in the future.<br><br></div>

I think its fair game in International waters as long as no lives are endangered.<br><br>The Soviet Union and US often stalked each others warships during the cold war.  Even up to a point where they entered each others territorial waters.  But are the details of all these incidents concretely known today?  No.  Because both sides have relatively cool headed leaders who down play these incidents.<br><br>The Chinese however, don't seem to understand the concept of "keep it quiet."   What we now know, is a result of a Sub skipper who decided to surface his sub inside a carrier's defenses to make a point.<br><br>And how is that point taken? Its being interpreted to the American public as, "the Chinese are not interested in peace."  Does that serve to create warmer bilateral ties?  Does it take a step away from conflict?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The US has probably done a lot more stalking but the main diff is they know how to keep their mouths shut to avoid any incidents.  China however is only too keen to blab it out to the whole world.<br><br>I may spy on you but if no one knows about it, tough luck.  But if you spy on me &amp; then tell the whole world about it, that's an entirely different ball game.</div>
