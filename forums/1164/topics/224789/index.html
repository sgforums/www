The outer guardhouse the one beside the main road is manned by local singaporean guards or employees. they just conduct normal checking ur bags then u go thru the sensor. Walk a bit up the slope to the inner guardhouse. This one quite scary especially for a dude of my age. Inside all huge beefy, men in black type dudes. All US personnel, most of them i saw were Bruthas. But they didnt wear suits cos friday so wear polo tee i spose. All armed with side holster. They ask u go thru the sensor, empty everything out then use the handheld paddle over u. Then go forward so that another guy can pat u down. Imagine shortie speckie me being patted down by NFL size linebackers. Think if one of them chokeslam me at that time siow liao no chance ever for me to engage targets with my 'personal matador' hehe. Anyways after clearing it go to main foyer. They have the ubiquitous embassy marines in their famous peak cap, dress blue pants with red piping and khaki shirt and armed with side holsters too guarding the place. Saw a pair patrolling. Then have a few leatherneck inside this bulletproof glass booths usually in front of hallway leading to other wings of the place. Some hallways dont have. But now thinking back quite sober experience especially after watching bourne identity i think. Oh yeah and when ur standing on the main road boy it really looks a hell like a fortress lol. Aus high commission on the right, its on the left, cant imagine an infantry company assaulting it without air support.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Darkbaron:</div><div class="quote_body">From my experience a decade ago while during early teens, went to the embassy in singapore to do visa to go to states with my friend. The outer guardhouse the one beside the main road is manned by local singaporean guards or employees. they just conduct normal checking ur bags then u go thru the sensor. Walk a bit up the slope to the inner guardhouse. This one quite scary especially for a dude of my age. Inside all huge beefy, men in black type dudes. All US personnel, most of them i saw were Bruthas. But they didnt wear suits cos friday so wear polo tee i spose. All armed with side holster. They ask u go thru the sensor, empty everything out then use the handheld paddle over u. Then go forward so that another guy can pat u down. Imagine shortie speckie me being patted down by NFL size linebackers. Think if one of them chokeslam me at that time siow liao no chance ever for me to engage targets with my 'personal matador' hehe. Anyways after clearing it go to main foyer. They have the ubiquitous embassy marines in their famous peak cap, dress blue pants with red piping and khaki shirt and armed with side holsters too guarding the place. Saw a pair patrolling. Then have a few leatherneck inside this bulletproof glass booths usually in front of hallway leading to other wings of the place. Some hallways dont have. But now thinking back quite sober experience especially after watching bourne identity i think. Oh yeah and when ur standing on the main road boy it really looks a hell like a fortress lol. Aus high commission on the right, its on the left, cant imagine an infantry company assaulting it without air support.<br></div></blockquote>When i went to do visa in 2005. it was protected by Gurkha guards.. the main security gate was manned by civilian (loca) secruity guys... have to empty all pockets.. go through metal detector, no handphone allowed etc etc....<br><br>behind the gate is a Gurkha with a MP5.  I walk up that slope to the main entrance... no "Marines" visible at all...<br><br>I think i saw another Gurkha somewhere also...<br><br>The Gukhas are not visible from the street.. i guess either becuase it is "sensitive" that they have Singapore mecerancies guarding US embassy, or they do not want the Gukhas guards to be vulnerable to any sniper fire in the event of a real attack.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont think SG government is very concerned about the perception of hiring mercenaries for protection. Even LKY's house is protected by grukhas. and they are famed and reputed for loyalty. WW2 provides some instances.<br><br>Anyway, I have seen these ghrukas in their distinctive khaki headgear wielding Mp5s at the US embassy at the front gate.<br><br>Anyway, the embassy may not be as easy to attack. If you look at the embassy,  it IS a fortress. Talk about security i think no one does it better than the yanks. You have to hand it to them.</div>
