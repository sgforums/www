I'm no physicist, but this is what i figured. The instant u pull the trigger, the percussion cap is struck and the explosive force drives the round out the barrel. That instantaneous pop is what begins the recoil action.  The pressure will try to escape from the point of weakest resistance, so the "recoiling" feeling we feel is the pressure, pushing the bullet out of the barrel.  That recoil dies immediately as soon as the bullet exits the barrel cos the pressure is then escaping already.<br><br>the recoil dampner thing in the butt-spring in the M-16 is there to absorb the initial shock and push for every round fired.  Otherwise, it would be abit to fire the weapon rapidly if it was gonna disrupt the firer with recoil every single shot.<br><br>I think the newer sniper rifles such as the PSG-1 or Hecates have recoil-dampner things as well.</div>
