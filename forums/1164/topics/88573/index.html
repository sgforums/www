            <div class='col-md body'>When they announced the cutback to 2 NSF years, my initial instinct was that - somehow - it's still short of the whole story. It wasn't until following &amp; participating in Sardaukar's thread that things sorta begin crystallizing together, but I'll like to hear ersewhile opinions on this.<br><br>The new 3G army is partly based on the fact that Singapore will see a projected surge in enlistment intake (15-20% more troops annually) from 2006. If I assume the current full-time NSF strength to be, say, 30,000 - I've noted figures of 50,000 but those numbers seem to comprise regulars too - that means a yearly increase of some 4,500-6,000. Which, extrapolated out till the end of the baby boom, means an additional 45,000-60,000 after 10 years.<br><br>That's a sizeable percentage, raising on the current 250,000 reservist pool by, oh, at least 18% too (prior discounting of the pai-kah's, disruptees/deferees). Of course, the SAF can create a new combat division to absorb the troops, but that'll take a serious commitment. Imagine the new defence budgets, possibly beefing up the existing arsenal, renumerating make-up pay claims, etc.<br><br>With shorter NSF stints all around, the enlistees are also going to go into the reserves quicker. Does a shorter ICT cycle make more pragmatic assimiliation, given the various new conditions? My own experience also told me a reservist unit peaks around the 7th-8th ICT stage, or around age 28-30, before collective diminishing returns set in (even though we, when oldies, can retrain &amp; retrain to pass the respective proficiency tests).<br><br>Can we cut the training cycle down from 13 years to, for example, 9 years - with perhaps a corresponding readjustment of the high-key/low-key ICT ratio, &amp; also more reservist units - without losing overall combat-arms operational capacity?<br><br>Make sense?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The number of days of each ICT has actually shorten I think, based on each units own operation requirements. Not very sure. Shorten the 13 - year cycle sounds like a good idea, especially for NS men coming to the end of the cycle when the burden of work and family becomes heavier and your body becomes slower.<br><br>Hope Mindef can bring so gd news soon ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought it has been already shortend in some ways. Its now 7 high key, 3 low keys, 3 BITs. In the past, it was 9 high keys and 4 low keys. Perhaps MINDEF can reduce it further by doing away with the BITs, shortening the cycle to 10 years. There's nothing really much to do for BIT, except catching up with old buddies. My last BIT was just IPPT, vehicle mounting/dismounting drills, briefing, more briefing and watching videos, collect award, eat and sleep.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mea culpa. I just browsed thru Tim Huxley's book again &amp; it looks like I'm offbase on some gross figures.<br><br>He approximated our NSF personnel at 40,000 &amp; NSMen strength at 290,000-300,000, of whom "perhaps 180,000" are still in their 13-year cycle - both Year Y2K numbers. He also touched briefly on the annual 18-year-old "pools" &amp;, of them, those who were called up as NSF intakes. It's a different methodology but I don't think I'm far off on the expected Dragon-Year increase (probably additional 5,000 enlistees each year).<br><br>Thanks on the comments on the Basic Individual Training (B.I.T.), but isn't it still kinda half-half in purpose - given then the unit concerned would still be technically operational ready, even as it's basically given the green light to wind down over the final 3-year period of the cycle? Cut out that end, &amp; perhaps go with 6 high-key ICTs in a 9 year window.</div>

My unit has been together since our NS days - we even got best combat unit in the reserves, twice. And yes - we peak as a unit during the 6th and 7th year before moving to PDF after that. The last 3 years of ICT cycle for "BIT" is nothing more than a get together for old pals.<br><br>I say it depends on individual unit because some units are formed only during their first ICTs and are relatively "new". It would take a longer time for them to gel as a unit. Other units are already operational since their NS days.</div>
