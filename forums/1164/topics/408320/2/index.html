              <p>I think we are referring to different ones...</p>
              <p>Found an article on the one I was referring...original article
              by the Straits Times is not available anymore....I copy and paste
              from another forum...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>He is fined for defaulting on his NS after he decides to
              return, as his aged parents are finding it difficult to visit him
              in London<br> By Kristina Tom<br></strong><br> <br> AFTER staying away from Singapore for nearly 30 years because he
              defaulted on his national service, pianist Melvyn Tan has finally
              paid his dues.<br> <br> The 49-year-old, who has lived in the United Kingdom for the last
              37 years, has paid a fine for not fulfilling his national service
              duty and will be performing at the Esplanade next month.<br> <br> In an interview with The Sunday Times, a visibly relieved Mr Tan
              said that he is glad to have put the past behind him.<br> <br> He has not stepped onto Singapore soil all these years because he
              had feared that he would be arrested and thrown into jail.<br> <br> But his 86-year-old father and 80-year-old mother are getting too
              old to make the regular trips to London to visit him at his home in
              Notting Hill, London.<br> <br> So he decided to take a 'risk'. After informing the authorities of
              his intention to return, he came home in April for a court
              hearing.<br> <br> The hearing lasted 30 minutes but he had never been so nervous in
              his life. 'It was very, very nerve-wracking,' he said.<br> <br> To his relief, he was asked only to pay a fine.<br> <br> He claims that he cannot remember the amount.<br> <br> Under the Enlistment Act, those who evade national service can be
              fined up to $5,000 or sent to jail for up to three years, or
              both.<br> <br> Although Mr Tan became a British citizen in 1978, he was still a
              Singapore citizen when he failed to fulfil his NS duties, making
              him answerable for the offence in a Singapore court.<br> <br> In 1994, The Straits Times quoted a lawyer who said that one of his
              clients, a 39-year-old French citizen, was arrested at the airport
              on arrival, fined and made to complete nine months of
              training.<br> <br> Mr Tan, who has an elder sister, was studying at Anglo-Chinese
              School when he left Singapore to study at the Yehudi Menuhin School
              in Sussex. He was then 12 years old.<br> <br> After he finished his course, he stayed on in England to study at
              the Royal College of Music instead of coming home to serve national
              service in 1977.<br> <br> He said: 'When I was at the Royal College and I got my final
              call-up, I was just on the brink of starting a career. I thought
              about it and thought about it and realised that I was not going to
              get this chance again.<br> <br> 'So I made that very difficult decision to not return. It meant I
              could never come back.'<br> <br> Mr Tan first made his mark in the classical world with his
              performances on the 19th-century fortepiano, the precursor to the
              modern concert grand.<br> <br> In the 1980s and 1990s, he produced a series of recordings that
              popularised the early music movement, regarded as a slightly
              eccentric niche within the music world.<br> <br> He has about 30 recordings to his name and a regular touring
              schedule in Europe.<br> <br> Along with Seow Yit Kin and Margaret Leng Tan, he has helped
              Singapore to gain recognition on the global piano scene.<br> <br> The pianist is wasting no time in reconnecting with the Singapore
              music scene.<br> <br> He goes back to England tomorrow, but will return early next month
              to sit on the jury of the National Arts Council's biennial National
              Piano and Violin Competition, which starts Dec 7 and ends Dec
              18.<br> <br> He said that he is getting to know Singapore, which he describes as
              'unrecognisable', all over again. And, of course, he has been
              feasting on his favourite foods such as popiah.<br> <br> But the best part about being able to come home as a free man was
              showing up at his mother's 80th birthday party on Thursday.<br> <br> His parents still live in his childhood home in Lengkok Angsa, off
              Paterson Road. 'There were a few tears,' he said. 'She was just
              delighted. It was the best birthday present she's ever had.'<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:ktom@sph.com.sg">ktom@sph.com.sg</a></p>

              <p>romanian diplomat was different.he is wanted by interpol for taking lives n crime is viewed as worthy to be in interpol list...however even then they still cant bring him back immediately...the spore police dun have juristiction overseas....and he made himself famous b4 he left.</p>
              <p>what about the malaysian guy who fled across the causeway with no passport or anything after comitting a serious crime???he actually simply just walked across the causeway.....that sounds even easier leaving spore!</p>

              <p>It could well be that quick, fudge.  Years ago, I got a surprise phone call from an ex-classmate from secondary school.  He was a Filipino PR who had gone back to Manila at the age of 18 (his parents still stayed in Singapore) and returned three years later.  I said that we should catch up for a beer, and his reply was, "No can do - there's an MP standing right here who's about to take me to Khatib Camp". <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
