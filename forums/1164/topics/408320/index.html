              <p>Unless you left before age 11 and have renouced your citizenship, chances are you're screwed when you arrive. Good luck.</p>
              <p>"<em>National service-liable males who migrated from Singapore before age 11 and have not enjoyed significant socio-economic benefits of citizenship (e.g., applied for a Singapore identity card or studied in Singapore beyond the age of 11) are allowed to renounce their Singapore citizenship if they do not wish to fulfill their NS obligations. They will be required to register for national service with Central Manpower Base and apply for deferment from full-time NS until the age of 21, pending the renunciation of their Singapore citizenship. They can continue to make short social visits to Singapore and will not be required to serve NS if they renounced their citizenship at age 21. </em> </p>

              <p>if you want to completely skip NS, get ready to give up your Singapore Citizenship as Singapore doesn't allow dual citizenships, young adults reaching 21yrs old must decide which citizenship they want in life, if they want to stay as Singaporean, they must serve NS.</p>

              <p>As others have pointed out, if you had not renounced your citizenship before the age of 11, you're as good as screwed.</p>
              <p>The most likely scenario would be that you will be arrested at the airport and be charged in court. You can be jailed (though a fine is more likely) and you will be made to serve the 2 years of NS since you're not overaged. I'm not trying to scare you; I'm just stating the facts for what they are.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I seriously don't understand you. You say that you support NS, but in the very next sentence you say that it is against human rights. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>I think we are referring to different ones...</p>
              <p>Found an article on the one I was referring...original article by the Straits Times is not available anymore....I copy and paste from another forum...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>He is fined for defaulting on his NS after he decides to return, as 
              his aged parents are finding it difficult to visit him in London <br> By Kristina Tom<br> </strong><br> <br> AFTER staying away from Singapore for nearly 30 years because he 
              defaulted on his national service, pianist Melvyn Tan has finally paid 
              his dues.<br> <br> The 49-year-old, who has lived in the United Kingdom for the last 37 
              years, has paid a fine for not fulfilling his national service duty and 
              will be performing at the Esplanade next month.<br> <br> In an interview with The Sunday Times, a visibly relieved Mr Tan said that he is glad to have put the past behind him.<br> <br> He has not stepped onto Singapore soil all these years because he had feared that he would be arrested and thrown into jail.<br> <br> But his 86-year-old father and 80-year-old mother are getting too old to
               make the regular trips to London to visit him at his home in Notting 
              Hill, London.<br> <br> So he decided to take a 'risk'. After informing the authorities of his 
              intention to return, he came home in April for a court hearing.<br> <br> The hearing lasted 30 minutes but he had never been so nervous in his life. 'It was very, very nerve-wracking,' he said.<br> <br> To his relief, he was asked only to pay a fine.<br> <br> He claims that he cannot remember the amount.<br> <br> Under the Enlistment Act, those who evade national service can be fined 
              up to $5,000 or sent to jail for up to three years, or both.<br> <br> Although Mr Tan became a British citizen in 1978, he was still a 
              Singapore citizen when he failed to fulfil his NS duties, making him 
              answerable for the offence in a Singapore court.<br> <br> In 1994, The Straits Times quoted a lawyer who said that one of his 
              clients, a 39-year-old French citizen, was arrested at the airport on 
              arrival, fined and made to complete nine months of training.<br> <br> Mr Tan, who has an elder sister, was studying at Anglo-Chinese School 
              when he left Singapore to study at the Yehudi Menuhin School in Sussex. 
              He was then 12 years old. <br> <br> After he finished his course, he stayed on in England to study at the 
              Royal College of Music instead of coming home to serve national service 
              in 1977.<br> <br> He said: 'When I was at the Royal College and I got my final call-up, I 
              was just on the brink of starting a career. I thought about it and 
              thought about it and realised that I was not going to get this chance 
              again.<br> <br> 'So I made that very difficult decision to not return. It meant I could never come back.'<br> <br> Mr Tan first made his mark in the classical world with his performances 
              on the 19th-century fortepiano, the precursor to the modern concert 
              grand.<br> <br> In the 1980s and 1990s, he produced a series of recordings that 
              popularised the early music movement, regarded as a slightly eccentric 
              niche within the music world.<br> <br> He has about 30 recordings to his name and a regular touring schedule in Europe.<br> <br> Along with Seow Yit Kin and Margaret Leng Tan, he has helped Singapore to gain recognition on the global piano scene.<br> <br> The pianist is wasting no time in reconnecting with the Singapore music scene.<br> <br> He goes back to England tomorrow, but will return early next month to 
              sit on the jury of the National Arts Council's biennial National Piano 
              and Violin Competition, which starts Dec 7 and ends Dec 18.<br> <br> He said that he is getting to know Singapore, which he describes as 
              'unrecognisable', all over again. And, of course, he has been feasting 
              on his favourite foods such as popiah.<br> <br> But the best part about being able to come home as a free man was showing up at his mother's 80th birthday party on Thursday.<br> <br> His parents still live in his childhood home in Lengkok Angsa, off 
              Paterson Road. 'There were a few tears,' he said. 'She was just 
              delighted. It was the best birthday present she's ever had.'<br> <br> <a href="mailto:ktom@sph.com.sg">ktom@sph.com.sg</a></p>
