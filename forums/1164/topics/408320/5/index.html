I emigrated <span> </span>to Holland a few years ago to skip the National Service. I am not unsupportive of NS and I think it is a good training for young men and to serve the nation. But to force it upon us and leaves us with no alternatives, I think that really is against human rights. Anyways, <span> </span>I am coming back to SG this Wednesday to visit my family. Do you think I can fool the SG border control with my Dutch passport? Any advice is welcome!!!</span></span></p>

              <p>........well,,,,,dunno if the weichung dude was real or not .he could have not returned. perhaps one of his parents is still in spore.but he claimed he immigrated a few years ago which would only mean one of his parents was a dutch national.but how could he have been captured with his dutch biometric passport without digital fingerprints ??only the picture of his face.and a 19 year old would look different from a 21 yr old due to food in holland.</p>
              <p>then if he was captured....due to name n birthday ..he could always say airport has mistakened him for someone else.</p>
              <p>some stuff dun add up and perhaps he is too young to fight for himself.</p>

              <p>ged a life,</p>
              <p>it is supposed to be a piece of shit...but its not and looks like any standard car in spore.a 2001 sedan car looks 90% the same as a 2010 sedan car in australia.so im quite grateful it doesnt look like a shit with dents...im only worried after a year as i dun expect much from a car that costs $5k no matter how good it looks physically.pretty much like how a cdo guy or girl like u who looks he is dressed up with a $5k pearl necklace on rest days.its whats working on the inside that counts.</p>
              <p>anyway i bought it at a giveaway bargain ...it wuld cost around $8k but got it cheap.im just thankful and grateful for driving such a nice beautiful car with everything for $5k.</p>

              <p><br>most likely a sampan. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>Broken apart in the middle of the sea, so sampan became 'submarine' for a while, before he was saved (unfortunately) by some passing ship</p>
