              <ul>
              <li>a person adopted after majority in the Netherlands, the Dutch Antilles or Aruba by parents at least one of whom has Dutch nationality. </li>
              <li>married to or are the registered partner of a Dutch man or woman. If this is the case, the person can submit an application for naturalisation after 3 years of marriage or registered partnership and cohabitation. If the person has cohabited in the Netherlands with a Dutch man or woman (both partners unmarried) for an uninterrupted period of 3 years, an application may also be submitted. Note: this is true (in respect to marriage, partnership or cohabitation) if and only if in the last three years the applicant has continually lived together his/her partner inside the Netherlands. In case of marriage, it does not matter where this happened, i.e. inside and/or outside Dutch territories are both acceptable for married couples. As a rule of thumb, for each passed year, more than 6 months (per year) must have been spent under the same roof with that partner. <a class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow" href="http://ind.nl/nl/Images/5013_Ned_worden_tcm5-574.pdf"><span style="color: #3366bb;">[5]</span></a> <a class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow" href="http://ind.nl/nl/Images/bro_buitenland_tcm5-1844.pdf"><span style="color: #3366bb;">[6]</span></a> There is an extra clause, namely that the couple/partners has/have to remain living under the same roof for as long as the request for naturalization is being researched. </li>
              <li>the 5-year term is reduced to a 3-year term if the applicant is stateless. </li>
              <li>the 5-year term is reduced to a 3-year term if the applicant as a minor is acknowledged or legitimised by a Dutch national and has been cared for and brought up by this Dutch national for a period of 3 years. </li>
              <li>the 5-year term is reduced to a 2-year term if the applicant has legally lived in the Netherlands, the Dutch Antilles or Aruba for a period of 10 years, the last 2 of which uninterruptedly. </li>
              <li>a former Dutch subject. In some cases the applicant will instead be able to use the option procedure. </li>

              <p><span>Dutch exemptions to the residence
              requirement</span></p>
              <p>The 5-year residence requirement may not apply where the
              applicant falls into <strong>any</strong> of the following
              categories:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>a person adopted after majority in the Netherlands, the Dutch
              Antilles or Aruba by parents at least one of whom has Dutch
              nationality.</li>
              <li>married to or are the registered partner of a Dutch man or
              woman. If this is the case, the person can submit an application
              for naturalisation after 3 years of marriage or registered
              partnership and cohabitation. If the person has cohabited in the
              Netherlands with a Dutch man or woman (both partners unmarried) for
              an uninterrupted period of 3 years, an application may also be
              submitted. Note: this is true (in respect to marriage, partnership
              or cohabitation) if and only if in the last three years the
              applicant has continually lived together his/her partner inside the
              Netherlands. In case of marriage, it does not matter where this
              happened, i.e. inside and/or outside Dutch territories are both
              acceptable for married couples. As a rule of thumb, for each passed
              year, more than 6 months (per year) must have been spent under the
              same roof with that partner. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ind.nl/nl/Images/5013_Ned_worden_tcm5-574.pdf"><span style="color: #3366bb;">[5]</span></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ind.nl/nl/Images/bro_buitenland_tcm5-1844.pdf"><span style="color: #3366bb;">[6]</span></a> There is an extra clause, namely
              that the couple/partners has/have to remain living under the same
              roof for as long as the request for naturalization is being
              researched.</li>
              <li>the 5-year term is reduced to a 3-year term if the applicant is
              stateless.</li>
              <li>the 5-year term is reduced to a 3-year term if the applicant as
              a minor is acknowledged or legitimised by a Dutch national and has
              been cared for and brought up by this Dutch national for a period
              of 3 years.</li>
              <li>the 5-year term is reduced to a 2-year term if the applicant
              has legally lived in the Netherlands, the Dutch Antilles or Aruba
              for a period of 10 years, the last 2 of which uninterruptedly.</li>
              <li>a former Dutch subject. In some cases the applicant will
              instead be able to use the option procedure.</li>
