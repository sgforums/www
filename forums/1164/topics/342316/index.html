              <p>Do u think it is easy to get contract from UK?</p>
              <p>The ability of ST is beyond your imagination.It can give u a whole range</p>
              <p>of weapon from hand held small arms to IFV and armoured SPH!!</p>
              <p>http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/listing.aspx?pdtypeid=1</p>
              <p>Just look at Land System-----</p>

              <p>ST Kinetics' patented 120mm
                                      Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System (SRAMS) with delivery to be
                                      completed in 2011.<br> <br> <em>The SRAMS is the world's<span style="color: #ff0000;"> first and only</span> 120mm mortar system with a
                                      recoil load of less than <span style="color: #ff0000;">26 tonnes w</span>hen firing at maximum charge
                                      thus allowing it to be mounted onto a wide range of <span style="color: #ff0000;">light weight
                                      vehicles. </span>Â The low recoil force also allows for rapid shoot
                                      and scoot missions without the need for an out-rigger. Â It is
                                      equipped with an automatic round loader and has a high firing rate
                                      of ten rounds per minute hence enabling missions to be accomplished
                                      with fewer mortar systems.--EOQ</em></p>

              <p>i was hoping can get a 3 day streak of no lionnoisy nonsense. seems like lasted 2 days only.</p>
              <p>trust lionnoisy to turn a PATROL VESSEL deal into a contract for egyptian NAVY vessel.</p>
              <p>do you think the US would have awarded the contract to VT halter marine if the vessels were built in singapore ? since specs wise they are very similar to our MGB ?</p>
              <p>do you see the flaws in your logic ? will anyone believe your rah rah chest thumping ?</p>
              <p>you want to compare STK revenue and product lineup with the big boys ? have you any idea how much lockheed martin, Boeing, general dynamics or Bae systems makes ?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>what STK earns in revenue in a year, lockheed martin earns 1.5 times that amount in a quarter (after currency exchange factored in)</p>

              <p>like that singapore can magically have 10 % annual growth and escape recession at the end of the year. you might be incredibly retarded in that sense, or you could be a financial alchemist genius.</p>

              <p>which means by sept 28 2007, lockheed martin earned<strong> 2234 million dollars</strong> for that calender year (jan 1~ dec31st 2007)in profits after tax</p>
              <p>which means by sept 28 2008, lockheed martin earned <strong>2394 million dollars</strong> for that calender year (jan 1~ dec31st 2008) in profit after tax.</p>
              <p>so if this were a maths problem, the answer would be</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2,234 + X + 2,394 = Lockheed martin total profit from period Jan 01, 2007 to sept 28 2008</strong></span></p>
              <p>X being the amount of profit after taxes earned during the period from sept 29 ~ dec31st 2007.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>and oh btw, Lockheed martin earned<strong> 4, 628 million dollars (4.628 billion) </strong>even if using your screwed up method of counting. *</p>
              <p>*= revenue from jan 1 to sept 28 2007 + revenue from Jan 1 to sept 28 2008</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>for those who cant bother to read, this is official. this is big. LIONNOISY CANT COUNT :D</p>
              <p>hahahahaha</p>
              <p>simple addition also cannot do. i used to think you were a young punkass sec school kid. but now i realize you probably need to go back to kindergarden. your addition FAIL.</p>

              <p>actually i was the one who egged him into making the comparison.</p>
              <p>i posted the link on LHM's profits and challenged him to take the bait and reveal his intent.</p>
              <p>lionnoisy clearly isnt out for some logical comparion or reasoning. his sole purpose here is to troll and pump outÂ  a RAH RAH singapuRAH message.</p>
              <p>i baited him and he bought it hook line and sinker by saying that ST engineering is very good,blah-blah competent. etc. and he even tried to forge / spin the numbers (which are complete fabrications on his part btw)</p>
              <p>point i wanted to make is, irregardless of how diverse and how complicated STK's product range is, STK is still a kuching kurup in the global defence Pie.</p>
              <p>I have no doubts STK have their strengths and weaknesses with stakes distributed across the various defence sectors, its just that STK is still a small fish in a big ocean.</p>
              <p>good point about the bit of how much STK's products are actually technology transfers and how much is created or produced by local R&amp;D. but i promise you he wont get it. he'd just continue his rant about how we STK has mastered the art of "integrating weapons systems" or whatever he calls it.</p>

              <p>lionnoisy OBVIOUSLY fail reading comprehension in school.

              <p>for those text-challenged like lionnoisy, i shall post here in

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>wah lionnoisy, not enough with telling lies, now cooking up
              numbers too ? you'd make a fine banker lionnoisy. pluck out
              imaginary numbers and concoct them in your head is it ?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>and let me announce to you a new level of lionnoisy stupidity.
              cannot differentiate between 2/3 of a physical year profit ?</p>
              <p>lionnoisy said :</p>
              <p>FYI : no body counts income like based on 3 quarters and
              adjusted to one year. it is earnings as far as this 3Q that year.
              if everyone did like you did, means 4Q of the year can anyhow add
              and subtract figures to economic output ? lol.. wtf was that ? i
              cant imagine how stupid you can be.</p>
              <p>like that singapore can magically have 10 % annual growth and
              escape recession at the end of the year. you might be incredibly
              retarded in that sense, or you could be a financial alchemist
              genius.</p>
              <p>the 2007 figures arethere to compare and show improved
              performance above the previous year at that specific point in
              time.</p>
              <p>SELF-PWN +1<br> IGNORANCE +1<br> STUPIDITY OF LIONNOISY +X</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>and btw, even if i go by your stupid means of accounting, you
              still add wrongly.</p>
              <p>ild prove it right here :</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>which means by sept 28 2007, lockheed martin earned <strong>2234
              million dollars</strong> for that calender year (jan 1~ dec31st
              2007)in profits after tax</p>

              <p>ST is good to intergrate and make decisions pretty fast to

              <p>i give u pan chance. take it back before the MODs catch u for your classic OZ bashing and lock this thread</p>
              <p>in any case, collins class is beyond IOC and actually actively deployed. you might wanna do some reading up. IOC is ususally used to refer to the period in which crews are familiarized with the weapons platform and doctrines are put to the test in the initial deployment of the weapons platform. it usually refers to a period of sussing out the kinks and potential failures of a particular weapons system.</p>
              <p>and the wedgetail project isnt being handled in Australia. you clearly know this. it is being handled by boeing out of its seattle plant. delays if any, are due to boeing and northop gruman not getting their act together. what does this have to do with australia's technical competency ?</p>
              <p>country bashing again ? u really hate australia do you ?</p>
              <p>you might wanna do the reading up on your frigates as well. DSTA was responsible for the integeration. NOT STK. STK didnt exactly R&amp;D and create stealth technology as well. STK got a technology transfer from DCNS. the lead ship of the class isnt exactly manufactured by STK as well ainnit.</p>

              <p>actually i was the one who egged him into making the

              <p>i posted the link on LHM's profits and challenged him to take
              the bait and reveal his intent.</p>
              <p>lionnoisy clearly isnt out for some logical comparion or
              reasoning. his sole purpose here is to troll and pump outÂ  a
              RAH RAH singapuRAH message.</p>
              <p>i baited him and he bought it hook line and sinker by saying
              that ST engineering is very good,blah-blah competent. etc. and he
              even tried to forge / spin the numbers (which are complete
              fabrications on his part btw)</p>
              <p>point i wanted to make is, irregardless of how diverse and how
              complicated STK's product range is, STK is still a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> kuching kurup in
              the global defence Pie.</span></p>
              <p>I have no doubts STK have their strengths and weaknesses with
              stakes distributed across the various defence sectors, its just
              that STK is still a small fish in a big ocean.</p>
              <p>good point about the bit of how much STK's products are actually
              technology transfers and how much is created or produced by local
              R&amp;D. but i promise you he wont get it. he'd just continue his
              rant about how we STK has mastered the art of "integrating weapons
              systems" or whatever he calls it.</p>
              <p>he's quite phathetic really, living in his own little bubble</p>

              <p>i give u pan chance. take it back before the MODs catch u for
              your classic OZ bashing and lock this thread</p>
              <p>in any case, collins class is beyond IOC and actually actively
              deployed. you might wanna do some reading up. IOC is ususally used
              to refer to the period in which crews are familiarized with the
              weapons platform and doctrines are put to the test in the initial
              deployment of the weapons platform. it usually refers to a period
              of sussing out the kinks and potential failures of a particular
              weapons system.</p>
              <p>and the wedgetail project isnt being handled in Australia. you
              clearly know this. it is being handled by boeing out of its seattle
              plant. delays if any, are due to boeing and northop gruman not
              getting their act together. what does this have to do with
              australia's technical competency ?</p>
              <p>country bashing again ? u really hate australia do you ?</p>
              <p>you might wanna do the reading up on your frigates as well. DSTA
              was responsible for the integeration. NOT STK. STK didnt exactly
              R&amp;D and create stealth technology as well. STK got a technology
              transfer from DCNS. the lead ship of the class isnt exactly
              manufactured by STK as well ainnit.</p>

                                      significant expertise in this particular area. DSTO<br> worked closely in the program prior to contract signature, at the
                                      point in time that the requirements were developed, and has been
                                      engaged in the program sets. <span style="color: #ff0000;">MIT

                                      independent assessment. That will be important for us to understand

              <p>why cannot acknowledge that SG is an ANCHOVIE ( ps i forgot your INGRISH not so good, IKAN BILIS)Â  in the global defence market ? wanna compare with ISRAEL ? approximately same size population, but much larger and better defence industry.</p>
              <p>Isarel has its fingers in armour (merkava) to UAVs (elbit , IAI) and even aircraft (LAVI project) . WHY SINGAPORE DONT HAVE <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/sunglasses.png" alt="sunglasses.png"> ?</p>

              <p>what they screw up with their Kama SH-2 Seasprite has anything to do with me ? must i bear the blame if they screw up their own program ?</p>
              <p>FYI, your beloved pegasus only came about after SAF acquired a m777 from BAE for testing and evaluation in the 90s.</p>
              <p>our bionix also came about after SAF evaluated several IFV platforms like the bradley and the marder for local needs.</p>
              <p>read between the lines and piece the puzzle together yourself. Its an open secret that our Bionix was designed and manufactured based on the thorough evaluation of the best IFVs avalaible to us in the market.</p>
              <p>likewise, the Pegasus's appearance in the immediate aftermath of the m777 raise a few eyebrows.</p>
              <p>its quite clear even if they are not carbon copies, the engineering for both weapon platforms can be loosely said to have been "inspired" by existing products within the marketplace.</p>
              <p>and i m not even going to mention the Bronco , BV206 connection here. Bae Hagglunds thought the Bronco ripped the Bv206 off enough that it sued STK. that alone pretty much explains everything.</p>

                          			simulator, installed at RAAF Base Williamtown, in July.<br> <br> Customer acceptance of the first two aircraft isnât planned until 
                          			March 2009, with the first two aircraft to form the basis for crew 
                          			training, Deeble said. Australia will declare initial operational 
                          			capability once the crews are trained, which is typically 18 months 
                          			after aircraft acceptance, he added. </span></p>

              <p><em>âSenior military officers have admitted the prime contractor, US
                          giant Boeing, and its sub-contractors have no idea how to fix the main

              </blockquote>
              <p>so now you want to blame Australia and attack australia's competency and defence industry because of an problems with the MESA radar being built by northrop grumman ?</p>
              <p>MIT was engaged to conduct an independent review of problems with the radar and to explain it to the ADF. which is actually a really smart thing to do. because if ADF finds out that Boeing or Northrop Grumman is screwing up or delaying the integreation process out of their own incompetency,Â  ADF stands to get additional compensation on top of the 200 something million that boeing has paid them.</p>
              <p>note the part about DSTO having evaluated the MESA's radar performance up to contract signing</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em> DSTO worked closely in the program prior to contract signature, at the
                                                  point in time that the requirements were developed, and has been
                                                  engaged in the program sets</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>which leads to the following conclusion</p>
              <p>(i) MESA radar performance not up to contract requirements set by DSTO<br>(ii) integreation issues by contractor, BOEING, Northorp grumman and BOEING australia<br>(iii) MIT's role is to investigate and find out why is the MESA radar not performing up to requirements and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>who or what</strong></span></span> is causing the fall in performance.</p>
              <p>please learn to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>read</strong></span></span> the the article first. It is questioning the efficiency of the integreation process and how it might delay the delivery of the aircraft and affect the radar's performance</p>

              <p>oh yeah, collins class sub. dont worry. collins class sub is operational. i cant figure out why only you cant get it.</p>
              <p>everyone else does.</p>
              <p>you want to quibble over semantics ? over operational release ? FYI, Collins class has been in service since the 1990s and you know that link you provided is the shipyard that produced the collins class right ?</p>
              <p>i guess it would be just atypical of you to conveniently leave this out :</p>

              <p><br>The sixth Collins Class submarine - HMAS <em>Rankin</em> - was delivered to the RAN on 26 March 2003. Â This marked the end of ASC's Submarine Build contract for the Collins Class.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>cant see the connection ? RAN commission the last sub in 26 march 2003. with about 1 year for the ship to pass initial operating tests , criteria and familiarization for the crew before the boat can be considered operationally ready.</p>
              <p>which is whyÂ  RAN can declare that ASC is operationally release on the 4 marchÂ  2004?</p>

              <p>their FXXXING operational release (quoting you here) means, ASC has completed the contract for the collins class and is released from any liabilities ensuing or related to the production of the collins class boats.</p>
              <p>it is the MANUFACTRER being officialy told by RAN that its released from liability in relation to its duties specified in the collins class contract.</p>
