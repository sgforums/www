            <div class='col-md body'>Been reading about  "militia" type forces in the history of warfare.  Our military concept of civilian forces is what people in history will call militia forces. From my reading of various wars and incidents, one common thing occurs.  It appears to me that militia forces suffer initial setbacks more frequently than regular forces. It could be that the initial "shock" of going into combat unnerves mobilised civilians more than a regular soldier.<br><br>However, militia forces in a long campaign, start to show the advantages of initiative, intelligence and flexibility/ adaptability. Militia forces have defeated regular troops soundly in many battles but usually only after the initial setbacks.<br><br>It would appear to me that the SAF chances of winning a conflict is to be the one who chooses the time to strike and where to strike. It is more than just operationally ready at the soldier level. Like one of the replies I saw, it is more than just waking up and brushing teeth and changing into your no.4 and reporting for duty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not doubt the operation readiness of our navy, very impressive thus far.<br><br>As for the army, the operation readiness amongst the active units are good too (those who went thru full equip stand by would understand). However, they only a small fraction of our army, as NS (reservist) units still made up of our main fighting force. talking in terms of COMBAT operation readiness.<br><br>IMO, the operation readiness of NS units are questionable. I referring more to reaction time and equiping. Think in terms of planning, ind / bn / brigade / div level training &amp; tactics, logistics we are pretty good for a civilian army. We all know the good points so i'll focus  only on what i preceived as major weakness impeding our ops readiness.<br><br>Equipment:<br>There's also seem to be in shortage of equipment, always t loan here and there during standby and exercise. Wonder what happens if we start recalling 10 reservist battelion at the same time, not forgeting the brigade and supporting units, division elements. guess $$$, life span and maint. of eqiup  will be a concern.<br><br>Reaction time:<br>Think a bit wayang at times. Who here never got prior warning before standby? How soon during war times will only brothers, fathers, mates report back in a timing manner, we will never know i guess.<br><br>Nonetheless, these are not unqiue problems, US National guards faced to same problem too. Well, if we compare ourselves against our neighbours, i guess we are still much better * fingers crossed *<br><br>Btw, not sure if the refief effort in Aceh is a good reflection of COMBAT operation readiness. They are not eqiuped for full battle order.</div>

Talking to some Indonesian BREMOB (self defence forces), more like our "Ang chia" or Police Tactical teams, more tougher than our regulars. The Col has combat experience during 'konfrantasi', others in E Temor or Irian Jaya or Aceh (beofre present calamity). What they lack in equipment, service support, and technical expertise, they more than make up for in toughness, endurance, patience and numbers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I guess SAF knew the inherent weakness of a citizen army. People are already not too happy to go for ICT, so there is so much that SAF can do.  Perhaps, the reason why we have so many tanks and fighter jets is to make up for the weaknesses mentioned.  Just hope that our Navy will get new subs and helos and replace the MCVs to enhance our defense further.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Morale, physical fitness, mental readiness... issues there always will be. I have some Isreali friends who also say the same thing about their equivalent of reservist training and IPPT.  They also have their problems about obese soldiers, unfit chaps who fail PT etc etc. And they are the ones who deploy reservists in frontline actions. At the end of the day, I suspect unfitness and poor morale will be compensated by other factors.<br><br>For the average Soldier, he is not going to be a SAS or SEAL trooper, marching under stress for miles and miles and then expected to storm a building and shoot "one-shot- one -kill" tactics. The average infantry man will face long quiet periods and then intense action for a few hours.  Whether he is a marathon runner or a chap who does his physical training only one week before IPPT , I think it is not going to make that much of a difference.<br><br></div>

However, they only a small fraction of our army, as NS (reservist) units still made up of our main fighting force. talking in terms of COMBAT operation readiness.<br><br>IMO, the operation readiness of NS units are questionable. I referring more to reaction time and equiping. Think in terms of planning, ind / bn / brigade / div level training &amp; tactics, logistics we are pretty good for a civilian army. We all know the good points so i'll focus  only on what i preceived as major weakness impeding our ops readiness.<br><br>Equipment:<br>There's also seem to be in shortage of equipment, always t loan here and there during standby and exercise. Wonder what happens if we start recalling 10 reservist battelion at the same time, not forgeting the brigade and supporting units, division elements. guess $$$, life span and maint. of eqiup  will be a concern.<br><br>Reaction time:<br>Think a bit wayang at times. Who here never got prior warning before standby? How soon during war times will only brothers, fathers, mates report back in a timing manner, we will never know i guess.<br><br>Nonetheless, these are not unqiue problems, US National guards faced to same problem too. Well, if we compare ourselves against our neighbours, i guess we are still much better * fingers crossed *<br><br>Btw, not sure if the refief effort in Aceh is a good reflection of COMBAT operation readiness. They are not eqiuped for full battle order.</div></blockquote>I agree. SAF's ops readiness in deployment to Aceh, regardless of motive, make me proud to be Singaporean. Majulah Singapura!</div>
