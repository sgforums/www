Talking to some Indonesian BREMOB (self defence forces), more like our "Ang chia" or Police Tactical teams, more tougher than our regulars. The Col has combat experience during 'konfrantasi', others in E Temor or Irian Jaya or Aceh (beofre present calamity). What they lack in equipment, service support, and technical expertise, they more than make up for in toughness, endurance, patience and numbers.</div></blockquote>Bremob is their Police Mobile Brigade force. More like a police field force for internal security and counter-insurgency. They lost over 600 men and family members to the tsunami, according to my Indonesian friend.</div>

However, they only a small fraction of our army, as NS (reservist) units still made up of our main fighting force. talking in terms of COMBAT operation readiness.<br><br>IMO, the operation readiness of NS units are questionable. I referring more to reaction time and equiping. Think in terms of planning, ind / bn / brigade / div level training &amp; tactics, logistics we are pretty good for a civilian army. We all know the good points so i'll focus  only on what i preceived as major weakness impeding our ops readiness.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Equipment:</span><br>There's also seem to be in shortage of equipment, always t loan here and there during standby and exercise. Wonder what happens if we start recalling 10 reservist battelion at the same time, not forgeting the brigade and supporting units, division elements. guess $$$, life span and maint. of eqiup  will be a concern.<br><br>Reaction time:<br>Think a bit wayang at times. Who here never got prior warning before standby? How soon during war times will only brothers, fathers, mates report back in a timing manner, we will never know i guess.<br><br>Nonetheless, these are not unqiue problems, US National guards faced to same problem too. Well, if we compare ourselves against our neighbours, i guess we are still much better * fingers crossed *<br><br>Btw, not sure if the refief effort in Aceh is a good reflection of COMBAT operation readiness. They are not eqiuped for full battle order.</div></blockquote>Those equipment are only cater for training/active purposes, ever try a Full Equiping Mobilization before? Then you will know that you don't draw weapons etc from the Armskote instead all come from boxes and newly wrap...</div>

Seen my weapon and stuff allocation some time ago. It's brand new. Not the ones that you draw from the armskote room, which have loose barrels, black finish wearing to shiny metal and scratched butts etc etc.<br><br>Lots of wrapping plastic and grease. On the same subject, about carbine, I was allocated a carbine and pistol.</div>
