              <p>Dear EAC,</p>
              <p>Dear all who can help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just attended my Permanent Disability Board.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am PES C2L2 for RSD </p>
              <p>My condition is Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy on my right foot.</p>
              <p>doctor told me the best they could give me was 1% disability compensation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but seriously? 1%?</p>
              <p>my underneath of my feet hurts when i walk.</p>
              <p>i have to be on medication for the pain to reduce or go away.</p>
              <p>constant pain when walking and i was given only 1% .</p>
              <p>reason being doctor said there is no medical science to prove this case, something like that. so according to guidelines can only give that much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i factured my foot, after recovering from the fractures, i have been feeling pain for 2 years underneath my feet.</p>
              <p>so, is 1% really enough as compensation?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i didnt argue because i knew it'd be useless to do so.</p>
              <p>so instead i just agreed.</p>
              <p>he told me HR will contact me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my question is:</p>
              <p>1) can i still fight my case? 1% i feel is too little for a constant hurting feet</p>
              <p>2) how to fight for my case? i have ORD afew months back.</p>
              <p>3) if i have no choice but to accept the 1%, can i proceed to claim from Aviva ?  since i was covered under Aviva also during the time of injury. and how to go about doing this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks all. please help. i am confused whether to accept the 1% which is like few k? or fight again.</p>

If you sustained an injury during ICT, you are required to report immediately to your unit’s Medical Officer and unit S1. This is so that your unit can arrange to attend to your injury, and document your injury sustained in your medical docket.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Before MINDEF determines that an injury is attributable to service, you are responsible for bearing all medical expenses.

Eligibility for disability compensation will be based on the degree of residual permanent disability as endorsed by the SAF Medical Board.<br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">If your service injury requires continuous medical or hospitalisation leave beyond your ICT period, you are eligible for a stepped-down compensation as a form of ex-gratia payment. Compensation will be based on your civilian pay or an equivalent regular serviceman’s pay (whichever is higher) if you do not receive any income from your employers. This ex-gratia payment is compensation for your loss of income during this period. Payment will cease when you are no longer on medical/hospitalisation leave or when disability compensation is paid, whichever is earlier.</span></p>

There will be an administrative charge of $15 for each replacement of lost or defaced SI Card. He will need to make the payment via MINDEF Cashier / Internet and submit the receipt to the unit PMC before he will be issued a new SI Card.<br><br>While waiting for the SI Card to be issued or replaced, the serviceman may approach the respective PMCs for the issuance of the SI Memo (a temporary identification document) for the fully-subsidised medical treatment.</span></p>

              <p>The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) is enhancing its insurance coverage 
              scheme aimed at encouraging its employees and Singapore Armed Forces 
              (SAF) active servicemen to secure a minimum level of insurance 
              protection for themselves. This initiative, which takes effect from 1 
              January 2009, will be extended to all MINDEF employees and SAF regulars 
              who are 45 years old and below, and full-time National Servicemen 
              (NSFs). The scheme will provide insurance protection against personal 
              accidents in daily life.<br> <br> This opt-out insurance coverage plan rides on the existing SAF Group 
              Term Life insurance scheme, which has been available to SAF personnel 
              since 1983. For a monthly premium of $12.80, MINDEF employees and SAF 
              personnel who are eligible will be insured for a sum of $100,000, unless
               they opt out of the scheme. To help full-time National Servicemen 
              (NSFs) pay for the monthly premium, all NSFs will receive a $20 increase
               in their monthly allowance from 1 January 2009 onwards.</p>
              <p>With effect from 1 January 2009, all MINDEF employees and Singapore 
              Armed Forces (SAF) active servicemen will be automatically insured for 
              $100,000. This initiative, which rides on the existing SAF Group Term 
              Life (GTL) Insurance scheme, is aimed at encouraging them to have a 
              minimum level of insurance protection for themselves.<br> <br> For a monthly premium of $12.80, all eligible MINDEF employees, regular 
              servicemen who are 45 years old and below, and full-time National 
              Servicemen (NSFs), who do not opt out of the scheme will be insured for 
              the sum of $100,000. The insurance coverage will provide protection 
              against personal accidents in daily life.<br> <br> <strong>SAF GTL Insurance Scheme<br> </strong><br> The SAF GTL insurance scheme is a voluntary life and personal accident 
              insurance scheme that has been available to SAF active servicemen and 
              Operationally Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) since 1983.<br> <br> Features of the SAF GTL include:<br> <br> â—� <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Low cost and affordability.</span> MINDEF/SAF is able to leverage on 
              its large population base to negotiate the best terms and rates for its 
              employees and personnel.<br> <br> â—� <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Portability.</span> MINDEF and SAF personnel can continue to enjoy the
               coverage even after they leave service, as long as they pay their 
              premiums. Insurance coverage will continue up to age 65 based on the 
              prevailing premium. From age 66-70, the premium will be based on a 
              different prevailing rate every year.<br> <br> <strong>Increase in NSF allowance<br> </strong><br> With the introduction of the SAF GTL opt-out $100,000 insurance 
              coverage, MINDEF will increase the monthly allowance of NSFs by $20 to 
              help them pay for the monthly premium. The increase in NSF allowance 
              takes effect from 1 January 2009.</p>
