            <div class='col-md body'>We got a Army Ghost story thread, why not a police one? Police TRACOM at Thomson Rd is famous for its supernatural residents too.<br><br>Anyway, it is important to document it down as TRACOM will be shifted to Chua Chu Kang in afew years time.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I did my PNS training years ago, Charlie coy barracks. The place famous for dirty things due to the former presence of the infamous 'Black Museum' on level 2. Let just say during my BMT stay there, there were afew cases of possessions, hauntings and other sightings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Get this.<br><br>Was taking a cab to the airport one day. Met this taxi driver, showed me his picture. He was some high ranking guy in the PF. Told me that he was involved in the Adrain Lim case. He said that they actually saw him move his "soul" or "conscious" being away during interrogation stage. They has to get some badge (I think it is either Singapura one or the PM's, cant remember well) to put it on him to prevent him from doing it.<br><br>Also said that some ancient trees cannot be removed or chopped. Sure have accidents one. But when the PM sign on its removal, then everything is fine.<br><br>Make sense in the Chinese belief. Says that a genuine leader of the land (Zhen Min Tian Ze) really has live or die authority (Sheng Sha Da Quan) across the people and things he presides upon. Maybe that is why his approval works when things become too fishy for normal dealings.<br><br>On the other hand, if someone who is not meant to be in charge accidently holds the reins (e.g. President of ROC), then there will be funny things happening in his land - note the chaos of their parliament and all the bureacratic cock-ups plus the earthquakes and floods.

            <div class='col-md body'>okay think i'll help out here abit. been in the police academy for the past 5months and i've had my share of experiences and stories to tell =P<br><br>for starters, theres this really old tree between the echo and delta company. funny thing bout this tree is that theres a well right in the middle of it. kinda looks like the one right out from 'the ring' and it gives you a really eerie feeling everytime you look at it, even during the day. apparently, one of my friends living at the delta block witnessed an individual climb onto a chair and throw herself into the well, this was around 12midnight.<br><br>another thing about PA is that its quite common to hear things moving in the trees when your walking alone at night.. thats why, word of advice to those getting posted to police, try not to walk alone =) there was this once i was on my way to the guardroom to report for sentry duty, this was around 8pm and it was pretty deserted already. while toying around with my baton (i was pretending to hit something), i heard somebody behind me running towards me.. then a loud female scream. but there was no one there, till now i don't know where that came from.<br><br>of all the spooky places i've been to, none beats the PA clinic. this building hasn't been in use for sometime, how long i don't know. it looks really old, like those old buildings you see in chinatown. in the day the clinic looks okay, but at night the place totally radiates an evil atmosphere.. in fact if you look from afar, the whole place around it seems to be greenish, kinda like an aura.. step inside and theres this room padlocked with the lights on..whats strange is that it only turns on at night. unfortunately, i haven't heard of any sightings yet. perhaps some brave soul will pay a visit there and maybe spend the night? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>theres also other common stuff like seeing figures walking around in the ajoining room, waking up ouside the barracks, having people knock your windows at night, seeing figures fly past your window, female voices whispering in your ear, babies crying downstairs, oh yeah and most commonly.. beds shaking at night when you don't sleep. experienced it myself a couple of times.<br><br>p.s ill try and take pictures next week of all all the sites i've mentioned when im back in camp. =)<br><br></div>
