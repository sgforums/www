            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.inetres.com/gp/military/infantry/rifle/M107_left.gif"><br><br>(Source: US Army; issued March 31, 2005)<br><br>PICATINNY ARSENAL, N.J. --- The Army has approved its new long-range .50-caliber sniper rifle, the M-107, for full materiel release to Soldiers in the field.<br><br>The M-107 program is managed at Picatinny Arsenal, N.J., by the Project Manager Soldier Weapons with engineering support provided by PicatinnyÂ’s Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center.<br><br>The term Â“full materiel releaseÂ” signifies that the Army has rigorously tested and evaluated the item and determined that it is completely safe, operationally suitable and logistically supportable for use by Soldiers, officials said.<br><br>Product Manager for Crew Served Weapons Lt. Col. Kevin P. Stoddard said that PMSW previously equipped combat units in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as other units supporting the Global War on Terrorism, with the M-107 under an urgent materiel release.<br><br>The Army expects to complete fielding of the M-107 in 2008, Stoddard said.<br><br>The M107 was funded as a Soldier Enhancement Program to type classify a semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle for the Army and other military services. It underwent standard type classification in August 2003.<br><br>A production contract was awarded to Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Inc., Murfreesboro, Tenn., the following month.<br><br>Compared to the M24 7.62mm sniper rifle, Stoddard said, the M107 has more powerful optics and fires a variety of .50 caliber munitions.<br><br>Â“This provides sniper teams greater capability to identify and defeat multiple targets at increased ranges,Â” he said.<br><br>The M-107 is based on the Marine Corps special application scoped rifle, the M82A3.<br><br>The M-107 enables Army snipers to accurately engage personnel and material targets out to a distance of 1,500 to 2,000 meters respectively, he said.<br><br>The weapon is designed to effectively engage and defeat materiel targets at extended ranges including parked aircraft, computers, intelligence sites, radar sites, ammunition, petroleum, oil and lubricant sites, various lightly armored targets and command, control and communications.<br><br>In a counter-sniper role, the system offers longer stand-off ranges and increased terminal effects against snipers using smaller-caliber weapons.<br><br>The complete system includes the rifle itself, a detachable 10-round magazine, a variable-power day-optic sight, a transport case, a tactical soft case, cleaning and maintenance equipment, a detachable sling, an adjustable bipod and manuals.<br><br>The Army plans to modify the M107 in the future by adding a suppressor to greatly reduce flash, noise and blast signatures.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure whether it is the same weapon , but it was reported that SEAL has chosen the AI's AS50 Semi-Automatic Rifle.<br><br><blockquote>The boys at NSWC Crane (Crane Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana) have apparently been busy little beavers over there. One of the projects they've been working on is this little .50 BMG badboy. It's called the AS50 Semi-Automatic Rifle, and it's the result of NSWC Crane's teaming with Accuracy International (AI).<br><br>At approx. 27 pounds empty/dry weight (according to the AI representative at their booth), the AI AS50 is relatively lightweight. DefenseReview got a chance to handle it (and lift it) at its SHOT Show 2005 debut, and was surprised by how light it felt, for a semi-auto .50 caliber rifle. One of the pictures DefRev shot at SHOT (which we will be releasing soon) shows...<br><br>three targets, each shot at 100 meters. On all three targets, all the rounds are touching.</blockquote><img src="http://img178.exs.cx/img178/1091/ai14ht.jpg"><br><br>But based on the drawing I think it look a bit more like this:<br><br><img src="http://world.guns.ru/sniper/barett_m82a3_1.jpg"><br><br>M82A3 rifle, also known as M82A1M, latest version developed for US Army. Note the long Picatinny rail on the top of the receiver.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The websites didn't mentioned anything about how they are deployed though. Seriously doubt that they can be carried in 2 men teams like in MG teams. I mean judging by the size of the weapon and the ammo, i can safely say it is at least 2 times the weight of the MG plus ammo! Maybe they are carried by vehicle to a place near the odjective then they dismount to find a suitable site to attack armoured vehicles just like in anti-personnel sniper teams. Just that now they are sniping vehicles! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
