The price is affordable, (as compared to the Stinger) and from what I've heard from my friend in the ADA, they are going to, or have already begun licence-production of the Igla in S'pore.

And it can actually be used to hit high altitude "rockets".<br><br>By the way, if there are enemy aircrafts flying over or doing CAS continuously here in our motherland, it meant one thing, OUR mighty AIRFORCE HAS FAILED in their quest to maintain AIR supremancy. So it doesn't really matter what SAM systems we have, becos we should then be already losing our cutting edge over our "enemy"!!!<br><br>My 2 cents worth...<br><br></div></blockquote>i would for one... hold back RSAF and let RMAF come and kill themselves admist SADA's  defence wall...<br><br>then .. once.. they limited fighters are depleted... we can send RSAF in....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

We simply have more than enough jets to pound our enemy on the ground and in the air i would say, so we still have some more for CAP at the borders rite?<br><br>and i think that the purchase of the Igla is for forging ties... defence ties. If Igla is really so cheap like u guys say, then maybe our government is thinking that spending a little money on "not so capable" weapons is worth it for future larger contracts? U guys get wad i mean? hee. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   i mean... maybe the government is laying the groundwork for more purchase of russian equipment next time...more clearer now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> But Igla also not bad wad... if it is included in armour. BTW... Malaysians have attack helicopter anot? i think last time i heard ppl from here saying that Malaysians operates the Eurocopter Tiger or some South African helicopter rite??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
