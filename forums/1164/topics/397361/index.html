              more on the whose point of view really matters spin since the wikileaks. imho the pt of view that mattered in the end were the kids caught in the shitstorm.
              
              
              
              http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/04/2007-iraq-apache-attack-as-seen-from-the-ground/
              
              some quotes:
              
              "McCord, who served seven years in the military before leaving in the summer of 2009 due to injuries, recently posted an apologetic letter online with fellow soldier Josh Steiber supporting the release of the video and asking the familyâ€™s forgiveness. McCord is the father of three children."
              
              "So, the first thing I did was grab the girl. I grabbed the medic and we went into the back. Thereâ€™s houses behind where the van was. We took her in there and weâ€™re checking to see if there were any other wounds. You can hear the medic saying on the video, â€œThereâ€™s nothing I can do here, she needs to be evacâ€™d.â€� He runs the girl to the Bradley. I went back outside to the van, and thatâ€™s when the boy took, like, a labored, breath. Thatâ€™s when I started screaming, â€œThe boyâ€™s alive! The boyâ€™s alive!â€� And I picked him up and started running with him over to the Bradley. He opened his eyes when I was carrying him. I just kept telling him, â€œDonâ€™t die; donâ€™t die.â€� He looked at me, then his eyes rolled back into this head."
              
              "I doubt that they were a part of that firefight. However, when I did come up on the scene, there was an RPG as well as AK-47s thereâ€¦. You just donâ€™t walk around with an RPG in Iraq, especially three blocks away from a firefightâ€¦. Personally, I believe the first attack on the group standing by the wall was appropriate, was warranted by the rules of engagement. They did have weapons there. However, I donâ€™t feel that the attack on the [rescue] van was necessary.
              
              Now, as far as rules of engagement, [Iraqis] are not supposed to pick up the wounded. But they could have been easily deterred from doing what they were doing by just firing simply a few warning shots in the directionâ€¦. Instead, the Apaches decided to completely obliterate everybody in the van. Thatâ€™s the hard part to swallow."
