            <div class='col-md body'>its no really so much about how many hours u have,<br>yes the flying hours count when it comes to airmanship, decision making and all.<br>but military flying is different from civilian flying.<br>i had a friend who had a CPL but he failed his basic flying training.<br>why? too many bad habits. tried to rely too much on his things he learnt while doing his private licence.<br>even ppl with zero flying experience can become fighter pilots, its juz the aptitude that one possesses..</div>

Fighter flying, u have a bubble canopy.<br>hahaha...<br>Juz go for it. for the record. in a class of 30, most prob, about 5 will make it.<br>And im not talking about airgrading. im talking about those who pass air grading. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Just because your friend can get driving licence and drive modified EVO it does not mean he can qualify to be in next year's F1 series.<br><br>Civilian flying is fly alone... military is flying as a team with the other aircraft types, army and navy too.<br><br>Civilian flying is like driving a bus. Military flying is like flying a launching platform for weapons as in the case of the fighter jets.<br><br>Met alot of fighter pilots in my life.... they all possess that X factor... which is like having the ability to think very fast and quick reactions, and they plan and execute their plans to work in a 3 dimensional world.<br><br>Flying hours logged from an airborne lawn mower does not count towards the X factor. I have met alot pilots who when you meet them, do not come across like fighter pilots but rather more like ah bengs... but damn they are bloody good in what they do.<br><br>Your friend want to become a fighter pilot because of the money, status or the passion for flying?? The first 2 is of no use.... the last one counts towards the X factor.<br><br>Just my old 2 cents worth.</div>
