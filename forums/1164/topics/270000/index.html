            <div class='col-md body'>Found an old funny pic of the M71 during my NS days.   The pic was taken by the gun commander in Thailand (or is it Taiwan).   Guaranteed that you have never seen anything like it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://i9.tinypic.com/4za8hnn.jpg"><br><br>An agressive enemy ant bit his ass.   He decided to blow the ant away.   However, the barrel cannot be depressed enough so he got the gunners to lift the trail to lower the barrel.   He didn't get to blast the ant - it was crushed by the barrel.   Mission accomplised without a shot being fired <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just joking!</div>

When fired, the gun rocked (the barrel moves down, trail up, then barrel up , trail down) a few times.

By the short barrel length?  This particular gun had characteristics of both M68 and M71.   The short barrel length of the M68 and the pneumatic rammer of the M71.

What is not obvious here is that the incident was in an active unit .where such practices were not allowed.   I can testify to the fact that standard textbook procedure taught in SOAY (School of Arty) was used - I was there.   Anyway, a controller from SOAY was there to ensure that things were done properly.</div>
