After that go to arts friends, buy pastel chalk. To simulate mud, mix acrylic clear to some brown pastel chalk powder den brush on the tracks. To simulate dust, just brush chalk powder on the tracks den seal with matt spray.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Unidentified, to paint a good set of tank tracks, you have to understand the kind of abuse they go through. Here is what I usually do...<br><br>As Centurion has said, first paint them in Gun Metal, as they are made of steel. Second, wash rust colour onto the nooks and crannies of the tracks, as rust tends to gather on these areas since moisture gets trapped there and theres no contact with the ground during movemen .<br><br>Next, wash (yes wash not dry brush) a layer of soil/mud colour onto the tracks. Washing will ensure that the soil/mud looks like it got onto the nooks and crannies of the track instead of sticking to the surface which is what happens.<br><br>Finally, using silver, dry brush the track guides and the portions of the track links that jut out, because on the real thing these same portions come into contact against hard ground and road and tend to become polished and smooth.<br><br>Tedious? You bet. But from my NS days, thats what I observed on the tracks of  tanks/AFVs that have been used.<br><br>You can try pastel chalks that Centurion suggested, but my personal preference is Gunze's acrylic weathering line, which includes colours like rust/mud/sand etc. Because these paints come with pigments inside that when dry, gives the weathered models the 'feel' of the real thing (run your finger along a part painted with Gunze's Rust and it feels like the part has really rusted)</div>

As safe as splashing water on the paint layer.<br><br>It is safe for both lacquer and enamel based paint.<br><br>As a general thumb of rule,<br>You may spray acrylic paint/thinner over anything<br><br>Enamel paint  and be sprayed over both acrylic and lacquer.<br>Enamal thinner will eat into cured enamal paint and sometimes into acrylic paints. So if you want to do enamal washing on enamal and acrylic surfaces, spray gloss coat first.<br><br>Lacquer is the worst. You cannot spray it over enamal or acrylic surfaces. Straight away strip of the paint.However it is resistant to enamal thinner. So you can do washing without much preperation.<br><br></div>

Here is what I usually do...<br><br>As Centurion has said, first paint them in Gun Metal, as they are made of steel. Second, wash rust colour onto the nooks and crannies of the tracks, as rust tends to gather on these areas since moisture gets trapped there and theres no contact with the ground during movemen .<br><br>Next, wash (yes wash not dry brush) a layer of soil/mud colour onto the tracks. Washing will ensure that the soil/mud looks like it got onto the nooks and crannies of the track instead of sticking to the surface which is what happens.<br><br>Finally, using silver, dry brush the track guides and the portions of the track links that jut out, because on the real thing these same portions come into contact against hard ground and road and tend to become polished and smooth.<br><br>Tedious? You bet. But from my NS days, thats what I observed on the tracks of  tanks/AFVs that have been used.<br><br>You can try pastel chalks that Centurion suggested, but my personal preference is Gunze's acrylic weathering line, which includes colours like rust/mud/sand etc. Because these paints come with pigments inside that when dry, gives the weathered models the 'feel' of the real thing (run your finger along a part painted with Gunze's Rust and it feels like the part has really rusted)</div></blockquote>hey , thx for sharing these tip with me , unlike my other modellin friend who are too lazy to explaint to me , told me to throw the track in the mud so it look dirty  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>and also i  want to bring up an old question , which i alway forgot , when handling aircraft glass pannel , sometime the cement will accidentally blurred the 'glass' , and cant be remove. can share how to handle aircrat 'glass' pannel? thx  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Den use tooth paste and polish a few rounds to remove the major scratch marks. After that, get tamiya polishing compound to finish up the micro scratch marks. Your canopy will be shinier than new.<br><br>In the future, don't use cement to glue your canopy. Use white glue instead. It can be purchased from any stationary shops.  It doesn't bond extremely strong, but it holds the canopy in place. It dries clear and is water soluble.  Only thing, don't push on the glass surface. It will drop out easily.</div>
