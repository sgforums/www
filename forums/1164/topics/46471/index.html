            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore vulnerable to attack: Najib<br>Small islands are difficult to defend, he says, but admits Singapore's military capabilities are better than Malaysia's<br><br>By Reme Ahmad<br><br>SINGAPORE is difficult to defend because it is a small island, Malaysian Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak has said in an interview with a local newspaper.<br><br>Because of this strategic limitation in its defence, the Republic is vulnerable to external attacks, he added.<br><br>'In war doctrine, point defence is very difficult to carry out as the place is small and limited... So, Singapore...has limitations from a strategic standpoint as it is an island.'<br>- On Singapore being tough to defend<br><br>'We could not identify or be suspicious of any country as a country that will threaten us. We must upgrade our defence forces so that everyone...will at least respect us.'<br>- On who the real enemies in the region are<br><br>'We stand firm on the position that this region should be a zone of peace, tranquil and neutral and free from the power play of the big powers.'<br>- On the possibility of a US base in Singapore<br><br>'Singapore is an island and in military concept, the defence of an island is described as point defence,' he told Berita Minggu, which published the interview yesterday.<br><br>'In war doctrine, point defence is very difficult to carry out as the place is small and limited and is actually very easy to attack from outside.<br><br>'So, Singapore is a country that has limitations from a strategic standpoint as it is an island.'<br><br>But Datuk Seri Najib acknowledged that Singapore's military capability might be better than that of Malaysia's because the Republic sets aside more money for its defence.<br><br>'They spend 6 per cent of their gross domestic product for defence compared to only 2.5 to 3 per cent for Malaysia,' he noted.<br><br>Berita Minggu is the Sunday edition of Berita Harian, the most hawkish newspaper in covering issues involving the Republic.<br><br>Its reporters had asked the minister for his views on the perception that Singapore has pre-emptive defence capability and that it receives sophisticated equipment and advice from the United States and Israel.<br><br>While acknowledging Singapore's military capability, Datuk Seri Najib declined to comment on its military purchases but said such moves were within its rights to modernise its armed forces.<br><br>'But we would analyse if the weapons have offensive capabilities,' he said.<br><br>He would also not be drawn to comment on a question on who the real enemies in this region are.<br><br>'We could not identify or be suspicious of any country as a country that will threaten us. We must upgrade our defence forces so that everyone will feel that even if they are not fearful of us, they will at least respect us,' he said.<br><br>Asked about views that Singapore wants to be seen as the replacement to the Philippines in providing a base to US forces, he said Malaysia would not agree if US forces were to have a permanent base in any Asean country.<br><br>Kuala Lumpur would agree only to joint military training with the US, an arrangement that Malaysia also has, said the minister.<br><br>He said Malaysia was not aware of any plans to turn Singapore into a permanent base for the US, and added that the Republic was only a transit point.<br><br>'We stand firm on the position that this region should be a zone of peace - tranquil and neutral and free from the power play of the big powers,' he said.<br><br>Touching on Malaysia's defence, he said that the government has looked at proposals for an airborne early warning radar system.<br><br>Malaysia's armed forces, with a total strength of 110,000 men, recently announced plans to buy 18 Russian-made Sukhoi fighter jets for US$900 million (S$1.55 billion) to add to its fleet of 18 MiGs, eight F-18s and 28 Hawks.<br><br>It is also buying 48 main battle tanks from Poland for RM1.4 billion (S$635 million) and will pay 1.035 billion euros (S$2.1 billion) for three French submarines.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>It is interesting to read the reported opinion of the Malaysian Defense Minister that SingaporeÂ’s size makes it difficult to defend much like that of a Â“Point Defense".<br><br>Certainly the Malaysian Newspaper Reporter was trying to lead (or instigate) his Defense Minister to commit to some controversial remarks, but unlike the Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar, who is raring for high publicity in controversies, Najib is more reflective and circumspect with his thoughts being freely given.<br><br>It is little wonder that he is being seen as the successor to Malaysian DPM Badawi.<br><br>Let the Malaysians be comfortable in their thinking that Singapore is difficult to defend.<br><br>If they think that the defense of Singapore will be anything like the Â“Point DefenseÂ” adopted by the Freedom loving Texans, in their last stand - when the Texans were outnumbered by the Mexicans with a difference of 3000 to 186 - in the Battle for Fort Alamo, during the Texas-Mexico War of 1836.<br><br>Or if they think that it will be anything like Khe Sanh during the Vietnam War, when this US remote outpost was repeated stormed by the North Vietnamese Army that outnumbered the US Battalion defending this outpost by 60 to 1.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, after going on a weapons buyinhg spree for the last 12 months, a they are feeling pretty confident of themselves. So naturally for those people up north, the next question is whether the military gap between spore and msia has narrowed............ from najib response, i feel that he has given a candid and realistic appreciation of the situation. what he has said is nothing new. our defense planners knew that long ago. due to spore size, of course we do not have defense in depth. we do not need a rocket sciencetist to tell us that.unlike msia, we do not announce all major purchase..... e.g. mbt. sph and most probably the sm-1 replacement........due to this reason, the msias probably are feeling confident.... let them be.... as DPM Tony Tan said....... spore has its siliver bullets.... what kind of siliver bullets...... that i do not know........despite bringing in new hardware, fundamentally, i do not see much of a change within their ranks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with what most of you guys have said about Najib's comment being nothing new. He is indeed saying things that everyone already knows, but there will always be pple who believe every comment made is an attack. I guess the moral of the story is to stay calm and composed whenever they make comments and not to let emotions dictate our actions. Look, we know they are watching us, and they know we are keeping an eye on them as well. They (especially the Malaysian press) will always do and say things that Singaporeans will find offensive, or suggestive. We have to keep in mind that a lot of what these politicians say are usually for their own pple to hear, and the press (more often than not) tends to put a twist on things. I guess, to be fair, even our own ST can be guilty of that sometimes. I think S'pore is on the right path, keeping in mind LKY's famous words, 'Walk quietly and carry a big stick'. I think we have to just keep making sure that our 'stick' is big enough. I just hope we never have to use it....</div>

Israel is some kind of obscene word to them and like the Arabs, the ruling party there think Israel should be eradicated.<br><br>By linking Singapore with Israel, and making Singapore to be some kind of Israel in SE Asia, the Malaysian politicos are effectively shutting down the brains of their voters, putting Singapore firmly in their minds as some kind of bogeyman and in that process, uniting the voters in hatred against some perceived enemy.<br><br>I would think that the talk by Najib is not about defense, rather, it's propaganda to win votes.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Viper52:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="font-style: italic;">Its reporters had asked the minister for his views on the perception that Singapore has pre-emptive defence capability and that it receives sophisticated equipment and advice from the United States and Israel.</span><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Singapore is useful to the ruling umno in a sense that we help them win votes by being the bogeyman. whether we like it or not, this problem will persist for sometime to come. furthermore the msia GE is due in the next 12 mths...... so my fellow singaporeans... be prepare for some more of their non ending barage of criticism.....it seems that whatever we do or say,  they sure have something negative to say in response.....so lets be calm, rationale, responsible and level-headed in handling the expected nonsense in the coming few months. just remember that their rheotric is nothing new......but to those people up north, they just like to listen to this ear soothing and pleasing propaganda again and again.......as i have noticed, a level-headed, calm, rational and responsible senior msian govt official is becoming a scarce commodity............</div>

Though many Malays strongly oppose this theory. Reason is that they will lose their position as the 'Bumiputera'. Malays actually came to the peninsula about 3000 to 4000 years ago.<br>The Orang Asli were actually the ones. They came to Malaysia about 50,000 years ago.</div>

"Japanese" is in today's context...<br><br>fact is, its not. Chinese as a national citizenship is rather different from "Han" Chinese as an ethnic conception. the Party itself acknowledges that they have within their borders hundreds of minority groups which they claim to "respect and protect"... just ask any Tibetan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> better yet... take a trip to Xinjiang and ask the muslims what they think about being "Chinese"... its communist bull crap lah...<br><br>if u go back even further, u'll even find that "Han" Chinese are in fact, Northern Chinese... South China isn't Han, its Yueh... some go as far as to say that Vietnam was founded by these people who moved further south after the Hans pushed them out. think: "Nan-Yueh (southern Yueh)", "Yueh-Nan"... hmmm... some don't agree lah but its almost certain that some of the hill tribes living between the borders between Myammar, Vietnam and China have been around for a bloody long time... descendents of Yueh? dunno...<br><br>as for Malay from China, thats just bizarre. they're descendents of Champa, a Hindu kingdom from the area that used to be South Vietnam... they lived there before the Vietnamese dynasties moved south and invaded them. the population was displaced and assimiliated. some moved further south and there u have it.<br><br>if u dig WAY back, some say they're related to the Polynesians... u know, little people in the pacific who cruised over in canoes... so they would be kinda related to Hawaiians... pineapples and grass skirts anybody?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
