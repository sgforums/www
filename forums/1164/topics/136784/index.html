And i wun call that few years if i were you.<br><br>And as for tanks, they were used since the birth of the nation.Each of them have an average age of 60 years. They have been there even before you were sucking you thumb. And from an engineering point of view, those things are not exactly the safest things to drive abt.<br><br>As for rifles, you want something that keeps jamming all the time due to poor design age and fatique? If you do i salute you.<br><br>And if you talk abt NS, you have 3 months to learn all the basics and the rest of the time you are there to apply all them in practical. 2 years is barely enough to train a soldier if you ask me.<br><br>As for reusing old weapons, read the above . . . . .<br><br>Finally . . .please for goodness sake do your research before jumping the gun !!!!!<br><br>On the contrary it is time for you to re-think . . . . .</div>

Even with a few functional ships you can effectively blockade the whole straits of malacca . . .with mines and ships then what the hell are you going to use to deal with them? Sampans?<br>And while their planes may not be very well maintained, the last time i heard, quite a fair bit of them are still airworthy.<br>And indonesia have a 700 000 strong army. Even if they are 1/2 trained as you claimed they are, if they decide to do a major human wave some how, you want some 1/2 trained 1/2 farked singapore ns men to defend the shores?<br>Use your logic sometimes and read the news paper more often for goodness sake.<br>Oh if you have time, pls read sun tze art of war.<br>And the internet is a nice place to do research too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No offence to you, iveco, but your opinions bear similarities to pacificist theories that have been repeatedly disproved throughout history.<br><br>Let me rebut your theories categorically:<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1) Theory of disarmament:</strong></span><br><blockquote>Yes, all nations should cut defence spending and practice disarmament. The money could go to more worthy causes like education and healthcare costs. Not to mention public transport.</blockquote>Disarmament has almost never worked in any case throughout history. All it takes is for one party to break the treaty and you have to start from scratch.<br>Germany did it before World War II and more recently, the USA broke the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) with Russia.<br><br>It's a easy thing to tell the World, let's make love not war. But do you seriously believe that while you throw down your weapons, everyone else is going to put down their guns too? We don't live in a perfect world.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2) Theory of Caps on Service Numbers:</strong></span><br><blockquote>In the first place, there should be a UN resolution to cap armed service numbers to no more than 15 per cent of those eligible to vote. In this way, nobody is capable of invading anybody, and world peace is guaranteed. </blockquote>This theory is flawed if only because different nations have different populations. For example, 15% of registered Malaysian voters is NOT equal to 15% of Singapore voters and we are nowhere near 15% of China's population (if they could vote).<br><br>Also, caps have been tried and failed, refer to history and you have the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 (before WWII). The treaty declared that signatories would keep their naval armament capped to a fixed ratio so as to avoid an arms race.<br><br>It officially failed when on December 29, 1934, the Japanese government gave notice that it intended to terminate the treaty. Its provisions remained in force until the end of 1936, and it was not renewed. We all know what happened next...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aerozapper: I get your drift on both the issue of disarmament and JWs. However, if you consider North Korea, the citizens are dying of starvation while millions of dollars are invested in nuclear weapons. The money could have been better spent getting food for the people. South of the border, conscription is practiced. However, Seoul makes provisions for conscientious objectors and that includes JWs. In Singapore, the JW community is treated like common crooks even though they have done no wrongs. It seems a little like discrimination to me.<br><br>Blockhead: Any member of the UN must be aware of its responsibilities.

Fact of the matter is, there is no real enforcement. Sometimes, 'responsibility' can be a very flexible word, and so is 'obligation'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iveco, with respect to JWs, I understand where you're coming from, I was trying to point out that "Holocaust" was too strong a word as while it may be regarded as discrimination, the policy definitely does not require us to KILL them. The use of Holocaust is also inaccurate because in the years before WWII, the JW organisation actually SUPPORTED the Nazis discrimination against the Jews until the Nazis turned around and outlawed the JW as well.<br><br>Also, as for the part about Singapore discriminating against JWs, it should be noted that countries such as Canada, France, Greece and even the United States have on previous occasions also discriminated against this group. This is because the group is seen as a radical sect, even within main stream Christianity.<br><br>The reason they don't serve military service is because they believe in being "politically neutral".<br>They refuse to salute the national flag (or say the pledge), refuse participate in military service and refuse to vote. Their refusal to show allegiance to Singapore means that serving in Civil Defence or other uniformed organisations is out of the question too.<br><br>Part of their religion also deems blood transfusion to be unholy so they don't donate blood and even if some JW kid is bleeding on the surgeon's table, he can't accept blood.<br><br>I'm pointing out the facts, can you really say that our government is doing something that is wrong? I've debated it in my head repeatedly, while I don't really like the idea of imprisoning them, I don't see how a small country like us can accomodate a big group of them if they were allowed to spread. Are there any good alternatives to suppressing the group? What are they?</div>
