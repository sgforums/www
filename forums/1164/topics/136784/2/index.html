The use of Holocaust is also inaccurate because in the years before WWII, the JW organisation actually SUPPORTED the Nazis discrimination against the Jews until the Nazis turned around and outlawed the JW as well.<br><br>Also, as for the part about Singapore discriminating against JWs, it should be noted that countries such as Canada, France, Greece and even the United States have on previous occasions also discriminated against this group. This is because the group is seen as a radical sect, even within main stream Christianity.<br><br>The reason they don't serve military service is because they believe in being "politically neutral".<br>They refuse to salute the national flag (or say the pledge), refuse participate in military service and refuse to vote. Their refusal to show allegiance to Singapore means that serving in Civil Defence or other uniformed organisations is out of the question too.<br><br>Part of their religion also deems blood transfusion to be unholy so they don't donate blood and even if some JW kid is bleeding on the surgeon's table, he can't accept blood.<br><br>I'm pointing out the facts, can you really say that our government is doing something that is wrong? I've debated it in my head repeatedly, while I don't really like the idea of imprisoning them, I don't see how a small country like us can accomodate a big group of them if they were allowed to spread. Are there any good alternatives to suppressing the group? What are they?</div></blockquote>It is every individual's right to do something they want , and anything they don't want to , its just a matter of choice.<br><br>Not trying to defend the JW , but what makes you think the citizens are the property of the state from the moment they are borned <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by aerozapper:</div><div class="quote_body">Iveco, with respect to JWs, I understand where you're coming from, I was trying to point out that "Holocaust" was too strong a word as while it may be regarded as discrimination, the policy definitely does not require us to KILL them. The use of Holocaust is also inaccurate because in the years before WWII, the JW organisation actually SUPPORTED the Nazis discrimination against the Jews until the Nazis turned around and outlawed the JW as well.<br><br>Also, as for the part about Singapore discriminating against JWs, it should be noted that countries such as Canada, France, Greece and even the United States have on previous occasions also discriminated against this group. This is because the group is seen as a radical sect, even within main stream Christianity.<br><br>The reason they don't serve military service is because they believe in being "politically neutral".<br>They refuse to salute the national flag (or say the pledge), refuse participate in military service and refuse to vote. Their refusal to show allegiance to Singapore means that serving in Civil Defence or other uniformed organisations is out of the question too.<br><br>Part of their religion also deems blood transfusion to be unholy so they don't donate blood and even if some JW kid is bleeding on the surgeon's table, he can't accept blood.<br><br>I'm pointing out the facts, can you really say that our government is doing something that is wrong? I've debated it in my head repeatedly, while I don't really like the idea of imprisoning them, I don't see how a small country like us can accomodate a big group of them if they were allowed to spread. Are there any good alternatives to suppressing the group? What are they?</div></blockquote>*makes a mental note.. this is wat JW's about..*</div>
