              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Military Justice System in the
              SAF</span></span></strong><br> <br> 1. Overview<br> The military justice system in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is
              expected to treat every service personnel fairly and equally,
              regardless of race, rank or vocation.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 2. Multi-levelled Approach</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The military justice system is based on the SAF Act, which was
              implemented in 1972. All servicemen are subjected to the SAF Act,
              SAF Regulations, and orders of whatever form issued pursuant to
              them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">While discipline is paramount in the military, not all offences
              committed by SAF servicemen are dealt with by formal investigations
              and charges. Essentially, offenders can be dealt with either by way
              of informal or formal punishment systems.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 3. Informal Punishment System<br> Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments like
              push-ups and weekend confinement to servicemen who have committed
              disciplinary breaches, like being late, sluggish, or improperly
              dressed.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">4. Formal Punishment System<br> If the offence that a serviceman committed is of a more serious
              nature, he may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary officer
              by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate military
              court (more commonly known as the General Court Martial or
              GCM).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(a) Summary Trial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are
              essentially military offences, such as absence without leave
              (AWOL), non-compliance with lawful orders or insubordination.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Depending on the rank of the serviceman in question, and the type
              of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible sentences
              that may be imposed can vary, and these can include fines or
              detention.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The summary trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF
              regulations, and the records of the summary trial are sent to the
              office of the Director, Legal Services of the SAF.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">(b) General Court Martial</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The General Court Martial exists as a separate forum from that of
              the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM can deal with
              a wider range of offences, and can impose a wider range of
              punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
              sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
              and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
              legal rules and procedures as those used in a civil criminal
              court.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military
              Police Command, and which are referred to the office of the
              Director of Legal Services, will result in the accused serviceman
              being charged in a GCM. In such a case, a military prosecutor will
              draw up a formal charge sheet and present it before the GCM.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">General Courts Martial can be further sub-divided into two
              categories, namely the Panel Courts Martial - consisting of a
              President and usually two other members, and Judge Courts Martial -
              consisting of a single President only.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Currently, the practice is for military offences to be heard by
              Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of drugs and
              penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court Martial.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"><br> The current policy is also for an NSman, who is or was a District
              Judge in the Subordinate Courts, to preside in a GCM. There are
              currently 10 NSmen who have been appointed by the Armed Forces
              Council to perform duty as President of a court martial. They are
              rostered by the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Court to hear
              cases during their in-camp training. In the case of a Panel Court
              Martial, the other two members are rostered from among some 155
              military officers appointed by the Chief of Defence Force.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 5. Ways to Seek Redress</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the military
              justice system for an SAF serviceman to seek redress if he is
              unhappy about the punishment imposed on him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Generally, a serviceman who is dissatisfied with an informal
              punishment meted out to him may request a higher level commander to
              review the punishment, or request for formal disciplinary
              dealing.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a summary trial, a serviceman brought before the
              disciplinary officer may elect instead to be tried by a court
              martial. Alternatively, an aggrieved serviceman may request that
              his conviction or punishment imposed at the summary trial be
              reviewed by MINDEF's Director Manpower (a delegated authority of
              the Armed Forces Council).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">In the case of a GCM, a serviceman may choose to be represented by
              a lawyer or an SAF defending officer if his case will be heard by a
              court martial. The SAF has about 200 trained defending officers.
              While an SAF defending officer comes free to the serviceman, he has
              to bear the cost of engaging a lawyer. At the end of the trial, a
              serviceman who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court
              martial may petition the Reviewing Authority (the AFC or a
              committee of its members) for a review of his case. The serviceman
              can also appeal to the Military Court of Appeal (MCA) for a
              reconsideration of his conviction, or his sentence, or both.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">The MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a panel of five
              members. Heading the MCA is a President, who is appointed by the
              Chief Justice. By law, he must be a person qualified to be a Judge
              of the Supreme Court. The current President of the MCA is Justice
              Choo Han Teck. Four other members - two civilian members who are
              qualified legal practitioners with at least five years experience
              each, and two senior military officers - make up the rest of the
              MCA. The MCA is the highest court in the military justice
              system.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;"> <br> 6. Impartial Hearings<br> It is important to recognise that the GCM and the MCA are tribunals
              headed by presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 17.77777862548828px;">Being an "outsider", the president of these forums will hear the
              case impartially like any other civil criminal case. The
              proceedings in the GCM and the MCA are also heard in a public
              forum, and these military courts adopt many of the same legal
              procedures and safeguards as that used in the civil criminal
              courts. All servicemen formally charged with an offence can bring
              their case to these forums.</p>

              <p>Your pregnancy reason is the only way to plead for leniency in the mitigation plea. <br>Maybe your husband will have to bring you and carry your newborn baby to see his Commanding Officer (CO). Do whatever it takes, cry, kneel and beg for mercy/ leniency.</p>
              <p>A plea in mitigation is when you state facts tending to reduce the 
                              sentence and/or ask the court to be lenient when imposing sentence. You 
                              should state specific reasons for the Court to impose a lighter sentence
                               than it normally would. For example, family background, educational 
                              qualification, medical history, employment history and relevant factors 
                              which gave rise to the offence.</p>
