The remaining 32 A-4S airframes were shipped to and upgraded in Singapore.<br><br># The A-4S first flew on July 14, 1973.<br><br># Seven TA-4S variants were unique.  To maintain engine commonality, A-4S (A-4C) airframes were lengthened, a la the TA-4, to provide a second cockpit; however, rather than the single canopy characteristic of other "T" birds, each TA-4S cockpit had a separate canopy.<br><br># In 1980, Singapore purchased an additional 86 Skyhawks from U.S. suplus (70 A-4Cs, 16 A-4Bs).<br><br># From 1984 to 1989, the RSAF conducted an ambitious Skyhawk service life extension program.  Most of the A-4S airframes were extensively re-built and modernized.  Redesignated A-4SU (SUper), upgrading included replacement of J65 engines with the 11,000 lb thrust F404-GE-100D; new refrigeration, hydraulic pump, air turbine starter, electrical power, and oil cooler systems; new sensors, cockpit instrumentation, and state-of-the-art avionics; and improved air-to-air and air-to-ground ordnance carrying and control capability.<br><br># The re-engineered A-4SU "Super Skyhawks" became operational in 1988.<br>A-4C (A-4S) BuNos Known Sold to Singapore<br>142101, 142119, 142125, 142131, 142711, 142746, 142751, 142770,<br>142771, 142774, 142800, 142819, 142832, 142840, 142850, 142870,<br>142876, 142882, 142908, 142942, 144874, 144926, 144971, 144974,<br>144980, 145013, 145030, 145038, 145046, 145056, 145059, 145110,<br>147779, 148521, 148526, 148603, 149498, 143537<br><br>A-4S Known Singapore Serials<br>600, 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621,<br>622, 623, 630, 631, 632, 633, 634, 635, 636, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647,<br>648, 649, 650, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 679, 680, 681, 682, 683, 914,<br>917, 918, 919, 923, 924, 927, 928, 933, 936, 937, 938, 939, 940, 941,<br>942, 945, 946, 947, 956, 957, 960, 961, 967, 969, 970, 971, 972, 973,<br>974, 975, 976, 977, 981, 983, 985, 991, 992, 993, 994<br><br>TA-4S Known Singapore Serials<br>651, 652, 653, 687, 688, 689, 690, 900, 901,<br>902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909 </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A tribute to the A4su super skyhawk</span></span></span><br><span style="color: #444444;"><br><br>The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) purchased 47 refurbished Skyhawks (40 A-4B, 7 TA-4) from U.S. in 1972. The aircraft were re-designated A-4S/TA-4S. The "T" version of the RSAF Skyhawk was unique in that, rather than the single "clam shell" canopy common to other TA-4 models, each TA-4S cockpit had a separate canopy.<br><br>From 1984 to 1989, the RSAF conducted a Skyhawk service life extension program. The 8,400-lb-thrust J65 engines were replaced with 11,000 lb. thrust F404-GE-100D turbofans. Other upgrades included modified engine air intakes; new structural mounts to accommodate the F404 engines; installation of new refrigeration, hydraulic pumps, air turbine starters, and oil coolers; new sensors, cockpit instrumentation, and state-of-the-art avionics; engine and environmental control systems; higher output electrical generators; and improved air-to-air and air-to-ground ordnance carrying and control capability.<br><br>Re-designated as A-4SU "Super Skyhawk," the refurbished Skyhawks became operational in 1988, and Skyhawk pilot training was fully operational in March 1989. With the total RSAF inventory of about 60 aircraft, the three Singapore Skyhawk units (142, 143, and 145 Squadrons), operating from Tengah Air Base, made up a numerical majority of that country's military aircraft.<br><br>In late 1997, the RSAF Skyhawk training unit (143 squadron) was disbanded as part of a new advanced jet training effort. The former 143 Squadron A-4SUs were shipped to southwest France in September 1998 where, at Cazaux Air Base, 150 Squadron was established for advance training of RSAF pilots. The French site was selected because of available practice bombing ranges and airspace over the North Atlantic for ACM training, as well as opportunity for electronic warfare technique practice.<br><br>In October 2003, the RSAF announced three survivors in the competition to replace the A-4SU Skyhawk: the Boeing F-15T Strike Eagle, the Dassault Rafale, and the Eurofighter Typhoon. Dropped from consideration were the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Boeing FA-18E/F Super Hornet, and the Sukov Su-30/35 Flanker. A contract for as many as 24 replacement aircraft may be let in 2004, but, since the replacement for the A-4SUs is viewed as an interim solution, the final number ordered could be well below the projected 24 and the service life of the venerable old Skyhawk could be extended. The Lockheed-Martin F-35 JSF (Joint Strike Fighter) has entered the picture. Since Singapore is expected to be a player in the JSF project as a "Security Cooperation Participant," if the F-35 is ordered the first deliveries could occur as early as 2012-2015. </span><br></div>

These aircraft were built from A-4Bs bought from MASDC in the early 1970s. These aircraft were rebuilt with LockheedÂ’s assistance together with itÂ’s Singapore subsidiary, Lockheed Air Services Singapore (LASS). 51 A-4S and TA-4S were built between 1974 and 1977, with 6 built in the United States and the rest assembled in Singapore. These aircraft had over 100 modifications from the original A-4B, including a longer nose housing a new comms/nav package, 5 stores hardpoints instead of the usual 3, a saddle type ADF dorsal hump, cockpit armour plating, spoilers, cranked refueling probe, Sidewinder capability, brake parachute housing below jetpipe and 30mm Aden cannons in place of the Mk12 20mm cannons.<br><br>Internal changes included a Ferranti D-101 lead computing gunsight and associated weapons delivery computer. Decca provided a Type 72 Doppler system and Tactical Area Navigation System (TANS), while Lear Siegler provided the Altitude and Heading Reference System, new radios, IFF, ADF, TACAN and radar altimeter. The original APQ-145 mapping and ranging radar was retained. In RSAF service the A-4S/TA-4S were given 3-digit serial starting with 6. (Eg. 600, 651)</span><br><br>The a4s-1<br><br><img src="http://www.clubhyper.com/reference/images/skyhawkrsaf_3.jpg"><br><br>All aircraft from the second batch of airframes onwards were built to this standard. All A4S-1s and most of the TA4S-1s were ex A-4Cs. These were rebuilt mainly into the same standards as the earlier A-4S, but retained the 20mm cannons and A-4C nose of the original Skyhawk. Due to serviceability problems with the Doppler sets, these were also not retained from this batch of Skyhawks onwards. All A4S-1/TA4S-1s were serialled 9xx (eg. 918, 950). The first example joined the RSAF in the early 1980s.<br><br>Late in their service lives these aircraft acquired Radar Warning Receivers on the nose and above the jetpipes, while chaff/flare dispensers were fitted to both sides of the arrestor hooks. Prior to the mid-1980s, the RSAF had no in flight refueling capability, so it was not unusual to see RSAF Skyhawks (both A-4S and A4S-1) during this period having no probes fitted.<br><br>The A4SU<br><br><img src="http://www.clubhyper.com/reference/images/skyhawkrsaf_4.jpg"><br><br>The final guise of the RSAF Skyhawk. In 1986 a two-stage upgrade program for the A4S-1/TA4S-1 fleet was initiated by Singapore Aircraft Industries (later Singapore Technologies Aerospace or STAe), in conjunction with the RSAF. The first stage included a new engine to replace the old and underpowered J65 turbojets. A non-afterburning General Electric F404-GE-100D turbofan was selected. The new engine necessitated some changes to the inlet to be made, along with fitting new engine mounts, air turbine starter, hydraulic pumps, refrigeration units and oil cooler. Two prototype aircraft, a single and a twin-seater, were converted and designated A4S-1/F404 and TA4S-1/F404 respectively. The first flight was made by a single-seater serialled 919 on 19 September 1986 and was designated A4S-1/F404 (unofficially designated A-4U). During flight tests the new engine demonstrated vastly improved performance, including outrunning RSAF Northrop F-5 Tiger II chase planes!<br><br>The second stage involved replacing the outdated avionics on the aircraft. Much is still unknown about this aspect of the upgrade, although it is known that the new avionics package includes a Ferranti 4510 HUD, Litton LN-93 INS, mission computer, MED-2067 MFD and processor, Bendix flight data recorder and a laser seeker in the nose.<br><br>TA-4S/S-1/SU 2-seat trainer<br><br><img src="http://www.clubhyper.com/reference/images/skyhawkrsaf_5.jpg"><br><br>Singapore acquired unique twin-seaters for its Skyhawk fleet. Instead of the standard single canopy trainer, Lockheed chose to design a totally new nose for the TA-4S. A 28-inch fuselage plug was inserted into the front fuselage, and a second, separate cockpit added for the instructor, with a redesigned, outward-bulging rear canopy (not simply a second single-seater canopy as its commonly believed) to enable better all-round vision for the instructor. The reason for this is unclear, we have heard 2 reasons for this: Firstly, the RSAFÂ’s fleet was made up of J65-powered aircraft, while all trainer Skyhawks (TA-4F/J) were being powered by J52 engines Thus, to avoid having a Skyhawk fleet comprising of aircraft with 2 different engine types, Singapore elected to customize itÂ’s own trainers. Another possible reason was that Singapore wanted more trainers than the US was willing to supply (at that time TA-4F/Js were still a mainstay in the USN), therefore leaving Singapore with no choice but to build itÂ’s own trainers. Whatever the reason, the RSAF has ended up with what must be the most unique Skyhawks ever built!<br><br>Taken from http://www.clubhyper.com/reference/singaporeskyhawksmy_1.htm</div>
