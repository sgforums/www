The F-5 has top speed of M1.6, and I fancy that the tiger eyes can fly faster as they are lightly loaded. Skyhawk was sub-sonic, so even if you up-grade, how much can the speed increase? F-5 also feature more advanced aerodynamics like area-ruled fuselage, making it a more efficient flyer. However, the skyhawk was never built for speed. It was built as small as possible and for heavy-loads, so we can't really compare to the F-5, which was built for agility and low cost.</div></blockquote>speed is not everything when it comes to dogfighting.<br>if you talk about agility, the A4 beats the F5 hands down.<br><br>and we are talking about sidewinders only not super missiles like aim 120.<br><br>when the two had a dog fight just after the upgrade, they said that the A4s was so agile, with all the tight turns and loops that the F5s had to go after burners just to keep up with it.Finally within 10 mins of dog fighting, the F5s were both "shot" and had to return to base  for refueling. ccording to what i heard, the A4s still had 30 mins of flying time and they were still flying around , playing some mock dogfights with each other.<br><br>Dun ask me where i got this info.

Twelve A4-SU Super Skyhawks took to the skies for one final flight over Singapore.<br><br>Flying with the pilots were some of the top brass of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), including Chief of Defence Force, Lieutenant General (LG) Ng Yat Chung, and Chief of Air Force, Major-General (MG) Lim Kim Choon.<br><br>Speaking at a simple ceremony after the flight, MG Lim called the fleet of Super Skyhawks "a faithful friend", one that had accomplished many missions and achieved much throughout its nearly 300,000 hours of operational flying.<br><br>The A4-SUs' achievements included flying directly from Singapore to the Philippines, incorporating the RSAF's first air-to-air refuelling mission in 1986, as well as the excellent aerobatic display of the 'red and white' Super Skyhawks flown by the RSAF Black Knights during Asian Aerospace 1990.<br><br>Thumbs up for a good flight! Chief of Defence Force, LG Ng Yat Chung (right) and MAJ Theng Fai Yew, take to the skies in a Super Skyhawk for one final time.<br><br>Commanding Officer of 142 Squadron, Lieutenant-Colonel (LTC) Tay Boon Chong, who flew with MG Lim, was also full of praise for the aircraft he has been flying since 1992.<br><br>He likened the planes to a Singapore "icon" for their many appearances at National Day Parades through the years.<br><br>"I think they have a place in the hearts of Singaporeans and I am sure they have inspired many to join the RSAF to become fighter pilots," said LTC Tay.<br><br>In recent months, the Super Skyhawks had continued to perform exceptionally, participating in various exercises and even coming out tops in a competition among the six RSAF fighter squadrons in February.<br><br>Said LTC Tay: "I am glad we are ending on a high note." - CyberPioneer</div>

Remembered that there was a loud noise and I looked out of the classroom door, saw 2 skyhawks flew past. And that was almost 30 years ago. Believe it or not, I was already plane crazy back then. At that time, I had this book where I paste pics of planes(both civilian &amp; mil) cut out from newspapers back then and I can also id them all.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

Many bombs were dropped too low. Several bombs that hit their targets were not armed and failed to explode on impact, example the one that hit the Type 21 frigate HMS Antelope. The UXB exploded when it was being disarmed. Those that exploded did so with devastating effect, example: the sinking of Type 42 destroyer HMS Coventry.<br><br>2) The A-4s carried more bombs per sortie. Because of the extreme range, many A-4s flew with only one 1,000Ib bomb on the centreline pylon.<br><br>3) On a related point, if the A-4s had enough fuel to make more than one pass in San Carlos water, i.e. bomb alley, for strafing runs.<br><br>4) The A-4s had better close range AAMs for self defence. It's no contest between early model AIM-Bs versus all-aspect AIM-9Ls on the "black death" Sea Harriers.<br><br>5) There was more better coordination between Argentina's air and naval forces.<br><br>6) A-4s worked with Airborne Early Warning support.<br><br>Again off topic, I'm not sure the F-16 can best replace the Scooter in the CAS role... but that is my personal opinion.<br><br>Apaches are optimised as tank-busters when operating in concert with A-10s. That should be the ideal mud mover mix, and this again is my personal 2 cents opinion.<br><br></div>

Really, the skyhawk is a neat aircraft.</div>
