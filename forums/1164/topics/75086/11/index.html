            <div class='col-md body'>Does anyone have updated infos of T-94 or 95? The extracts below if true could provide us wif viable options in the near future.<br><br>Russia develops new main battle tank<br>Tuesday, April 11, 2000<br><br>USDEFENSE.COM | Russia has a new low profile main battle tank, according to published reports, but officials in Moscow say the tank, designated T-95, may not have enough funding budgeted in 2000 to make the transition from development to production.<br><br>The tank's design, developed at the Uralvagonzavod plant in the Urals, was called "radical" by Russian Defense Minister Marshal Igor Sergeyev, who saw a prototype of the T-95 on a recent visit to the plant.<br><br>One of newly elected president Vladimir Putin's goals is to strengthen the Russian military, perhaps by boosting professionalism and cutting forces while modernizing primary combat systems and phasing out older ones.<br><br>While all of the design information on the T-95 remains shrouded in secrecy, one plant official told Jane's Defense Weekly that the tank has been created from whole cloth, not simply based on an upgraded version of an existing main battle tank design.<br><br>The T-95, if produced en masse, would succeed Russia's T-90, the most modern of Moscow's main battle tanks and reportedly plagued by performance and maintenance problems, though Russian military officials have dismissed those reports as rumors.<br><br>Nevertheless, Jane's said, the length and width of the new 50-ton behemoth is "believed to be similar to the existing T-72, T-80 and T-90 MBTs (main battle tanks)."<br><br>The defense magazine said "the main feature of the T-95 is its radical configuration with the main armament in a small unmanned turret fed from a newly-designed automatic loader located below the turret." The tank sports a 135 mm cannon, which is presumably smooth-bored, and "is fitted with a new fire control system."<br><br>according to my sources the new revolutionary-designed T-95 MBT will mount a 152mm cannon. This tank reportedly boasts armor which is so strong that it cannot be penetrated from the frontal arc by our Rheinmetal 120mm cannon (which I have personally fired on many an occaision). This is made possible by the placing of all of the 3 crew members in a heavily armored pod in the hull, rather than the turret as is the case on conventional tanks. The prototypes of this tank were first sighted in 1994, but it has been in the planning stages for much longer. Actually, all Russian MBTs now in service boast ERA armor packs which they claim are proof against 120mm cannon fire in the frontal arc.<br><br>The big difference with the T-95 is that has thick top-attack armor to enable it to defeat top-attack missiles like the Javelin, which with the abolition of our tank forces will be our most powerful anti-tank weapon in service after 2012. Of course, the tank can be expected to mount a follow on of the excellent ARENA top-attack missile defense systems as all modern Russian tanks use today. The US was rumored to be attempting to purchase this defense system from the Russians for its Abrams tanks, but with Shinseki's foolish plan to abolish the US tank fleet, this will probably not happen.<br><br>We can all thank General Shinseki and his boss Bill Clinton for implementing their radical and insane plan to abolish all of our excellent M-1 Abrams tanks and all other tracked vehicles from the Army by 2012 and replace them with armored cars, which are lightly armed and armored. If this plan is implemented by a President Bush-Gore as I suspect then the Russian tanks will essentially and most ominously be impervious to US anti-tank fire.<br><br>Personally, I think the Russkies are going to kick our buttes in the first post 2012 US-Russia war. I can see it now--our brave LAV troopers with their 25mm peashooters staring down the barrel of the T-95's 152mm gun/missile launcher only to be unexpectedly dispatched by the Russian tanks HMG AP rounds as the Russians refuse to waste a 152 round on so puny and non-existent a threat.<br>1 Posted on 04/21/2000 06:02:30 PDT by rightwing2<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another extract:<br><br>Nizhny Tagil New Main Battle Tank<br><br>Is this what it looks like?<br>A new MBT was developed by V. Potkin's design team in Nizhny Tagil, at the Uralvagonzavod Plant where all the latest Russian tanks except the T-80 were manufactured.<br><br>This vehicle is intended to become the new Russian MBT and was planned to enter service in 1994, but due to lack of financing it is still on the testing grounds (according to some reports it has cleared the testing phase around March 1999). As a result, the Russian Army is stuck with the obsolete designs of T-64/T-72/T-80/T-90 line for much longer than it wishes.<br><br>The MBT doesn't yet have any lofty name and hides behind some obscure "ob'ekt" designation. In March 2000 the Defense Minister Igor Sergeev, while visiting Nizhny Tagil, said that Russia now "has a new T-95 tank" referring to the MBT being discussed here. It is unclear if this means that the vehicle is finally fielded (as only a fielded vehicle may get T-95 designation), or he just used the term that is sufficiently known in the West to avoid getting into details.<br><br>I could find very little about this vehicle, because it is all classified data. Here is the precious little I could gather, thanks mostly to Col. Viktor Mourakhovsky.<br><br>Crew protection on the tank will be emphasized to a far greater degree than ever before in Russian tank designs. The level of crew protection should ensure its survival when the tank is hit by any anti-tank munitions from any aspect or angle, thanks to the crew placement in a unitary armored pod inside the hull.<br>A unique drivetrain suspension system is being tested on this tank that to a certain extent extinguishes the hull vibrations and stabilizes its position.<br>The tank still remains in Class 50 (i.e. it weighs 50 tons) and it shall have an even smaller silhouette than the modern Russian MBTs.<br>The gun will be a 152mm smoothbore tank gun/ATGM launcher. The development of this system started as far back as end of the fifties for the heavy tanks (originally a rifled gun, probably M-69). The project was revived in the eighties and the gun was significantly redesigned. Even with ordinary powders a very high initial velocity of an APFSDS projectile is achieved. I could not, unfortunately, learn how the caliber increase is going to influence ammunition allowance and rate of fire.<br>This gun shall be located in an unmanned gun pod on top of the hull with no crew access to it. This is likely to increase survivability and lower the silhouette even further.<br>The fire control system will be multi-channel (optical + thermal + IR + laser + radar).<br>The carousel autoloader goes away.<br>According to plans the crew will consist of a 3 man combat structure and one mechanic (not unlike the air force crew structure), who will be responsible for vehicle maintenance and will reside in a battalion service and repair company.<br><br>armor.kiev.ua/fofanov/Tanks/MBT/t-95.html<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the US have always relied on infantry and air assets to support their armored and armored cav forces on the ground.  They just didn have the standard of mobility, precision, as well as command n control available under an "all encompassing brigade."  Yes, stryker packs their own logistics, transport, engineering assets even.  Basically, the all the assets function together to serve the brigade.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I still tink its biased lor. How come Challenger ranked so low compared to Abrams. Just because its an American programme doesn't mean Abrams is better lor. Challenger also destroy alot of iraqi tanks during the gulf war mah and i dare to say their armour protection is stronger and more evenly distributed than on the Abrams.</div>
