Parading a Sabra or Centurion is not like parading the latest M1A2 or Leo2A6 or even Lelerc.  Furthermore, I am sure that it sure will boost morale.<br><br>I'm sure parading MBT would stir some talks from some radical Malaysian or Indonesian, but hey, look at their own backyard, they will be having PT-90, Sukhois, etc, what is there to be surprised if one day Singapore parade some Sabras or even Merks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> plus our new Primus.<br><br>What would be nice to see in NDP is also a newly developed light tank with 120mm round that is going to be replacing the SM1s.... dream dream dream....<br><br></div>

The upgrade program encompasses thermal imaging and Elbit Knight-III fire control system (including stabilizer and ballistic computer), 120mm Merkawa-IV smoothbore cannon (with LAHAT guided ammunition) and fume extractor, automatic fire and explosion suppression system, Merkawa-IV add-on armor technology and explosive reactive armor (ERA), 1200 hp MTU diesel engine/transmission, full system modernization and integration capability, new improved Merkawa-IV tracks, RWR/IR warning system and NBC protection. The remaining M60A1 and M60A3 tanks are likely to undergo the same upgrade process with more involvement of Turkish companies, upon completion of the upgrade of first 170 tanks.</blockquote><a href="http://warriorsoul.4t.com/army.html" rel="nofollow">http://warriorsoul.4t.com/army.html</a><br><br><img src="http://www.ravenshield-fr.com/images/RS_animation4.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually seriously speaking.. its a good question you raised there. Hmm.. seriously do you guys think that the SAF would actually own MBTs? Hmm.. i guess its another one of those pros and cons situations. from what i can gather (non-classified stuff) singapore's military doctrine dictates that we produce a pre-emptive strike. and in a pre-emptive strike, i'm sure that MBTs are definitely needed to deal a decisive and swift blow to our enemies. But... given that we are an island nation and that neighbouring states are all relatively built up, i don't think they would deal the swift and powerful punch required by the SAF. the only reason why MBTs have been successful in recent combats is because they have the ability to travel over vast distances at considerable speeds and provide sufficient covering firer cum firepower needed to invade any enemy territory. I agree with those who say that FIBUA (Fighting in built-up areas) is a tankers worst nightmare.. but then again.. MBTs have been quite successfully used by the Israeli army when entering palestinan territory. (Israelis use M1A2 abraham).. hmm real good question you raised there. real tricky to answer to.. hee <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The israeli army does use the abrahams. They have been buying their MBTs from the USA since god knows when. do you actually think a M113 would supply sufficient protection and firepower for the ground troops should the event of a full-scale war between the arabs and israelis break out? NO.<br><br>anyway just another question. do you think that the singapore made Bionex (think its spelt this way) is powerful enough to provide the protection and firepower needed?<br><br>hey... maybe one of the reasons why we think the spore got has never bought a MBT is bcos' we already have tank killers ie Apache AH-64</div>
