Notice the Bionix is very compact with very low frontal width,juz rright for squeezing in between trees in forested areas.The replacement for the sm1 will likely follow the dimensions of the Bionix and maybe juz about a few tonnes heavier.because the sm1 replacement needs to be light in order to be able to cross bridges,therefore a 120mm gun will not be mounted due to the high stresses imposed on the light chassis by firing of the gun.the main gun will definitely be 105mm.tat should be enough to penetrate the frontal armour of the PT91 being fielded by our neighbour.this has been shown by the Israeli merkavas mounted with 105mm during the lebanon war.the sm1 is being used more as a fire support vehicle rather than a dedicated tank killer since our neighbour doesnt have much tanks for us to kill anyway.tat explains why the replacement for the sm1 has been so slow in coming.the tank-killing part is better left to the Ah64 apaches.the sm1 will juz provide fire support and hold ground.i tink this talk about a system with missiles instead of a direct fire gun is a load of crap by the saf.dont know wat they tinking of.<br><br>some guys were talking about mounting the Spikes on a chassis to produce a missile system.taats workable but the Spike with its shaped charge is more for blowing small holes through armour to penetrate them.tats wat they do.juz good for blowing small holes through metal.if u r talking about a fire support system in which our sm1 is primarily being used for, then u need a direct fire main gun that can fire armour piercing and high explosive rounds.  </div></blockquote>Here is a link to a ATGM called 'Javelin' to show u how devastating it is.'Spike is something similiar to 'Javelin'.

Given that, one has to compare the lethality of such weapons together against other classes like helicopter launched (Hellfire/HOT/AT-6) and air-launched (Maverick/LGB/AS30) etc.<br><br>The kind of weapon effect on the T-72 is more associated with the results of direct hit by aerial bombs/LGB or Maverick missile given the size and effects of their payloads on heavy armour.  You have to seriously doubt that an infantry-level ATGM is that lethal.  Either that the weapon used was totally souped-up to a high payload, or that the target was innuoucously pre-conditioned for the demo.<br><br>Knowing the track record of the weapons industry in the US especially missile technology (refer movie "Pentagon Wars" depicting development history of Bradley and gist of some other Cold War weapons systems), have to note this is not an operational deployment video.</div>

Now if you are saying that an IFV can kill an MBT, then the design philosophy calls for it that your IFV must be able to take a hit from the equivalent MBT of the one you just killed - is there logic in it,  given the current technology ?  No.<br><br>You have to throw out all the so-called active armour solutions e.g. SHTORA out the window.  Having such systems just means even more so that your vehicle cannot afford to take a hit and survive at all.  So placing active defence aids against your threat does not answer this problem.</div>

Also I didn't see any microwave director unless it's in the millimetric wave band! Or it's laser beam riding?<br><br>Assuming it's still a SACLOS system.<br><br>The radar radome looked like it's covering a search radar not a parabolic dish.<br><br>I think it's Igla with PSTAR maybe?</div>
