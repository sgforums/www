Such weapons can destroy targets faster, but cannot hit targets behind obstructions like hills or buildings. They are unlike indirect fire weapons such as mortars and some types of missiles whose warheads are lobbed high over obstructions.<br><br>The vehicle used by 3G armoured forces promises to give soldiers a 'comprehensive awareness' of events unfolding on the battlefield as well as enemy intentions.<br><br>Also, precision-guided munitions, which now make up only a small proportion of SAF Armour's arsenal, would be the weapon of choice in the future, over the present-day unguided or dumb munitions.<br><br>This means the new vehicle may carry less ammunition.<br><br>'That's because you've got a greater hit probability, which means your dumb round requirements start to go down,' said BG Tan, who is also Commander of 25th Division.<br><br>In turn, the general firepower requirement would likely go down, probably leading to trimmer, lighter, more mobile and protected forces rather than larger, heavier ones.<br><br>'Now, this is a big turn in the development of armoured vehicles,' he added.<br><br>These armoured units may also include unmanned robots to monitor the battlefield or to destroy enemy units.<br><br>The development of the 3G arsenal will eventually make the current SM1 light tank redundant. For now, it remains a mainstay of the SAF armoured units and is still effective because of the various improvements done on it.<br><br>Made in France in the late 1940s as the AMX-13, the 18-tonne tank has been upgraded locally with, among other things, a better fire control system and more lethal ammunition.<br><br>The 3G arsenal with the new armoured vehicle can quicken the pace of battle by three to four times.<br><br>BG Tan said: 'At the end of the day, you cannot wait for the last man to die or surrender before you go in to take a position. At some stage, you've got to engage him in close battle.<br><br>'Armour is the arm of decision. When you employ this force at the decisive point, it tilts the battle totally.'<br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,248112,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,248112,00.html?</a></div>

How did this idea come about that indirect fire can do a direct replacement. Direct and indirect weapons should complement each other, or in the case of Merkavas, they have both ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I still believe in a direct fire weapons especially, indirect fire tends to be less accurate (precision guided or not).  I can agree that SAF doesn't need a whole lot of MBTs, but direct fire light tanks are definitely needed. If SAF can have a mix of heavy armoured light tank with a low recoil 120mm gun, coupled with a remote controlled 0.5 inch HMG, plus, side mounted Spike ATGMs and an internally fire 60mm mortar or multipods 40mm genade launchers like the one from Metal Storm, then we will have a winner.<br><br>Furthermore, SAF should invest on something like the AMOS turrets on Bionix firing dumb and guided munitions. This will give that the indirect fire they will need.</div>

I can agree that SAF doesn't need a whole lot of MBTs, but direct fire light tanks are definitely needed. If SAF can have a mix of heavy armoured light tank with a low recoil 120mm gun, coupled with a remote controlled 0.5 inch HMG, plus, side mounted Spike ATGMs and an internally fire 60mm mortar or multipods 40mm genade launchers like the one from Metal Storm, then we will have a winner.<br><br>Furthermore, SAF should invest on something like the AMOS turrets on Bionix firing dumb and guided munitions. This will give that the indirect fire they will need.</div></blockquote>Exactly , Joe. You have take the word out of my mouth.<br><br>Just a few point to add , something 'revolutionary' does not means that it will be combat effective and might be overcome by newer technology, for example the turretless S-tank, which exhibit low profile , lower weight etc but eventually become obsolete becos it has a lower rate of fire , unable to fire on the move etc.<br><br>Yes, a missile system offer longer range and precision with NLOS targeting but has many disadvantges as well as compare old proven workhorse , the old tank gun.<br><br>The missile will most probably be more expensive than the round a gun, and also less reliable as missile will have dud.

Again...it's secret :p<br><br>Hmmm...Possible future ways of fighting in urban warfARE w/ tanks would be the use of missiles, and the possibility of the missile tank being in service in SAF cannot be discounted, considering range and accuracy it provides. Also, payload can be changed, from the normal AT/AP/HEAT rounds present. Then again, future doctrines may include a mixture of tank based 120mm mortars/arty systems (in place) with light tanks backed by missile guided systems and cover fire by Apaches and AI troopers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SAF with these missiles,the PT-91 Tank will be useless!<br><br>Rafael based in Haifa, Israel, manufacture the Spike family of anti-armour weapons. The weapons are lightweight fire-and-forget anti-tank missiles and use electro-optical and fibre-optic technologies. The systems are used by infantry soldiers, special rapid reaction forces, ground forces and helicopter aircrew.<br>The Spike family includes the Gill and the Spike missiles and is currently in production and in service with the Israeli Defence Force and with the Singapore Armed Forces. In November 1998, Rafael signed a co-operation agreement with EuroSpike (STN ATLAS, Diehl and Rheinmetall) to market, produce, sell and maintain Rafael's anti-armour systems, including the Gill and the Spike in certain European markets. Rafael have also signed an agreement with MBDA (formerly Matra BAe Dynamics) to address the British and some other European and overseas markets.<br><br>System<br><br>The Spike's thermal Command Launch Unit (CLU).<br><br>The Gill and the Spike have the same firing post. The firing post consists of the Command Launch Unit (CLU), the thermal imager and a tripod. The Gill, the shorter range version, is a portable fire and forget anti-armour missile system with a range up to 2.5 kilometres. The Gill uses a charge coupled device (CCD) seeker for day time use or an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker for day and nightime use. Gill can fly with a lofted trajectory enabling the tandem warhead to hit the target at the most vulnerable point. Spike is a portable anti-armour weapon system with a range up to 4 kilometres, which can be operated in fire-and-forget mode and in fire, observe and update mode for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) operations using the fibre optic data link. One soldier can carry two missiles in the back pack and the total system weight is 26 kg.<br><br>The thermal sight unit used with the SPIKE system.<br><br>Operation<br><br>The system is made ready to fire in less than 30 seconds. The soldier acquires the target and lays the cross hairs of the sight on the aim point on the target using either the day sight with a 10 times magnification and 5 degree field of view or the clip-on thermal imaging night sight with wide and narrow fields of view.<br>The soldier activates the missile, locking the tracker on the target and he pushes the Fire button to launch the missile. The missile automatically propels itself towards the target without any additional interaction and this fire and forget capability allows the soldier the option of relocating to a new firing position or to reload immediately for the next engagement. Reloading takes less than 15 seconds.<br><br>After launch the missile follows a lofted trajectory and as it approaches the target it dives down to impact the target. The lofted trajectory and the tandem high explosive warhead enables the missile to penetrate tanks equipped with explosive reactive armour (ERA).<br><br>Missile<br><br>The missile has four rectangular fins for aerodynamic control at the rear, and four wings at just over halfway from nose to tail on the length of the body. They unfold as the missile leaves the launch cannister.<br>The guidance system in the nose of the Gill-Spike missile comprises a charge coupled device (CCD) and Imaging Infra-Red (IIR) seeker. The imaging infrared provides higher sensitivity and improved thermal background rejection characteristics for all weather day and night operation. Gill has a range up to 2,500 metres.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know how many times we have discussed this suggestion about simply replacing SM1 or a tank with a missile based armoured fight vehicle  in the forum, it is simply NOT practical both in war and during peace time.
