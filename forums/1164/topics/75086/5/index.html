It is an APC, and Israel have different types of APCs (mostly indigenously converted from old MBTs) than M113.<br><br>IDF also have other tanks in their inventory, just out of my head I can list the following:<br><br>1.

In terms of actual comparison between the Abrams and the Merkavas, there is no actual guarantee that the Abram is superior to the Israeli's homegrown MBT and the Merkava's unique turret design gives it an advantage in dug-in positions. Furthermore, do not underestimate the M113, especially an IDF M113. The strength of its designs are such that even up to today, countries are still designing derivatives of the M113, such as KFV 2000<br><br>Why not? That the Bionix was even allowed to enter the US Army Interim Armored Vehicle competition shows that it has sufficient merits to recommend a closer look. Furthermore, in terms of firepower, it is a relatively easy though expensive task of upgrading the firepower of the Bionix, through the use of more powerful 30mm cannons, which was reported as being an considered option.<br><br>Another thing, if you have actually read the front of the thread, Singapore does possess MBTs in the form of Centurion MBTs. So this issue about Singapore possessing MBTs is a moot one. Furthermore, I don't think a squadron of Apaches are going to be sufficient to ward off a determined armored thrust. Given the growing sophiscation of air defence weapons, it would be foolhardy for anybody to rely completely on air power to win the day.</strong></div>
