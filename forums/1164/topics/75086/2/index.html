For example, it seems that modern armour technology still can't provide that much protection against oncoming fire; I was quite shocked to see those photos from Gulf War II that showed how even M1s had been disabled by the humble RPG-7.<br><br>Anyway, as for the Rangers - although the Mog was technically a defeat for them, let's not forget that the number of casualties they actually sustained was a paltry 18, compared to over 700 KIAs suffered by Mohammad Aideed's militia.

            <div class='col-md body'>The utilization of unmanned units in future engagements is not a matter of if we can do it, but a matter of it we want to. It is certainly not far fetched, non of the problems we have with them today are due to any fundemental flaws in their operating concept, but a matter of time when technology improves, they will be solved.<br><br>In the end, why do we want to devote a number of resources towards getting unmanned technology? Because it offers a ton of advantages in battle. A UAV can be replaced rapidly, and in many cases cost less then the SAM that shot it down, but to replace a recon scout who had to scout to forward locations just to get a weak view of the enemy is a lot more expensive, harder, and drains our labour pool.<br><br>Micro UAVs can even be one of the tools used by our recon scouts to find out what's ahead of him, it will certainly improve their line of sight.<br><br>It's far from far fetched, it's like saying using missiles to arm our aircraft is far fetched because we have to create a whole new class of workers to handle their related issues. No, when you do the math, the cost is more then worth it.<br><br>In the end why do we want a networked army with unmanned eyes? Because the army that can see through the fog of war better, and diffuse the information along to the right people faster, will be the one who will ultimately respond faster, make better and more informed desisions, and outwit a slower, blinder opponent, which as anyone can see, will be a great advantage for the side which holds these cards.<br><br>In a battle soldiers would certainly like to know where that sniper is, or were that machine gun position is instantly over a network via imaging software instead of somebody risking their lives to relate that information by voice, or better, using such networked technology to take out the threat without even having a LOS to it. Like send a non-LOS missile tied in to an aquostic or microradar sniper detection system to a sniper nest without even exposing yourself.<br><br>Worth it? Certainly. We should not shy away from developing these technologies because of the cost, but put more resources into them to make sure when cruch time comes, we are as far forward of the field as we can.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by panzerjager:</div><div class="quote_body">In response to this in-lieu of spencer99's 10.23am post on 7 Apr in the same thread:<br><br>In fact, Russian style modern MBTs are by most if not all accounts, more agile than any of the Western style MBTs, primarily because of their prevailing ex-Soviet doctrine in the employment of MBTs, i.e.<br>in an offensive role, tank maneuvers involving charging down relentlessly headlong towards the mission objective, ignoring enemy resistance.  This is quite unlike Western style tactics in which mopping up operations are carried out progressively along the line of advance.  In essence, the Russians had harnessed the true purpose of the tank...<br><br>So in the light of using the tank in this way, the Russians preferred their tanks to be light but powerful enough to provide the charge, and making them cheap and in numbers helps in the curtain effect in overwhelming the enemy.  This ultimately meant that Russians traded away a lot of protection to achieve this.  Which is why Russian MBTs are normally seen with add-on reactive armour to circumvent their inherent lack of protection.<br><br>So do not underestimate the potential value of Russian style MBTs used by potential adversaries against us.  Unfortunately our own military is still too steeped in the Western style of warfare tactics to allow for a radical paradigm shift in their own doctrines.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well.... Russian style MBTs still possess a very fundemental problem when it comes to surrounding terrains and that is their weight. At 44.5 tonnes, the T-72S, which I am using as the base unit for comparison is just too heavy for the soil around, let alone the road. In dry weather, it might be able to transverse ground but when it comes to wet weather, the MBT will sink into the ground, being bogged in by the wet soil! There is a reason why the SAF has stuck to light vehicles to date! At 21.5 tonnes, the Bionix,  is the heaviest vehicle used in the SAF Armor Corps, not including the Centurions which are not part of the regular armor formations. For Russian style MBTs to be used against Singapore, they would have to transverse their own terrain in order to reach us, which would be a task all on its own. If they get bogged down, which is extremely possible, our own armor units just bypass them to strike at vital areas, cutting own their supply lines. If any do reach us, Apache Longbow supported by Milans and Spikes take them out before they can do any harm.<br><br>Another point I would like to bring up is that merely purchasing MBTs is well and good but to maintain them is a totally different ball game. To keep an MBT running in the humid conditions of Southeast Asia a year from the date of purchase is no easy feat. Anybody can buy an MBT but to keep it capable of combat missions entails good base support. Thus, it is not merely the strategies but the ability to keep the simple things running that is what differentiates a good army from a mediocre army.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bot_in_shop:</div><div class="quote_body">Well.... Russian style MBTs still possess a very fundemental problem when it comes to surrounding terrains and that is their weight. At 44.5 tonnes, the T-72S, which I am using as the base unit for comparison is just too heavy for the soil around, let alone the road. In dry weather, it might be able to transverse ground but when it comes to wet weather, the MBT will sink into the ground, being bogged in by the wet soil! There is a reason why the SAF has stuck to light vehicles to date! At 21.5 tonnes, the Bionix,  is the heaviest vehicle used in the SAF Armor Corps, not including the Centurions which are not part of the regular armor formations. For Russian style MBTs to be used against Singapore, they would have to transverse their own terrain in order to reach us, which would be a task all on its own. If they get bogged down, which is extremely possible, our own armor units just bypass them to strike at vital areas, cutting own their supply lines. If any do reach us, Apache Longbow supported by Milans and Spikes take them out before they can do any harm.<br><br>Another point I would like to bring up is that merely purchasing MBTs is well and good but to maintain them is a totally different ball game. To keep an MBT running in the humid conditions of Southeast Asia a year from the date of purchase is no easy feat. Anybody can buy an MBT but to keep it capable of combat missions entails good base support. Thus, it is not merely the strategies but the ability to keep the simple things running that is what differentiates a good army from a mediocre army. </div></blockquote>Actually, BIONIX is not the heaviest in SAF armour, armoured engineers' CEV and AVLB are already MLC 60 (as opposed to BX's MLC 30), utilizing M60 chassis, noting the yellow circular numbered sign on the vehicle fender.<br><br>And these armoured engineer vehicles are supposed to be in the frontline, not in the rear as popularly believed and understood.  Meaning that if Russian-style MBTs of 40-tonne class are going to be bogged down, these 60-tonne behemoths will be worse!  Furthermore the powerpacks on these non-MBTs do not possess as great a power-to-weight as those used on the Russian MBTs - imagine regular diesel engines vs gas turbines.  Of course the fuel economy will be a big question but my argument is to counter the notion that Russian-style MBTs could be bogged down in SEA terrain.  And my stand is that they will not be as affected as any of the current latest generation of Western MBTs, even with gas-turbined Abrams.  Because the Abrams will still have to deal with its own ground pressure vs, say, a typical Russian MBT - lighter with probably the same ground pressure<br><br></div>

However, what I do feel is that Singapore's solution does not lie with the MBT route... The SEA terrain is one that is extremely difficult for MBTs to function at will. For the SAF to use MBTs, the SAF Armor Corps would then have to give up its ability to conduct rapid manuevers, giving up 'mobility'! Either Russian or Western-style MBTs would still face that same problem.<br><br>Light tanks from my point of view are preferable to MBTs for their ease of passage through the surrounding terrain, allowing the armor corps to surprise the enemy where it never expects to face armor units! The XM8 would have been good. Too bad the program was cancelled... The AMX 10 PAC 90 was a move in replacing the SM1 but too bad it failed.</div>

It could boil down to novel chemical processes to contain sticky goo in stable, compacted form in the rounds, which upon detonation by air-bursting fuse, the substrates could rapidly react with the onset of immediate exposure to ambient atmosphere in a self-forging manner, expanding in micro-seconds to form the required aereal expanse for encapsulating target area.  Coupled with automatic firing rates of cannon/grenades to achieve a blanket effect.<br><br>This process could be further developed for the case of employing entrapment netting within the space available for cannon/grenade ammo.</div>
