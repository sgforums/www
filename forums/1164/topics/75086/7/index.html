            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Joe Black:<br>I don't know how many times we have discussed this suggestion about simply replacing SM1 or a tank with a missile based armoured fight vehicle  in the forum, it is simply NOT practical both in war and during peace time. How many times do we have to re-iterate the arguments before before can be convinced that doing away direct fire platform with Spike firing platform is impractical.<br><br>1. Each spike missile cost a lot more than a tank shell. I can't see the justification to use a spike missile to destroy a bunker or an APC.</blockquote> oh so true<br><blockquote><br>2. How many spike can 1 AFV carry compared to the number of tank shells? The logistic support for the spike launcher, storage tubes, place and the missiles are far greater than the tank shells. Thus, once again, less "rounds" per vehicle.<br></blockquote>very true however the tank could have other things like rockets or RPG's<br><blockquote><br>3.  Rate of fire... A 120mm gun can fire much faster rate than the number of spikes that can be launched. Don't have the exact fire, but I suspect, one can't fire more than 2 Spike per minute, whereas, the 120mm gun has a norm of 6 rounds per minute.<br></blockquote>Well the new spike it meant to replace the hellfire for the Israel army i think....so it shld work like the hellfire where u can fire of 1 missile every 4 seconds or so.....meaning a much higher rate of fire<br><blockquote><br>4. Fire on the move for 120mm gun that is stabalised can be as high as 80-90% accurate. Try firing a spike on the move - impractical or even impossible.</blockquote>once again taking it to be  like the hell fire if it can be fired from a AH-64 and from bronco's then i doubt it'd be a problem.<br><br><blockquote><br>5. Doctrine has to change. Even the most advanced armies in the world, namely the US Army, IDF, British Army or even the German Army do not have such radical ideas. Look at US Army next generation armoured vehicle, still gun based. Same goes with the rest of the armies in the world. In fact the Germans were toying with 140mm gun.  I wonder whose "bright" idea within the armour units came up with the "brilliant" missiles firing AFV to replace gun-based and that the BG Tan could buy into such ideas.</blockquote>The US army , British army and German army once toyed around with that idea but found out that it was not practical as it would be too expensive and not as good so they scrapped it and decided to upgrade their tanks.<br>It was to be something like the Bradleybut with a 30-75mm gun and carried some 16 missiles?read about it long ago lah but yea even those guys found it useless how can the SAF consider it?!dunno wad they thinking also....but then that was 10-20 years ago maybe times have changed but i doubt it</div>

The visual effect from target point of view is that the launch platform is totally shrouded in the exhaust plumes of the whole barrage of munitions.  The munitions may be course-updated to either engage individual targets or all massed upon one single target.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BMP-3 TRACKED INFANTRY COMBAT VEHICLE, RUSSIA<br><br>The main armament of the BMP-3 is a 100mm 2A70 semi-automatic rifled gun/missile launcher, which is stabilised in two axes and can fire either 3UOF HE-FRAG (High Explosive-Fragmentation) rounds or 3UBK10 anti-tank guided missiles. Effective range for the HE-FRAG round is 4,000m. Muzzle velocity is 250m/s. 22 HE-FRAG rounds can be carried in the automatic loader, total ammunition load being 40 rounds. Rate of fire is 10 rounds per minute.<br><br>The gun fires the 3UBK10 anti-tank guided missile round, which consists of the 9M117 laser beamriding missile and container. This missile is used in the Bastion missile system (NATO designation AT-10 Stabber). The missile can engage tanks with explosive reactive armour (ERA) as well as slow, low-flying targets such as helicopters. Range is 100 to 4,000m. Hit probability is given as at least 0.8 with armour penetration of 600mm. Ammunition load is 8 rounds.<br><br>Armament also includes a 30mm 2A72 automatic gun, stabilised in two axes, which fires 3UOR-6 and 3UOR-8 rounds. Ammunition load is 500 AP (Armour-Piercing) or HE-FRAG rounds. Rate of fire is more than 300 rounds/min and range is 1,500 to 2,000m. There are also one 7.62mm PKT coaxial machine gun and two 7.62 bow machine guns.<br><br>SELF-PROTECTION<br><br>The BMP-3 can be fitted with the Arena Defensive Aids suite, developed by KBM Kolumna. The system consists of target detection and tracking radar, computer and processing unit and protective ammunition. The system is automatic: the radar passes tracking data to the computer, which selects the number of ammunition rounds and controls firing. The selected ammunition is then expelled as a directed field. The vehicle can also be fitted with the Shtora defensive aids system which counters anti-tank guided weapons with SACLOS (semi-automatic command-to-line-of-sight).<br><br>The hull and turret are constructed from aluminium alloy armour. Protection also includes steel external straps fitted on the turret, side armour displacement panels and a double-bottom at the front of the vehicle. NBC equipment includes a filter ventilation unit as well as hermetic sealing. This system is located in the rear of the vehicle, as is the ejection cooling system which, coupled with the reduced length of the gas ventilation system exhaust, serves to reduce the tank's thermal signature.<br><br>FIRE CONTROL AND OBSERVATION<br><br>The fire control system is automatic with manual override for both gunner and commander. It includes a 1V539 ballistic computer, 2E52 electro-mechanical armament stabiliser and 1D16 laser rangefinder. The gunner has a 1K13-2 main sight, a combined image-intensified day/night sight and PPD-1 standby day sight. The commander has a 1PZ-10 day sight and TKN-3 combined day and image-intensified night sight.<br><br>The French company SAGEM, with Kurganmashzavod and Peleng of Belarus, have developed the Namut thermal sight for the BMP-3.

Transmission is hydromechanical with a hydrostatic gearbox for the steering gear and power take-off for the water jets.<br><br>The BMP-3 vehicle weighs 18.7t and is capable of a maximum speed of 70km/h and range of 600km on roads.<br><br><img src="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/bmp-3/bmp-31.html"><br><br><img src="http://www.army-technology.com/projects/bmp-3/bmp-33.html"><br><br>This one better can fire missile and rounds,lighter than MBT,carry infantry ,ALL IN ONE!</div></blockquote>Sometimes just wonder how the Russians do it...packing all that ammo!  BIONIX itself only has 260 rds of cannon ammo onboard and this guy has almost double for the same calibre, and that's just the secondary armament!  BMP3 is a technical marvel in terms of firepower and mobility, but protection is lowdown of course...</div>

No Abrams MBTs-like as the core<br>- This is due to forestted terrain with hills and mountains, and rubber plantations.  There is little open plain for heavy MBT-operations.  For strategic terrain, can call in your Tempests if they do fit, e.g. open highways<br>- Now because of the forestted terrain and mountains, etc. visibility is limited.<br><br><strong>Hypothesised Conclusions</strong><br>Given the facts:<br>- SAF wants a light-med armour tank to be able to operate in rubber plantation-like enviro.<br>- But light-med = relatively less protection<br>- As visibility is limited, the answer might lie in being able to destroy the enemy before you even see them, hence the indirect fire idea.<br>- Light tank = cannot carry heavy calibre shell weapons.  The famous Sheredian is one such example (despite that, it remained in service for almost 20-30 years!); hence the idea of missiles thought they are expensive.<br>- Also, missiles are guided - hence accuracy goes up and chances of being detected by the enemy is less (less smoke, noise, etc.).  You do not wish to miss a P-91 on yr 1st shot and face its 125mm gun.<br><br><strong>Hypothesised gun system</strong><br>- Likely to be a 120mm gun / mortar system<br>- Else a short barrel, low recoil 155mm gun<br><br>- 120mm could fire Israel LAHAT round / SPIKE missiles.<br>- There are guided / autonomous 120mm mortar rounds in the market.<br><br>- For 155mm, can fire autonomous BONUS / SMART cargo rounds...<br>- With 155mm, can fire missiles aka Sheredian...<br><br>Southpark<br>The Dude</div>
