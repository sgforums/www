However, I do sincerely hope that they will eventually be upgraded with Hunter-Killer capability, active defensive suite (liken the one installed on Merk 4 or Swedish CV90-120), reactive armour and a new powerful engine to increase the weight to power ratio so that the new MBT will be able to move just as fast as the Bionix and the new light tank.<br><br>Anyway just my opinion.

Anyways, yeah, I havent even seen the tempest before, though a close gauge of them would be something like what the swedes did to theirs.<br><br>As for the "new" MBT.  I agree about the effect of rain having on the soil.  However, some of the points taken into consideration would probably have to do with the wide surface area and low turret profiles.  The wider the surface area the tracks come in contact with the ground, the less pressure on it.  And honestly speaking, MBTs may have limited use in such area, but they would have better use in other "reinforced" terrain.<br><br>I don't wanna start another discussion about MBTs in fibua environments.  Just realise that MBTs have changed much since the days of the Coldwar.</div>

Do you think the ISA is really bothered with a bunch of idiots discussing about hearsays and unconfirmed "sightings" that we have such and such 'toys' in the SAF? Here's how everyone hear sounds...."Hey you know ah the other day my Ah Kong tell me he saw a Galactic Starship Destroyer take off from Paya Lebar Air Base leh. He saw photon torpedoes being transported into the base too!".<br>I mean come on I can come here and spread a load of crap and people will still lap it up. So how will our neighbours know what's true and what's not? Get a life man...and drop this espionage "on need to know basis" act. </div></blockquote>how do u know that they know?<br>the key word is  "maybe"..maybe they know..maybe they dont..<br>we rather be on the safe side..dun get it?<br>ask your ah kong lor...since your ah kong saw the Starship..guess he is quite senile still... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>weird eh..<br>is this assuming? assume thing can get u killed..<br>its a joke to u..not to us..if u cant stick with it..go some other forum n post..dun come here..this is not the place for u..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

However, it is also good news that US Airborne troops will be acutally using the 8 M8 AGS as an interim light tank. Finally someone come to their senses to know that the 81st and 101 really need something after loosing the M551.  M8 will finally get to see some real world ops. I think this is probably the best time for SAF to "acquire" M8 or part of it, like the chassis or the turret (or even its 120mm gun turret derivative called Thunderbolt).<br><br>I'm sure UD would like to use this opportunity to sell some, perhaps to SAF and who knows even Taiwan or Thailand <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>on one hand, I understand the govt reason to keep the mbt secret for national interest. on the other hand, I hope that such information can be released to the public, the majority of nsmen still thinks that singapore cannot be defended, even those highly educated ones, they have not much interest in military affairs and does not bother much about anything beyond their ict and ippt. worse is these big bunch of idiots go around telling how inferior singapore's armed forces are. nowadays singapore is full of foreigners and they really believe what is being told. they say that our armour is inferior becos we are still using amx-13 these days. and its true that public will think this way as these tanks were around with us for almost 35 years.<br>I really hope next year's ndp parade at padang we will get to see something new, 35 years ago when the amx-13 was paraded for the 1st time singaporeans were assured of their safety as they know that the island is protected by our own armour, so on our 40th birthday, I hope new generations of singaporeans will have this feeling again.</div>
