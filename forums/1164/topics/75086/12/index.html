            <div class='col-md body'>It was ranked 9th. The production rating factor pulled it down heavily. However the experts did comment tat the merkava is currently probably the safest tank out there. Its design had spared a thought for the tank crews and there's even a emergency hatch behind the tank for the crew to escape shld the tank be wrecked. Futhermore the crew is situated right in the middle of the tank, with its engine placed in front so the possibility of the crew getting out of the tank alive is high.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry first time discovered this forum... WTF? US abolishing tank fleet? omg... they just signed a document to send them to hell on their own will. Anyway i think every country needs MBTs . They offer a lot of protection for infantry and light vehicles. Besides their massive main gun packs a heavy punch. FOr singapore i guess we should concentrate on Russian tanks as they are lighter and faster with adequate firepower. M1's in SG? not likely... abit difficult to maintain but i wont be surprised if we get 2nd hand ones after US sells it fleet away(again i must say... stupid f**ks) then we buy and mod the hell out to our needs... this way not so bad... M1 armour i like... offer alot of protection. Don't know about other tanks but Russian tanks are the winner to me... i think getting the new T-95 if it happens would be great.<br><br>Pardon me for my lack of knowledge but i just want to state that tanks are vital to an army... they give infantry support and morale... imagine having firefight and losing then all u see is Light Strike Vehicles, Stryker or Bradley when the army has like T-72s or Challengers. Siao liao lor. with the T-72s speed can rush the whole battlefield down. Artillery with their mobility might be useless.. Okay if say CAS then just shoot smoke lor... Planes see nothing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually you have a valid point there. Wonder what is the respective combat weight of the M60 MBT and engineer vehicles.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually M60A2 or A3 rumours had been around since I was in primary school (that is at least 2 decades ago). Judging by the thai experiences in using the M60 in the Laos and Mymanese border crashes, the M60 is a very rugged and battleproven weapon system, by the way Thai M60 belongs to the basic models. The only problem that they faced is that the Thai M60 could only be deployed easily in the mountainous North West regions in the dry seasons.<br><br>Thus, there is one incident that the Thai border guards ran into problem in containing some XXX nation intruder in the monsoon period. The M60 could not be deployed due to soft muddy tracks. In the end, the Thai had to deploy all their 6 units of AH-1W cobras to suspress the border intrusion.<br><br>We can see that M60 can certainly be used in jungles effective in right condition. We have operate the M60 CEV in SAF for at least 2 decades. We should have a good knowledge base to mod the vehicles, and the sources of the M60 chassic is readily available. Using the modern tech, we can mod the M60 using low recoil guns coupled in a new low profile turrets and new tracks and transmission to improve the weight and mobility performance. That could expand the operation envelope of the M60 beyond the M60A3 standard with our friends from Nation X.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How about buying Stingray II light tank??? It's basically an upgraded version of Stingray light tank which our good neighbour Thailand owns. It has improved target engagement capabilities, superior mobility and agility, better survivability than the earlier version. It's weight is about the same as Bionix IFV, a slight increase over current AMX-13SM light tank. Soft ground will not be a big problem. Main armament is definitely better than AMX-13SM's 90mm. Performance wise, range, speed slope, power is better compare to AMX-13SM, on par with the Twardys in some aspect. Already in production, we can perhaps get it before the Polish tanks arrive in the region. Only problem is that a loader is required, whereas other more advanced machines use automatic loader. In terms of design, Stingray II is also not bad, as nice as Leclerc MBT. Below are some of the specs of Stingray II...<br><br>Specifications<br><br>Armour Protection -------- 23mm frontal. Higher protection avail as option.<br>Gross Vehicle Weight ---- 22,600kg.<br>Crew ------------------------ 4 crew (commander, gunner, driver, loader).<br>Speed (road) -------------- 70km/h.<br>Range (at 48km/h) ------ 525km.<br>Slope ------------------------ 60% (climbable gradient), 40% (side).<br>Trench ---------------------- 2.13m.<br>Water fording ------------- 1.07m.<br>Engine ---------------------- Detroit Diesel 8V92 TA, 410kW &amp; 550hp at 2,300rpm.<br>Transmission -------------- Allison XTG 411.<br><br>Primary Armament ------------- NATO standard 105mm low recoil force gun.<br>Secondary Armament --------- 7.62mm coaxial mounted machine gun.<br>Supplementary Armament --- commander's 12.7mm mounted machine gun.<br>Ancillary Armament ------------ Smoke grenade launchers, 16 tubes (8 per side).<br>Gunner's Optics --------- Hughes Hire Day/Night thermal, dual axis stabilised sight with laser range finder.<br>Commander's Optics --- 7 periscopes and remote video display of gunner's thermal sight image.<br>Fire Control -------------- CDC digital fire control system.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something about armor kits for Bradleys..<br><br>$37.8M Adds More Israeli Reactive Armor for M2/M3 Bradleys<br><br>Posted 08-Jul-2005 09:32<br><br>Related stories: Americas - USA, Contracts - Awards, Contracts - Modifications, Design Innovations, General Dynamics, Middle East - Israel, Other Corporation, Project Successes, Tanks &amp; Mechanized<br>Also on this day: 08-Jul-2005 Â»<br><br><img src="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/LAND_Reactive_Armor_Rafael.jpg"><br>LAND_Reactive_Armor_Rafael.jpg<br><br>General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products Inc. in Burlington, VT received a $37.8 million modification to a firm-fixed-price contract for Reactive Applique Armor Tiles for the M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle System. The Bradleys and AAV7 APCs, which played a central role in the armed operations in Iraq, have been fitted with armor by Rafael of Haifa, Israel in partial cooperation with the American General Dynamics company.<br><br>The armor is some of the most advanced in the world, and includes both passive protection of strong material that diverts the rocket, and reactive protection comprised of plates that contain explosives. The add-on armor consists of 105 tiles that attach to the sides, the turret and the front of each Bradley. The tiles, which look like small boxes, contain a very special, insensitive explosive that is detonated only when hit by a missile or rocket and does not react to other heat sources such as small arms or other fragments. The resulting explosion disrupts the incoming, armor-penetrating gas jet produced by a RPG's shaped-charge warhead, for example, so the Bradley remains unharmed.<br><br>The US Army is very pleased with the results, according a release from the US Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems (PEO-GCS), and Rafael's performance and delivery won it a letter of recognition from the U.S. Army. The rush deliveries were part of the US military's effort to slow the damage done by roadside mines, explosive charges and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) in Iraq.<br><br>Rafael first began applying reactive armor technology immediately after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when the Israeli military realized its older-model tanks were vulnerable to missiles and rockets. Israel became the world's first army to use reactive armor, but kept it secret until Syrian forces captured an Israeli tank in Lebanon.<br><br>Since then, Rafael has continuously improved its technology and applied it to numerous programs in Israel and abroad. Rafael has been working with General Dynamics since 1994 to provide reactive armor sets for the U.S. Army Bradleys.<br><br>The team received an earlier $19.4 million order from the U.S. Army's TACOM / ARDEC Picatinny Arsenal, covering procurement of 56 reactive armor vehicle sets and 170 partial sets for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. That contract also included funding for the qualification and first-article testing of a product upgrade to further improve crew and vehicle survivability over the current design.<br><br>Work on this contract modification will be performed in Haifa, Israel (38%), Burlington, VT (36%), Lyndonville, VT (13%), Graham, KY (6%), and Albany, OR (7%) and is expected to be complete by Oct. 31, 2006. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This was a sole source contract initiated on April 21, 2005. The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command in Picatinny Arsenal, NJ issued the contract (W15QKN-05-C-1166).</div>
