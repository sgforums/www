            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>anyone here know what MBT SAF is using? I know about the lousy WWII era Centurion MBTs upgraded with Israeli equipment. But I heard rumours that we have a modern MBT with a 120mm gun. There aren't many 120mm out there right? I'm not sure cause I'm not a tank nut. It definitely can't be the M1A1 so that leaves the British Challenger, Merkava Mk III or maybe the German Leopard or even the French LeClerc??? Ok that's about all the 120mm tanks I know. Correct me if there's an error in the 120mm tanks. Cause I'm not too sure. Oh is it true the SAF centurions are painted in olive green and always covered with canvas? I'm just really curious about the tanks since the AMX-13SM1 can't be our only tank. In reality I don't even think its a tank. It seems to be built more like a tank destroyer. What do you guys think?

            <div class='col-md body'>I apologise for not answering the question as I seriously don't know the answer...  However, I have been following this topic keenly and this is my POV:<br><br>Good point about the support elements which will go in with the MBTs.  Not much point just slugging it out with just tanks.  It needs to be a combined arms team with infantry, artillery, close air support (CAS) and engineer support.  Send in a battalion of MBTs without support into a battle and they will be decimated.<br><br>This would mean that our future MBT (and I think it will be a matter of time) should be able to work with the various elements we already have now.  We already have self-propelled artillery, the AH-64D Apache and the Bionix IFV so the next step will be a tank which could work with the other elements.<br><br>Frankly, I think what we need is a Mobile Gun System (MGS such as the US Stryker) rather than a full-fledged MBT.  The XM8 Buford would have been a good choice but that fell victim to budget cuts.  Alternatively, we could also pick up 1st generation M1 Abrams (like what Australia recently did) and modify the hack out of them and we will still have a tank which is far superior to what our neighbours have.<br><br>Any counter-arguments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from my point of view, MBTs are actually quite 'useless' especially when u talk about defending singapore... firstly, urban combat is something every tanker fears... the possibility of a soldier hanging out from a window with an rpg is just too likely... what we can do is to have light tanks like the south african Stingray... i'm not that sure about the stingray's origin, but yep, it's a light tank with a 105mm cannon and sophisticated firing control system... light tanks with big guns will be more suited for our regions terrain, but there is always the consideration of maintenance and recoil forces and stuff like that... i rest my case..</div>

Tanks are best employed with the Blitzkrieg tactics. But with the poliferation of ATGMs, I believe that a mix of Tanks, AFVs and Armoured Infantry is the best solution, speed, firepower, 360 degree protection (ie, infantry protects Tanks and AFVs from anti-tank guys, tanks and AFVs protect AI from GPMGs.<br><br>Urban warfare is a totally different cattle of fish in my POV.

            <div class='col-md body'>For a Hi-tech armed force, urban battle will negate the advantages that you have in terms of material and technology. Look how the Rangers got mauled in the streets of "Mog" in Somalia.<br><br>If you are "low-tech", you would want to play urban to minimize your disadvantage in Technology. That is what Saddam try to do in GW II, but unfortunately his forces melt away without much of a resistance.<br><br>If you are "Hi-tech", like US and to some extend SAF (compared to our neighbours), you will want to avoid urban combat.<br><br>You would want to play to your own strengths if possible. A pure conventional battle like Gulf War I illustrate how a hi-tech force can crush a low-tech opponent.<br><br>I don't think the SAF will buy a MBT that will be suited for urban warfare or useful in defending Spore, for the pure reason that the MBT will be be "utilized" in Singapore (not classified info please read Tom Huxley). If it happen to be suited for urban, good. But I don't think that is much of a priority.<br><br>As for the weight of MBTs being too heavy for roads in the region, this is a peacetime consideration only. In war who cares!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I understand, the Rangers got into trouble because their political masters didn't allow them to bring heavy firepower into the Mog. They were too lightly equipped for their mission.<br><br>Maybe that's the root of the problem - maybe what's needed to boost your chances of winning a FIBUA action is lots of armoured vehicles and heavy firepower: armoured vehicles to provide your troops with some protection and mobility, and firepower to smash a particularly stubborn enemy to pieces with sheer brute force, e.g. wrecking or even collapsing a building in which enemy forces are strongly holed up.<br><br>Of course, this isn't a foolproof solution, either. For example, it seems that modern armour technology still can't provide that much protection against oncoming fire; I was quite shocked to see those photos from Gulf War II that showed how even M1s had been disabled by the humble RPG-7.<br><br>Anyway, as for the Rangers - although the Mog was technically a defeat for them, let's not forget that the number of casualties they actually sustained was a paltry 18, compared to over 700 KIAs suffered by Mohammad Aideed's militia. They acquitted themselves rather well, all things considered.</div>

If the roads collapse under the weight of your tanks, your vehicles' mobility will be appreciably reduced, and if the ground beneath the road has been extensively excavated for urban architecture like pipes, electrical and telephone lines, etc, you may find your tanks getting stuck in the ground!<br><br>Obviously, this will be less of a problem with respect to, say, roads in rural areas, but in urban or suburban areas, where the ground has been hollowed out quite a bit to make way for considerable underground construction, it would be a real issue.<br><br>And then of course, there's also the problem of bridging - most bridges in this part of the world, which is dominated by rural terrain, are simply not designed to bear the weight of 40-50 ton MBTs.<br><br>In Europe and the Middle East (the theatres of war in which most MBTs have been designed to operate), this is not really a problem because there is enough open terrain such that MBTs can forego the roads and just travel cross country. In SE Asia, which is mostly forested, this is clearly not an option.</div>

Would it then render the vechicle useless as it seems like the optical TV/sight is use predominately for driving and target acquisition? If the enemies hit that mast the very first thing from any direction, wouldn't it make the  MULE vehicle essentially unguidable?

Even the upcoming potentially advantageous micro-UAVs are not significant improvements in themselves.<br><br>Things being that these current technology UAVs give themselves away immediately upon discovery - why?  Because to the enemy, they look like they don't belong and deserve to be blasted away immediately.  And the enemy does not need to see them in order to know they're around - their powerplants are noisy enough.<br><br>The ultimate UAVs (or even UGVs) will be those that totally look (and sound) benign - things that look natural and blend in with the environment, e.g. for UAVs, could be as small as housflies and look (and fly if possible) exactly like them, allowing them to actually penentrate enemy strongholds with impunity to scout them out.<br><br>Then, for UGVs, could be a 'stray dog' or 'stray cat' embedded with sensor and motor implants to be controlled by remote.  To add to realism, such UAVs/UGVs could even interact with enemy entities and environments in order to 'coerce' them into inadvertently  divulging of additional valuable information<br><br></div>
