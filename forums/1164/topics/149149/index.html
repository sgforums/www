            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a very interesting development in hand grenade technology. Smaller and lighter than our SFG87, but more lethal. Has ball bearing glued to the outside of the body to increase lethality.<br><br><img src="http://www.copybook.com/images/publications/ArmedInt/articleimages/ruag8.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.copybook.com/publications/article.asp?pubID=15&amp;artID=1562" rel="nofollow">http://www.copybook.com/publications/article.asp?pubID=15&amp;artID=1562</a><br><br>In my entire length of service I've used only one real live frag grenade. Anyone did more?<br><br>I remember the distant crump of grenades exploding as we were marching to the safety hut at the grenade range.<br><br>There has never been a more quiet bunch of recruits than those about to throw their first grenade. Even the platoon clowns were not telling jokes that day.<br><br>While we waited in the safety hut for our turn to throw, something hit the corrugated roof of our hut from one of the exploding grenades. And we were quite far away from the actual explosions. Although it was probably nothing more than a pebble, it brought home the seriousness of the task at hand.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think experience with real grenades in SAF is too inadequate. We are very familiar with all our other weapons except the hand grenade. Once we threw a smoke grenade while assaulting up a small hill but the thing hit a branch and rolled back down to smoke us out. This shows how little experience we have with hand-thrown ordnance. Imagine if it was a real frag.<br><br>I've thrown a lot of thunder flashes but these are too far from the real thing.<br><br>For FIBUA we used a grenade simulator that was very realistic. It looked, weigh and worked exactly like a grenade. It's basically a iron ball with holes in in. You screw on a new "head" (for lack of a better word) every time.<br><br>This "head" is like that on a real grenade with the lever, safety clip, safety pin and a fuse. Basically after pulling out the pin and throwing it, the lever flies off, the fuse burns and then explode with a bang that's louder than a thunderflash.<br><br>After using, the "head" is unscrewed, the expended fuse is replaced with a new one and the head screwed back on.<br><br>Great for FIBUA where you can easily retrieve this but now for other ops in the field where once thrown cannot be found.<br><br>ST should really look into producing expendable exploding blank grenades.<br><br>Either that or we should go to the grenade range once every year.</div>
