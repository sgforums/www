            <div class='col-md body'>Suppresion of Enemy Air Defences<br><br>"During the early days of the Vietnam War, the United States Air Force had almost full autonomy over the skies of Vietnam. However, once the Soviet Union and China began arming the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), with advanced Surface to Air missile (SAM) systems, the U.S. domination of the skies was abrubtly challenged. To deal with the new SAM threat, the U.S. Air Force decided to dedicate men and machine exclusively to the SAMÂ’s. Thus a new breed of aviator and aircraft were born, the Â“Wild Weasels.Â”<br><br>The purpose of the Â“WeaselsÂ” was to seek out and engage NVA SAM sites, and if possible destroy them. Often times though, the only way the Weasel pilots could locate a SAM site was by getting the NVA to fire a SAM at them, thus revealing their position. Tantamount to a suicide mission, the Weasel missions were amongst the most dangerous sorties of the war. Losses in the Weasel squadrons were among the highest of the war. In the early stages of the Weasel development, the aircraft and its avionics were not ideally suited for this new and dangerous mission. However as the war progressed, the U.S. Air Force developed a dedicated Weasel aircraft, the Republic F-105G Thunderchief. The Â“ThudÂ” as it is affectionately known to the pilots who flew it, is recognized as the workhorse of the Vietnam War. The men who flew the F-105 love the airplane and from all accounts the aircraft performed superbly throughout the war.<br><br>One such Wild Weasel is retired U.S. Air Force Colonel George Acree. Colonel Acree flew the F-105 both as a bomber and a Weasel aircraft. With over 200 missions over North Vietnam to his credit, Colonel Acree was one of a different breed of men. Colonel Acree and the other Weasel pilots flew the most dangerous missions of the war and did so with courage, honor and professionalism. Putting aside the nasty politics that governed the Vietnam War, the Weasel pilots accepted their mission and carried it out faithfully. The men who flew the Weasel missions in the Vietnam War did so to a varying degree of success, but they paved the way for the Wild Weasel program to become a major part of the modern day United States Air Force."<br><br>from http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/vietnam/airpower/wildweasel.aspx<br><br>more modern "wild weasels" kill SAMs using AGM-88 HARMs (high speed anti-radiation missiles), which are missiles that home in on the radar emissions of the SAM fire control radars.<br><br>just wondering, does the RSAF have any aircraft or squadrons that are specifically tasked for SEAD? and does the RSAF have any anti-radiation missiles in our inventory?</div>

You'd rather risk a few multi-million dollar aircraft to take out those AA guns and Short-range SAMs?<br><br>I remind you now that a commando team, armed with the right equipment, can do as much damage as a flight of dedicated SEAD aircraft.

And yes the EF-111 is a SEAD aircraft but not a delicated one. The EA-6 which have the capability to discrupt and destroy is IMO a delicated SEAD plane.<br><br>Back to my point on 'other fighters', it mean other fighters of the RSAF.</div>

This variant is suppose to be the EW fighter of the F/A-18 Superhornet family. It will replace the EA-6 that's in US naval aviation service now. That was what i read years ago, but i do believe the situation is unchanged. It was envisioned that the naval air arms will be operating only 3 or 4 platforms when most of the 70s era aircrafts are retired.<br><br>and i don't quite agree with using bombers for SEAD. we should be using precision strike instead of indiscriminate area suppression.<br><br>and if i'm not wrong, f5 is still in the interception role and a4 the strike/CAS role. f16c/d, i think, were bought with an eye toward deep interdiction/SEAD capacity. let me know if i'm wrong<br></div>
