It is a combine effort. However SOF and grunt are extremely useful is flushing those that are unseen by SEAD aircraft and need not say, they provide good intelligence.<br><br>What happen in Kosovo was that, those SAM pieces (largely the mobile ones) that are difficult to track almost single handledly cause the SAM crisis there. So u see, for such systems which can pose great threat to our aircraft, we need grunts to be down there to flush them out, sometimes even before a major sortie can begin. As i had said before, it is best that they enter and locate the tangos before the war and make the destruction of those systems (together with other crucial pieces) the declaration for ultimo ratio regis.</div>

But you don't have exact fix on them, so you send in teams of SpecOps. 1st you need time to do insertion, of course will be inserted way outside the AD zone, so let say 10km out. SpecOps have to march 10km to place and then still have to search ! What I am saying is why the ADs are there in the 1st place, they must be defending some very important units like armor or infantries bns. So what the chance of your SpecOps wandering around and not engage any units ? even if they avoid everyone, how can they time their attack together, for once 1 AD is hit, the rest will be alerted to intruders.<br><br>What I am saying is in this case it is faster and easier to use SEAD planes to do the job. Imagine if you fly 3 helicopter to insert troops, I could have flown 2 SEAD mission already. By the time the troops moving to 10Km into zone, I would have flown a few more SEAD to take out the rest ADs already, and ground strikes can already hit enemy troops on the ground, with my armour and infantry Bns already move forward.  I would instead use the SpecOps to look for the ground amour or infantry bns, to direct air strikes on them instead.<br><br>Thinking that Iraq Scub hunting is like hunting for ADs is totally wrong concept.

You are having an arguement that my idea of using SOF troops is not ideal because AA pieces will be heavily guarded by enemy troops. I think your arguement have some faults because all of us know that SOF troops are trained to sabotage fixed or unfixed targets eventhough they are heavily protected. If in anycase SOF will not be called for action just because most of the targets are heavily guarded and friendly airstrikes can settle the problems, must as well stop training such troops in sabotage missions that they are so familar in.<br><br>My two cents.</div>

During the 1st Gulf war, the fact was no 1 knew how to deploy all this Spec Ops.  It was te Brits SAS that suggested to the U.S ally Commander Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf that they volunteer for the Scud hunting missions.  Of, SAS having clsoe ties with their U.S counter parts, D-boys were included into the hunt.<br><br>SEAL teams part of the play in the whole grand plan was to block of ships heading towards or out of Iraq.  They also had their usual duty of beach recon.  Plans changed when a SEAL officer came up with a plan that would ensure the safety of the MARINEs assualt by staging a diversion trick.<br><br>Green Berets were the most important Spec Ops for all the allies involved in the war.  Because there weren't enough interpreters to communicate between the various ally forces, Green Berets were assigned to the various ally forces to act as interpreters &amp; co-ordinators between the U.S forces &amp; its allies.<br><br>At the end of the 1st Gulf war, Gen Norman Schwarzkopf gave a speech which gave glory to the Spec Ops( not just the U.S &amp; Brits forces ) for their part in the war.</div>

You are having an arguement that my idea of using SOF troops is not ideal because AA pieces will be heavily guarded by enemy troops. I think your arguement have some faults because all of us know that SOF troops are trained to sabotage fixed or unfixed targets eventhough they are heavily protected. If in anycase SOF will not be called for action just because most of the targets are heavily guarded and friendly airstrikes can settle the problems, must as well stop training such troops in sabotage missions that they are so familar in.<br><br>My two cents.</div></blockquote>Yes SOF is train to sabotage, even heavily guarded . They may be better train and better armed, but they are still human !<br><br>SOF always need to prey on the enemy lapse in security and element of surprise. You can have one team hit one AD site, by then enemy is alerted, with the element of surprise lost and other teams will find themselves hard to sabotage the rest of the ADs.<br><br>What my other point which you totally ignore it timing. Using SpecOps team cost more time !<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the use of snipers to counter these threats lies with the sniper's ability to take out important sections of the unit, such as officers, radar operators and maybe hardware such as generators. imagine a scenario where a enemy pilot is checking his helicopter. the sniper can choose to snipe the pilot, or send a bullet into the engine compartment, which effectively gorunds the helicopter. i believe snipers are trained in the vital areas of the radar so as to render it useless by hitting certain areas. of course, with the xm109 sniper rifle that the us army is using, the rifle can also penetrate armour and hit APCs.<br><br><a href="http://www.barrettrifles.com/rifles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.barrettrifles.com/rifles.htm</a></div>
