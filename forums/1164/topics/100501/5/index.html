Even the grunt.</div></blockquote>Clear you still don't understand enough about AD and artilleries.<br><br>Are you aware what the definition of SHORAD and V-SHORAD AD systems are? You can name the few system, but are you aware of the range ! These are very short range system, that mean they are deployed with the units they are defensing and protected by that unit.<br><br>Those system you mention are all amoured and tracked, why ? they are tracked to be able to keep up with armor unit and armoured because they can withstand light arms and artilleries attack.  Even if you use FH-88, unless a direct hit or special any armour rounds, you cannot do serious damage. Also, once you open up, counter artilleries will go after your FH-88s.  Using Artilleries for Sead is not say never, but in most general cases, you don't waste your artillery that way.<br><br>Next SpecOps again !!! What you think they super human again !  The SpecOps will still lay low and call in SEAD planes to take out the ADs first then guide the other planes to take out the amour units.<br><br>It is easiler to send one plane ahead, so enemy will switch on radar to engage it while the next take it out. That will soon leave enemy without ADs and other planes take out amour units.<br></div>

For example in the case of SAF, eventhough u suppressed the P-Star, you are most likely still within the range of the RBS during the main strike (not refering to the SEAD strike) and the firer with a Mk1 eyeball can still have pretty much chance to shoot you down.<br><br>In most modern air strikes, it is much better now to suppress the long range missile system, dominate the air and then launch the air strike at high attitude to avoid VSHORADs which are hard to evade when they are coming in masses and hard to detect as while. With current guidance technology, it is possible to launch a strike above the clouds, not even seeing ur enemy. But of course, i will also go for long range precision strikes.</div>
