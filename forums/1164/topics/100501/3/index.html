You see, it is much more cheaper wiping off the enemy's air defence to the minimum as you can than u frequently have to require heavy EW support in every sorties. You see, the allies fail to neutralise the serbian's SAM system during the first few days of the Kosovo war and subsequently eventhough all air sorties are accompanied by EW or SEAD aircraft to their fully capability that they can arrange, SAM is a major problem in the war (despite the low number of allied aircraft downed).<br><br>Of course what happened in kosovo was due to many reasons which limits the effectiveness of the SEAD forces, however what is clear to me is that, it is through their fully ability that they try to neutralise the threat using force but they just fail to neutralise all. All in all, i cant realli think of any instances in which the force ceteris paribus, chose not to completely neutralise but just open corridors despite them having to know the threat and their capability to hit it.</div>
