Many people have mentioned that they appreciated more the hardships of the commandos since reading my memoirs. Likewise, I think that reading the memoirs of clerks will give us a greater appreciation of clerks and their great work.<br><br>I don't know much about the life of an army clerk. But it may be much harder than I have imagined. For example, a clerk may be given an order to photocopy a huge amount of material in one hour. That's great stress. If you ask a commando and a clerk to do this task, I am sure that the clerk can photocopy much faster and do a better job. Commandos can do parachute jumps and march 35 km or whatever, but give us a huge stack to photocopy in a short time and it may be very difficult for us.<br><br>During my NS, many of my commando friends envy the clerks. But as they say, "the pasture is greener on the other side". Who knows if my commando friends were to be suddenly converted to being a clerk, they may wish that they were back in the commandos? Who knows if some of them may not be able to handle the pressures of being a clerk?<br><br>I have respect for army clerks, but if I read their memoirs, I think I'll have an even greater respect for their works and sacrifice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

So I am not surprised to hear what you wrote.<br><br>Still I have great respect for all R.O.K troops because they are fierce excellent fighters. I wish that some of the fierceness can be rubbed unto we Singaporean soldiers, including myself.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yes, the aggressiveness of ROK troops has been well documented. Generally speaking, where it comes to finesse and tactics, the ROK military is somewhat lacking - this was true in the old days, and still somewhat true today.<br><br>Nevertheless, I believe we more than make up for it through sheer endurance and aggressiveness. Trust me, I know (all too well, alas)!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Although the ROK military derived its tactics, strategy, and doctrine from U.S. forces, the "spirit" and "culture" of the ROK military is largely taken from the Imperial Japanese Army of WWII.

ThatÂ’s quite true Â– to a certain extent.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tankee1981:</div><div class="quote_body">Welcome! We hope that you have a good time here  in sgforums. It will be best if you could share with us some stories from your South Korean military service as well. I am sure many of us will be curious about what foreign NS system differs from ours.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Thanks! Actually, I'm not sure where I'd begin. The Korean military is really big (650,000 active soldiers, not including reserves) so it's hard to genrealize.<br><br>Living conditions are pretty spartan, and pay is very poor. If you are lucky, a squad of men may share a room. If you are unlucky, as much as 20+ people may have to share. Each soldier has a small cupboard, in which he puts his equipment and belongings. To sleep, you unroll a mat in front of your cupboard, and lie down. Everybody lies down like this - shoulder to shoulder - in two long rows.<br><br>As for pay, itÂ’s pretty non-existent. I donÂ’t know how much they give now, but it was like around $20 ~ $60 for private/private 1st class/corporal/sergeant per month (in Singapore dollars). I heard itÂ’s gone up though. (That must be where all my taxes are going.....)<br><br>Recently, I saw in the news some units are getting BUNK BEDS instead of the old musty mats on the floor.... How dare they break from the "Tradition"! (hehe, actually IÂ’m glad that things are getting better.)<br><br>Maybe I'll start another thread and write more.</div>
