The former president (and also a military dictator from 1961 to 1979) Park Junghee was one of them. He received a gold wrist watch from Hirohito himself on his graduation from the Japanese Military Academy for his performance.<br><br>Many officers of the early ROK Army were ex-IJA officers and that's why some of very bad and brutal 'traditions' have been transplanted from the IJA to the ROK Army and Marine Corps. The early Bundeswehr was also staffed by ex-Wehrmacht and even ex-Waffen SS officers, but the West Germans managed to weed out Nazi traits.<br><br>To be fair to Park Junghee, he is credited with instilling the 'can do' spirit and 'do or die' attitude in Korean people.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>

Actually, the ROK Special Forces practice their own version, called "Tuk Gong Mu Sool". It has more throws, knife techniques, etc.<br><br>During my time in service, I watched several "Tukgong Musool" demonstrations, and had to provide translation to U.S. officers/NCOs.<br><br>It was pretty extreme. SF soldiers would break SLABS  - not "tiles" - of concrete with bare hands, feet, and even heads. There were also knife demonstrations, throws, etc. Female SF were also among the them (and also the highlight of the show ^^).<br><br>The Marines practice "Mujok Do". I've never seen it in before, though. The Army practices Tae Kwon Do.<br><br>From your website, it seems that the Singapore commandos practice mixed martial arts. Is this correct?</div></blockquote>Yes, we practise mixed martial arts. If by "mixed" you mean a combination of different types/styles of martial arts, then yes.<br><br>But we practise them at separate sessions. We have Tae Kwon Do sessions in which we wear the traditional TKD gear and are trained by TKD instructors. We also have "unarmed combat" sessions in which we wear army uniforms and are trained by unarmed combat instructors.<br><br>But not all of us are Black Belts in TKD. I am only a Brown One Belt for example.<br><br></div>

You don't expect people to start disembowelling each other with knives in front of the "honored guests" like the gladiators of old, or twisting necks and slashing throats, do you?<br><br>Safety is very important. And if you can exercise safety while at the same time making things a little more flashy here and there...hey, I see no problem with that.<br><br>I have also learned martial arts and participated in demonstrations. Breaking wood is no big deal (as I'm sure you already know), but breaking 5 slabs of cement with a knifehand is a bit harder, to say the least. If you don't prepare your hand and execute the proper technique you will injure yourself.</div>
