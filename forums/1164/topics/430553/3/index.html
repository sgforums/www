              <p>Units which don't admit Malays are a fact of life. I am not insulting the SAF without basis.</p>
              <p>One such unit is SAF Ammo Command (manages and services ammunition depots). Their officers openly tell you that in all its history since the beginning of SAF, no Malay has ever been posted there. You need a higher security clearance to be posted there.</p>
              <p>As for the Air Force, in all my years of serving on air base, reservist and attending open house after that, I have never ever seen a Malay pilot or ground crew. <strong>Not a single one.</strong> Likewise you need an even higher security clearance to be one.</p>
              <p>And yet I see there are more Malay and Indian regulars in some vocations than in civilian jobs, indicating Malays are eager to join. I wonder why some units have zero of them.</p>
              <p><strong>SM Lee Kuan Yew, Straits Times, 
                  September 19, 1999 on Malays in the Singapore Armed Forces:</strong> "If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and 
                  who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine gun unit, that's a
                   very tricky business. We've got to know his background... I'm saying 
                  these things because they are real, and if I don't think that, and I 
                  think even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully about 
                  this, we could have a tragedy."</p>
              <p>It was revealed in 1987 that the SAF was cautious about putting Malay
                   officers in key posts. <strong>PM Lee Hsien Loong </strong>(Second Minister for defence 
                  at that time), made the following comment when asked <strong>why weren’t there 
                  any Malay pilots in the SAF. </strong>"If there is a conflict, if the SAF is called upon to 
                  defend the homeland, we don’t want to put any of our soldiers in a 
                  difficult position where his emotions for the nation may come in 
                  conflict with his emotion for his religion, because these are two very 
                  strong fundamentals, and if they are not compatible, then they will be 
                  two very strong destructive forces in opposite directions."<strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Lee Kuan Yew, Jaunary 2011</strong>:</p>
              <p>“I would say today, we can integrate all religions and races except 
                  Islam,” he said in “Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going,” a
                   new book containing his typically frank views on the city-state and its
                   future. “I think we were progressing very nicely until the surge of Islam 
                  came and if you asked me for my observations, the other communities have
                   easier integration — friends, intermarriages and so on…” he stated. “I think the Muslims socially do not cause any trouble, but they are 
                  distinct and separate,” Lee added, calling on the community to “be less 
                  strict on Islamic observances.”</p>

              <p>There's always a choice when it comes to war. Any soldier who feels that he is not up to the mission can always stand down from it. 
              The problem with the malay's is that they are not daring enough when come to confront someone whom in their own religion and race. Try asking our chinese singaporean to go to war with china and he'll be more than glad to do so. Try asking our singaporean malay to go to war with indonesia, they will actually think 3 times before coming to a decision.
              Once again that doesnt mean that doesnt mean that malays shouldnt be in the force</p>

              <p>The KC-135 deployment was part of Singapore's on-going contributions to the

                  Detachment Commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Zakir Hamid, said, “We completed all 
                  the missions assigned to us successfully. We also gained valuable operational

              <p>Firstly, I wish not for this to be an argument. I did not say Malaysia does not discriminate, but I can show evidence it does not.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I can show you more Chinese pilot offers than you can count. I personally took this pic at the memorial at the RMAF museum at TUDM Sungai Besi, KL. There are 17 Chinese names I marked with red dots (and 5 Indian names marked with blue) out of a total of 84. Also note that the ranks are very evenly distributed. Chinese pilots make 20% of the RMAF, which matches the racial composition of Malaysia, which does not suggest discrimination. (Indians make up 6%).</p>

              <p>Thirdly, I would correct you because there are 25 active battalions in the RMR (+2 reserve). At 800 men a battalion, that is 18% of 110K soldiers of the Malaysian army. There are also other corps(formations) in the army, and also the air force and navy. So I'm not sure where your figure of RMR making up 75% of the army is cited from.</p>
              <p>I would say don't think all countries are out to get your race, the 
                          truth is out there. In fact, Malaysia and us will likely be on the same 
                          side in war against the most probable aggressor.</p>

                  battalions in the RMR (+2 reserve). At 800 men a battalion, that is
                  18% of 110K soldiers of the Malaysian army. There are also other
                  corps(formations) in the army, and also the air force and navy. So
                  I'm not sure where your figure of RMR making up 75% of the army is
                  cited from.</p>
              <p>I would say don't think all countries are out to get your race,
                  the truth is out there. In fact, Malaysia and us will likely be on
                  the same side in war against the most probable aggressor.</p>

              <p>forget your museum list, that was in the past prior to the "malaynization" of the MAF. try and look at the present RMAF and tell me how many chinese pilots are there NOW!</p>
              <p>there are 25 RMR battalion, even having one is gross racial discrimination, can you justify having 25 exclusive malays only battalions? </p>
              <p>according to the official malaysia ministry of defence figure for 2010, there are total of only 397 chinese and indians are fast dropping below 1,000 in numbers. </p>
              <p>in 2008 malays consist of 88.8% of MAF with 9.3% aboriginis from east malaysia, the total chinese and indian soldiers in MAF is less then 2%!!!</p>

              <p>When you challenge me to show you 2 Chinese pilots, I show you 17 of equal ranks from 1967 to 2004 you don't believe.</p>
              <p>I should challenge you to show your "official MOD source" instead of just saying it. If you claim a "malaynisation" over these years you should also show it. Otherwise don't blow hot air.</p>
              <p>I already pointed out your mistake/lie. You took 27 active+reserve RMR battalions against 9 active-only RRD battalions to get your faulty 75% figure. Conveniently ignoring the other branches of the army. Then you conveniently applied this percentage to describe the whole army, navy and air force.</p>
              <p>The problem is that only kids can laugh at SAF soldiers wearing specs. But any thinking adult can laugh at your claim. You might as well claim that 81 of 87 Singaporeans support the PAP.</p>

              <p>The Malaysian military's most striking characteristic is that, unlike its neighbors. It is an important social function of the military to insure Malay political dominance. The highest ranks of the military are composed of ethnic Malays, as are a majority of those who serve under them. The military's controversial role in establishing order following the May 1969 urban rebellion further emphasizes the political function of the institution as one supporting the Malay-dominated ruling coalition.</p>
              <div>why are you denying the facts from the malaysian defence minister??? are you saying that the malaysian defence minister is lying when he provided the figure that shows that indians and chinese makes up less then 2% of MAF??</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>or perhaps you know the MAF better then the malaysian defence minister? maybe you should take his job... assuming you meet malaysia "special" qualification.</div>
