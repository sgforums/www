            <div class='col-md body'>u need both to be effective. No one actually really "won" the Vietnam War. The VC did not have good weapons and training, so all they could fall back was on motivation. Just like the Taliban! They were using soviet-era weapons but their indoctrination was so strong, so extreme they believed they could do anything. On the other hand, u have the US troops and their superior firepower, but they were alienated by the cause and some were utterly demoralised.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If the northern Vietnamese had lost, they would have lost thier home. That says a lot about the cards they had to play then. The US was not threatened. Only thier interests were. It is different from World War two. It resonates less with the spirit. They lost the war at home. What some people had fail to realise and continue to use this as a rallying point to justify lesser equipped militaries is that if the war had been prolonged and the US had gone one step further as they did with World War 2, the war would have turned out differently. But they can`t because of prevailing political strategic conditions then; within the US and Vietnam and outside of these two countries. There is no conclusive evidence that the average GI is less capable than thier Vietnamese counter-part man to man.</div>

But ethnic Bosnians?</div></blockquote>One of the paradoxical aspects of Hitler's "elite" Waffen-SS was that more than half of the estimated 900,000 men that served in its units were not full-blooded Germans, and this fact interested me enough while attending university to write a paper on the subject. It was, therefore, while doing the research on these non-German "volunteers" that I came across George Lepre's Himmler's Bosnian Division, which documents the story of the 13th Waffen Gebirgs Division der SS "Handschar" (hereafter Handschar). In its original form as a thesis, this work was awarded the Sydney Zebel History Award from Rutgers University.<br>The first divisions of the Waffen-SS were essentially purely German in manpower, but starting with the 5th SS Panzer Division "Wiking," the Germans began to draw on foreign volunteers from occupied countries. Initially, only Nordic volunteers were accepted, but as the war progressed, and manpower shortages became more acute, the Germans began to broaden their definition of "acceptable races" to encompass just about every race except Africans and Jews.<br><br>The Head of the SS, Reichsfuhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, was, in fact, fascinated by the fighting capabilities of certain non-German peoples, and this included the "Islamic faith, which he believed fostered fearless soldiers". He envisioned the creation of a Bosnian SS division constituted solely of Bosnian Muslims in a manner similar to the Bosnian divisions of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hitler, however, does not appear to have been so enthusiastic about such an undertaking, and it took some time before he finally permitted the division to be created.<br><br>The approval came in February 1943. By mid-April, approximately 8,000 men had volunteered for service with Handschar and three months later the number had only risen to 15,000. As this was still far short of the number required for a full division, recruiting of ethnic Albanians was begun, and finally the incorporation of Croatians--approximately 3,000--was permitted.<br><br>Training continued until mid-February 1944. Handschar was then returned to Bosnia where it was assigned the task of securing the northeastern region of Bosnia bordered by the Sava, Bosna, Spreca and Dvina Rivers. Anti-partisan operations commenced almost immediately, and these were carried out successfully. One of the largest was Maibaum, which was conducted in late-April against the Partisan III Bosnia Corp. After several days of fighting, one German report claimed that close to 1,000 partisans had been killed.<br><br>As was always the case, however, the setbacks that the partisans faced was not permanent. While successful, Maibaum did not fully rid the northeastern section of Bosnia from partisan activity in general, and by early June the partisans had regrouped and were on the offensive again. Heavy fighting took place at Lopare on June 8, 1944 and units from Handschar positioned there were overrun. In total, the division sustained just over 200 dead and a further 600 injured--the most serious losses to date.<br><br>For the rest of the summer, Handschar conducted further anti-partisan operations and by the end of the summer it was worn down and the morale among the men beginning to decline. During this time there were plans to form another Bosnian SS division (23rd Waffen Gebirgs Division der SS "Kama"), and officers and men were transferred from Handschar to facilitate this.<br><br>At about this same time, Handschar began to experience organizational and morale problems that were instigated by rumours that the unit would soon be leaving Bosnia. During the autumn of 1944, therefore, Handschar was plagued by desertions, and so Himmler decided that it and the still-forming Kama would be reorganized into two "small" divisions of 10,000 men each. However, on October 17, shortly after Handschar had been transferred to Zagreb (which resulted in more desertions), the men of Kama mutinied and shortly afterward it was disbanded.<br><br>It was now becoming quite evident that to the Germans that their Bosnian volunteers were becoming unreliable and as a result many were disarmed. To compensate for the loss of manpower, local Croatians were pressed into service, but this did little to enhance the fighting capabilities of Handschar, which, in mid-November, finally left Bosnia for Hungary, where it fought against the advancing Soviets.<br><br>For the rest of the winter, Handschar occupied three defensive positions--Margarethestellung, Dorotheastellung, and the Reichsschutzstellung--and were successful at slowing the Soviet advance in mid-April. It was all, of course, for no purpose as the war ended several weeks later.<br><br>Lepre relied almost entirely on primary sources in order to write Himmler's Bosnian Division and, as he explains in the preface, even these were scarce, and those that were available are "notoriously inaccurate". One has to wonder what information is not available and the implications that this has for our understanding of the true conduct of Handschar in its prosecution of its anti-partisan operations. But in terms of the book being a "chronicle of the birth, life, and ultimate death" of Handschar, the author has done an excellent job, and one hopes that it will lead to a better understanding of the paradoxical "volunteer" aspect of the Waffen-SS and the nature of the war in the Balkan Theater.<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764301349/104-5582977-9462316?v=glance&amp;n=283155</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Undoubtedly the most complete study concerning this obscure formation of the Waffen SS (the military branch of the SS organization) ever published. George Lepre, an american historian, tells us in details, the creation, the training and the military records of the 'handschar' division.<br><br>Raised in 1943, when Nazi germany was facing a manpower shortage, the 'handschar division' was the first Waffen SS unit, in a nazi point of view, made of 'racially inferior' elements (as Slavs were considered to be...). Thus, this mountain division (13th of the armed SS) was combining an 'all german' staff (officers and ncos) with a muslim-slav infantry (some muslim-albanians from kosovo were also accepted although). The fact that the nazis, known for their strict atheism (Hitler was the only 'God' they were encouraged to praise...) were willing to accept in their ranks, for the first time, some very religious muslim-slavs is another evidence of how bad the military situation had turned for them...<br><br>Fully trained and well equipped, the unit, according testimonies of some of its german officers, could not be compared to a german division of a similar nature. In spite of that, the Handschar was involved from february to september 1944 in several anti-partisan operations in which, it gained many successes but also some serious setbacks... In overall, that unit, thanks to its superior german leadership and its heavy armament, was a deadly opponent to the partisans. Lepre doesn't hide the atrocities the unit was accused to commit against christian-serb civilians and partisan members during some operations... Needless to say, such ugly things probably happened (for further details concerning war crimes commited by some of its members, see 'the Waffen SS' by George H. Stein), and were made by all sides, as usual in a civilian and ethnical conflict. It has to be told that counter-insurgency operations are often characterized by such excesses...<br><br>The increasing of desertion rate (about three thousands of men, in a total of about eighteen thousands, according to the author), made a reorganization of the unit necessary. Several thousands of muslims, considered as unreliable, were dismissed, or transfered to labour units in october 1944 (It has to be told that most of the deserters joined Ustasa or muslim militias whereas several hundred of them choosed to fight alongside the partisans!). The few remaining, would eventually fight until the end of the conflict in hungary, very far away of their homeland they were promised to protect...<br><br>Lepre, in his study, tells us some reasons why the 'handschar division' was finally a failure : the constant opposition of the so-called "Independent State of Croatia" (in reality, no more than a puppet in german and italian hands) toward the 'muslim division', the never solved shortage of officers and ncos, the generally bad relationships between german personnel and muslim-slavs. Moreover, for many german officers and ncos, a transfer to such units wasn't a thing they were enjoyed. To them, 'Handschar' couldn't match the crack elite divisions 'Das Reich' or 'Adolf Hitler'... Last but not least, the military situation, for the germans, worsened inside and outside yougoslavia...<br><br>To conclude, this book is a must read. Many saw a pro-muslim point of view. I think it's true but the author, using both german and yugoslavian official sources, has made a very complete research about this 'unknown' unit. Lepre shows us how and why thousands of muslims of the south-eastern europe decided to join nazi germany between 1941 and 1945... This a is a true historical masterpiece for everyone eager to understand what occured in Croatia during World War II.<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764301349/104-5582977-9462316?v=glance&amp;n=283155</div>
