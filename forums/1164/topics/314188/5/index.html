              <p>Apparently "solved" means reduce the risk of capsize to something more acceptable. But what exactly did they do? There was not really much they could trim from there, all the radars and stuff need to be there.</p>
              <p>In any case there's no denying that our Corvettes are still extremely top heavy for a surface combatant, lending it not only less stability but a larger radar signature. More importantly given recent shift to some form of power-projection in our navy the Corvettes with their inability to handle heavy sea states well are becoming less suitable for the RSN's future.</p>

              <p>Besides,67 ships of SG Police Coast Guard ,equipped with minimum</p>

              <p>help to patrol the sea.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>WRONG, another example of you talking rubbish.</p>
              <p>Firstly there's no GL in 20mm caliber in common use beyond experimental systems, another example of you making up stuff </p>
              <p>Also, our police coast guard ships are armed with the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, not 20mm GL  and the GPMG, the 20mm Oerlikon is an obsolute, ammunition-limited WW1 design which is a far cry from the 25mm standard mounts. The Australian boats can hit up to a good kilometer further, sustain a much longer fire time, as well as lay in more firepower.</p>
              <p>There is no 25mm autocannon in use with our Coast Guard, the heaviest weapons are the outdated 20mm Oerlikon, and that's only found in the PH Class.</p>
              <p>The majority of your "67" ships are mostly armed with the GPMG, which is only for very close in chase work, but useless against a suicide terror boat.</p>
              <p>In addition, our patrol boats are short-ranged craft that do not have the endurance, sensors or sea-state abilities of the Australian Pvs.</p>
              <p> </p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>WRONG Again, you go by tonnage, not number of vessels. The RAN is actually LARGER.</p>
              <p>If I have one Iowa class battleship and you have 20 sampans armed with AK-47 you can say you have a bigger navy?</p>
              <p>NO.</p>
              <p>Firstly our 4 Subs are small, refurbished vessels a far cry from the huge, deep ocean Collins class, our subs are only capable in local waters.</p>
              <p>As noted from lessons learnt from the USS Cole, there is a serious defect in the ability to handle unconventional seaborne terrorist threats, such as the fast suicide boats.</p>
              <p>All of the Naval classes lack the proper weapons to handle such a threat properly, they are more suited to fight a conventional war against large surface combatants.</p>
              <p>Our Naval Fearless class are the main line of defence against such a threat, but they weapons complement are still inadequate to effectively handle such a threat.</p>
              <p>Now use your common sense.</p>
              <p>As to why the Australia maintains a "small" fleet- this is because unlike us they have a vast ocean as a natural buffer between them and Australia while we are trapped in small waters in which the area you can move around in can easily be covered by a Harpoon missile. Hence a lot of our navy is made out of smaller combatants designed for still water. But when it comes to open sea confrontation our navy is far less capable. In fact the only ships that are really effective in a big ocean battle would be our Formidible class.</p>
              <p>But if you go by tonnage, endurance, firepower, the RAN exceeds the RSN by far. They are a true, blue water navy.</p>
              <p>This means that despite our supposedly "large" number of ships, they are actually highly specialized and are not as able to fight in all conditions as a real blue water navy. This also means in the opening hours of any war, our navy will take a lot of firepower coming their way because by virtue of our limited seas, there's not much place to hide.</p>
              <p>Hence our concentration on getting more numerous, less smaller ships. If you note the Australians actually have more long range heavyweights then us, despite the lower number.</p>
              <p>Unlike us the Australians will have plenty of time to know that an enemy fleet is coming and can choose their place to fight a pitched naval battle. More importantly they will have plentry of time to pick away at the enemy with their Collins, which can penetrate the ASW dragnet of the USN. One Collins sub can effectively give a bad day to any enemy fleet far out in the ocean.</p>
              <p>Also our Seawolfs are being retired and of little use in a modern naval war, plus two of our Formidibles are not commissioned yet so the standing effective strength of our fleet is actually 25 NOT 33.</p>
              <p>And note beyond the Formidible class the rest of our navy are actually lightweights. So in terms of tonnage, which is the way to measure things naval, the RAN combatant strength is actually LARGER then the RSN, which only has 6 3200 ton ships and which the rest are just 600 ton below lightweights. The RAN sports 12 multi thousand ton surface combatants.</p>
              <p>To give you an idea, one RAN frigate packs as much anti-air and anti-sub and anti-surface punch as 2-3 our of Victories, and can project this firepower further as well with it's much greater endurance. Their 5 inch naval guns make our 76mm gun look like a popgun, and they can project this firepower much further as well. In addition unlike our Corvettes and Frigates which rely on chaff to make last-ditch defence against ASMs, they have CIWS systems to give a hard-kill as well.</p>
              <p>And if you add up the firepower and torpedo storage capability of their submarine force, six 3,000 ton plus deep ocean SSKs with ADCAP and Harpoon capability plus the HK capability of the Virginia class SSN, versus our refurbished 1000 ton previous generaton SSKs. The disparity grows.</p>
              <p>The RAN actually has more firepower then our navy!</p>

              <p>Also his reliance on the media and inability to make any sort of critical thinking shows that he quite truly suffers from the spotlight fallacy:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span class="mw-headline">Spotlight fallacy</span></p>
              <p>The Spotlight fallacy is committed when a person uncritically assumes that all members or cases of a certain class or type are like those that receive the most attention or coverage in the media. This line of “reasoning” has the following form:</p>
              <p>1. Xs with quality Q receive a great deal of attention or coverage in the media. 2. Therefore all Xs have quality Q.</p>
              <p>This line of reasoning is fallacious since the mere fact that someone or something attracts the most attention or coverage in the media does not mean that it automatically represents the whole population. For example, suppose a mass murderer from Old Town, Maine, received a great deal of attention in the media. It would hardly follow that everyone from the town is a mass murderer.</p>
              <p>The Spotlight fallacy derives its name from the fact that receiving a great deal of attention or coverage is often referred to as being in the spotlight. It is similar to Hasty Generalization, Biased Sample and Misleading Vividness because the error being made involves generalizing about a population based on an inadequate or flawed sample. The Spotlight Fallacy is a very common fallacy. This fallacy most often occurs when people assume that those who receive the most media attention actually represent the groups they belong to. For example, some people began to believe that all those who oppose abortion are willing to gun down doctors in cold blood simply because those incidents received a great deal of media attention. Since the news media typically cover people or events that are unusual or exceptional, it is somewhat odd for people to believe that such people or events are representative.</p>

              <p>Did I say that or did you invent it because you failed your english comprehension?</p>
              <p>Let me remind you then to exercise basic english comprehension.</p>
              <p>note a keyword:</p>
              <p>COIN</p>
              <p>TERROR</p>
              <p>This lionnoisy fantasy situtation of PVs going to face heavy naval combatants would only happen if the RAN had your kind of thinking, the same kind of thinking that have you wanting to launch F-18s off LHDs <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Unfortunately for you, the RAN has far more common sense meaning your point is invalid.</p>
              <p>The RAN PVs are dedicated to the role of facing the threat that hit the USS Cole, as well as other smaller threats on which a heavy surface combatant would be a waste of resources. The RAN is not going to use them to fight an heavy combatant just because they are in the navy.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Just because you use your limited command of the language and put words together does not mean your poorly-thought out fantasy scenarios are going to happen.</p>
              <p>You seem to have this fantasy that a fleet of multi thousand ton ships can just teleport out of nowhere across thousands of miles of ocean and surprise the Australian navy without getting picked up by radar or sonar or other forms of sensors when such a journey will take days and leave plentry of time to get detected and having actions taken by the right kind of naval unit long before they even come close to Australian waters. </p>
              <p>What that can suddenly happen anyday is the small, terror suicide boat that the PV is designed to handle that our current navy and coastguard cannot effectively, an Iowa class battleship is not going to "anyday, happen to be around". You might as well say 15,000 enemy tanks "anyday, happen to be around" Orchird road. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>This is not surprising given your inline skates, F-18s off LHDs and crashing Fantail ideas all defy good common sense.</p>
              <p>Going by your logic, you might as well say that our Primus is useless and has no role because it is totally defenceless if an MBT suddenly teleported next to it and the closest help is too far away.</p>
              <p>Going by your logic you might as well say we shouldn't have people doing guard duty because all they have is a SAR-21 and 5 rounds because what if a Gundam suddenly show up?</p>
              <p>Going by your logic, you might as well say we have to use Leopard 2s to do guard duty <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Your idea of a PV having to face an enemy fleet is pure fantasy. Such an action would be picked up days before they have even entered into Australian waters and dealt out with far out in the Ocean via the Collins or Frigates. In fact the things that do slip through and get close are those small terror/smuggler vessels that don't show up on radar until too late. This is what they have the PVs for.</p>
              <p>Unlike you, the RAN knows what unit to pit against what unit. The Fearless class PV with all the wrong weapons, as well as our short-ranged Police Coastguards armed with old 20mm cannons in a few ships and mainly GPMGs will be far less capable of in the COIN/terror ops as the modern, sea-state 5 capable, 25mm stabilized deck mounted autocannons.</p>

              <p>So what? You think the terrorist suicide craft is going to care if your are Police Coast guard or not? Do you think they are going to surrender just because you have some WW1 20mm cannon and mostly GPMGs?</p>
              <p>Note that our vital installations like Jurong Island or Changi Naval base still have to be protected? By who? Our limited numbers of Fearless class that are not even suited for the role with the clunky weapons loadout? By our police coast guard who is armed just with manually operated WW1 20mm cannons and GPMGs?</p>
              <p>You seem to have this inability to use good common sense about anything, which is no surprise you think the RAN are going to make bad choices... because you think they have YOUR kind of ideas <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>You are just playing on labels, nothing you said changes the fact that the Aussies still have a more capable COIN/terror platform then us. And nothing changes the fact that despite the lame idea you are trying to push on them, they're not going to use their PVs to fight heavy combatants, even if those fictional lionnoisy ships can cross thousands of miles of ocean in one hour without being detected and spring up beside a PV. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>And going by your label-playing logic, are you saying our Air Force is mixing up the roles because we use the RSAF to ferry our troops around while the US Army they have their own air wing to fly their troops in helicopters and let the USAF concentrate on the air war?</p>

              <p>here i am to give my 2 cents worth...sorry if im going off topic</p>
              <p>anws, personally, i feel that the difference in capabilities is mainly due to a difference in requirements, as has been mentioned, sg and aussie are in 2 different environments, (sg is surrounded by other countries, and thus has an extremely constricted area to defend), while aus is surrounded by large areas of sea, thus having a larger area....thus, both navies have rather different requirements, since they have somewhat different roles.</p>
              <p>lets say in a war situation, the sg navy might acutally (my guess) be working under the assumption of adequate air cover, and not having to leave into the big blue yonder for war (at least not the PBs)....with peacetime duties of trade protection from pirates and general policing...</p>
              <p>while for the aussies, my idea would be that their defence would be based on the acquitsiton of early intelligence, in order to forestall or predict any incoming threats, while they would have a peacetime duty of general duties, without the pirate protection role... thus the lack of a need for a large number of ships steaming at any one go....since the early intelligence would allow them to prempt these threats, and thus have a general mobilisation of its ships, however, going by my reading, apparently the aussies have a crew shortage, this should actually be rectified, since no crew would still make the ship a useless piece of steel,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...i think im going off topic.... so shall end here :D</p>

              <p>Even one 25mm round hitting a terrorist boat can do the job, shredding the terrorist and boat alike.</p>
              <p>One 76mm round will only hit a boat if it's a lucky shot, and it's total overkill, not to mention way slower in rate of fire and gun laying.</p>
              <p>76mm shells are also a lot more expensive and far less useful against such threats.</p>
              <p>The 25mm cannon can spew out <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>TWO HUNDRED</strong></span> of these terrorist-stopping shells per minute, way above the rate of the 76mm gun.</p>

              <p><strong>Oto Melara 76 mm</strong> gun It is capable of very high rates of fire, making it suitable for short-range anti-missile point defence. Its calibre also gives it abilities for anti-aircraft, anti-surface and ground shelling. Specialised ammunition is available for armour piercing, incendiary, directed fragmentation !!! </p>
              <p>85 round/min - is not slow !</p>
              <p>If it can take out short range anti missile - it can take out 40 knots speedboats..... and it will not be lucky shot !</p>
              <p>In fact both 76mm &amp; 25mm  (200 rounds per minute)  both are over kill for terrorist speedboats  - they both can easily take out muliple high speedboat easily .... but in habour or crowded sea both are too powerful ... as they risk damaging other ships in the area .....</p>
              <p>By the way our boat carry 2 x 0.5 (400 -600 RPM ) which will be more then enough to do the job.</p>
              <p>I think both 76mm &amp; 25mm does have their own adv and disadv ... you cannot say our Patrol boat is wrong to arm with 76mm.</p>
              <p>I do find the combination of 76mm with 0.5s ..... does give us a perfect combination mix of attack &amp; defense arment.</p>

              <p>Nah, experience has shown that in theory all these words look nice on paper, but in pratice things can be quite different.</p>
              <p>If the "terror" speedboat was a target drone in calm sea states and you are shooting at it in optimal conditions then prehaps things will work.</p>
              <p>Prehaps if the terror boats approach you piecemeal, then prehaps you have a chance of stopping it with the 76mm.</p>
              <p>The task becomes more complicated if there are multiple bogeys moving at you at high speed, you are moving at flank speed (to avoid them), running evasive patterns or worse at high sea states where the platform is listing from side to side considerably.</p>
              <p>In that case, to probability of kill trying to rotate the entire 76mm turret and slave the heavy gun it to a small, fast target whose only idea is to ram into you becames exceedingly small. </p>
              <p>This is why the a lighter, faster gun that spews out shells at over twice the rate is far more suitable for such applications. Not only is the 25mm gun much, much faster to move, it is also easier to stabilize as well as being able to keep up a longer time of fire due to its increased ammunition capacity. For the COIN/Terror this is the more practical, cost-effective solution.</p>
              <p>.50 is unlikely to work unless you're getting really close, and at that point the suicide boat is already in its terminal approach, even if you kill the driver you're screwed if that thing just triggers on impact.</p>
              <p>The problem is also that our 76mm is on the smaller side of naval mounts, it is kind of a popgun compared to the 5in mounts we see on the RAN frigates.</p>
              <p>I doubt the 76mm is good for point missile defence with modern ASMs, in fact I've yet to hear of naval mounts being used effectively in such a role.</p>
