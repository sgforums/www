              <p>http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/2001-02/02RP03.htm</p>
              <p>''The RAN appears to recognise the risk in this situation. In
                                                  early 2001 relations between Kockums and the RAN were strained
                                                  after the RAN had shipped one of the company's propellers to the
                                                  USA. Commodore Paul Greenfield, Director General of Submarines,
                                                  acknowledged that Kockums, as the designer, had a very important
                                                  role in the future support of the submarines and hoped that the
                                                  formerly strong relationship between Navy and Kockums could be
                                                  restored.</p>
              <p>note 91</p>
              <p>ibid., pp. 8-9. These facts help explain why Kockums went to the
                                                  Federal Court seeking to injunct the delivery of one of its
                                                  propellers to the US Navy, on the grounds that it would compromise
                                                  Kockums' intellectual property rights. Publicity that the
                                                  propellers did not work confused the difference between the
                                                  effectiveness of the design, the on board environment in which it
                                                  operates and the failings of the material that the shipbuilder was
                                                  forced to use.''</p>

              <p>Can't help but notice your infantile efforts at continuously undermining the reputation of the Aussies.</p>
              <p>Why should it be hard to believe that there are only 10 ships per day patrolling the sea around Australia ?</p>
              <p>What is the intent of your thread  - which seems to be a continuous efforts to deride the Aussies ?</p>
              <p>What do you think should be the optimum number of vessels to guard the seas around Oz ?</p>
              <p>Have you not heard of satellite surveillance, UAV, and other airborne electronic surveillance, as well as seabed sensors ?</p>
              <p>With such a long coastline, and large expanse of territorial water to guard - are you expecting the entire fleet to be out at sea, and with the fleet size double so as to have sufficient crew and equipment to be rotated  ?</p>
              <p>What will that incur for the Australian Budget ?</p>
              <p>Will that produce another reason for your further derogatory piece towards the Aussies ?</p>

              <p>Who exactly in the region is going to attack Australia via the sea? Indonesia? I don't thnk so.</p>
              <p>And why does lionnoisy not include the <strong>Armidale class patrol boat fleet? </strong>Which actually takes the lion's share of coastline patrol against tasks that would be wasted on bigger platforms and actually consitute a large part of peacetime operations.</p>
              <p>Also lionnoisy creates the fatal error of assuming that peacetime readiness equals mobilized readiness. In which case he might as well say we must call up all our NSmen to defend Singapore 365 days of the year because our move-on-the-moment force ready level is actually a very small percentage of our total force. He assumes that we must send a large portion of our fleet to sea, drive all our tanks, run all our soldiers and fly all our aircraft without realizing the need for this thing called "reserve" as well as the costs involved in running everything.</p>
              <p>And of course he keeps going "Collin's class partial blind and crippled" when the problems have already been long solved, the class given a nod by the yanks as one of the deadilest and most advanced SSKs in the world, as well as even managing to slip past USN antisubmarine defences and "kill" their SSNs and Destroyers, as well as vital ships, which was such a significant feat that it got the yanks to rethink their naval tactics.</p>

              <p><br>10 is quite ok already. You can't have too many ships going around at any 1 point. Definitely at any point in time, some ships will undergo refits. Launching a ship takes $$ also.</p>

              <p>While incompetence is indeed the case, things are often complicated on the bridge. And it's not surprising something like that happens, because the area involved is a fairly congested area and the ship was patrolling the area which makes it even more dangerous.</p>

              <p>An unproven combination is trying to launch F-18Es off LSDs or fitting our troops with inline skates. How on earth can the system they fit into the Collins be "unproven" given it's a system made for submarines by GD with no relation to the propulsion? SSN or SSK, the system will work.</p>
              <p>What will not work is trying to launch F-18Es off LSD like you tried to argue for.</p>
              <p>This is what the "unproven" combination did:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"> </span><a class="mw-redirect" title="HMAS Sheean" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/HMAS_Sheean"><span style="color: #ff0000;">HMAS <em>Sheean</em></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"> had "held its own" during two rigorous weeks of combat trials off </span><a title="Hawaii" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Hawaii"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hawaii</span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"> with the <em>Los Angeles</em> class attack sub </span><a title="USS Olympia (SSN-717)" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/USS_Olympia_%28SSN-717%29"><span style="color: #ff0000;">USS <em>Olympia</em></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;">. The two subs swapped roles as hunter and prey and scored roughly equal numbers of hits. During its mock attacks on <em>Olympia</em> and on two US destroyers, <em>Sheean</em> fired 28 torpedoes. The chief-of-staff of the Australian Navy's submarine force reported that "a respectable percentage of shots <em>Sheean</em> fired at <em>Olympia</em> were hits that would have destroyed the powerful US vessel."<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1164/topics/#cite_note-8">[9]</a></sup> In the RIMPAC 02 exercises, playing a 'rogue' submarine Sheean penetrated the US Navy surface unit screen to ‘sink’ both the amphibious assault ship </span><a title="USS Tarawa (LHA-1)" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/USS_Tarawa_%28LHA-1%29"><span style="color: #ff0000;">USS <em>Tarawa</em></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;"> and dock landing ship </span><a class="mw-redirect" title="USS Rushmore" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/USS_Rushmore"><span style="color: #ff0000;">USS <em>Rushmore</em></span></a><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span></p>
              <p>Sinking a 688I class SSN as well as penetrating the advanced ASW screen of the USN is indeed no mean feat, no surprise you failed to mentioned it in here given how selective you are about your articles.</p>
              <p>In any case the Aussies are smarter then you, the only way to get an SSK suited for their open water needs is to build one themselves and get the experience from it for the simple reason no SSK class in the world really suits what they need. What they created in the Collins is expected of a first-generation design with teething problems but eventually they got pretty competent at it. Navies around the world anknowledge the Collins as a very capable SSK and it seems that it is that all you have in your pocket is trying to put a spin to any media article you can scrounge up, which is kind of sad.</p>
              <p>I could actually list the problems we had with our own-made systems just like you, like how the SAR-21 was quite a piece of junk when it was first issued and plenty of things didn't work as advertised, not to mention hated by the SAF soldier... of how the Primus was rendered "partial blind and crippled" during it's first few tests with the grunts because of undiscovered problems and what else. But unlike you I have some common sense that militaries generally experience problems with new systems, but the experience is more then worth it.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The role of seeking and destroying an enemy submarine is one of the most difficult faced by Australia's six new Collins class submarines. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The success off Hawaii in August has boosted morale dramatically among submarine crews who have had to endure years of hearing their boats condemned as noisy and vulnerable.</span></p>
              <p>A 1999 report by the then CSIRO chief, Malcolm McIntosh, and former BHP managing director John Prescott said the Collins' combat system should be junked, the vessels were noisy and vulnerable to attack, their engines broke down regularly, a badly shaped hull and fin made too much disturbance when they moved at speed under water, the view from the periscope was blurry, the communications system outdated and the propellers were likely to crack.</p>
              <p>Commander Steve Davies, chief-of-staff in the navy's submarine force, <span style="color: #ff0000;">said that during the past three years those problems had been fixed to the point where the submarines were able to match the best of the US Navy's giant underwater fleet.</span><br>

              <p> </p>
              <p>During its mock attacks on the Olympia and on two US destroyers, the Sheean fired 28 torpedoes. Commander Davies said "a <span style="color: #ff0000;">respectable percentage" of shots Sheean fired at Olympia were hits that would have destroyed the powerful US vessel.</span></p>
              <p>Commodore Davies, Australia's most experienced Collins commander, said the two vessels were very evenly matched. The submarines also practised landing special forces.</p>
              <p>The exercises provided a crucial test for the Australian submarine, which has been as much criticised at home as it has been feted abroad.</p>
              <p>The Olympia, 110 metres long and 12 metres across the beam, is twice the displacement of the Sheean, at 80 metres by eight metres. The Olympia carries up to 120 crew; the Sheean 45. Many of the Americans are engineers caring for their reactor.</p>
              <p>The Collins is powered by diesel and electric motors and its roles include undersea warfare - finding and destroying other submarines - destroying enemy warships and merchant ships, surveillance and intelligence collection, support for special forces and covert transport.</p>
              <p>Commander Davies said the US sub's size was not an advantage: "It just means you make more noise when you go faster."</p>
              <p>He said cooperation with the US submarine force had increased significantly recently. "<span style="color: #ff0000;">That has come about because they're interested in the Collins class and in our submarine force generally."</span></p>
              <p>While the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Americans run the world's most powerful submarine arm, they acknowledge that changes in international conditions in the past decade and new priorities have left them with tactics to learn from the small Australian submarine arm.</span></p>
              <p>Commander Davies said Australian submariners were used to operating in shallow water.<span style="color: #ff0000;"> "That's one of the things the Americans are looking towards us for experience in.</span></p>
              <p>"Ten years ago their submarine force was chasing Russian submarines around the deep ocean. Now, as with all submarine forces, it's more focused on closer inshore operations, intelligence collection or working with special forces. They're looking to us as a submarine force which has a long experience in that sort of thing."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The six Collins' combat systems are to be upgraded further and they will get more modern torpedoes. Those the Sheean used in its clashes with the Olympia were developed in the 1970s; the Americans used a far more sophisticated generation.</span></p>
              <p>While smaller than the US nuclear boats, the Collins is one of the world's biggest conventional submarines. It was designed to cover long distances and the Sheean easily reached Hawaii without refuelling.</p>

              <h1><span id="headLine">Deadliest Diesel Boat in the World Goes to Sea</span></h1>
              <p><span id="content">Australia has completed the refurbishment and upgrades on the first of its six Collins class subs. The United States, in a rare move, gave Australia access to American sonar and underwater warfare systems technology for this. Australia is spending nearly a hundred million dollars each, to upgrade the sonar and fire control systems on its six Collins class subs, and this new deal with the U.S. means that <span style="color: #ff0000;">those diesel electric subs will carry the most advanced electronics in the world. The Collins class boats, mainly because of the quality of their crews, have proved to be among the most capable diesel-electric subs in the world. This is known because Collins class boats often train with U.S. Navy ships and aircraft, and usually come out ahead. </span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This has made the American admirals more concerned about the threat from diesel-electric subs. For the moment, however, <span style="color: #ff0000;">none of America's potential naval foes have submarine crews as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">well trained</span> as the Australians.</span> The new electronics will provide the Collins class boats with <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>combat capabilities similar to the new U.S. Virginian class SSNs.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Collins class boats were built in Australia during the 1990s, and are based on a Swedish design (the Type 471.) At 3,000 tons displacement, the Collins are half the size of the American Los Angeles class nuclear attack subs. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>However, boats that size are nearly twice the size of subs Europeans are accustomed to designing and building for their own use. Australia needed larger boats because of the sheer size of the oceans that surround Australia.</strong></span> There were a lot of technical problems with the Collins class boats, which the <strong>media(lionnoisy) jumped all over</strong>. The design of these subs was <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">novel and ambitious</span></span>, using a lot of automation. This reduced the crew size to 45.</p>

              <p>Australia plans to increase their sub fleet size and have them styled similar to the newest Uk submarines in the sense that the nuclear reactor purchased whole sale and as a complete unit from US, will last a life time without maintainence and will be installed in a larger sub than that of the collins class. And yes they are going to build the sub themselves. The collins are one of the best subs in our part of the world.  They are without doubt the best subs in our region.</p>

              <p>No surprise he managed to screw it up again, given he has a very limited knowledge of anything military beyond whatever he sees on the media.</p>
              <p>And unfortunately for him, he seems to draw his own naive conclusions from the media, such as launching F-18Es off LHDs and running for his life carrying handbag SAR. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>In any case it's not surprising he wants to slam the Collins, trying to paint it as an unreliable, noisy boat that is unable to fight with old articles. The truth of the matter is this, if it is as unreliable, noisy, and unable to fight as he says, there is no way it would have been able to go up against the most efficent antisubmarine force in the world and wreck havoc with it to the point the USN are looking to the Australian Navy for experience in submarine warfare against SSKs.</p>
              <p>This is the same pattern as in the TAR-21 thread, which made him feel threatened when he realized the TAR-21 was the superior weapon to his beloved SAR (which he never even trained with in the first place) So it was not surprising that when he, not even knowing anything about the rifle started to make a lame argument that "it needs as least two hands to run for your life with" without even knowing anything about it, when the TAR in reality is not only much lighter, but also no grunt in his right mind will want to run carrying his SAR by the scope handle, plainly ridiculus! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p><strong>Why US did not lease Collins for long term training?</strong></p>
              <p>1.US Navy leased Swedish sub Gotland SSK with AIP for 2 years training.</p>
              <p>US should have leased the best in conventional sub to train,right?</p>
              <p>May be Oz has not enough subs lah!!</p>
              <p><strong>Why no Full Operational Cabalitity declared so far</strong></p>
              <p>Under the original contract and subsequent modifications,</p>
              <p>NOT a single Collins has been declared achieving </p>
              <p><strong>Full Operational Cabalitity!!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Always vertify all news</strong></p>
              <p>US has deep involvement in Collins retifications and modifications</p>
              <p>for so many years.Dunt buy their story so easy,just like we dunt buy</p>
              <p>SG story so easy.</p>
              <p><strong>Retifiaction or modifications</strong></p>
              <p>Collins projects costs over ran from A3.9 billion to 6 billion</p>
              <p>for ORIGINAL project.Schedule is much behind schedule.</p>
              <p>After that,there are so called modifications</p>
              <p>to Collins,non stop after they are launched.</p>
              <p>Are the modifications is in fact retifications?</p>
              <p>Billions of $$ are just spent.Why it take so short period to scrap</p>
              <p>the original few billion $$ spent?</p>

              But what is the products look like?
              
              Since the delivery of last ships,how many days each ship can sail?
              
              seriouly over budget ,long delay,
              Just build one class with so many problems and claim
              to be sub designer!!
