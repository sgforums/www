                          The FFG Upgrade Project has experienced extensive delays in meeting the
                          contracted capability upgrade requirements specified in <span style="color: #ff0000;">the late 1990s.</span> The number of FFGs to be upgraded has been reduced from six to four,
                          and the scheduled acceptance of the fourth and final ship has been
                          <span style="color: #ff0000;">delayed by four and a half years</span> to June 2009. Since the last ANAO
                          audit in 2005, the project delays are attributable to a range of
                          Underwater Warfare System and Electronic Support System <span style="color: #ff0000;">performance
                          deficiencies</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Considerable risk remains to the delivery of
                          contractually compliant capability to Navy, given the maturity of these

              <p>''21. OT&amp;E on the Collins-class submarines is experiencing significant difficulties caused mainly by the amount of engineering development still under way in the program as well as significant in-service support problems. The Collins class has shifted from development into operational service without a distinct end to development T&amp;E, placing further<br>demands on the overall program.</p>
              <p><br>22. Many Collins-class performance deficiencies were not corrected prior to DMO offering the submarines to Navy for acceptance into service.<br>These have caused extra cost and delays in gaining required naval capability and in achieving acceptance into naval service. The need to spend substantial amounts on modifications to achieve ‘limited capability level’ improvements in two submarines, and to extend the Collins program by seven years to accommodate modifications and upgrades to<br>all Collins submarines, reinforces the importance of this issue. The submarines’ existing and planned redesign, modification, upgrade and sustainability enhancement costs represent an increase of <span style="color: #888888;">39 per cent o</span>n the approved submarine project cost of $5.09 billion (December 2000<br>prices).<br>23. Shortages of Navy technical personnel have led to a chronic<br>shortage of T&amp;E trained personnel in Navy’s T&amp;E agency (RANTEAA).''</p>

              <p>speaking about the indonesians, why not make some critiques about the state of their military hardware and software?? i believe it mght be in even worse position than the aussies...</p>

              <p><br>yes damn difflcult to build sub. But what is the products look like? Since the delivery of last ships,how many days each ship can sail? seriouly over budget ,long delay, Just build one class with so many problems and claim to be sub designer!! Upgrade upgrade every where (in the ship)! Upgrade upgrade every year!</p>
              </div>

              <p>This is just an example of you sticking your fingers in your ears and going "la la i can't hear you" <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p><br>Going by your logic are you implying that our SAR-21 is a total waste of money because it was outclassed by the TAR-21 the moment it came out and we spent even more money to make more variants and in the end it's still heavier and the advanced versions haven't found their way to the grunt?</p>
              <p>Going by your logic it means our Bx would also be a waste of money and time given not only did we not manage to replace the M113s it was supposed to despite years spent on design and funding, we now have to spend more time and money to come up with a Bx2 because the orginal Bionix was found to be NOT COMPATIBLE with our SAF 3G vision!</p>
              <p>Also does this mean our Light Tank Project was a total waste despite 20 years and millions spent when in the end we decided just to get Leopard 2?</p>
              <p>All the media nonsense apart, if you look at the entire Collins project from the standpoint of experience gained in sub manufacture, technology transfer with the Yanks which put their SSKs on par in hunter-killer ability as an Virgina class SSN, plus ADCAP torpedoes as partr of experience-for-technology with the yanks, as well as experience in submarine warfare penetrating the most effective ASW net in the world, PLUS unique technologies developed in the program means that the Australians actually managed to kill multiple birds with one stone and got a VERY good deal with the Collins program. </p>
              <p>So you can say all you want lionnoisy, but the Aussies actually made a very good investment and deal. If ST Marine want to build a local sub right now, we will have to rely on blueprints from other countries, and then spend time and money FIGURING out how to develop our technology for our own needs, and then test it and implement it and then troubleshoot it. On the other hand, the Aussies are already into their second generation of advanced SSKs while we are just starting on our first generation.</p>
              <p>So yes, the Aussies paid a hefty price to get the technologies and experience to be the most lethal SSK force in the world, but a the end of the day they managed to trump the USN and as a reward even got yank technologies and ADCAP torpedos! And that is something ST will be hard-pressed to get. Somehow this fact seems to be lost on you if one day the Austraian submarine force ever decide to take on the RSN, the RSN will be in very serious trouble.</p>

              <p><br> yes damn difflcult to build sub. But what is the products look
              like? Since the delivery of last ships,how many days each ship can
              sail? seriouly over budget ,long delay, Just build one class with
              so many problems and claim to be sub designer!! Upgrade upgrade
              every where (in the ship)! Upgrade upgrade every year!</p>

              <p>Don't upgrade.... you say the subs are outdated.</p>
              <p>Upgrade regularly.... you say that the subs got problems.</p>
              <p>So how? I take it that you're still using Windows 95?</p>

              <p>So yes, the Aussies paid a hefty price to get the technologies

              <p><br>Actually I'm not sure if he has any form of critical thinking.... CRITICAL thinking on anything non Singapore maybe, as in he seems to operate on two main modes:</p>
              <p>1)Play up anything on Singapore and give it a good spin</p>
              <p>2)Play down anything in other countries that are better then Singapore, and give them a negative spin if possible... his attempt to downplay the TAR-21, SAF and Singapore security peacetime blunders is a prime example of him shooting off his mouth in his desperate attempts to defend his precious notion of Singaporean weapons and security "superiority".</p>
              <p>Intellectual intergity is something pesky to him and as we can see from his carry-SAR-like-handbag and F-18E-launch-from-LHD threads, he has no issues with warping reality or the laws of logic and physics to suit his own fantasies.</p>
              <p>Hence it's no surprise while the Australians now have most advanced SSKs in the world, managed to trump the USN in exercises that led to the yanks trading off ADCAP torpedos for experience from the Aussies, as well as planning their next generation submarines, lionnoisy is still stuck in trying to create his own fantasy world that despite all apperances the Aussies are not making it with their submarine programme when by all measures they got a very good deal from the whole saga.</p>
              <p>This is no surprise when all you know how to do is to quote articles from the media and demostrate no form of critical thinking except CRITICAL thinking about other countries.</p>
              <p>Since he's so keen on media articles, then prehaps he could love to explain some other media articles about the Australian Defence Forces:</p>
              <p>Like how if the Collins is "partial blind and crippled" it managed to outfox and defeat a 688I class SSN, plus score several hits on American ships despite an entire fleet trying to hunt ONE Collin's class sub? The performance was so exceptional that the Americans decided to help the Australians with their submarine program in exchange for SSK hunting experience.</p>
              <p>Like how if the ADF is supposedly crippled and unable to fight, their troops have distinguished themsleves in combat in Afganistan in one instance managing to kill over 300 of the enemy in a firefight without loss? </p>

              <p><strong>''Only One Amongst Many: Ongoing Problems in Defence
                  Procurement</strong></p>
              <p>Yet, in reality, the Collins submarine program is not amongst the worst
                  managed by Defence, in terms of either additional costs or time overrun. At
                  present there are 15 Defence acquisition programs which have exceeded their
                  approved cost by a combined total of $568 million...</p>
              <p>Even by the worst interpretation of performance, the Collins program would
                  rank twelfth amongst these. Many of the programs are characterised by changes
                  to overseas systems to meet specifications developed by the Australian Defence
                  Force (ADF) for peculiarly Australian requirements. These systems are unique to
                  Australia and typically have proven difficult both to develop and maintain.
                  Within Defence they have attracted the nickname<strong><span style="color:

              <p>Nobody is arguing with the numbers, you are mistaking peacetime readiness for wartime abilities, which is no surprise given all you know how to do is to tally numbers without even knowing how things really work.</p>
              <p>The URD figures will naturally change when a military goes to heightened alert, for maintaining a high URD for no reason (especially out of proportion to current threat levels) is not only wasteful, but means you are running down your own forces for no good reason.</p>
              <p>Unless you are going to come out with some fantasy situtation where the Indonesian navy launched a whole fleet of stealth ships that can sail at 200 knots and reach Australia within 24 hours, I think you're talking rubbish. You are mixing up URD for actual readiness in different alert levels. </p>
              <p>Going by your logic, I can say that we may have 250,000 personnel in our military, but at any one time only a small proportion (less then 10 percent) is actually ready to go or out in ops in ten minutes case anything breaks out. Going by your logic I can conclude that the SAF then, is unable to defend Singapore.</p>
              <p>I think you are deluding yourself if you think just by repeating your old posts people will bother to read them. But I managed to spot yet another mistake in your post:</p>

              <p>''The RAN appears to recognise the risk in this situation.

              </blockquote>
              <p>This is yet another example of you not knowing your homework and relying on the politically-charged media to formulate your arguments.</p>
              <p>For your information, propeller design is among one of the most difficult aspects of submarine design, for having a wrong or inadequate screw design will result in the submarine wasting energy or worse, creating cavitation even at low speeds. A lot of effort is spent designing the specific propeller for the specific class and even then screw design is a very specific art.</p>
              <p>It is not surprising given this is the first time they are working with making their own screws that they are going to need some help from the yanks, the whole injunctment thing is more of a political battle then a technical one.</p>
              <p>What do you mean by how can they give their propellers to the yanks? The yanks are far ahead in this field and the Australian navy stands nothing to lose and everything to gain from this exchange by getting American help... but once again the politics and the media, and you by extension, decide to jump all over it without even knowing what is the case or doing your homework.</p>

              <p>Another example of you talking rubbish. You seem to think the only way to defend any nation is to flood the ocean with hundreds of warships.</p>
              <p>Firstly what is the purpose of an SSK? It is not a picket line ship to form a gaunlet but a hunter-killer that often operates alone.</p>
              <p>What this mean is that the purpose of these subs is not to defend each and every inch of Australian coastline but to be at the right place at the right time, not go on extensive patrols for no good reason. That role is better served by other cheaper means. </p>
              <p>And before you talk more rubbish, remember that one Collins sub is more then enough to wreck havoc with an enemy fleet, as just <em>one</em> sub proved against the USN.</p>

              <p>The question I believe is so what?</p>
              <p>The real fact at the end of day is that Aussies still operate the most advanced SSK in the world, have trumped the USN with it, and are on their way to a second generation of locally-built SSKs which will draw from the lessons learnt from the Collins class.</p>
              <p>Would you criticize the F-22 Raptor for having a crash and hence meaning it is not the most lethal air superiority fighter in the world today or what about the B-2 which just crashed recently? Ultimately incidents aside militaries look at the big picture. What matters at the end of the day if not the Collins have teething issues expected of a first-generation design by a nation learning to build its own submarines in a very ambitious way, what matters is that the Australians have learnt a great deal from that experience, now operate the most lethal SSK in the world, and are going to use that experience</p>
              <p>If we went by your logic then the Americans should have stopped all SSN development after Scorpion and Thresher and went back to conventional boats. PURE RUBBISH.</p>
              <p>In an actual war, it will be us the Singapore Navy turning to the Australian Navy for help on how to conduct Submarine warfare so you best swallow your pride and learn a little bit.</p>
              <p>But I am not surprised given you don't do your homework.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I don't think you know what are the implications of having the hunter-killer abilities of a VirginIa Class SSN, especially in an SSK</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I don't think you know the implication ADCAP torpedos will have in naval warfare in this region </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I don't think you know what a feat the Australians have achieved in creating the world's first big ocean SSK and getting it to defeat the ASW net of the USN.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>The only thing you seem to know however, is the believe blindly in any media article without bothering to make any sense of the facts and implications of what is truly happening. The military and media rarely mix and trying to take the media position in here usually means you are going to get debunked quite quickly.</p>
              <p>In fact the only reason you seem to stick to your media articles is that they reflect negatively on the ADF, choosing instead to ignore the knowledge and common sense of the people in here, many of whom are actually trained in military affairs.</p>
              <p>Are you not behaving like a little kid? Your thread on LHDs bring used for F-18Es is a prime example of that. What happened in there? After acting all man and trying to accuse the forumers of not noticing this development and getting trashed you lost your appitite for a proper debate and decided to start more pointless threads?</p>
              <p>Of course you will not, given all you do is to feel threatened that Singaporeans are going to Australia, trying to convince them otherwise in Speaker's Corner and failing, and then going to Military Nuts to relieve yourself of your fustrations by trying to paint Australians as incompetent in doing anything related to defence when in actual fact you are actually showing yourself more to be a person who literally knows NUTS about military affairs.</p>

              <p>Another case of trying to launch F-18Es off LHDs, common sense apparently does not figure into your estimates.</p>
              <p>If you want to make up figures at least come up with a realistic number. 60 percent for peacetime is pure wishful thinking.</p>
              <p>If the RSN fields 60 percent of its strength each and every day it will actually be hard-pressed to be a fighting force when the stuff actually hits the fan. You might as well say the RSN runs Exercise Malabar 24/7!</p>
              <p>So are you also implying that when we go for any of the annual naval military exercises we have to lower our naval defences because we certainly will not have enough ships to meet your magical and imagined 60 percent?</p>
              <p>It's pretty akin to saying we field all of our Guard Battalions on ops from the moment they do AIT until they ORD, which is pure nonsense. Even our units who do POI (24/7 ops) cannot maintain a 60 personnel out in the field rate 24/7 in peacetime, in the long run it will be disaster.</p>
              <p> In short, this smells like another case of lionnoisy running out of things to say and desperately trying to save his position by invention fantastic figures.</p>
              <p>Seriously, if you cannot be trusted to even make an intellectually honest estimate in your own posts how do you expect people to even bother with whatever you are posting- it is quite apparent you are not interested in any honest discussion at all.</p>
              <p>And for the record I didn't even bother to read whatever you cut and paste, like others we just skim through them to pick out any glaring errors that you make, and the sad thing is they are very easy to spot.</p>

              <p>LOL, exactly. Going by lionnoisy's logic the Swiss need to position an MG post every 200 meters in their mountain ranges. The concept of NATURAL BUFFERS does not exist to him, the entire world is just like a Risk board to him. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>I can see how this thread is going to end, given he is getting badly defeated, he is going to do several of these few predictable actions :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) come up with another lame argument that disregard the laws of common sense and physics in a desperate attempt to save his position</p>
              <p>2) cut and paste more repeated media articles that nobody bothers to read and quote them out of context </p>
              <p>3) quietly abandon this thread, lick his wounds for a while and then start another one later.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In either case it's fun to see him get pwned.</p>
              <p>The problem with lionnoisy is that he's too afraid to face the truth. He would so much rather believe in a world that everybody who leaves Singapore is making a mistake because Australia can't be such a better place then an island he has so much misplaced passions for and in anger he redirects his insecurities an inferiority complex onto Australia to resolve his own inferiority complex.</p>
              <p>But the truth is, if lionnoisy is truly confident that the SAF/ Singapore truly better, we won't have to make so much noise about how bad Australia/ADF is. Is is precisely because he has an inferiority complex that he is so quick to try to put Australia down. In his world things like this can never exist:</p>
              <p>These following statements will cause lionnoisy a lot of discomfort:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>On June 30, <strong>Australia defeated Singapore</strong> 3-0 in their final match prior to the Asian Cup.</p>
              <p>Nepal cleaned up the remaining 7 wickets in two hours to register a 205-run victory over Singapore on the last day of the ACC Premier League match at the TU Cricket Ground.</p>
              <p><span id="more-381">King's College London (United Kingdom) <strong>defeated</strong> University of California Hastings (USA) National University of <strong>Singapore in law debate</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Playoff for 1st-4th Positions 12 April Philippines <strong>defeated Singapore</strong> 3-0</span></p>
              <p><span>India <strong>defeated</strong>. <strong>Singapore</strong> 3-0</span></p>
              <p><span>In Round 9 at St Andrew’s College, New Zealand <strong>defeated Singapore</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span>Malaysian Warriors <strong>defeated Singapore</strong> Wombats @ the Rubber Institute in KL</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In his world these things cannot exist and if they do are just some illusion- hence he will spend every effort trying to find out anything negative about any country that seems to hold any kind of advantage over Singapore.</p>
              <p>But in reality TRUE Singaporeans are confident about their own nationality, and know when to defend it or not.</p>

              <p>They can just detect and track,but cant hit the targets.</p>
              <p>The coastal line in south east oz already runs 2000 km.</p>
              <p>Most of the major cities are there.How about other isolated</p>
              <p>major cities like Perth?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Any US official stamp of approval for Collins existing sys</strong></span></p>
              <p>Dunt talk about the incoming nuke sub combat sys which is still</p>
              <p>under installation.It is another pioneer---nuke sub combat sys installed in SSK!!OMG!It<span style="color: #ff0000;"> just like modern sys not compatiable  in Oz Vietnam era air frame Seaspirit naval heli which </span>has just been scraped!</p>
              <p>Tell me where did u read that US offical</p>
              <p>openly praise Collins?Pl bear in mind the conflict of interst</p>
              <p>for US officials who helps Collins to rectify and supply US sys</p>
              <p>to Collins.</p>
              <p>Again,why did yanks lease Swedish sub iso Collins to learn</p>
              <p>against SSK warfare?Do u know Collins is not installed AIP?</p>
              <p>Do u really believe Collins just need few minutes in 24 hours</p>
              <p>to snorkel?In war,this few minutes will kill any sub!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. SG and oz defense industry</strong></span></p>
              <p>Every new stuff will get problems initially.SG also experience.</p>
              <p>But this is the cutlure and attlitudes that make the different.</p>

              <p>Mates,the main cause is  system failure from the above reports!!</p>
              <p>SG defense industries has been learning and growing steps by steps for few decades,from making bullets for Vietnam war:</p>
              <p>Small arms to crew serve :M16,CIS 50 MG,Ultimax,...SAR 21,</p>
              <p><strong class="Header1">120mm Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System (SRAMS) etc</strong></p>
              <p>Military vehicles:upgrading SM1 tank,M113 APC to design and built</p>
              <p>Bionix etc...</p>
              <p>Field Guns:FH 88.FH 2000,SPH,Light SPH etc</p>
              <p>Naval ships:Very strong in civilian ship repairs and buildings ,</p>
              <p>oil rigs etc</p>
              <p>http://www.stengg.com/CoyCapPro/listing.aspx?pdtypeid=1</p>
              <p>Have u noted ST just start from small and old models</p>
              <p>and progress to modern design and making?</p>
              <p>with the large civilian experience,SG is in a better position</p>
              <p>to build surface ships,but not sub.</p>
              <p>Swedish took 100 years and few generations to build sub.</p>
              <p>Singapore's Transport Engineering achievements include:</p>

              <p>I cant believe www.asc.com.au<span style="color: #ff0000;"> can become sub and war ship designers,with barely one class sub making and two warship</span>s</p>
              <p>making experiences!!</p>
              <p>If u say ASC design Collins sub,then what did www.kockums.se</p>
              <p>involve in Collins?Did kockums just made the bow and escape section for the 1 st ship?</p>
              <p>besides ASC and Metal storm,are there any defense industry in Oz?Any small arms manufacture?</p>
