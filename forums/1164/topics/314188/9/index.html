              <p>Selective reasoning? When Singapore uses a system Isreal uses then Israel is suddenly a battle-hardened nation "in war for few decades" that is our "reference customer" and when they use something different or better it's suddenly a mistake by the IDF?</p>

              <div id="project_details">
              <p>The Commonwealth of Australia placed a contract on Boeing in December 2000 for the development and supply of the 737 airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) programme, Project Wedgetail.</p>
              <div class="rightpullquote">"Project Wedgetail is the 737 AEW&amp;C airborne early warning and control programme."</div>
              <p>Boeing is the prime contractor for the program and team partners include Northrop Grumman's Electronics Sensors and Systems, Boeing Australia Limited and BAE Systems Australia.</p>
              <p>The initial contract was for four AEW&amp;C systems with options for up to three additional systems. The contract also provides a mission support segment and the associated ground based support segments for flight and mission crew training. In May 2004, Australia exercised options to purchase an additional two aircraft.</p>
              <p>Boeing Australia is responsible for providing systems engineering and leading the product support teams. BAE Systems Australia is to supply the electronic support measures and the electronic warfare self-protection systems. Quantas Airways has been awarded the contract for maintenance of the aircraft. The first two aircraft will be completed by Boeing in the USA; the remainder will be modified in Australia.</p>
              <p>The first airframe for modification was rolled out in December 2002, ready for modification and installation of the radar and systems. First flight of the aircraft with the radar and mission systems took place at the Boeing Field in Seattle in May 2004. Performance and flight handling tests were completed in July 2005. The first aircraft for modification in Australia arrived in January 2006.</p>
              <p>Delivery of the first two aircraft, capable of peacekeeping and training roles to the Australian Air Force is planned for July 2009. These aircraft will then be upgraded to full mission capable status by January 2010. The remaining four aircraft will be delivered, fully mission capable, in early 2010. It is expected that the first aircraft will enter service with the Royal Australian Air Force's new Number 2 Squadron, with headquarters at Williamstown Air Base, by the end of 2010.</p>
              <p>In May 2002, the Turkish government signed a contract with Boeing for four 737 AEW&amp;C systems with options on a further two. The sale received US Government approval in September 2003. Boeing is modifying the first and Tusas Aerospace Industries (TAI) of Ankara the other three. The first aircraft for local modification arrived in March 2006.</p>
              <p>Deliveries of the system, to be known as Peace Eagle, are expected by 2010. The first flight of the Peace Eagle was in September 2007.</p>
              <p>In August 2006, the 737 AEW&amp;C was selected as 'sole candidate' for South Korea's E-X requirement for four surveillance aircraft to be delivered by 2012. The contract was awarded to Boeing in November 2006.</p>
              <h2>Boeing 737-700 aircraft</h2>
              <p>The aircraft selected for the Wedgetail is the Boeing 737-700 Increased Gross Weight variant (IGW), based on the airframe of the Boeing Business Jet. The aircraft is flown by two flight crew with between six and ten mission crew.</p>
              <div class="leftpullquote">"The aircraft has a flying boom receptacle."</div>
              <p>The aircraft operates at an altitude of 30, 000ft to 40,000ft with a maximum operating altitude of 41,000ft. The aircraft has state-of-the-art flight deck, avionics and navigation equipment. It has an extensive communications suite including three HF, eight VHF/UHF communications systems together with Link 4A and Link 11 systems.</p>
              <h2>Engines</h2>
              <p>The aircraft is equipped with two CFM International CFM56-7B24 engines each rated at 118kN. The aircraft's maximum take-off weight is 171,000lb (77,110kg). The range is 3,800 nautical miles and the time on station is estimated at more than nine hours.</p>
              <p>The aircraft has a flying boom receptacle and a fixed probe providing dual in-flight refuelling capability</p>
              <h2>Mission avionics</h2>
              <p>The Advanced Systems Division of BAE Systems North America is to supply major elements of the aircraft's mission avionics, including cockpit tactical mission displays, command and control consoles and mission computers. There are six multi-role / multi-purpose mission consoles with ultra-high resolution Flat Panel Tactical Displays installed in the aircraft. Production of the equipment is scheduled to be carried out at BAE's Advanced Systems Greenlawn facility.</p>
              <p>The computers use advanced signal processing algorithms to analyse, categorise and prioritise the data. The data is presented to the mission crew on an integrated situation display on the system console. The open system architecture ensures that the systems can be upgraded and extended. The AEW&amp;C Wedgetail aircraft is compatible and interoperable with the E-3 and 767 AWACS Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft.</p>
              <p>The AEW&amp;C Peace Eagle aircraft for Turkey are being fitted with EADS Defence Electronics multi-sensor integration software.</p>
              <div class="rightpullquote">"Deliveries of the modified system, to be known as Peace Eagle, are expected by 2010."</div>
              <h2>Radar</h2>
              <p>The MESA Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array radar is being supplied by Northrop Grumman Electronic Sensors and Systems Division, based in Baltimore. Tenix Defence Systems of Adelaide, Australia, is supplying some components and modules for the radar. MESA provides 360° coverage and a range of over 200nm.</p>
              <p>The radar has a system track capability of 3,000 targets and can track air and sea targets simultaneously.</p>
              <p>The system's variable track update rates and dedicated tracking modes allow the operator to track allied and hostile high performance aircraft while continuously scanning the area of operations.</p>
              <p>The electronically scanned array features an assembly of transmit and receive modules, operating at L-band and sharing three apertures to provide the 360° coverage. The radar system provides a high level of operational capability because the system is dynamically structured to match the changing mission requirements. When an operator requires a long range view of a selected sector of the operational area, then the relevant system modes can be selected to initiate the search of that sector at more than twice the nominal uniform surveillance range.</p>
              <p>An integrated Identification Friend or Foe system (IFF) is combined with the primary radar and uses the same aperture as the primary radar, which avoids target correlation problems. The IFF system has an operational range of over 300nm.</p>
              <p>The distinctive 'Top Hat' radome provides a low aerodynamic drag profile while meeting the requirement for fore and aft coverage. Two large strakes are fitted on the underside at the rear section of the fuselage. The strakes provide an aerodynamic balance to offset the effect of the MESA radome on the upper surface of the fuselage. In January 2005, flight tests of the aircraft were temporarily suspended while the upper surface of the radome was raised by about 100mm, to improve radar performance.</p>
              <h2>Countermeasures</h2>
              <p>BAE Systems Australia is responsible for the electronic warfare self protection and electronic support measures subsystems for the Wedgetail.</p>
              <div class="leftpullquote">"MESA provides 360° coverage and a range of over 200nm."</div>
              <p>Elta Electronics of Israel has been selected to supply the advanced ESM/ELINT electronic support measures system.</p>
              <p>The system provides 360º instantaneous surveillance and is similar to Elta ESM systems on RAAF P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft.</p>
              <p>In February 2002, Northrop Grumman Electronic Sensors was awarded the contract to provide the AN/AAQ-24(V) Nemesis Directional Infrared Countemeasures (DIRCM) system, augmented with the Viper solid state multiband laser.</p>

              <p>Correct, but lionnoisy has to justify why he, the "layman" who cannot argue with the "experts" can suddenly slam the Israelis for using the Tavor in one thread, and then support them as a battle-harderned reference customer for the SAF in this one because they happen to use the same thing we are using.</p>
              <p>His own logic as always, is inconsistent.</p>
              <p>Also lionnoisy, you post an article on 3G SAF air defence for WHAT when our 3G SAF is not ready yet. You make so much noise about how the aussie tankers are not here yet but dare to talk about a 3G network that is nowhere near ready to make your argument?</p>

              <p>hey sgtyrannousaur.</p>
              <p>dont mind me asking. i really dont know much about AWACS/AEW-C platforms but i do observe two trends.</p>
              <p>in the past its usually large and placed on medium sized civillian jets e.g the 707.  until the development of the e2c hawkeye, there's a new sub-market in the small/business jet sized AWACS. like the saab 2000 erieye and the israeli phalcon.</p>
              <p>but why is the platform being mounted on somewhat large aircraft like the 737 in more recent developments like wedgetail when it can be minaturised without substantial compromise in the abilities in a platform like the phalcon ?</p>
              <p>wont putting it in a substantially bigger aircraft make it a much easier/bigger/fatter target ? i understand the need for room to incorporate more gear. but aside from that , what possible benefits could be derived from a bigger aircraft ?</p>
              <p>personally i think the larger the size of the awacs, the bigger the liability.</p>

              <p>Some one said Wedgetail is much better than Gulfstream.</p>
              <p>I remind him Israel also used Gulfstream.</p>
              <p>Then,do we need to adopt every gears that Israel using?</p>
              <p>Aussie sometimes pick up US military gears,sometimes Spain,etc.</p>

              <p>dont think its a simple matter of size = capability.</p>
              <p>its like chucking all your eggs in a basket. you can have 4 smaller awacs, accept a smaller performance tradeoff *(assumption as i dont know the full performance of the phalcon vis a vis the wedgetail) as you have lesser operators and room for equipment. but if you lose one, it dosent mean that much for you. on the other hand, the strategic significance and value of a single wedgetail is much higher. as it is with almost all high tech wizadry of the military these days, its the people that arent that replacable. not so much the hardware. hardware can be replaced with money but the years of experience and cost of training and handpicking these people cannot be bought back that easily.</p>
              <p>737 has certain clear benefits for example, shared common parts with commercial aircraft, which would lead to lower lifetime operating costs.</p>
              <p>buts its a helluva lot more vulnerable too. imagine the IR signature or the radar signature of it. it would be a ginormous one compared to a gulfstream based phalcon.</p>
              <p>and its simply just isnt as nimble. nimble NOT in the sense that it can dodge missiles or outrun other jets but in the notion that it cannot shift away or react from a possible danger / shift in threat directions. look at the 737 turning radius and climb rate and operating limits compared to a smaller gulfstream and i think you'd get what i am trying to say.</p>

              <p>Moot point, the point of having an AWACS in the sky is to turn on its radar, and turning on such a powerful active radar means that your RCS will be pretty much irrelevant, everyone will pretty much know where you are if you are an AWACS.</p>

              <p>Your perception and reality are wrong, as usual.</p>
              <p>If push comes to shove plenty of nations will dare, and CAN attack Singapore, and WILL cause a lot of damage to it.</p>
              <p>The malaysian military presents a challange for the SAF and can cause plenty of problems for us if we ever got down to the ring.</p>
              <p>Also if the PRC ever goes bad, we are well in range of their airforce and cruise missile saturation attacks. Note that we are just a cluster of targets in a small island, no matter how many AA defence you put up some will get through. Both Gulf Wars are proof of the fact that saturation point air defence is no subsitute for proper Air Superiority. </p>
              <p>The reverse is not true for Australia, safe the US, no military power in the world can reach with without expending a lot of effort due to their geopolitical location. Singapore's centralized location makes us practically fish in a barrel in terms of war waging if it ever comes down to it. </p>
              <p>So lionnoisy you are wrong, plenty of nations CAN and WILL attack Singapore despite our SAF and can cause a lot of damage to us if need be.</p>

              <p>And note that this is a BASIC need, the rifle is the most basic building block of our defence.</p>

              <p>“Now, back to what I had first said,” Cheah said.</p>
              <p>“There are seven problems with the SAR-21 and its carbine form.</p>
              <p>“The biggest one is that it cannot be used by left-handed people. It’s of a bullpup design, see, and if lefties use it, empty brass will fly into their face. There’s no conversion for left-handed people right now, so left handed people have to use their left eye to aim, and fire from their right shoulder. It’s highly <em>un</em>natural…hell, I tried doing it once, and damned near sprained my neck. According to a left-handed soldier, it took him dozens of live-fire sessions before he could hit <em>one</em> target.</p>
              <p>“The next is its so-called safety. It has two safety…buttons, I guess, a little like the Thompson M1921 and its successors…though it really should be called ‘Auto Ordnance’. Anyway, the safety device is at the rear end of the handguard. It can be engaged and disengaged just by pushing the protruding end. The second button is really a fire selection switch. However, the bloody thing’s in the stock, so you have to take your left hand off the handguard to switch between semiautomatic and full auto. In a firefight, the delay is long enough to get you killed, especially if you’re ambushed. I prefer the M16’s safety: it’s very instinctive and very fast.</p>
              <p>“The third problem is with the sights. It uses a 1.5x sight that is pre-zeroed at the factory, and is one of the best sights I’ve ever seen. However, there are no good iron sights, just the pistol sights mounted on the 1.5x sight. I mean, for CQB, you can use the crude sights, but what if the optical sight breaks in open combat? Frankly speaking, you’ll be screwed. Also, in cold weather, the sights will fog up…and the same thing will happen if you fire sixty rounds through it at full auto. An assault rifle should be able to be used in all weather conditions, not just in some.</p>
              <p>“The fourth is its laser sight. The bloody thing can be knocked out of true just by a hard blow to the handguard. Imagine what would happen in wartime.</p>
              <p>“The fifth problem is that it’s incompatible with the M203 grenade launcher we’re using. Now, a modified version called the CIS 40 has to be built so that the SAR-21 can be fitted with a grenade launcher. Hell, a laser sight is incorporated into the CIS 40, since it blocks off the original one.</p>
              <p>“The sixth problem is with the MMS. I mean, standard issue MMS carbines come with a CCTV (closed circuit television) fitted on its accessory rail, a HWS (Holographic Weapon Sight) on top of the CCTV, a pistol grip, a bipod, and another CCTV fitted on the accessory rail below the barrel…the handguard has to be removed, Ding, in case you’re wondering. It’s replaced with some sort of platform built of polymer and fitted with that rail. If necessary, the bipod can be replaced with a laser. Now, that makes three or four sights that you have to zero to point of aim. That’s bloody tedious. Plus, the CCTVs only work if they’re connected to a wearable computer, which is connected to some sort of monitor fitted to the soldier’s helmet. That adds weight, and reduces peripheral vision in CQB.</p>
              <p>“The final problem follows. The gun is of a bullpup design, right? So is the MMS. Now, it’s touted to be able to fire around corners with the CCTV equipped, right? If the corner turns to the right, you’ve got a problem. The ejection port is facing you, and is in your face or chest. If you pull the trigger, that’s where the brass will land. And, in accordance with Murphy’s Law, the brass casing may land inside your clothing, and you’ll have to remove it before it burns a hole in either your or your uniform, or both. For conventional arms, the ejection port is facing your arm or the wall, so it’s not so bad.”</p>
              <p>“Precisely!” Wong exclaimed from his seat. “That’s why we don’t use the SAR-21 or the MMS unless necessary. I’d rather stick with our M4A1s. Besides, you forgot one more thing. The charging handle of the SAR-21 is not what I consider ideal. It’s folded under the sight. To cock the rifle, you have to flip the handle out before you can use it. The M16 series have charging handles that can be accessed immediately, and is ambidextrous to boot, so it does not waste more time than necessary,” Wong continued.</p>
              <p>“The M4s aren’t as reliable as the SAR-21, you know,” Cheah countered, “and reliability is everything in battle. If a gun is unreliable, it’s no good.”</p>
              <p>“Yeah, well, if you take good care of it, it can be very reliable in combat.”</p>

              <p>I served a stint in Guards which along with the Cdos, are the tip of the spear of the SAF, the first to go in if anything breaks out. but yet we didn't get the equipment we need.</p>
              <p>Additionally, go ask anybody who serves in those front-line units who have to fight. None have recieved even basic things like the SAR-21 GL, which is for some reason stuck in development hell for NINE years.</p>
              <p>Worse, in an era when armies are modernizing with modular and advanced sighting systems we are stuck with our 1.5X, and even worse, we see the SAR-21 versions that ought to be used by our troops being sold to other armies.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Yet it remains 
                      a mystery why the RAN, able to call on the USN in the late 1990s for help, 
                      did not monitor progress with the BSY-1 and draw a parallel between American 
                      experience and that of the Collins' CDS, which was clearly replicating 
                      the former. Instead, Navy sought to preserve this part of its procurement 
                      strategy when clear evidence suggested it had failed.</p>

              <p> and so whats the point ?</p>
              <p>you simply think that the RAN is underequipped and undermanned and is fundamentally flawed ?</p>
              <p>wake up and smell the roses lionnoisy. As a force, its still very capable. and if the aussies arent worried about their maritime security. why the hell should you be worried about that ? every military force is bound to have strength and weaknesses .our navy isnt exactly above that. look at the MGB/ recently retired victory class its a compromise decision. </p>
              <p>RAN's biggest problem comes from it being a relatively wealthy country with plenty of coastline and a small population. what will the RAN have to do before it satisfies you ?</p>
              <p>build a carrier battle group and have a 3000 ship navy to guard every single square mile  of sea ? and build a massive airborne defence network ? have soldiers running around in kangaroo boots or inline skates ? </p>
              <p>i bet if singapore had a sampan and australia has a carrier, you'd find some way to argue that our sampan is superior to their carrier</p>
              <p>or maybe RAN's biggest mistake was not to fire every single person in their military and hire you. i am sure YOU have the capability and intelligence to REVOLUTIONISE the australians and turn them into the world's premier "Fighting force" without peer or flaw.</p>
              <p>sometimes i really wonder what dope youve been taking. get out of that bubble and wake up to reality. </p>
