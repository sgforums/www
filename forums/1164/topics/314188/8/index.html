              <p>Hmm who is the one not facing reality?</p>
              <p>Firstly Australia is not my idol country, I am Singaporean and Singapore is where I belong.</p>
              <p>As a Singaporean I believe it is our duty to uphold the honour and intergity of our nation and not smear its name in the mud by engaging in irrational and antisocial behaviour towards our foreign friends by engaging in your kind of behaviour.</p>
              <p>In fact, true Singaporeans will, and as you have seen, have spoken up against your behaviour, which consists of decieving people in here by selectively using media article without presenting the full picture to present reality in your own twisted way.</p>
              <p>Who's the one who keeps ignoring questions asked to him when he can't answer and repeat old and debunked ones?</p>
              <p>Who is the one who refuses to learn from his mistakes and keep making the same ones?</p>
              <p>Who is the one who refuses to stand up for truth and intergity in here?</p>
              <p>On top of that you have been utterly dishonest in creating a clone.</p>
              <p>You say you want to expose the truth in here about Australia, then why do you have to resort to such low and dishonest means such as using a clone, talking to yourself to make it look like you have more support?</p>
              <p>What truth are you showing?</p>
              <p>Do you dare to face the truth and admit to your actions?</p>
              <p>What impression are you giving people of other nations about your behaviour? Or your fellow Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>So you tell me lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>Who are the real Singaporeans that have honoured the reputation of their nation in here?</p>
              <p>It's not you.</p>

              <p>Answer lionnoisy and don't avoid the topic.</p>
              <p>Do you think your dishonest and antisocial behaviour in this forums against your own countrymen as well as our foreign friends have honoured the intergity and reputation of our nation?</p>
              <p>Do you think the hard work, blood, sweat and tears that our forefathers have spent to build up this nation deserves your style of talking about it? A style the dishonors their memory and achievements by trying to twist it to fit a irrational warped nationalistic worldview that has caused many evils in this world.</p>
              <p>No lionnoisy, Australia is not our idol.</p>
              <p>But it seems you have made Singapore your idol, and in doing so actually dishonored and disgraced the very nation you think you are protecting.</p>
              <p>Is it not ironic? You want to make Singapore look good but make it look worse instead. It is the rational Singaporeans in here who give fair play to all sides and nations in here that are honouring what our country stands for.</p>
              <p>So tell me, lionnoisy, who have been the true Singaporeans in here?</p>
              <p>Not you.</p>

              <p>I dont know much about this, but i m thinking that the south koreans actually picked the wedgetail as it would mean greater interoperability with the americans in the event of any military excursion from the Norh. Israeli equipment usually operates on thier own standards. in any case, the market for awacs is really limited. if it isnt exactly a very broad market with different product, either a il-76 based russian awacs, saab erieye, isareli phalcon based or the american awacs. not exactly a lot of choices to pick from.</p>
              <p>Its hard to say if something is 2nd rate or not without taking a full look at the features/technical abilites and examining the possible motivations, political, cost and other important factors. and in the matter of AWACS, data simply isnt avaliable in the public domain to make objective comparisons.  suffice to say, ild just leave it that the gulfstream suits singapore's needs and the wedgetail would have been more appropriate to south korean need.</p>
              <p>singapore simply cant control the straits. we own merely a tiny portion of it. but there are existing frameworks to work upon. malaysia, indonesia and singapore (3 countries bordering the straits) have organised joint piracy patrols to combat the notion that its "piracy infested". in fact, the malacca straits is actually a pretty safe one, attacks have been falling</p>
              <p>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7391004.stm</p>
              <p>regional piracy attacks are relatively high because they primarily occur in the indonesian archipaelago.</p>
              <p>http://www.icc-ccs.org/extra/display.php</p>
              <p>http://www.mindef.gov.sg/scholarship/ST%20-%20Reading.pdf</p>
              <p>but its the possibility of terrorism that is the main fear. not of normal piracy. the worry is that some nutjobs capture a supertanker and sink it in the straits. closing the straits for marine passage. Maybe thats why the US offered its fleet. to have a deterrent value. closing the malacca straits basically screws japan, and denies the US navy a resupply point in south east asia such as singapore</p>

              <p>For example, the Gulfstream AWACS are 2nd rate compared to the
              Wedgetail. The Koreans rejected the Gulfstream and went for the
              Wedgetail. Why is your country sending its troops under 2nd rate
              AWACS?</p>

              <p>Ooooooh ... the Koreans "rejected" the G550 Phalcon?  As in the Koreans had a choice and chose the Boeing AWACs instead?</p>
              <p>Dude, the Phalcon was KO'ed from the competition by the US congress rejecting the export licenses for key systems in the G550 Phalcon.  The "key system" were supposedly parts of the AWACS system developed in cooperation with
              the US government including data links for automatic
              exchange with other aircraft and satellite communications (satcom)
              ground stations.</p>
              <p>... and yet the Boing AWACs was approved *cough* for export sales.</p>
              <p>Basically, the G550's loss was a result of political pressure being brough to a multi-billion dollar arms sales. That can't really be used to construe that it is a less capable platform.  You'll really need to produce other evidence to make such a claim.</p>
              <p>AFAIK, what I've read indicated that the Phalcon had the support of the Korean Government given the initiative by Pres. Roh Moo Hyun to reduce dependance on US defense products.</p>

              <p>I seem to know more about the situation than SG ppl. You asked for ideas, shotgun, here's some ideas.</p>
              <p>1. Legislate so that all ships travelling thru the Malacca Straits and wanting to stop in SG carry some protection systems against  pirates. This could range from basic systems which already exist all the way to weapons like .5 cal. I am not advocating this, it is merely an option.</p>
              <p>2. Work with tribes in the area to work out ways of improving poverty so that piracy isn't needed.</p>
              <p>3. Work with the Malays and Indos more effectively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for Wedgetail vs Phalcon, in terms of capability the Wedgetail is better. Source: <a href="http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/korean-ex-helicopter-competitions-reaching-endgame-updated-01608/">http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/korean-ex-helicopter-competitions-reaching-endgame-updated-01608/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However before you reply, I think the Phalcon is appropriate for SG due to cost and need. SG doesn't need to cover a large area with AWACS like Korea or Australia due to the fact that your land mass is small. I used the Wedgetail vs Phalcon scenario merely to highlight lionnoisy's deficiencies in that he is biased against Aust systems.</p>

              <p>BE COOL Everyone !</p>
              <p>@ Asian aussie, be cool and dont take it too personally man. its an asian thing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span></span> to be in your face and tell you outright from the start that what you know isnt the complete picture. or tell you that you are wrong outright. in asia, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">concept of "face" or reputation</span> is very inherently built into society. you can comment but you cannot embarass and thats the whole thing going on, no one wants to tell you outright your knowledge of the thing is extremely superficial at best. </p>
              <p>if you observe the posts here, most people have been hinting that its not that we arent willing to act . but rather the <span style="font-weight: bold;">onus being on the malaysia and indons</span>. if you look it it  thoroughly, singapore has been quietly improving on our maritime capabilities. we bought the frigates, increased our coast guard, established a new joint CG navy command centre, bought new fast boarding craft, buying choppers for our frigate(boarding), established new maritime commandos/ship boarding activities. and these are only the open domain info. could be alot more that we dont known off.</p>
              <p>We can only do so much. <span style="font-weight: bold;">most of the coastline actually belongs to malaysia and indonesia archipaelago.</span> with about 12,000 known islands and much more unknown islands in indonesia alone, tell me, which nation can spare the resources to fully patrol them ? FYI, even with maritime patrol aircraft, which singapore has 4 of, its by no means easy. Malaysia has been beefing up on its maritime enforcment agency MEA and has dramatically increased spending and planned procurement of aircaft (rotary and fixed wing) but for domestic or regional interest, that is questionable.</p>
              <p>and piracy isnt even the real threat. terrorism is. and in that, you'd find thats where the real effort and money is being poured into. why spend so much patrolling the oceans when u can hit the terrorist networks where it really hurts ? the malacca straits is a small place. usually the modius operani of pirates is to capture and bring the ship to some of the small uninhabited islands of indonesia and <span style="font-weight: bold;">hold the crew and ship hostage</span>.  terrorism would be to <span style="font-weight: bold;">sink a supertanker in the middle of the straits</span> and effectively deny your VLCC and superships passage, which would include aircraft carriers</p>

              <p>Well.My poor knowledge cant discuss with u experts here.</p>
              <p>Israel,a country in war for few decades,also choses this platform.</p>

              <p>Besides,i think the aerodynamic of Gulfstream is slightly better than Wedgetail.</p>
