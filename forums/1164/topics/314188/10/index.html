              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">AdelaideNow: Collins Class a Triumph</span></strong></p>
              <p>DEREK WOOLNER</p>
              <p>May 12, 2008 12:15am</p>
              <p><strong>PEOPLE in the street and some sections of the media dismiss the navy's Adelaide-built Collins Class submarines as monumental duds.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In stark contrast, most insiders we interviewed, as the authors of the history of the project, consider them a naval engineering triumph and a monument of Australian nation-building.</span></p>
              <p>From its inception in 1978 the project was seldom far from controversy and it was mercilessly attacked by the media and the Howard government for a myriad of technical failings – real, exaggerated and imagined.</p>
              <p>It is widely believed to have been a financial disaster, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>yet it is one of the few military purchases where the original budget was still relevant at the end of the project.</strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Further, Australian industry responded successfully to the challenge of building submarines in this country, an achievement widely believed to be beyond Australian capabilities and one in which many other countries have failed disastrously.</span></strong></p>
              <p>During the 1970s the Australian Navy operated British-built Oberon diesel-electric submarines on some of the most secret intelligence-gathering missions of the ColdWar.</p>
              <p>Nuclear submarines lacked the stealth for these covert operations, and the U.S. Navy encouraged Australian military planners and politicians to maintain the long-range intelligence-gathering capability in the Oberons' successor vessels.</p>
              <p>At the same time the Australian submariners developed convincing arguments that submarines were the most effective vessels for use in long-range offensive operations in enemy waters.</p>
              <p>Thus was born the desire to build the most modern long-range conventional submarine in the world.</p>
              <p>Modernity would be attained through a then-revolutionary idea: Instead of taking whatever options for a combat system came with the design, the navy would specify the combat system which best met its needs and this would be developed separately from the submarine.</p>
              <p>Further, following intense debate, it was decided to build the submarines in Adelaide as a focus for industrial regeneration and to provide better long-term maintenance and support than was usually received from overseas shipyards.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>These factors determined the nature of the Collins project. To U.S. submariner Admiral Phil Davis, the project was a huge undertaking, a "monumental feat".</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"There is really nothing in the history of submarine construction that has been done like that," he said of the transformation of a small Swedish submarine into a "radical new design", built 18,000km from the designer's office "in a new yard with a new workforce".</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Amazingly, the project's objectives were largely delivered. Today, the Australian Navy operates sophisticated long-range submarines.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Peter Sinclair, the first skipper of HMAS Collins, who has wide experience with other conventional submarines, believes the Collins is more capable than any conventional submarine at sea, with a turning circle second to none and "super quiet at slow speed, quieter than anything else in the world".</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Few thought that Australia's recession-ravaged industries of the early 1980s could build a submarine. Yet, with the introduction of modern techniques that accompanied the project, over 70 per cent of its value was produced in Australia by hundreds of subcontractors who embraced the exacting defence quality standards. The welding standards remain some of the best achieved in the world.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>THE project suffered its share of problems but the only surprise, given the ambition of the project, was that they were not better anticipated.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With problems overcome through some remarkable defence science and assistance from the U.S., the submarines were delivered close to budget and an average of 26 months behind schedule.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is one of the shortest delays with any military purchase and remarkable for the largest systems integration project in Australian history.</strong></span></p>
              <p>The persisting failure has been the combat system, a testament to both the inadequacies of some of the world's major arms corporations and the unchecked ambition of Australian submariners.</p>
              <p>Even this disaster was <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">salvaged by the expertise and ingenuity of Australia's project engineers and defence scientists, cobbling together a system to provide an acceptable performance.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Derek Woolner is an expert on defence procurement projects, and is Visiting Fellow at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University. He is co-author, with Peter Yule, of The Collins Class Submarine Story – Steel, Spies and Spin.</strong></p>
              <p>The Australian navy has six Collins Class submarines, designed by the Swedish company Kockums, and built by the Australian Submarine Corporation at Adelaide between 1989 and 2003. The construction of the Collins class submarines was Australia's largest and most controversial military purchase. The submarine project was subjected to an unprecedented level of media scrutiny and criticism, became highly politicised and on several occasions faced the prospect of being abandoned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The general public perception of the submarine project is that it was a hugely expensive failure and that the submarines are noisy 'dud subs'. While I am far from being an apologist for the navy, it is amazing how wrong this perception is. The submarines were indeed expensive - all modern weapons are expensive - but the submarine project was one of Australia's few modern military purchases in which the initial budget was still relevant at the end of the project. The submarines were a financial success.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Collins submarines had technical problems - all new and complex machinery has teething problems - <strong>but the general belief that they are 'noisy as a rock concert' is wrong. The reality is that they are probably the second-quietest submarines in the world, with the only quieter ones being the Swedish Gotland class, Kockums' next design after the Collins class. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The minor noise problems of the early submarines, as with the other mechanical issues, have long since been solved.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the submarines suffered from one major defect which the media and the public never really picked up on. The combat system - that is the computer systems in the submarine used to find enemies and fire torpedoes or missiles at them - has been by far the largest problem for the Collins class submarines. The earlier Oberon class submarines had a largely Australian-built combat system which was one of the best in the world. When our submariners began planning the combat system for the new submarines, they naturally wanted an even better one. However, what they asked for proved to be too hard to build and the combat system never worked properly - in fact it was never finished - and it was abandoned in 2000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The navy then ran a competition to select the best available combat system already in operation in foreign submarines - a competition won easily by a European electronics company. However, the result was overturned by the coalition government, which insisted that our submarines had to have an American combat system. As the Americans did not have a combat system suitable for non-nuclear submarines, the consequence was that it was not until 2007 that our submarines began to be fitted with a combat system of the standard hoped for when the submarines were designed back in the 1980s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The media and the public (and even to a surprising extent, the navy) never understood the sheer scale, complexity and risk of the submarine project. Building submarines is hard and getting harder - far harder than building aeroplanes, the closest analogy is perhaps with space ships. To build a hull to withstand extreme water pressures has always been demanding but the increasing complexities of electronics and computer systems make modern submarines among the greatest of engineering challenges. Even countries with long histories of submarine construction often have problems, while countries attempting to build submarines for the first time regularly experience disasters. Dilapidated or abandoned shipyards from Buenos Aires to Bombay, littered with the relics of failed submarine projects testify to the magnitude of the challenges.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The submarine project was taken up with great enthusiasm by the Hawke government in the 1980s as a major nation building endevour to revitalise Australian manufacturing. Consequently the submarines were built in Australia rather than overseas and over 70% of the money spent on the submarines was spent in Australia - a far higher proportion than with most military purchases. The end result of the project is a squadron of submarines that are among the best conventional submarines in any navy in the world and rank with the F111s as Australia's most potent weapons. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Collins Class submarines were an extraordinary engineering achievement and it is testimony to the power of politics and the popular press (lionnoisy) that they are regarded as a disaster</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>Australia leads the way in Submarine development, not STK!</p>

Perception drives the reality of the media, and in general the media misses the mark today when it talks about the Collins class submarines.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The truth is, the Collins class submarine is one of the best submarines in the world, anywhere.</strong></span> Only Japan and the United States are realistically contenders in a match game debate, it really is that good. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Any American submariner who has served on a Seawolf or Virginia class submarine would feel comfortable in a Collins, the same tech exists.

The only real difference is the propulsion system and the size.<br></strong></span><br>The Collins class may not be nuclear, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>but it is a fleet submarine</strong></span>. We have recently learned thanks to released documents that if they were allowed, Australian submariners could tell more than a few stories of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/secret-spy-missions-forced-to-the-surface/2006/09/07/1157222265317.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #336699;">cold war operations deep into Russian waters</span></span></a> in the Pacific, and it is a good bet if they did it with older submarine platforms, they will conduct the same mission profiles with the Collin class, and the Collins class replacement.<br><br>There is a lot of speculation regarding what the requirements of the Collins class replacement will be. From my discussions with people who do know, this is all we actually know..., it will not be like anything on the market today outside the US, and when 2011 comes, we will only hear the generic details. We can only count on three specific requirements leading the design focus: Fuel cell technology, high energy requirements, and it will operate as an underwater mothership for both manned and unmanned deployable systems. There is currently nothing in the market that meets those requirements outside of the US, and sense it is unlikely Australia will go nuclear with its submarines, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>it means there is</strong></span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://informationdissemination.blogspot.com/2007/10/future-of-underwater-warfare.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>nothing in the market designed today</strong></span></span></a> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>likely to be the Collins submarine replacement.</strong></span><br><br>Australia will introduce something new, likely to only be influenced by Japanese and American concepts and technologies.

              <p>"Every car smuggler taking cars coming into Batam from Singapore must wait for the high tide because it allows the boats to dock at the beach, something that people don't expect," Sumandi said. Each large vessel carried seven to 12 cars, he said.<br><br>It is an open secret that the local police, the Navy, the Army and the customs office are behind the smuggling of the used cars from Singapore into Batam.<br><br>These smuggling operations have grown in size since the beginning of the reform era, with importers now competing to bring in cars illegally.</p>
