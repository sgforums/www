              <h1>MK 38 25-mm machine gun</h1>
              <p>The 25mm Machine Gun System (MGS) Mk 38 is a 25mm automatic gun system that provides ownship with defensive and offensive gunfire capability for the engagement of a variety of surface targets. It is designed to provide close range defense against <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">patrol boats, swimmers, floating mines, and various targets ashore including; enemy personnel, lightly armored vehicles and terrorist threats</span></strong></span>. One crewman is required for operation and two for maintenance.</p>
              <p>This system consists of the M242 auto-cannon and the Mk 88 machine gun mount. The M242 auto-cannon is an externally powered, dual-feed, single-barrel weapon which may be fired in semi-automatic or automatic modes. In the automatic mode, the rate of fire is approximately 175 rounds per minute. The M242 does not depend on gases for operation but instead utilizes an electric motor, located in the receiver, to drive all the moving parts inside the cannon. Ammunition feeding, loading and firing, extraction, and ejection are all done by the motor. The Mk 88 machine gun mount train and elevation is controlled manually by the gun operator.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In the event of a major malfunction, the M242 auto-cannon can be removed from the mount and another auto-cannon installed in five minutes by two people.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.simpsonslipways.net/images/011-collins.jpg"><img src="http://www.simpsonslipways.net/images/011-collins.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="216"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>MK-48 Torpedo</h1>
              <p>Torpedoes are self-propelled guided projectiles that operate underwater and are designed to detonate on contact or in proximity to a target. They may be launched from submarines, surface ships, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. The three major torpedoes in the Navy inventory are the Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo, the Mark 46 lightweight and the Mark 50 advanced lightweight.</p>
              <p>The MK-48 is designed to combat fast, deep-diving nuclear submarines and high performance surface ships. It is carried by all Navy submarines. The improved version, MK-48 ADCAP, is carried by attack submarines, the Ohio class ballistic missile submarines and will be carried by the Seawolf class attack submarines. The MK-48 replaced both the MK-37 and MK-14 torpedoes. The MK-48 has been operational in the US Navy since 1972. MK-48 ADCAP became operational in 1988 and was approved for full production in 1989. The SSN 714 <em>Norfolk</em> fired the first ADCAP torpedo on 23 July 1988, sinking the FORREST SHERMAN class destroyer DD 938 <em>Jonas K. Ingram</em>. MK-48 and MK-48 ADCAP torpedoes can operate with or without wire guidance and use active and/or passive homing. When launched they execute programmed target search, acquisition and attack procedures. Both can conduct multiple reattacks if they miss the target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A highly capable weapon, the MK 48 can be used against surface ships or submarines, and has been test fired under the Arctic ice pack and in other arduous conditions. The ADCAP version, in comparison with earlier MK 48 torpedoes, has improved target acquisition range, reduced vulnerability to enemy countermeasures, reduced shipboard constraints such as warmup and reactivation time, and enhanced effectiveness against surface ships. The MK 48 is propelled by a piston engine with twin, contra-rotating propellers in a pump jet or shrouded configuration. The engine uses a liquid monopropellant fuel, and the torpedo has a conventional, high-explosive warhead. The MK 48 has a sophisticated guidance system permitting a variety of attack options. As the torpedo leaves the submarine's launch tube a thin wire spins out, electronically linking the submarine and torpedo. This enables an operator in the submarine, with access to the submarine's sensitive sonar systems, initially to guide the torpedo toward the target. This helps the torpedo avoid decoys and jamming devices that might be deployed by the target. The wire is severed and the torpedo's high-powered active/passive sonar guides the torpedo during the final attack.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The MK 48 Mod 5 ADCAP torpedo is an improvement to the MK 48 submarine launched torpedo. It is a heavyweight acoustic homing torpedo with sophisticated sonar and a fuzed warhead. The ADCAP enhancement includes all digital guidance and control systems, digital fuzing systems, and pro-pulsion improvements which add speed, depth, and range capability. The Navy will produce about 1046 MODS ADCAPs, replacing an equivalent number of baseline (Mod 5) ADCAPs, and maintaining the total inventory of ADCAP torpedoes at 1046. One of the major advantages of using readily available technology to develop an updated weapon using the current torpedo body and off the shelf systems resulted in significant savings and reduction in the development time for the ADCAP torpedo. In addition, by using currently installed systems in place for operating and maintaing the MK-48 torpedo very little additional cost is incurred in new facilities for maintenance and repair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Navy developed two hardware modifications to ADCAP, called the G&amp;C (Guidance and Control) MOD and the TPU (Torpedo Propulsion Upgrade) MOD. The G&amp;C MOD replaces the obsoles-cent guidance and control set with current technology, improves the acoustic receiver, and adds additional memory and improves processor throughput to handle the expanded software demands anticipated for near term upgrades. The TPU MOD improves the propulsion unit as discussed in the classified version of the FY96 Annual Report. Both modifications were combined into one torpedo, the MK 48 Mod 6 (MODS ADCAP).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Software Block Upgrade III (BU III) is intended to provide a near-term improvement for use in the baseline G&amp;C for improved performance in some key scenarios.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Software Block Upgrade IV is intended to provide a mid-term upgrade for use in the MODS G&amp;C for improved performance in key scenarios as discussed in the classified version of this report. It will use advanced sonar and signal processing algorithms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One engineering change planned for the MODS ADCAP, the Common Torpedo Development Vehicle (COT-DV), is planned for fleet introduction in the FY01 time frame. COT-DV is a common processor to be used on all advanced U.S. torpedoes, that will use COTS hardware and be significantly more capable than the current MODS G&amp;C. It will initially use BU IV software.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another hardware upgrade, Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS), is planned for IOC in FY04. Additional information about CBASS is contained in the classified version of this report.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ADCAP torpedo OPEVAL was completed in August 1988, and the B-LRIP report was sent to Congress in December 1988. ADCAP was reported to be operationally effective against certain threats, but not operationally effective against other threats at that time. The system was reported operationally suitable. The Navy subsequently authorized full-rate production, but Congress constrained procurement because of the concerns identified in test reporting. Modifications were implemented by the Navy to improve performance in certain scenarios, upgrade fuzing systems, and improve reliability. These modifications were considered effective. In 1994 a second software upgrade was introduced to improve performance and reliability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The MODS ADCAP (MK 48 Mod 6), when properly employed, is more effective than the ADCAP torpedo (MK 48 Mod 5). Unfortunately, production MOD 6 ADCAPs have shown a significant vulnerability, differing from the test units. This production problem is typical of problems seen in the initial phases of LRIP. The program office is investigating. DOT&amp;E will continue to follow this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Performance in some environments of both ADCAP and MODS ADCAP, against certain targets employing advanced tactics and equipment, still needs to be improved. Shortfalls are discussed in the classified version of this report. The program office is aggressively working to upgrade these modes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The MK 48 ADCAP torpedo R&amp;D program focuses on two specific areas through FY99: Guidance and Control (G&amp;C) software block upgrades and wideband sonar capability. The Chief of Naval Operations continues to stress shallow water (less than 600 feet) as a critical operating area to counter third world diesel electric submarines. Torpedo testing in shallow water has demonstrated that in-service ADCAP has less than full capability in this difficult environment. However, this testing, in conjunction with laboratory simulation efforts, has shown that significant performance improvements can be made by implementing changes to weapon tactics and software algorithms. Development, implementation and testing of these changes is being accomplished under the ADCAP G&amp;C software block upgrade program.</p>
              <p>The focus of the MK 48 ADCAP torpedo R&amp;D program for FY99 and out has shifted from being primarily concentrated on Software Block Upgrade efforts to a coordinated hardware/software upgrade for countering evolving threats and maintaining robust performance. Countermeasure (CM) sophistication and availability on the open market directly affects ADCAP kill proficiency and its ability to counter rapidly evolving threats. The Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) program will develop and field a wideband sonar capable of identifying CMs and discriminating them from the target. CBASS received an ACAT III designation on 17 April 1997, with full rate production scheduled to begin in FY04.</p>
              <p>The introduction of phased prototyping in FY01 will provide a more rapid technology transition path for incremental torpedo improvements and upgrades (including the development and test of New Technology Concepts from the R&amp;D community (6.2) and contractor Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D)). This approach will incorporate accelerated in-water testing of the new concepts allowing early Fleet input into future ADCAP upgrades and help to provide the foundation for Next Generation Torpedoes. These efforts will continue torpedo development investment at a lower cost and shorter term than traditional torpedo development programs.</p>

              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.defence.gov.au/defencemagazine/editions/011204/images/31dsto_gps.jpg"><img src="http://www.defence.gov.au/defencemagazine/editions/011204/images/31dsto_gps.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="313"></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"So what can we expect in the future?" That's a question regularly posed to Defence scientists. It's not an unreasonable question given the public's fascination with technological advances in all fields, let alone defence science.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Yet a question that is asked less frequently, but which is probably far more pertinent is "What's happening now?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For DSTO, the short answer is "plenty". While DSTO is leading and taking part in many projects that have a long-term focus on future warfare concepts, a substantial proportion of our work is directed towards supporting the current capabilities of Australia's air, naval and land forces, in both training and operational modes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO has developed a number of key capabilities designed to enhance the current ADF. These capabilities include:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #000000;">Through-life support of assets, which involves the development and application of technologies for the through-life support of air, maritime and land platforms. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000000;">Operational analysis, which involves the application of scientific methods to assess the effectiveness of military operations. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000000;">Warfighter support, which involves the provision of direct support to the war- fighter through a mix of modelling and simulation tools combined with expertise in human sciences. </span></li>
              <li><span style="color: #000000;">Acquisition advice, which involves the provision of scientific and technical advice on the acquisition of materiel, as well as acting as technical adviser to Defence during the development of new capabilities and their introduction into service. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One of DSTO's longest-running, continuous projects has been support for the Collins-class submarine. DSTO has been providing vital scientific and technical support for the Collins class submarine since the design was first proposed in 1986.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Much of the focus has been on addressing current capability issues, and our work has resulted in significant benefits, including vastly improved stealth performance as a result of a number of magnetic and acoustic investigations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Demagnetisation enhancements have achieved low variability in the final platform magnetisation, and have also greatly reduced the amount of required deperming treatment time, resulting in considerable operational cost savings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO's acoustics work has produced better signature prediction as well as valuable strategies and solutions for management of the acoustic signature.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And, in the combat system, DSTO was instrumental in developing a new open architecture environment which has been of major benefit for the capability.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO's involvement in the F-111 Sole Operator Program (SOP) has also been widely recognised. Among research activities conducted as part of the SOP have been a full-scale tear-down of an F-111 fuselage, full-scale fatigue testing of an F-111 wing, countermeasures trials aimed at reducing the susceptibility of aircraft to infra-red and radar-guided missiles, and the development of a PC-based engine diagnostic and acceptance system that has been installed in the engine-test cells at RAAF Amberley for ground testing the aircraft's TF30 engines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO's involvement in the SOP is ensuring the safe and effective operation of the F- 111 fleet to its planned withdrawal from service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">An excellent example of support to operations has been the successful conduct of trials by DSTO and the Air Force's Joint Electronic Warfare Operational Support Unit to validate the effectiveness of countermeasures to protect C-130J aircraft against threats like infrared-guided man-portable air defence systems, commonly referred to as shoulder-launched missiles. These trials were part of a rapid acquisition fitment of electronic warfare self-protection equipment. In September, the C-130J departed for Iraq operations and was farewelled by the Minister for Defence, Robert Hill, who acknowledged the success of the rapid acquisition program.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO's expertise in air accident investigation has been called on several times over the years. The organisation provides support to the Directorate of Flying Safety to investigate aircraft accidents and has several key investigators on call to respond immediately.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Central to DSTO's success in accident investigation has been the use of global positioning system technology to map the crash debris over an accident site.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In recent years, our accident investigators have conducted forensic investigations of crashes of Black Hawk helicopters, a Eurocopter Tiger helicopter, a US Marine Corps F/A-18, and a Russian-made Ilyushin IL-76 cargo jet aircraft in East Timor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One major fear of all submarine and ship personnel is an outbreak of fire, and DSTO has been involved in fire and smoke research since 1989. Our research provides Navy with advice on the measures required to minimise the risk of, and combat the spread of, fire and smoke, as well as of equipment failure. While we conduct some full-scale experiments, most of the research revolves around numerical and salt water modelling.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Numerical modelling involves the use of computational fluid dynamics to study possible fire scenarios, while salt water modelling involves the injection of salt water (the analogue of hot smoke) into fresh water (the analogue of air), and the subsequent study of the resulting behaviour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Modelling is also a central component of the wide range of DSTO's human factor-related research, which includes human-machine interface design, task workload analysis, predictive modelling and the development of training systems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">There are many more examples of DSTO's work supporting the current ADF; examples that come from all divisions within the organisation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And therein lies the secret behind DSTO's success: strength through diversity. Deep pockets of technical knowledge exist throughout the organisation, and this knowledge is able to be brought together and drawn on to solve problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But it is not just the internal units of DSTO that we rely on to support the ADF. DSTO readily acknowledges that the goal of enhancing the ADF's existing capabilities a wide range of parties, including those in industry and academia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">We have forged strong relationships with companies and institutions that have the appropriate intellectual capabilities and expertise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO is working to further encourage Australian industry to become a key player in the development of the required support.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wherever Australian military personnel are operating or training, wherever Australian military platforms and technology are being used, DSTO's fingerprints can be detected. While research and development into future warfare technologies and practices is critical, the development of solutions to today's problems can never be underestimated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Sare is Director of the Platforms Sciences Laboratory, DSTO</span></p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.ausairpower.net/HMAS-Collins-1-S.jpg"><img src="http://www.ausairpower.net/HMAS-Collins-1-S.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="198"></a></p>
              <p>The role of seeking and destroying an enemy submarine is one of the most difficult faced by Australia's six new Collins class submarines. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The success off Hawaii in August has boosted morale dramatically among submarine crews who have had to endure years of hearing their boats condemned as noisy and vulnerable.</span></p>
              <p>A 1999 report by the then CSIRO chief, Malcolm McIntosh, and former BHP managing director John Prescott said the Collins' combat system should be junked, the vessels were noisy and vulnerable to attack, their engines broke down regularly, a badly shaped hull and fin made too much disturbance when they moved at speed under water, the view from the periscope was blurry, the communications system outdated and the propellers were likely to crack.</p>
              <p>Commander Steve Davies, chief-of-staff in the navy's submarine force, <span style="color: #ff0000;">said that during the past three years those problems had been fixed to the point where the submarines were able to match the best of the US Navy's giant underwater fleet.</span></p>
              <div>            </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During its mock attacks on the Olympia and on two US destroyers, the Sheean fired 28 torpedoes. Commander Davies said "a <span style="color: #ff0000;">respectable percentage" of shots Sheean fired at Olympia were hits that would have destroyed the powerful US vessel.</span></p>
              <p>Commodore Davies, Australia's most experienced Collins commander, said the two vessels were very evenly matched. The submarines also practised landing special forces.</p>
              <p>The exercises provided a crucial test for the Australian submarine, which has been as much criticised at home as it has been feted abroad.</p>
              <p>The Olympia, 110 metres long and 12 metres across the beam, is twice the displacement of the Sheean, at 80 metres by eight metres. The Olympia carries up to 120 crew; the Sheean 45. Many of the Americans are engineers caring for their reactor.</p>
              <p>The Collins is powered by diesel and electric motors and its roles include undersea warfare - finding and destroying other submarines - destroying enemy warships and merchant ships, surveillance and intelligence collection, support for special forces and covert transport.</p>
              <p>Commander Davies said the US sub's size was not an advantage: "It just means you make more noise when you go faster."</p>
              <p>He said cooperation with the US submarine force had increased significantly recently. "<span style="color: #ff0000;">That has come about because they're interested in the Collins class and in our submarine force generally."</span></p>
              <p>While the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Americans run the world's most powerful submarine arm, they acknowledge that changes in international conditions in the past decade and new priorities have left them with tactics to learn from the small Australian submarine arm.</span></p>
              <p>Commander Davies said Australian submariners were used to operating in shallow water. <span style="color: #ff0000;">"That's one of the things the Americans are looking towards us for experience in.</span></p>
              <p>"Ten years ago their submarine force was chasing Russian submarines around the deep ocean. Now, as with all submarine forces, it's more focused on closer inshore operations, intelligence collection or working with special forces. They're looking to us as a submarine force which has a long experience in that sort of thing."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The six Collins' combat systems are to be upgraded further and they will get more modern torpedoes. Those the Sheean used in its clashes with the Olympia were developed in the 1970s; the Americans used a far more sophisticated generation.</span></p>
              <p>While smaller than the US nuclear boats, the Collins is one of the world's biggest conventional submarines. It was designed to cover long distances and the Sheean easily reached Hawaii without refuelling.</p>
              </span></span><p></p>

              <p> </p>
              <h1>MK-48 Torpedo</h1>
              <p>Torpedoes are self-propelled guided projectiles that operate underwater and are designed to detonate on contact or in proximity to a target. They may be launched from submarines, surface ships, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. The three major torpedoes in the Navy inventory are the Mark 48 heavyweight torpedo, the Mark 46 lightweight and the Mark 50 advanced lightweight.</p>
              <p>The MK-48 is designed to combat fast, deep-diving nuclear submarines and high performance surface ships. It is carried by all Navy submarines. The improved version, MK-48 ADCAP, is carried by attack submarines, the Ohio class ballistic missile submarines and will be carried by the Seawolf class attack submarines. The MK-48 replaced both the MK-37 and MK-14 torpedoes. The MK-48 has been operational in the US Navy since 1972. MK-48 ADCAP became operational in 1988 and was approved for full production in 1989. The SSN 714 <em>Norfolk</em> fired the first ADCAP torpedo on 23 July 1988, sinking the FORREST SHERMAN class destroyer DD 938 <em>Jonas K. Ingram</em>. MK-48 and MK-48 ADCAP torpedoes can operate with or without wire guidance and use active and/or passive homing. When launched they execute programmed target search, acquisition and attack procedures. Both can conduct multiple reattacks if they miss the target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A highly capable weapon, the MK 48 can be used against surface ships or submarines, and has been test fired under the Arctic ice pack and in other arduous conditions. The ADCAP version, in comparison with earlier MK 48 torpedoes, has improved target acquisition range, reduced vulnerability to enemy countermeasures, reduced shipboard constraints such as warmup and reactivation time, and enhanced effectiveness against surface ships. The MK 48 is propelled by a piston engine with twin, contra-rotating propellers in a pump jet or shrouded configuration. The engine uses a liquid monopropellant fuel, and the torpedo has a conventional, high-explosive warhead. The MK 48 has a sophisticated guidance system permitting a variety of attack options. As the torpedo leaves the submarine's launch tube a thin wire spins out, electronically linking the submarine and torpedo. This enables an operator in the submarine, with access to the submarine's sensitive sonar systems, initially to guide the torpedo toward the target. This helps the torpedo avoid decoys and jamming devices that might be deployed by the target. The wire is severed and the torpedo's high-powered active/passive sonar guides the torpedo during the final attack.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The MK 48 Mod 5 ADCAP torpedo is an improvement to the MK 48 submarine launched torpedo. It is a heavyweight acoustic homing torpedo with sophisticated sonar and a fuzed warhead. The ADCAP enhancement includes all digital guidance and control systems, digital fuzing systems, and pro-pulsion improvements which add speed, depth, and range capability. The Navy will produce about 1046 MODS ADCAPs, replacing an equivalent number of baseline (Mod 5) ADCAPs, and maintaining the total inventory of ADCAP torpedoes at 1046. One of the major advantages of using readily available technology to develop an updated weapon using the current torpedo body and off the shelf systems resulted in significant savings and reduction in the development time for the ADCAP torpedo. In addition, by using currently installed systems in place for operating and maintaing the MK-48 torpedo very little additional cost is incurred in new facilities for maintenance and repair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Navy developed two hardware modifications to ADCAP, called the G&amp;C (Guidance and Control) MOD and the TPU (Torpedo Propulsion Upgrade) MOD. The G&amp;C MOD replaces the obsoles-cent guidance and control set with current technology, improves the acoustic receiver, and adds additional memory and improves processor throughput to handle the expanded software demands anticipated for near term upgrades. The TPU MOD improves the propulsion unit as discussed in the classified version of the FY96 Annual Report. Both modifications were combined into one torpedo, the MK 48 Mod 6 (MODS ADCAP).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Software Block Upgrade III (BU III) is intended to provide a near-term improvement for use in the baseline G&amp;C for improved performance in some key scenarios.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Software Block Upgrade IV is intended to provide a mid-term upgrade for use in the MODS G&amp;C for improved performance in key scenarios as discussed in the classified version of this report. It will use advanced sonar and signal processing algorithms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One engineering change planned for the MODS ADCAP, the Common Torpedo Development Vehicle (COT-DV), is planned for fleet introduction in the FY01 time frame. COT-DV is a common processor to be used on all advanced U.S. torpedoes, that will use COTS hardware and be significantly more capable than the current MODS G&amp;C. It will initially use BU IV software.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another hardware upgrade, Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS), is planned for IOC in FY04. Additional information about CBASS is contained in the classified version of this report.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ADCAP torpedo OPEVAL was completed in August 1988, and the B-LRIP report was sent to Congress in December 1988. ADCAP was reported to be operationally effective against certain threats, but not operationally effective against other threats at that time. The system was reported operationally suitable. The Navy subsequently authorized full-rate production, but Congress constrained procurement because of the concerns identified in test reporting. Modifications were implemented by the Navy to improve performance in certain scenarios, upgrade fuzing systems, and improve reliability. These modifications were considered effective. In 1994 a second software upgrade was introduced to improve performance and reliability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The MODS ADCAP (MK 48 Mod 6), when properly employed, is more effective than the ADCAP torpedo (MK 48 Mod 5). Unfortunately, production MOD 6 ADCAPs have shown a significant vulnerability, differing from the test units. This production problem is typical of problems seen in the initial phases of LRIP. The program office is investigating. DOT&amp;E will continue to follow this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Performance in some environments of both ADCAP and MODS ADCAP, against certain targets employing advanced tactics and equipment, still needs to be improved. Shortfalls are discussed in the classified version of this report. The program office is aggressively working to upgrade these modes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The MK 48 ADCAP torpedo R&amp;D program focuses on two specific areas through FY99: Guidance and Control (G&amp;C) software block upgrades and wideband sonar capability. The Chief of Naval Operations continues to stress shallow water (less than 600 feet) as a critical operating area to counter third world diesel electric submarines. Torpedo testing in shallow water has demonstrated that in-service ADCAP has less than full capability in this difficult environment. However, this testing, in conjunction with laboratory simulation efforts, has shown that significant performance improvements can be made by implementing changes to weapon tactics and software algorithms. Development, implementation and testing of these changes is being accomplished under the ADCAP G&amp;C software block upgrade program.</p>
              <p>The focus of the MK 48 ADCAP torpedo R&amp;D program for FY99 and out has shifted from being primarily concentrated on Software Block Upgrade efforts to a coordinated hardware/software upgrade for countering evolving threats and maintaining robust performance. Countermeasure (CM) sophistication and availability on the open market directly affects ADCAP kill proficiency and its ability to counter rapidly evolving threats. The Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) program will develop and field a wideband sonar capable of identifying CMs and discriminating them from the target. CBASS received an ACAT III designation on 17 April 1997, with full rate production scheduled to begin in FY04.</p>
              <p>The introduction of phased prototyping in FY01 will provide a more rapid technology transition path for incremental torpedo improvements and upgrades (including the development and test of New Technology Concepts from the R&amp;D community (6.2) and contractor Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D)). This approach will incorporate accelerated in-water testing of the new concepts allowing early Fleet input into future ADCAP upgrades and help to provide the foundation for Next Generation Torpedoes. These efforts will continue torpedo development investment at a lower cost and shorter term than traditional torpedo development programs.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.defence.gov.au/defencemagazine/editions/011204/images/31dsto_gps.jpg"><img src="http://www.defence.gov.au/defencemagazine/editions/011204/images/31dsto_gps.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="313"></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"So what can we expect in the future?" That's a question regularly posed to Defence scientists. It's not an unreasonable question given the public's fascination with technological advances in all fields, let alone defence science.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Yet a question that is asked less frequently, but which is probably far more pertinent is "What's happening now?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For DSTO, the short answer is "plenty". While DSTO is leading and taking part in many projects that have a long-term focus on future warfare concepts, a substantial proportion of our work is directed towards supporting the current capabilities of Australia's air, naval and land forces, in both training and operational modes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO has developed a number of key capabilities designed to enhance the current ADF. These capabilities include:</span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="color: #000000;">Through-life support of assets, which involves the development and application of technologies for the through-life support of air, maritime and land platforms.</span> </li>
              <li><span style="color: #000000;">Operational analysis, which involves the application of scientific methods to assess the effectiveness of military operations.</span> </li>
              <li><span style="color: #000000;">Warfighter support, which involves the provision of direct support to the war- fighter through a mix of modelling and simulation tools combined with expertise in human sciences.</span> </li>
              <li><span style="color: #000000;">Acquisition advice, which involves the provision of scientific and technical advice on the acquisition of materiel, as well as acting as technical adviser to Defence during the development of new capabilities and their introduction into service.</span> </li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One of DSTO's longest-running, continuous projects has been support for the Collins-class submarine. DSTO has been providing vital scientific and technical support for the Collins class submarine since the design was first proposed in 1986.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Much of the focus has been on addressing current capability issues, and our work has resulted in significant benefits, including vastly improved stealth performance as a result of a number of magnetic and acoustic investigations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Demagnetisation enhancements have achieved low variability in the final platform magnetisation, and have also greatly reduced the amount of required deperming treatment time, resulting in considerable operational cost savings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO's acoustics work has produced better signature prediction as well as valuable strategies and solutions for management of the acoustic signature.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And, in the combat system, DSTO was instrumental in developing a new open architecture environment which has been of major benefit for the capability.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO's involvement in the F-111 Sole Operator Program (SOP) has also been widely recognised. Among research activities conducted as part of the SOP have been a full-scale tear-down of an F-111 fuselage, full-scale fatigue testing of an F-111 wing, countermeasures trials aimed at reducing the susceptibility of aircraft to infra-red and radar-guided missiles, and the development of a PC-based engine diagnostic and acceptance system that has been installed in the engine-test cells at RAAF Amberley for ground testing the aircraft's TF30 engines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO's involvement in the SOP is ensuring the safe and effective operation of the F- 111 fleet to its planned withdrawal from service.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">An excellent example of support to operations has been the successful conduct of trials by DSTO and the Air Force's Joint Electronic Warfare Operational Support Unit to validate the effectiveness of countermeasures to protect C-130J aircraft against threats like infrared-guided man-portable air defence systems, commonly referred to as shoulder-launched missiles. These trials were part of a rapid acquisition fitment of electronic warfare self-protection equipment. In September, the C-130J departed for Iraq operations and was farewelled by the Minister for Defence, Robert Hill, who acknowledged the success of the rapid acquisition program.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO's expertise in air accident investigation has been called on several times over the years. The organisation provides support to the Directorate of Flying Safety to investigate aircraft accidents and has several key investigators on call to respond immediately.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Central to DSTO's success in accident investigation has been the use of global positioning system technology to map the crash debris over an accident site.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In recent years, our accident investigators have conducted forensic investigations of crashes of Black Hawk helicopters, a Eurocopter Tiger helicopter, a US Marine Corps F/A-18, and a Russian-made Ilyushin IL-76 cargo jet aircraft in East Timor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One major fear of all submarine and ship personnel is an outbreak of fire, and DSTO has been involved in fire and smoke research since 1989. Our research provides Navy with advice on the measures required to minimise the risk of, and combat the spread of, fire and smoke, as well as of equipment failure. While we conduct some full-scale experiments, most of the research revolves around numerical and salt water modelling.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Numerical modelling involves the use of computational fluid dynamics to study possible fire scenarios, while salt water modelling involves the injection of salt water (the analogue of hot smoke) into fresh water (the analogue of air), and the subsequent study of the resulting behaviour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Modelling is also a central component of the wide range of DSTO's human factor-related research, which includes human-machine interface design, task workload analysis, predictive modelling and the development of training systems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">There are many more examples of DSTO's work supporting the current ADF; examples that come from all divisions within the organisation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And therein lies the secret behind DSTO's success: strength through diversity. Deep pockets of technical knowledge exist throughout the organisation, and this knowledge is able to be brought together and drawn on to solve problems.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But it is not just the internal units of DSTO that we rely on to support the ADF. DSTO readily acknowledges that the goal of enhancing the ADF's existing capabilities a wide range of parties, including those in industry and academia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">We have forged strong relationships with companies and institutions that have the appropriate intellectual capabilities and expertise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">DSTO is working to further encourage Australian industry to become a key player in the development of the required support.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wherever Australian military personnel are operating or training, wherever Australian military platforms and technology are being used, DSTO's fingerprints can be detected. While research and development into future warfare technologies and practices is critical, the development of solutions to today's problems can never be underestimated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dr Sare is Director of the Platforms Sciences Laboratory, DSTO</span></p>

              <p>The role of seeking and destroying an enemy submarine is one of the most difficult faced by Australia's six new Collins class submarines. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The success off Hawaii in August has boosted morale dramatically among submarine crews who have had to endure years of hearing their boats condemned as noisy and vulnerable.</span></p>
              <p>A 1999 report by the then CSIRO chief, Malcolm McIntosh, and former BHP managing director John Prescott said the Collins' combat system should be junked, the vessels were noisy and vulnerable to attack, their engines broke down regularly, a badly shaped hull and fin made too much disturbance when they moved at speed under water, the view from the periscope was blurry, the communications system outdated and the propellers were likely to crack.</p>
              <p>Commander Steve Davies, chief-of-staff in the navy's submarine force, <span style="color: #ff0000;">said that during the past three years those problems had been fixed to the point where the submarines were able to match the best of the US Navy's giant underwater fleet.</span></p>
              <div>            </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During its mock attacks on the Olympia and on two US destroyers, the Sheean fired 28 torpedoes. Commander Davies said "a <span style="color: #ff0000;">respectable percentage" of shots Sheean fired at Olympia were hits that would have destroyed the powerful US vessel.</span></p>
              <p>Commodore Davies, Australia's most experienced Collins commander, said the two vessels were very evenly matched. The submarines also practised landing special forces.</p>
              <p>The exercises provided a crucial test for the Australian submarine, which has been as much criticised at home as it has been feted abroad.</p>
              <p>The Olympia, 110 metres long and 12 metres across the beam, is twice the displacement of the Sheean, at 80 metres by eight metres. The Olympia carries up to 120 crew; the Sheean 45. Many of the Americans are engineers caring for their reactor.</p>
              <p>The Collins is powered by diesel and electric motors and its roles include undersea warfare - finding and destroying other submarines - destroying enemy warships and merchant ships, surveillance and intelligence collection, support for special forces and covert transport.</p>
              <p>Commander Davies said the US sub's size was not an advantage: "It just means you make more noise when you go faster."</p>
              <p>He said cooperation with the US submarine force had increased significantly recently. "<span style="color: #ff0000;">That has come about because they're interested in the Collins class and in our submarine force generally."</span></p>
              <p>While the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Americans run the world's most powerful submarine arm, they acknowledge that changes in international conditions in the past decade and new priorities have left them with tactics to learn from the small Australian submarine arm.</span></p>
              <p>Commander Davies said Australian submariners were used to operating in shallow water. <span style="color: #ff0000;">"That's one of the things the Americans are looking towards us for experience in.</span></p>
              <p>"Ten years ago their submarine force was chasing Russian submarines around the deep ocean. Now, as with all submarine forces, it's more focused on closer inshore operations, intelligence collection or working with special forces. They're looking to us as a submarine force which has a long experience in that sort of thing."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The six Collins' combat systems are to be upgraded further and they will get more modern torpedoes. Those the Sheean used in its clashes with the Olympia were developed in the 1970s; the Americans used a far more sophisticated generation.</span></p>
              <p>While smaller than the US nuclear boats, the Collins is one of the world's biggest conventional submarines. It was designed to cover long distances and the Sheean easily reached Hawaii without refuelling.</p>

              <p>Unlike RSN, Oz made good choice in using pratical, cheaper n proven system.</p>
              <p>25mm autocannon</p>
              <h1>MK 38 25-mm machine gun</h1>
              <p>The 25mm Machine Gun System (MGS) Mk 38 is a 25mm automatic gun system that provides ownship with defensive and offensive gunfire capability for the engagement of a variety of surface targets. It is designed to provide close range defense against <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">patrol boats, swimmers, floating mines, and various targets ashore including; enemy personnel, lightly armored vehicles and terrorist threats</span></strong></span>. One crewman is required for operation and two for maintenance.</p>
              <p>This system consists of the M242 auto-cannon and the Mk 88 machine gun mount. The M242 auto-cannon is an externally powered, dual-feed, single-barrel weapon which may be fired in semi-automatic or automatic modes. In the automatic mode, the rate of fire is approximately 175 rounds per minute. The M242 does not depend on gases for operation but instead utilizes an electric motor, located in the receiver, to drive all the moving parts inside the cannon. Ammunition feeding, loading and firing, extraction, and ejection are all done by the motor. The Mk 88 machine gun mount train and elevation is controlled manually by the gun operator. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the event of a major malfunction, the M242 auto-cannon can be removed from the mount and another auto-cannon installed in five minutes by two people.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>''The Dechaineux was <span style="color: #ff0000;">only 20 seconds from sinking to</span> the ocean floor
                  after a seawater hose broke while the submarine was at its deepest
                  diving depth.</p>
              <p>The accident, revealed in <em>The Australian</em> in July 2005,
                  caused more than 12,000 litres of sea water to flood into the submarine
                  in seven seconds, almost drowning sailor Geordie Bunting..</p>
              <p>Defence last month contracted a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Texas-based company</span>, Oil States
                  Industries, to design new flexible seawater hoses for the submarines
                  that can absorb greater water pressure.</p>
              <p>It hopes the new hoses will be ready as early as next year, allowing
                  the Collins-class fleet to <span style="color: #ff0000;">safely return to the diving depths it
                  operated at before the Dechaineux accident.</span>''</p>
              <p>OMG!www.asc.com.au is the sole Sub designer and manufactuer</p>
              <p>in oz.But now it need US co. to designa and make a hose to replace</p>

              <p>Ok. The points are all wrong.</p>
              <p>The PVs are NOT for COIN. They are simply naval eyes.</p>
              <p>It's unfair to say that the PVs suck because the RSN ships are mostly optimized for coastal defence.</p>
              <p>And if you keep saying that the PVs are fast and unmanouverable, you must be mad. They are slow and manouverable in fact. With a 50m turn radius and max speed of 20+ knots.</p>

              <p> WRONG, our PV will have serious issues trying to engage the new era of threats. The 76mm is too slow and clumsy to effectively engage such targets, especially if there's a large number of them moving in evasive patterns at 40 knots.</p>
              <p>What you need is a REAL weapon, not some 76mm hammer.</p>
              <p>What you need is a weapon that is designed to kill such new threats, not make fancy water splashes that mostly miss them.</p>

              <p>Threat facing PV from terrorism will come from small, possibly fast craft like the ones used to attack USS Cole:</p>

              <p>Weapons our PV have like the 76mm gun, Mistral Sam and Whitehead Torpedos are not designed for such a threat but engagement of larger craft.</p>
              <p>What we need is a rapid firing, small caliber weapon that can engage at smaller, faster targets at high speed and shred them:</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"The corvettes are noted for their tall mast, making them top-heavy compared to ships of similar class."</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">During naval exercises with other countries, their navies noted the Victory's class lack of stability even in basic sea conditions!</span></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">"The Victories are appallingly top heavy, in any sort of slop they roll worse than a Adams class DDG.<br><br>I watched one making very uncomfortable way during a Kakadu exercise some years back, I was on a Fremantle, and while not exactly comfortable we were rolling and pitching far less than they were and making the same speed."</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">RSN cannot keep up with foreign navy stability during exercies! Oh gosh how shameful!</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">How come other nations can design normal corvette with non-top heavy ST Marine cannot?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Worse in severe sea states the corvette is at risk from capsizing! this danger is exposed all the time and cannot be fixed like a pipe!</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">This can happen!</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>"In December 1944, the U.S. Navy met a greater foe than the Japanese -- Mother Nature. A typhoon with 100 mile-an-hour winds caught Admiral Bull Halsey's fleet by surprise. The storm battered 2000-ton destroyers, capsizing three of them and killing 790 sailors. Six months later, another damaging typhoon struck his fleet. As a result, Halsey nearly lost his command."</strong></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">This happen to normal ship, how will top-heavy Victory fare? Worse!</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">This means that if got future enemy blockage SG searoutes further out in open rough sea, RSN Covette dunt can fight effectively!</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Which first world country only have navy ships that must stick to calm weather and avoid storms?</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">This means that even with slight flooding from damage the SG Covette is already danger from capsize!</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">After spending millions of dollars to build these ships is this acceptable?</span></span></span></p>
