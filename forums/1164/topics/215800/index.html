            <div class='col-md body'>While in actual fact,some of these new weapons have found civilian usage. The nuclear reactor would be a pretty good example. The nuclear race to develop a nuclear bomb during WWII has led to millions of people enjoying low-cost,low pollution electricity. No doubt,nuclear power has its flaws but I feel that its one area where military technology has actually helped to better man's quality of life.</div>
