After all a 9mm will still kill you dead if it hits your head. One reason why some elite outfits might choose to forgo head protection, something that proved to be dangerous thinking in Mog.

Its arent a realistic action war film like ' band of brothers' , ' we were soldiers' that uses the word ' realistic ' to hit box office.<br><br>The main objective of the film is to educate the typical public on wat to do when terrorist attack , what the govtment is doing now to deter terrorist attack and wat can happen doing a terrorist attack. It is to info the public on the importance of our country's total defence , whereby the responsibility do not onli depends of the effort of soldiers but the whole population. And also to warn that the repercussion will affect every single one of us.<br><br>If u want a realistic film that runs along with ur military knowledge , sorry thats show isnt directed for u.</div></blockquote>I agree with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I think the everyday singaporean will be able to appreciate this show. If it is too complex, the average Singaporean will not be able to appreciate also.<br><br>In a way, this show will make those who watched it to be more "mentally" prepared in the event that such attacks ever happen to Singapore.<br><br>This show will probably boost our defence readiness better then a dozen x-ray machine at the airport.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lets face it..... This show is not for Military nuts....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I never catch his rank. Where was it? Anyway I could have heard wrongly, 'cos they might have said "sergeant" too fast until it became "sar", which sounds like "staff" in a way.<br><br>Prop? You mean like airsoft guns? Hahah ... the optical scope, probably they borrow from SAF.<br><br>Call anyone tell me why they wear the vest with EOD letters? Is that like a bulletproof vest? What's it for?
