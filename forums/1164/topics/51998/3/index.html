            <div class='col-md body'>the rifle, was a customized version of the remington 700 series(looks more like a confiscated airsoft rifle from the S'pore customs warehouse), long bolt action series. if u noticed, the scene when the sniper mades it first shot was quite unrealistic. He forget to take out the scope covers (to protect the scope lens from dust, sand..etc) before pulling the trigger. U mean he is so accurate to hit a target with a coveres scope blocking his aiming ? power sia  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Its quite stupid. He was also shown loading quite a "few" rounds of bullets into a typical m16 ammo magazine. hmm, doesn't look right either.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  The sniper rifle he was using had a 4-5 internal mag capacity. The bad guys in the warehouse were using Glocks , my guess would be either Glock 17 or 19. I did saw a Browning HP in one of the recent espisode.
