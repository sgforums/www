Its a headache for us to file the MRs as well.  I'd follow some of the exercise troops out once in a while, and I see the way they abuse my equipment, "breaks my heart."<br><br>But seeing what kinda rough treatment the equipment were subjected to, I was also able to feedback to my superiors on the equipment viability as well as come up with "usage" guidelines for the exercise troops.  It pisses them off, but it saves time &amp; money in terms of logistics.<br><br>However, its not always the exercise troops' fault.  It can be higher ups that make stupid decisions without ground-level knowledge.  Eg "Inflatable Dinghies loaded with heavy equipment beaching largely graveled areas is more cost saving that aluminium hull boats."  Makes one wonder if the stars and the crabs actually have thought process.<br></div>
