            <div class='col-md body'>I was browsing thru one of my old favourite sites HKPro.com when I ran across tis pic.. As ALL of us noe, safe gun handling is one of the TOP priorities for a police/military unit as the consequences of a firearm wif live ammunition in unprofessional hands will onlie result in disaster. The pic below is such an insult tat I juz cant help but post it! LoL!<br><br><img src="http://www.hkpro.com/action8mp5yikes.jpg"><br><br>This pic was taken in the 2002 World Cup in Korea of a police officer on duty. As all of us can already see, his finger is ON THE TRIGGER when it shld be off it. More shockingly, the gun is set to SEMI-AUTO!! Holey cripes! Tink he'll get into some deep-**** after tis pic though.. Hehe.. Oh yeah, notice the how his gun is held.. Angled towards a HUGE crowd.<br><br>**Any more of tese unprofessional pics to share?

            <div class='col-md body'>I have the dubious opportunity to work on J I (go figure) where security is tight and go through the checkpoint every day.<br><br>Most of those doing sentry duty are NS Men (Reservist), sometimes NSF together with CISCO etc. Most times spot them with finger "on" trigger; till someone wrote in and a change in "Standing Orders" put a stop to it. (although still spot sentries 'sitting down' at times).<br><br>Having your finger on the trigger is ill-advised (as this is poor weapon safety). The M-16 has space on the pistol grip for all 4 fingers (your tumb wraps round other side duh!) as original design was for larger hands. The SAR 21, being local design is designed for asian users with a shorter pistol grip.<br><br>The tendancy for your index/pointing finger to 'stray' onto the trigger is hard to suppress. Blame it on this small oversight, as well as economy on materials, .<br><br>It may also be interesting to ask if all weapons basic design parameters pre-suposes that finger "on" the trigger; is more likely state than, finger 'off' the trigger.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure he put his finger on trigger only because he didn't cock the weapon yet, so it is perfectly safe. I think it is normal practice for people who are acting merely as guards to not cock the weapon. You only cock your weapon when the threat is obvious like for example, we are police, and now we know the location of one bunch of drug traffickers. Then we go and attack them traffickers, so on the way before we reach the building where they are hiding, we cock the weapon. Things like that etc..... Not cock the weapon when there is no clear threat. It would be dangerous if police go around with cocked weapons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Johnston:</div><div class="quote_body">no.</div></blockquote>uh huh as other people have already pointed out, if a round hasn't been chambered (ie. the rifle hasn't been cocked), having a finger on the trigger isn't dangerous at all. It's sloppy soldiering at worst.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha, maybe like the SAF, it's just an empty mag and the loaded one is in the SBO... in which case, they, like us unlucky guard duty personnel, walk around with the weapon in semi all the time...</div>
