              <p>Chinese are apathetic to politics, they just want their lives to get better, fully agree. Do they really love the 'communist' government? don't think so, but do they hate them so much that they want to topple them anytime? that would the the wish of the american. interesting to note that a 10 yr old knows what the jap did in china during WW2, was he brainwashed or he knows more about the history than many singaporean?</p>
              <p>the chinese government need to bring development to many areas, hoping to reduce the income gap vs the coastal areas, but are the chinese in the same kind of situation like those in the middle east? I don't think so. so even if the government don't take hush action, the jasmine movement is not likely to cause a stir in china.</p>
              <p>How would china end up war against G(20-1)?</p>
              <p>Did the KMT and Lao Mao not join force against the Jap in WW2? do you think taiwan would stand alongside Japan in the dispute for Diaoyutai?</p>

              <p>hinese are apathetic to politics, they just want their lives to
                          get better, fully agree. Do they really love the 'communist'
                          government? don't think so, but do they hate them so much that they
                          want to topple them anytime? that would the the wish of the
                          american. interesting to note that a 10 yr old knows what the jap
                          did in china during WW2, was he brainwashed or he knows more about
                          the history than many singaporean?</p>
              <p>the chinese government need to bring development to many areas,
                          hoping to reduce the income gap vs the coastal areas, but are the
                          chinese in the same kind of situation like those in the middle
                          east? I don't think so. so even if the government don't take hush
                          action, the jasmine movement is not likely to cause a stir in
                          china.</p>
              <p>How would china end up war against G(20-1)?</p>
              <p>Did the KMT and Lao Mao not join force against the Jap in WW2?
                          do you think taiwan would stand alongside Japan in the dispute for
                          Diaoyutai?</p>

              <p>He even knows China has 200 warheads! Since its advantageous for China to make the USA look warlike, they also told him USA has about 3000. Unfortunately they know everything about Chinese history, and little about world history. For example they think China won WW2 all by themselves.</p>
              <p>That kid also knows alot of funny jokes about Japanese being stupid people who fled China many centuries ago. :)</p>
              <p>He said on the first settler's voyage to Japan, their scriptures got wet and smudged- hence Japanese script's appearance. And when he reached Japan, he brought a round biscuit and put it on a table. The natives were so awed they made it their flag.</p>
              <p>More anti-government, anti-Japanese humor- look at this <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu_10_Mythical_Creatures#Ya_Mie_Die" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu_10_Mythical_Creatures#Ya_Mie_Die">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu_10_Mythical_Creatures#Ya_Mie_Die</a></p>
              <p>While KMT and CCP supposedly suspended the Chinese Civil War, at best they were building up reserves to fight each other, more often they attacked each other. Chiang had to be physically threatened into this arrangement. The US put pressure on the KMT to use its arms shipments against the Japanese as intended, threatened to stop them if not.</p>

              <p>You miss the point.  Not all Singaporeans hate Japanese.  Look at all the Anime loving otakus we have in here.  </p>
              <p>The point is that, it is inappropriate and to hold so much hatred to Japanese of a generation that has totally nothing to do with the atrocities of WW2.  Yes, they should know of their history, but to say that Japan today, should be nuked (which they are on the way of being self-nuked), is just being darn uncivilised. </p>
              <p>Conversely, I think Singaporeans dislike mainland Chinese.  But thats only because they are coming here in droves and not fitting in.  Yet, I don't see Singaporeans crying for Chinese blood or microwaved carcasses. </p>
