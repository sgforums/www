For most people, living is all about acting anyway. One tends to have different identities, assuming different responsibilities in different situations.  It is never easy to have every one acting professionally in the Armed Forces.<br>We must remember that we are made up mainly of civilian soldiers and of course we are never tested in war before. But do we really want a war just to show how good we are?  Deterrence and political alliance are still the best policies now. True, it might be wayang when Singapore sends troops to Iraq, East Timor etc etc but it is not just as simple as showing off to the world.<br><br>When one grows older, one's mentalities and priorites will change.
