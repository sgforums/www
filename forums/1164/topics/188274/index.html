            <div class='col-md body'>We have retired the Super Skyhawks not too long ago. We have still alot of A-4 airframes bought 2nd hand from the USN in the past. My question is what we can do with them? Of course, some have been sent to mueseums, local polytechnics for education purposes and as reserves but there are still quite a lot more. What can we do with them?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am thinking we can convert them into UCAV. After all they have been combat aircraft to begin with. We can use them as flying decoys (as UAV) during SEAD missions. These unmanned flying aircraft  will fly infront of the manned strike aircraft to make the enemy on their radar to track it. Once the radar is on, the strike aircraft flying behind can fire of a HARM missile. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not a new idea, using old combat aircraft as target drones.  The USAF did that a long time ago with a the old F-104, 101, and 102 spares.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I also agree that using them as target drones is a useful way of disposing old aircraft. On the other hand, if RSAF have the capability to convert the planes can fly unmanned as target drones, i think we can use them as decoys as well. If our technology is good enough we can even consider converting  these unmanned decoys and/or target drones into UCAV. After all they are previously combat aircraft.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think they will be kept in storage, and could be brought back to operational status in case of an emergency. If i'm not wrong, the fennecs, hueys and hunters are still kept in storage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Converting some of them into target drones isn't such a bad idea. The question is: what's the cost of doing doing that?<br><br>Anyway, I've heard that some of them have been converted into advanced jet trainers.... can anyone confirm?<br><br>And also, I'd like to see at least some of them kept in storage. Not a bad idea to have some old but functional Skyhawks operating in times of war in case if we do have a lot of Vipers shot down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, provided the current generation of Viper pilots know how to fly the A-4s.  They are very different planes, both in design and operations envelope.  Much of the work in the F-16s are done by computers and sophisticated avionics.  Whereas the A-4s require more manual switch flipping.  Its not safe to say that an F-16 pilot who bombs with the F-16s CCRP system can also bomb using the A-4s manual systems.<br><br>Hence, does storing them as reserve for war really help? RSAF pilots are getting younger.  In fact, the RSAF intends to keep their pilots as young as possible.  So all the lau chiau A-4 pilots would either be gone or in senior command positions alr.<br><br>In the UCAV role, I think we already have cheaper alternatives than using re-engineering the huge fleet of A-4s to become extraordinarily large and difficult to maintain UCAVs.  Target drones will be the best solution.  Mount ECM systems on the A-4 and test how effective our ECM systems really are against real missiles.  AT LEAST, that would help save lives in real war.</div>

I have the buying power and my company has an empty space where I can display the plane," the newspaper quoted Zhang as saying.<br><br>The eBay Web site for the transaction shows the plane is currently located in Lewiston, Idaho.<br><br>It said the fighter jet, last flown in 1995, has been inspected by a museum and found to be in excellent condition.<br><br>The seller was only identified by the username "inkgirle."<br><br>The Beijing News quoted Zhang as saying he learned from the seller's son by telephone that the fighter jet was retired by the Czech military.<br><br>It wasn't immediately clear if the fighter jet can be imported into China. Zhang said he is waiting for government authorities to get back to him, The Beijing News reported.<br><br>An operator at China's customs department said no one was available for comment.<br><br>"There is the precedent of a Chinese company buying a retired aircraft carrier, but I don't know if this jet plane is a banned item," Zhang reportedly said.<br><br>Zhang was apparently referring to the Soviet-built Minsk aircraft carrier that a Chinese company bought and converted into a floating theme park in the southern city of Shenzhen. The company went bankrupt and recently put the ship up for sale.<br><br>The report gave no indication where in China Zhang was located.<br><br>eBay's government relations department didn't immediately respond to a reporter's e-mail seeking comment.<br><br>Maybe we can sell our A-4s to collectors as well? Hahaha.  If we can make them airworthy, we can rip out offensive systems, and leave basic avionics and sell it to private aircraft owners in the US. =D</div>

The Isrealis, Americans, etc, store up old aircraft just in case....  There are technologies available (and I don't mean hardware, but wraps, sealants, etc) that can keep a aircraft in halfway decent shape during preservation.  Also, they service them before they fly again lah.<br><br>Heck, the Americans are happily selling their old F16A/B/ADFs to various countries as second hand planes.

            <div class='col-md body'>RSAF still places old airframes from the 60's, 70's like Strikemaster (or even older) at airbases. I can only imagine that they are there as decoys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Had been decided last year to scrap and meltdown down rather than to sell of in the market. These Super A4s are not going to follow the footstep of Strikemasters and Hunters which ended in somebody/hobbist backyard. This is to honour the services of these great machines that kept our skies safe<br>for 31 years against intruders (just joking only !!)<br><br>But the rational is that A4 were American made and need approval from uncle SAM for transfer to 3rd party. Keeping them in long termed preservation as war reserves is madness in economic sense. In time to come, you can go to National Iron and Steel and try to savage some perculiar parts of the A4 for keepsakes before condemned into the smelter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>Correction. no such thing as halfway decent shape during preservation. You need to service them daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, weekly engine runs and functional checks to make the systems work on ground condition. In fact they keep them as war reserves but they have to perform these tasks to keep them ever-ready in hard shelters/hangars. They need to be 100% airworthy. Perservative wrapping is just to prevent corrosion and only work in dry climatic condition but not in tropical conditions due high humidity. Say after 15 yrs in storage condition in desert with engine and main component removed, then corrosion is minimal. Inorder to make it in flying condition, it has to go thru a complete 'refurbishment' on the airframes, structure and control systems then buildup for completeness and flight tests. So there are two different conditions for preservation of aircraft in airworthiness status and carcass storage</div>

Aircraft stored in their boneyards, not all are US.<br><br>Note some of our A4's came via their boneyard.  IIRC, perishable  eg batteries are removed.  Hydraulic fluid drained and replaced with something else.  Cockpit windows coated over from the outside. Pitot tubes sealed.</div>
