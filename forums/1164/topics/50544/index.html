The team is also looking at the animal kingdom, computer games and movies for ideas to give Singapore an edge on the battlefield.<br>.<br>"We are still trying to figure out what lessons we can draw from Matrix Reloaded Â… maybe Finding Nemo would be more instructive," quipped Brigadier-General Jimmy Khoo (picture) from the Future Systems Directorate (FSD).<br>.<br>As the head of FSD, BG Khoo's formal title is one that will also not be out of place in any sci-fi movie: Future Systems Architect.<br>.<br>But FSD is no aberrant child within a disciplined order. The Ministry of Defence and SAF started looking at effecting major changes two to three years back.<br>.<br>The fact that FSD reports directly to the Mindef Permanent Secretary and the Chief of Defence Force also reflects the importance of transformation.<br>.<br>Such radical rethinking within the military establishment was driven by the new uncertain security environment that Singapore finds itself in after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks and subsequent discovery of Jemaah Islamiyah cells here.<br>.<br>"We need to transform SAF into a very flexible and agile force that will be able to adapt quickly to new threats and new missions, some of which we may not even have thought about yet," BG Khoo told Today shortly before today's SAF Day.<br>.<br>Besides, the SAF also had to contend with the so-called revolution in military affairs, fuelled by information technology.<br>.<br>This new landscape has presented new conceptual possibilities in the way military force can be deployed, and the world has had a glimpse of this potential in the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, said BG Khoo.<br>.<br>For example, there was the extensive use of "smart weapons" capable of surgical strikes. There was also the advent of unmanned aircraft, fully controlled from the US, being used to conduct missions traditionally done by fighter aircraft, he added.<br>.<br>Right now, Singapore's FSD is looking at exploiting information systems as a force multiplier.<br>.<br>"Our conviction is that victory on the future battlefield would go to the side that is best able to harness the exciting new technologies to achieve information superiority Â— seeing the adversary first, knowing more about him and the battlefield, understanding the combat situation better, enabling superior decisions and faster action," BG Khoo explained.<br>.<br>The whole idea is that the force multiplier effect of superior information can improve the capabilities of the SAF to the extent that there would be changes to traditional organisation structures and processes. It will also move the focus away from fighting platforms such as tanks, ships and aircraft.<br>.<br>However, these ideas are still in the experimental stage. "We need to explore and check out the ideas, the hypotheses, so that we can shape them, pick the best, before plunging into implementation," said BG Khoo.<br>.<br>This is where the new SAF Centre for Military Experimen-tation comes in. It will test such new concepts in a virtual environment.<br>.<br>Set up in Stagmont Camp in Choa Chua Kang, about four kilometres from the Mindef complex, the centre with three laboratories will provide modelling and simulation facilities for the army, navy and air force. Although experiments have begun, the centre will be officially opened later this year, said BG Khoo.<br>.<br>But the innovation will come not so much from the facilities but the people that make up FSD.<br>.<br>Now, it is made up of a small staff of 11 military people drawn from a diverse mix of engineering and humanities backgrounds.<br>.<br>"Being small has an inherent advantage that we cherish Â— we are able to informally and quickly test ideas and concepts," said BG Khoo. Another advantage is the youthful idealism of the team.
