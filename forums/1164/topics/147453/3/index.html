            <div class='col-md body'>While we're doing the wanton cut-and-paste thing, here's a little gem in response to the Argyll report (http://indymedia.org.uk/en/2004/06/292709.html):<br><br><blockquote>FLEET STREET'S armchair warriors thrilled to the news last week that soldiers of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders had defeated a large force of Shia militiamen in Iraq in an action involving bayonet charges - the first by British troops since the Falklands war. No one loves the flash of cold steel more than a tabloid sub-editor, and the hacks had a field day. "Bayonet Brits kill 35 rebels" drooled the Sun. "Our boys' victory in brave charge", said the Daily Star. The Daily Mail reminded readers that the Argylls formed the Thin Red Line at Balaclava, while the Grauniad's Stephen Moss mused upon the "psychosexual effect on the user" of fixing a bayonet to one's weapon. Among all the lovingly-reported detail of Iraqi bodies strewn across the highway and floating in the river, no one stopped to ask why the Argylls had used bayonets. The Eye has learned that the soldiers involved are furious at the gung-ho press coverage because it ignored the actual reason - that the ill-supplied Argylls were so short of ammunition that they had no choice but to resort to the bayonet or be killed.<br><br>Doesn't this rather suggest that the people that were killed might have been unarmed? </blockquote>Nice to see that not everybody gets caught up in a testosterone tornado. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

If the bugger's aggressive enough, and if he's got the ammo, what need is there for him to use the bayonet?<br><br>I see your point, but of course by this time you'd have realised that bayonet fighting is only a manifestation fo the issue, which is that if you're going to send the bugger out into the battlefield, you'd jolly well make sure he's aggressive enough to perform his task.<br><br>Now, taking into consideration that we've now effectively got a 2-year, 9-to-5 army, would it not make more sense to build that aggressiveness into tasks that soldier is more likely to use in actual combat?</div>

The soldiers escaped, only to be ambushed a second time by a larger group of militia, armed with machine-guns, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars.<br><br>Reinforcements were summoned from the Princess of WalesÂ’s Royal Regiment at a base nearby. "There was some pretty fierce hand-to-hand fighting with bayonets fixed," the source added. "There were some classic assaults on mortar positions held by the al-Sadr forces."<br><br>Official spokesman Major Ian Clooney confirmed the Mehdi army "took a pretty heavy knocking", but refused to specify tactics.

            <div class='col-md body'>The real problem is that if you want to be good at bayonet fighting, you need to spend time on it. If you want to spend time on it, time must be taken away from elsewhere in the training programme. So what do you want to cut to incorporate bayonet training?<br><br>I think bayonet training is fairly useless. It is far better to ensure that our soldiers simply don't run out of ammo or know how to disengage effectively with their last ammo, instead of wasting time running up and down a field with bayonets fixed. The Argylls were very lucky -- even half-competent opponents would have massacred them -- indicating the Iraqis were simply incompetent. I would not trust the lives of our soldiers to the incompetence of the enemy. Whatever time would have been used on bayonet training should be spent at the range or performing combat drills.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh me, oh my - you've really gone out to town with your little theories this time.  Why don't you ask True_Xerion and the_Don if I stay in Ang Mo Kio?  I must have whipped up one hell of a facsimilie of the Great Ocean Road to have fooled them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> One difference between you and me is that while you spend your time trembling behind your keyboard, people on this forum know me in person, have met up with me not only in Singapore but in Australia,  and are laughing at your little postulations about me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You just go on saying that I'm not this and not that - the only thing you're showing is that you're so much living in denial that you may as well have an Egyptian passport.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, that's all irrelevant to this thread.  if you're so thick as to be unable to understand the simple points I'm making here, I suppose I shall have to spoonfeed you.<br><br>Okay, let's get the basics out of the way first.  First, I'm not disputing that it happened.  Second, as I said, it's nothing against the Argylls.  We clear on that so far?<br><br>What I am saying is that there's something seriously wrong with this picture.  If you have a half-mag of ammo in your M-16 and someone comes charging at you with a bayonet, what would you do?<br><br>The guy's charging, not running and evading, so you've got all the time in the world to get a good bead on him, and you've got 15 rounds to make sure you got the job done right.  In fact, since it's 5-to-1, assuming that everybody's got a half-mag each, so one round out of 75 hitting the enemy in the right spot's pretty damned good odds.<br><br>Under normal circumstances, and all things being equal, the Argylls' bayonet charge would have been their last stand, glorious though it may be.<br><br>Okay, now pay attention, here's the important part: it's obvious that the circumstances were not normal and not everything was equal, but there's not enough detail to describe what actually happened, and nobody's said a whole lot more than what was reported in the original article.<br><br>What facts do we have on hand here?<br>- 20 Argylls performed a bayonet charge<br>- 35 enemy bodies were found, and 9 were captured<br><br>How were those 35 killed?  Were they bayoneted or shot before the bayonet charge?  The article doesn't say.<br><br>The article alleges that there were 100 enemy fighters.  Simple mathematics - what happened to the other 56 enemies?  The article doesn't say.<br><br>Why are these questions relevant?  Because the answers will allow us to develop a clear picture of what happened.<br><br>For all you know, the 35 dead enemies were all shot before the charge, the remaining 56 ran off because they were out of ammo, and the 9 captured were stragglers who were left behind.  We'll never know with the information on hand, will we?<br><br>Now, once again to be clear, I'm not saying this as any attempt to discredit the Argylls.  They got ambushed and they did more than well enough to produce the result that they did.<br><br>In light of the theme of this thread, the key question about the incident would be, "Was the result of 35 killed and 9 captured specifically the result of the bayonet charge?".  The fact is that the information is so thin that you cannot reasonably conclude that the result was due to the bayonet charge, because there are a number of other plausible factors involved.  Ragsheets such as The Sun are known for being thin on facts and heavy on hyperbole, and that in itself is reason enough to question the article.<br><br>There's the debate if you want one.  If you want to take things personally, hey, you're welcome to do so and make yourself look dumb.  Up till the point you showed up, this was a proper discussion, so it's up to you to decide to behave yourself.  I'm very amused by your little theories about me, and if you want to continue with that, why not start a thread flaming me?  We've got other things to discuss here.</div>
