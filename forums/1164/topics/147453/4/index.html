            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, i haven't gone to search google about this incidents?  But where there only 20 Argylls?  I read the post that tvdog posted... never said anything about having only 20 argylls wad.<br><br>Besides, there isn't much point in arguing.  We weren't there, we don't know the circumstances are exactly.  But from what I heard, the iraqi insurgents aren't exactly the most proficient riflemen to begin with.  Most of them would just stick out their rifles, and put a long squeeze on their AK-47s.<br><br>I'm not surprised if a regular infantry platoon can produce similar results.  Besides, in the report, it mentioned mortar support.  I figured the insurgent probably broke off and ran for it as the mortar barrage started.<br><br>As for the bayonet incident... well, I won't consider it a smart thing to do.  Then again, I guess we won't know what kinda effects a demonstration of aggression such as fixing bayonet  had on the opposition.<br><br>Its like the question I asked my sect comd in bmt.  "Why do we charge at the enemy immediately?"  It was about the "Enemy Right, Charge" Command.  We were told that if we spotted the enemy less than 20 meters or 30 meters on either of our flanks, we'd charge immediately at them.   The best answer he could come up with was, "Well, cos there isn't much else left to do."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind you, pistol in a thigh holster would be nice to have, but yeah, gedaken raised a good point about weight, a bayonet would be still be lighter than an SAF standard issue P226 and two spare mags, and, those who have fired a pistol would  agree with me, firing a handgun is NOT easy ! ... learning how to shoot a pistol will take quite a bit more training and practise than learning how to shoot a rifle to pass ATP (read: more ammo costs), and good point again about an edged weapon being good for despatching sentries etc ... i'm sure even those who're not for bayonet fighting per se would agree that a good combat/survival knife would be good to have, armed combat beats unarmed combat any day ....<br><br>and longish bayonets would not be a good idea i think, it would only be an encumbrance ... of course bayonet fighting with a short bullpup rifle like the SAR 21 would be different from fighting with an M16S1, no buttstrokes for one,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  .... and the key to fighting with a bullpup rifle is to parry the first thrusts and get inside the enemy's frontal arc of movement, with an M16, you'd parry and thrust at arm's length, with a bullpup however, you'd keep your rifle close in to your body, parry the thrust, and move in close to stick it in, because you're inside his frontal arc of movement, once his first thrust is parried away, because of your momentem and proximity, he basically will have no way to counter your own thrusts. conventional bayonet tactics doesn't work with a bullpup rifle, simply because there's not enough reach, but some pundits have claimed that a bullpup rifles are actually more effective bayonet fighting weapons than conventional rifles, because of what i've described above ...<br><br>over to you guys ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

If everybody cooperates, this thread wouldn't need to be closed.</div></blockquote>I posted 2 articles about recent bayonet use without reference to anyone or anything. This is the bayonet topic, am I right?<br><br>But from his vast dictionary of insults the sharp-tongued Gedanken quickly called it "wanton" and a "testosterone tornado".<br><br>I don't start fights but everytime this boy attacks me without provocation I'm responding in kind, and I'm not seeking your permission, sorry.<br><br>If you don't like to see fights then you tell this CBM to stand down. He can disagree like a man without making personal attacks like a spiteful housewife.<br><br>What must have angered Ged was that someone should post evidence of recent bayonet use when he was building a case for how obsolete the bayonet has become.<br><br>Whether or not the 35 Iraqi dead were stabbed or shot is irrelevant. The important thing was that the Argylls ran out of ammo - the insurgents didn't.<br><br>And you can't really hide the fact that you have no ammo for very long.<br><br>So the Argylls gambled with a bayonet charge that somehow worked and drove/scared the insurgents away. With bayonet attached to rifles, the insurgents would not immediately know the rifles are empty. But had the Argylls ran at the enemy with knives, machetes - and someone mentioned "entrenching tool" - the results would've been very different.<br><br>Furthermore, the modern-style bayonet used by the Brits SA-80 is no longer the crude piece of steel that our M-16 bayonet was. They look and function like fighting knives with a wire-cutting capability when combined with the scabbard.<br><br>So anyone who says there is a need for a "edged-weapon" but not a bayonet, well... the bayonet is now also a knife.<br><br><img src="http://www.egframes.co.uk/bayonet75.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry mods, but the post above is so far off the mark I'm compelled to set things straight.<br><br>Time to wake your ideas up, tvdog.  The "testosterone tornado" comment clearly referred to the journalists and publications that jumped on the bandwagon after The Sun published its article.<br><br>If you read it as a reference to yourself, you're either seriously egocentric or astoundingly paranoid.<br><br>I didn't attack you - you imagined you were being attacked and started a fight that you now claim you didn't.<br><br>I wasn't angered at all, although I'll admit I was a bit annoyed by The Sun's usual brand of gonzo journalism.  I expect that some of the more widely-read amongst us will be well aware of The Sun's poor reputation, and would appreciate that the comments I made about it are not at all surprising.<br><br>On to other points:<br><br>Again, there's nothing to state that the insurgents had ammo while the Argylls ran out - please read carefully.  All subsequent conclusions, being based upon this unsubstantiated assumption, are therefore invalid.<br><br>As for the remainder of the post, I'm glad you agree.</div>

I think LRRP coys and recce folks would no doubt want as short and handy a weapon as possible, and a bayonet for tankees and AI troopers would probably be next to useless, but the infantryman i think, would still find the bayonet (on the rifle) useful for certain situations.<br><br>over to you guys again ...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
