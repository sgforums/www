            <div class='col-md body'>I think the bayonet has its place in the mordern army. However, the SAF bayonet that i was issued was pretty much useless. I think it needs to be designed so that it can be used not only as a thrusting weapon, but also as a cutting weapon. Anyway, If i were to have to charge the enemy, i would rather have a bayonet at the end of my weapon than not.<br><br>Re the inscresing emphasis on UC and the removal of bayonet trg, i think the army made a mistake. Instead of learning how to kick, i think a soldier should first know how to properly use his weapon as an effective melee weapon. It wont take long, and would be infinitely more useful.<br><br>In Summary, Bring back the bayonet! But make sure there is Proper and comprehensive trg on bayonet use (You can lose the pugil? stick fighting thank you very much)!<br><br>Edited for spelling<br><br></div>

I think LRRP coys and recce folks would no doubt want as short and handy a weapon as possible, and a bayonet for tankees and AI troopers would probably be next to useless, but the infantryman i think, would still find the bayonet (on the rifle) useful for certain situations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Again, it's a question of what purpose it serves.

These two threads from a firearms forum called The High Road seem to sum up the situation with the recent handgun confiscation program pretty well:<br><br><a href="http://www.thehighroad.org/showthread.php?t=35341&amp;highlight=australia+confiscation" rel="nofollow">Thread 1</a><br><br><a href="http://www.thehighroad.org/showthread.php?t=22298&amp;highlight=australia+confiscation" rel="nofollow">Thread 2</a><br><br>Although I do not own any Glocks, I have shot them often enough to know they are accurate and reliable handguns, if somewhat undersprung in their factory configurations. Their prevalence in IPSC competition is a testament to their popularity and capabilities; I don't think you would regret getting one. My only reason for not getting a Glock is the fact that they have unsupported firing chambers, which tend to stress reloaded brass to the point of possible failure (brand-new commercial ammo is not a problem, though).<br><br>The CZ 75 series of handguns is not based on the 1911. The former is double-stack SA/DA design while the latter is a single-stack SA design. Both are fine choices for IPSC competition, however.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>MG</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AFAIK, you're still allowed to own handguns here, as long as they're stored in a gun club and not at home.
