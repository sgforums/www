            <div class='col-md body'>read about british bayonet fighting tactics, they are masters of the bayonet, the way they use the SA80 in bayonet fighting is to parry the enemy's initial thrust and get into his arc of movement, once inside, your charging momentem and the short length of the rifle will mean that he'll sure kenna skewered ...<br><br>anyway, like i said, the bayonet would be a more of a psychological weapon (for the SAF at least) now ... an edged weapon will have quite a psychological effect on the enemy as well as us ..... picture this: a squad of pimply-faced, scrawny tekong boys in number 4 charging at you going "ahhhhhhhh " ....... now imagine the same but with bayonets attached to their SAR 21s ....<br><br></div>

FIBUA, where your enemy might be in the next room, rolling grenades at you across the floor ..... i'd prefer to have a "last ditch" weapon with me should the ammo runs out ... and a bayonet fixed to end of a rifle, even a bullpup one, would be more lethal i think, than swinging the same M7 from your hands, especially in the hands of non-professional soldiers like our (non-professional as in a citizen army like ours), even in jungle warfare, because of the density of the shrubbery of our tropical jungles and all, the engagement range would be significantly shorter than say, the middle eastern desert, or the northern european forests (places where i suppose we get most of our doctrine from), like it or not, chances are you'll be close to the enemy, and so i think the bayonet is all the more important to have ...</div>

FIBUA with bayonets would be impractical with an M16 .... but we got a bullpup rifle now .... as for jungle fighting, the only reason commanders don't want you to fix bayonet is during exercise some cockster will skewer someone or himself or something like that .....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nuh-uh.  In both CQB and jungle fighting, a shorter weapon is always preferable because you don't want it getting caught on anything.  Hell, as it is, if it wasn't for the muzzle flash, I would have happily switched my carbine's flash suppressor for the standard M16 bit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if the enemy come around the tree with a full loaded and cocked rifle, it doesn't matter if you have a bayonet attached.  Cuz he's going to be able to point and shoot a lot fast then you can charge and direct your bayonet into his vitals so that he can't pull the trigger.<br><br>Might be a better idea to dive as far away as you can and pray your buddy will cover you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, to have to go into bayonet fighting; u'd either be charging down a trench, and detached from ur section.  Which shouldn't happen.<br><br>Either that, u're the last man standing.  Rifle over head sounds like a better option unless u are someone likely to be interrogated severely.</div>
