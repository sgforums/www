            <div class='col-md body'>to equip with pistols would be expensive ... even if it's only to all infantry based formations alone (infantry, guards, commandos ... ) a bayonet would be a cheap and universal solution ...<br><br>what i think a bayonet would be good for:<br><br>psychological weapon - an edged weapon tickles your brain stem like no other ... it's a primeval thing, might notch up the confidence a bit .... further more, a bayonet would not be solely for just close-in, hand to hand combat alone ... think crowd control ... military operations other than war, again, a lesson from the war in Iraq: ... suppose we take over a town or city somewhere, how do we deal with order and control issues ? ... protesters, agitators ? ... a fixed bayonet would send a very clear signal not to mess around ... much more effective and less confrontational to the civilians to the other side (as opposed to having to shoot a few rounds in the air ...) ... the psychological effect works both ways too ....<br><br>close combat weapon - like i said earlier, the terrain of our potential battlefield makes very close in contact often unavoidable, and a bayonet would make a good "immediate action" weapon, (think night fighting ... ever got contacted at night ? ... how close was it ? ... ) and again, considering the fact that our average infantryman would be a citizen soldier, bayonet fighting would be a much more easier skill to learn and to execute ... (as opposed to unarmed combat ... )<br><br>I dunno ... i just can't shake off the nagging unease that the SAF has done away with bayonet fighting all together ....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think incidents like Bloody Sunday have pretty much demonstrated that lethal firearms and crowd control don't mix.  If you're looking to intimidate the crowds, tear-gas guns, water cannons and other nonlethal weapons with muzzles you can stick your arm into will do the job admirably, thank you very much.  The bayonet's redundant under those circumstances.<br><br>If you're contacted at night, you've got ammo in your weapon - use it.<br><br>The design and intent of the bayonet dates back to the days of manually-loaded weapons and charging trenches.  With current fighting techniques, it's redundant.  If you do need to silence the enemy, you can use a knife that's not necessarily a bayonet.</div>

It has remained at 8 inches long but with a thin, fullered, bowie-type knife blade. Even the Submachine Gun L2A3 (Sterling) was issued with a bayonet in case the gun jammed or ran out of ammunition. The bayonet now passes as a combat knife, a sort of saw or a battlefield tool capable of cutting thin wire. It is still fitted to the business end of a rifle, knife-like, the quintessential close-quarter combat weapon.<br><br>The last documented use of the bayonet in combat by the British Army would probably be during the Falklands campaign by 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment on the night of June 11-12 and 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards on the night of June 13-14 1982, when night allowed them to close with the enemy without being seen, and engaged, at a distance.<br><br>The 3rd Battalion took Mt Longdon and its surroundings after hand-to-hand and bayonet fighting with the 7th Infantry Regiment. The British casualties were 23 killed, one of which, Sergeant Ian John McKay of the 3rd Battalion, was later awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross1. The Argentinians suffered over 50 dead, with many more injured.<br><br>The 2nd Scots Guards pushed the 5th Marine Infantry Battalion off the summit and flanks of Mt Tumbledown with rifle and bayonet shortly before the surrender of Argentine forces. It cost seven Guardsmen and one Royal Engineer killed, while 40 Argentinean Marines lost their lives opposing them.<br><br>After the Falklands, the infantry began to train in the use of the bayonet again; it had returned from near oblivion.<br><br>Anachronism?<br><br>Modern weapons have an awesome weight of firepower available, so why bother with cold steel? The bayonet, used by a determined soldier, is capable of physical harm, but it is primarily a psychological weapon. Its value is not in its form or the harm it can do.<br><br>When the soldier fixes his bayonet and points it at the enemy, he is declaring his determination to close and kill savagely at close quarter. For most soldiers trained to kill with bullets and shells at distance, it is time to think seriously about an easy way out.</div>
