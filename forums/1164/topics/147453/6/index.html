            <div class='col-md body'>The only reason why you secure the Black String through the Bayonnet is because someone is afriad that you'll drop it during training.<br><br>When you turn Ops, you secure the Bayonnet differently using Black Rubber Bands and it can be drawn relatively easily. Anyways, that's what my unit practices.<br><br>Infantry will seldom attack without some prior indirect fire, Inf mostly used to Comb and Mop up.  Thus, in such Situation, how will the bayonnet be employed? use Bayonnet to check if Enemy is really dead right? (not sure, than stab stab abit, confirm dead or not.)<br><br>Anyways, Soldiers nowadays are trained not to just go for the Final "Chargggeee! and Overrun Enemy. They are taughtt to Engage Accurately from afar, Moving Fwd only to maintain the initiative and get a better Field of Fire. (yah, now no more like last time, Overrun Trench than Umpire say "Trench Clear". )<br><br>That said, A Knife is always useful, but not necessarily have to be Bayonnet.

There are times where u cant just shoot and go.<br><br>http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=55098&amp;highlight=rok+taekwondo<br><br>ROK in vietnam war mentioned the usefulness of unarmed combat:<br><br>First, the enemy suddenly overwhelmed our trenches and continuously piled up to the degree that we were unable to use rifles and bayonets as weapons. There were many instances in which we were pushing and pulling each other inside the trenches. At that time, Tae Kwon Do became the Korean MarinesÂ’ weapon and by hitting the enemy in his vital parts, we brought him under our control.<br><br>Second, it can be seen that the courage to be unafraid when facing your enemy was trained through Tae Kwon Do. Although we didnÂ’t have a path of retreat and had to stay in our position, the fortitude to fight bravely while exposed to the enemy led to victory at the Battle of Tra Binh Dong.<br><br>Retired MajGen Shin Won Bae, who later commanded the Blue Dragon unit (now the 2d ROK Marine Division) provided similar insights, noting:<br><br>Even though tactics call for fixing bayonets to rifles during close quarters to neutralize the enemy, our weapon at the time, the MÂ–1 rifle, was not a weapon that could be wielded quickly. In urgent situations, the Marine in the front would fiercely strike the enemyÂ’s face and vital parts using Tae Kwon Do, causing him to momentarily lose his will to fight. Then a second Marine would finish off the enemy with the rifle. Additionally, striking the enemy with an entrenching tool was highly effective in destroying the will to fight among the enemyÂ’s lead elements. While Tae Kwon Do demonstrated its practical effectiveness on the battlefield, more importantly, martial arts training instilled the confidence to defeat the enemy in each Marine. I think this is the greater significance of Tae Kwon Do training.<br><br></div>

So to those who say they want a knife instead of a bayonet. Well, the answer has been there all along for the past 20 years. Just that for some reason SAF has decided not to implement this improved bayonet. This improved M-16 bayonet can cut wire, but I don't know if they mean barbed wire or comms/electric wire...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/M9bayonet2.jpg"><br>'<br>'<br>'<br>'<br>I don't know if this works, but someone has designed this jagged-edged muzzle for the M-16 that can be used like a bayonet to stab someone.<br><img src="http://bayonet.info/pic/getdata.php?id=3352"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally i felt that it is an extremely unwise move to have a weapon, in this case the SAR-21 not to be able to fix bayonets. The advantages of having a bayonet have been discussed many times before in this thread. So there is little reason why we should be abandoning it. In fact, bayonet fighting lessons are a favourite part of my BMT. We really felt like warriors then, kind of a morale boosting effect.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
