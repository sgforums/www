            <div class='col-md body'>Well,i cannot agree that when the order comes to fix bayonets,the men receiving the order are extremely psyched up and ready to go, and are like a living,walking bunch of taut steel wires which will snap and attack with all out furry when the call is issued.<br><br>Having an enemy charging you with an edged weapon is totally different from being shot at behind cover and having enemy pop up,shoot and scoot sorta thing.It realli shows the resolve of the foes man. Even US troopers armed with carbines get to retain their bayonets and even fix them on their weapons. Hmmz,but I have yet to see an M203 fixed with a bayonet.Any pics of one with a bayonet fixed?Thanks in advance<br></div>

Anyways, that's what my unit practices.<br><br>Infantry will seldom attack without some prior indirect fire, Inf mostly used to Comb and Mop up.  Thus, in such Situation, how will the bayonnet be employed? use Bayonnet to check if Enemy is really dead right? (not sure, than stab stab abit, confirm dead or not.)<br><br>Anyways, Soldiers nowadays are trained not to just go for the Final "Chargggeee! and Overrun Enemy. They are taughtt to Engage Accurately from afar, Moving Fwd only to maintain the initiative and get a better Field of Fire. (yah, now no more like last time, Overrun Trench than Umpire say "Trench Clear". )<br><br>That said, A Knife is always useful, but not necessarily have to be Bayonnet. Why? only Bayonnet can use to clear mine ah? My Mother's Skewing Knife also can you know.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Get something like a Kabaar also good, Better to open durains, if have to prod for mines also can use. hahahaha</div></blockquote>Really?  And how easy was it for you to remove that small black rubber band and then draw the bayonet?  I think unless if we were about to engage in open warfare anything that makes a weopon harder to draw (bayonet included) is going to be discarded in double quick time.<br><br>Btw, infantry is not just use for "comb and mop up".  Dunno what unit you were in, or how the heck they train you.  I'm starting to guess you weren't in any infantry or gaurds unit.<br><br>But yes, I think if given a choice, most everyone would rather get a better combat knife than the rather blunt bayonet we are issued with now.</div>
