              <li>Then consider the consumption rate of their numerous but near worthless ex-Soviet era fighting vehicles.  More vehicles, means more gas used up.  Unfortunately, their vehicles are nowhere as modern as the South Korean ones.  End of the day, they'll still burn more gas but achieve less.</li>
              </blockquote>well, so the NVA has a bigger stockpile of weapons,oil support in comparison than americans? as i mention, i did not say DPRK will win, i just want to illustrate that your assumption of war is simply win by weapons and oil is not sound. the war will simply end up fighting along the parallel lines that all. no one can even think what kind of sacrifice they will face if they ever invade north koreas.

              <p>it's not about balls or whatever...</p>
              <p>it's easy to let their testosterone get the better of them like it got the better of you, a few thousand miles away, sitting behind a PC, posturing with your dick in your hand...</p>
              <p>if the communists did this, the south koreans would probably have them by the balls...</p>
              <p>look at the whole situation.. Kim Jong-il is in PRC with his begging bowl... he's losing control of his country as his military has started believing their own lies and probably went to sink a south korean ship...</p>
              <p>pushing the button is easy... the ramifications are not...</p>
              <p>the commies feel they have nothing to lose, and don't give a shit about their own people (as they have shown time and again), they will fire their ballistic missiles into south korea..</p>
              <p>the south.. apart from bravado, have this thing called "a conscience" and will probably not want to decimate what is ultimately their own people...</p>
              <p>now.. how do you extricate yourself if you was the south korean leader?</p>
              <p>i'd call out the communists in the UN, present irrefutable evidence, and let them stew on it, demanding the mastermind and the one who gave the order to be brought to justice..</p>
              <p>THIS will embarass the hell out of the commies and they will not be able to do a single thing about it.. it may even bring about their downfall..</p>

              <p><br>I read an article in 90c that stated NK won't have access to watch the WC (censored in case NK loses). They'd probably show only delayed telecast where NK wins + heavy advertising about the Great/Dear Leader.</p>

              <p>do the north koreans has anyting to lose by forcing them into the table? do you still believe the communist like vietnam and china are facing threats? are you a regular travellers to china or vietnam? i am. they will be there long after you and me pass away. have you visiting liaoning province? have you ever talk to the local what they knew? in dandong , china are still sending tons of foods to NK.</p>
              <p>today press already reveal evidence in north koreans attacks. i knew corvettes well, they are vulnerble to torp attack fro submarine. it could only be torp.</p>
              <p>sure the south koreans has retaliate by stopping aids to the north korea, do the NK care? what can UN do? arent they already sanction whatever they can. what other ammunition/back up do the UN has?</p>
              <p>NK and china are long to be ally. china could be inviting kim to stop escalating the violence, well that is good sign afterall.</p>
              <p>if i am SK president, i will bite the bitter bills. lost of 40+ sailors is better than tens of thousands and crippling the economy. keep the balls for future use!.</p>

              <p>SEOUL—South Korea on Thursday will formally blame North Korea for sinking a South Korean warship and killing 46 of its sailors, and the South's foreign minister said Wednesday it had marshaled enough evidence to seek international penalties.</p>
              <p>North Korea has been suspected from the moment an explosion tore apart the Cheonan patrol ship, sinking it near the inter-Korean border in the Yellow Sea on March 26.</p>
              <p>But South Korean officials waited until recovering the ship's bow and stern to explicitly state that a torpedo caused it to explode. And now, after three weeks of examination by investigators from the U.S., Britain, Australia, Sweden and South Korea, the Seoul government is ready to officially point the finger at Pyongyang.</p>

              <p>South Korean defense officials have described some of the findings in recent weeks, including how satellite photography of a North Korean port showed a submarine was missing for several hours before and after the Cheonan sank. Investigators also found explosive residue and metal fragments of a torpedo that matched one of North Korean origin, officials have said.</p>
              <p>Several South Korean newspapers on Wednesday reported that investigators found a torpedo propeller with lettering that appears to be from North Korea. A spokesman for the defense ministry declined to confirm those reports, however.</p>
              <p>Also on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan told reporters it was "obvious" that North Korea sank the patrol boat. "We will take appropriate measures in a firm and cautious manner," Mr. Yu said.</p>
              <p>He added that the South's investigation yielded enough details to seek a penalty at the United Nations Security Council but that it was premature to discuss such action.</p>
              <p>The North has blamed South Korea for the incident but hasn't explicitly denied involvement.</p>
              <p>Senior government officials, including Mr. Yu and Defense Minister Kim Tae-young, on Tuesday listened to investigators describe what they found. President Lee Myung-bak, who received a separate briefing, plans to speak on the matter in a national address next week, a spokesman said.</p>
              <p>South Korean officials are expected take several more weeks to seek penalties, starting with some form of censure or sanctions imposed by the U.N. North Korea reacted harshly to U.N. sanctions imposed after it tested a nuclear weapon last May. Some analysts say North Korea may undertake another nuclear test in the face of further international condemnation.</p>

              <p>South Korean officials have also been discussing unilateral penalties, including cutting the few remaining economic connections with North Korea, restarting official government-sponsored radio broadcasting aimed at the North and changing some of the procedures its military uses when confronting the other country.</p>
              <p>But neither South Korea nor the U.S. have much ability to punish North Korea militarily because of the North's long-held ability to attack the South with hundreds of rockets and missiles. South Korea's capital, Seoul, is just 30 miles from the inter-Korean border.</p>
              <p>Senior U.S. officials said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is scheduled to leave Thursday for a visit to the region, will raise the issue while in Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul.</p>
              <p>Washington wants to demonstrate a strong response to Pyongyang without risking a military escalation between the two Koreas, the U.S. officials said. They said one casualty of the Cheonan issue will likely be the six-party negotiating process over North Korea's nuclear program, which includes the U.S., China, South Korea, North Korea, Japan and Russia. Pyongyang has refused to take part in the talks for over a year, instead seeking international recognition as a nuclear-weapons state.</p>
              <p>Mrs. Clinton will also face the delicate task of discussing the Cheonan matter with officials in China—North Korea's largest trade partner, economic benefactor and supporter. Seoul was irked when Beijing waited nearly a month to offer condolences for the South Korean sailors killed. Chinese President Hu Jintao two weeks ago hosted North Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Beijing.</p>
              <p>North Korea's state media in recent weeks issued critical statements in response to South Korean news reports about the Cheonan investigation.</p>
              <p>Pyongyang said Tuesday that its parliament would convene early next month for the second time this year, an unusual step for a group that usually meets once a year to rubber-stamp actions taken by Mr. Kim. North Korea didn't say why the group would meet, though analysts in Seoul speculated on a connection to findings in the Cheonan matter.</p>
              <p>Tensions between the Koreas have remained high since the Cheonan's sinking. On Sunday, a North Korean fishing boat and naval patrol boat crossed south of the inter-Korean maritime border. The fishing boat turned back after South Korea's military issued a radio warning. The military vessel returned only after a South Korean patrol boat fired two warning shots.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>SEOUL (AFP) - – Seoul's foreign minister said Wednesday it was "obvious" North Korea was to blame for the sinking of a South Korean warship, and there was enough evidence to take the case to the UN Security Council.</p>
              <p>The comments by Yu Myung-Hwan came a day before a multinational investigation team announces its report on the March 26 tragedy, which cost 46 lives.</p>
              <p>Top South Korean officials had previously hinted strongly that the North was involved in the sinking of the 1,200-tonne corvette near the disputed border on March 26.</p>
              <p>But Yu was the first publicly to implicate the communist state, which denies involvement.</p>
              <p>Asked by reporters whether the North had sunk the Cheonan, Yu replied: "I think it's obvious." Seoul has "enough evidence" to bring the issue to the UN, he added.</p>
              <p>News reports said investigators had found a torpedo fragment with a serial number written in North Korean style.</p>
              <p>The discovery, if confirmed, would be the latest and strongest piece of evidence that a North Korean torpedo broke the ship in two. Related article: South Korea ponders how to punish North</p>
              <p>Yonhap news agency, citing unnamed military officials, said Seoul had collected a sizeable piece, presumed to be part of the axle of a torpedo, with a serial number written in a North Korean font.</p>
              <p>It said this was in addition to a piece of the propeller salvaged earlier.</p>
              <p>Chosun Ilbo newspaper carried a similar report.</p>
              <p>"Analysing the serial number, experts from the US, Australia and other countries agree that the torpedo that sank the Cheonan must have been made by North Korea," an unnamed source told the paper.</p>
              <p>"It is the smoking gun, following the discovery of a piece of torpedo and traces of explosive."</p>
              <p>The defence ministry declined comment.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday Yonhap said explosive traces found on the Cheonan and on the seabed have a similar chemical make-up to substances found in a stray North Korean torpedo secured by the South seven years ago.</p>
              <p>Yu said in a speech on Wednesday that investigators, including experts from Britain, Sweden, the United States and Australia, have confirmed the corvette was hit by a torpedo.</p>
              <p>Seoul would take "firm and prudent" measures to deter "any future provocations which will undermine peace and stability in Northeast Asia," he told the European Union Chamber of Commerce, appealing for international support.</p>
              <p>In search of that backing, the foreign ministry Wednesday briefed diplomats from some 30 countries about the findings of the investigation. Envoys from China, Japan and Russia had been briefed a day earlier.</p>
              <p>South Korea is likely to ask the UN Security Council to slap new sanctions on the North, in addition to those imposed to curb its missile and nuclear programmes.</p>
              <p>But China, a veto-wielding council member and the North's ally, is unlikely to support new measures unless the South produces solid proof linking its neighbour to the attack.</p>
              <p>The United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in the South, has given its ally strong backing.</p>
              <p>US President Barack Obama and South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bak, in a telephone conversation Monday, called on the North to end "belligerent behaviour towards its neighbours".</p>
              <p>They stopped short of blaming it for the sinking but said they are committed "to follow the facts of the investigation wherever they lead."</p>
              <p>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will visit Seoul next week in a further demonstration of support.</p>

              <p>Retaliation expected.</p>
              <p>South Korea's president <strong>Lee Myung-Bak Thursday vowed "resolute countermeasures" against North Korea</strong> after investigators concluded that it sank one of Seoul's warships with the loss of 46 lives.</p>
              <p>President Lee Myung-Bak promised "resolute countermeasures" to the attack, which sparked national mourning in the South, but gave no immediate details.</p>
              <p>The White House called the report "objective and scientific".</p>
              <p>"The United States strongly condemns the act of aggression that led to their (sailors') deaths," said spokesman Robert Gibbs.</p>
              <p>Investigators said Thursday that a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine was to blame for the sinking of the 1,200-tonne corvette near the disputed maritime border with the loss of 46 lives.</p>
              <p>"The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine," the multinational team said in its report on the March 26 sinking.</p>
              <p>"There is no other plausible explanation."</p>
              <p>The investigators' report said torpedo parts salvaged from the Yellow Sea "perfectly match" a type of torpedo that North Korea has offered for export.</p>
              <p>It said a marking in Korea's Hangeul script was found on one recovered section, and matched markings on a stray North Korean torpedo recovered by the South seven years ago.</p>
              <p>The communist North's top decision-making body repeated denials of involvement and threatened "all-out war" in response to any punitive measures such as sanctions.</p>
              <p>The North dismissed claims of its involvement in the sinking -- the worst apparent cross-border provocation since the downing of a South Korean airliner in 1987 with the loss of 115 lives -- as a "fabrication".</p>
              <p>But the investigators, including experts from the United States, Australia, Britain and Sweden, laid out apparently damning evidence.</p>
              <p>It said torpedo parts recovered by a dredging ship on May 15 -- including the propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section -- "perfectly match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes".</p>
              <p>The report said the attack was likely carried out by a small submarine.</p>
              <p>"We confirmed that a few small submarines and a mother ship supporting them left a North Korean naval base in the West (Yellow) Sea 2-3 days prior to the attack and returned to port 2-3 days after the attack."</p>
              <p>The sinking caused outrage in South Korea, which declared five days of national mourning. But Seoul is believed to have ruled out a military counter-strike for fear of igniting all-out war.</p>
              <p>It is likely to ask the United Nations Security Council to slap new sanctions on the North, in addition to those imposed to curb its missile and nuclear programmes.</p>
              <p>China, a veto-wielding council member and the North's ally, is unlikely to support this unless it accepts the South's evidence.</p>
              <p>The South could also restrict trade with its neighbour and ban the North's merchant ships from using the Jeju Strait off the peninsula's south coast.</p>
              <p>"Resolute countermeasures will be taken against North Korea," Lee told Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in a phone conversation, according to a statement from Lee's office.</p>
              <p>South Korea, through strong international cooperation, "should make North Korea admit its wrongdoing and return as a responsible member of the international community", Lee added.</p>
              <p>Lee said the North in the past had committed "military provocations or terrorist acts against South Korea and denied involvement".</p>
              <p>The practice would not work this time "because there exists evidence that no one or no country in the world can deny."</p>
              <p>Lee will hold a meeting of his National Security Council Friday morning.</p>
              <p>The North's National Defence Commission, in a statement on the official news agency, said it would send its own investigators to the South to check the purported evidence.</p>
              <p>"Our army and people will promptly react to any 'punishment' and 'retaliation' and to any 'sanctions' infringing upon our state interests with various forms of tough measures including an all-out war, it said.</p>
              <p>North and South Korea have remained technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended only in an armistice.</p>
              <p>The North refuses to accept the borderline drawn in the Yellow Sea, where the Cheonan went down. The area was the scene of deadly clashes in 1999 and 2002 and of a firefight last November that left a North Korean boat in flames.</p>
              <p>Some analysts suggest the attack on the Cheonan was revenge for last year’s November clash. – AFP</p>

              <p>i still think SK has no balls to retaliate. i hope they provide me wrong. because, they had nothing to gain from all out war.</p>
              <p>if a war breakout, i think americans and chinese will sit this out. because it would never want to drag each other into a third party conflict. so SK take care!</p>

              <p>the whole world never give a damn about DPRK. the reason the UN, Japan, SK , USA give a damn is because they had nuclear capabilities. that the bargaining chips for NK. would they ever be stupid to give it up? what advantages they can get if they give it up? in my humble opinion, never!! </p>

              <p>no point going to war for 46 goons anyway mah !</p>
