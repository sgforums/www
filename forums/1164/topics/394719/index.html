              <p>No bueno.....the reason is still unknown or at least not reported or not escalating. Maybe there is a new sub that they can't detect. </p>
              <p>Does anyone has a picture of the vessel that was sunk?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SEOUL (AFP) - – A South Korean navy ship with 104 people onboard was sunk near the North Korean border Friday after an unexplained explosion in its stern, military officials said.</p>
              <p>South Korea's government called an emergency meeting but a presidential spokeswoman said it was still unclear whether the sinking resulted from a clash with North Korea.</p>
              <p>A South Korean naval vessel opened fire on an unidentified object but it was later found to be a flock of birds, the joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.</p>
              <p>The 1,200-ton vessel sank between 9:00 p.m. (1200 GMT) and 10:00 p.m. near Baengnyeong island in the Yellow Sea. A rescue operation was underway.</p>
              <p>A JCS spokesman said 58 crew members had so far been rescued</p>

              <p>Not usual. Waters there are choppy, and they have a long coastline, necessitating a high endurance corvette.</p>
              <p>If you want oversized, you should look to the Israelis. Their Saar line of frigates are quite notorious for having too much top weight and subsequently cut back from the initial specs. Then again, their navy is at the bottom rung of the funding ladder...</p>

              <p>Am listening to KBS World on this one. After all Korea is my "mother country" and I am paying special attention to this one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>KBS World is purely speculating on various scenarios. Some have been discussed here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. Shot down by NKorean submarine<br>2. Propulsion system blew up, exploding the tank of ammunition and fuel next to it<br>3. Hit by a floating mine</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to Korean reports, KBS World is hinting that it is scenario 2 that brought down the vessel. Due to the amazingly quick time in which the ship broke into two, heaved to its starboard side and sank. Only the tip of the vessel is above water now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will continue to pay close attention to its developments.</p>

              <p>it was a bunch of  ord ns guys smoking in ammo dump room with heaps of cigarette butts from months at sea with poor maintenance.</p>
              <p>if there was a mine then they would have detected it sonar long ago.....if it was missile....thcen it would also had been detected by radar and person on watch.</p>
              <p>guess u wont know it until u see underwater robots doing. the recon job on corvette.</p>
