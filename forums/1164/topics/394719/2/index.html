              capabilities....knowing that the trapped crews still have 60 hours

              navy have momentary lost track of 
              the wreck...when the coastal region was not deep blue. And why
              did they drag so long to get US navy asset for help if they
              can't do it on their own?</p>

              <p><br>To start with, you probably don't even know what Courageous was doing.</p>
              <p>That's fine.</p>
              <p>But you probably also don't know anything about Rules of the Road.</p>
              <p>If you don't know anything, at least give your respect to those who lost their lives, not heap senseless rubbish for all to see.</p>
              <p>Anyway since you seem to sorely underestimate the margins for errors out at sea, why don't you sign on to RSN or join a merchant ship-crew?</p>

              <p>It seemed that there were different news came out late yesterday  either a torpedo or sea mine....it seemed that this morning news is a sea mine......and rule out torpedo so basically they stop reporting that it was an onboard accident but an external explosion. SK govt are still taking the extra effort to say it was not NK.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong>However, Kim Tae-Young, the defence minister, told a South Korean parliamentary committee that initial reports of a North Korean torpedo attack appeared unfounded, citing accounts from rescued sailors who had been operating the ship's radar at the time of the explosion. </strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>"It is possible that a North Korean sea mine could have drifted into our area," he said, pointing out that North Korea had deployed some 3,000 Soviet mines in the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan during the war. </strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>"Though many mines were removed, it must have been impossible to retrieve them all," he added</strong></em></p>
              <p>But what if it was a torpedo and the sonar could not detect...than SK Navy is in trouble.....</p>
              <p>One news that was reported in the chinese newspaper was that it was a fishing thrawler that reported of the missing wreck.....(ha ha properly a fish finder)</p>

              <p>it seemed that informations are slowly triggering in about possible NK sub that left its base while it has yet to recovered the crew bodies. Contrary to the earlier statement about doubts over NK involvement. sounds like military hands are tied and politicians are trying to manage the crisi...wonder if the current SK President would suffer a no confident vote.</p>
              <p>I guess this is a good case study for govt on what not to do and what to do.....i think it is a PR disaster on the SK Gvt and military. Comparatively to the Isareli who started a full scale war to save its kidnaped soldiers. Both are civilian soldiers state.</p>

              <p>If the South Korean naval ships take a usual determined navigational course that are conducted daily, it is as good as allowing hostile forces to lay a trap - in the same way that the IEDs have been so successfully used in ambushes on land forces sent to Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It will not be a surprise if the truth will finally be revealed that this criminal act was another terrorist act authorised by North Korea to show it means what it says about striking South Korea.</p>
              <p>The dice has been rolled - now it is up to South Korea.</p>

              <p>i thought i read somewhere that mention it was the chinese who told SK that it wasn't NK. Now could this be the message coming up from china that it doesn;t want further military escalation of this situation?  </p>

Choi Sung-yong of the Family Assembly Abducted to North Korea said, "It seems that the Cheonan was sunk in a premeditated North Korean operation." <br><br>Choi published a transcript of a telephone conversation with what he says is a senior North Korean Army officer. <br><br>According to the transcript, the officer says, "Thirteen commandos who left from Cape Bipagot sank the Cheonan. Many people as well as military officers already know who attacked the ship." <br><br>The officer claims the motive was revenge. "After the North lost the sea skirmish in November last year, Kim Jong-il gave an order to take revenge. He gave the order when he visited the naval fleet command in Nampo." <br><br>The officer according to the transcript claims Gens. Kim Yong-chol and U Dong-chuk traveled between Pyongyang and Nampo frequently to visit the fleet command to work out an operational plan. "Navy Commander Jong Myong-do stayed in Nampo until the mission was accomplished," he added.<br><br>Kim Yong-chol, the director of the Reconnaissance Bureau in charge of espionage operations against the South, has been consistently fingered by South Korean intelligence agents as the man behind the attack. <br><br>U Dong-chuk, the senior deputy chief of the State Security Department and a member of the National Defense Commission, and Navy Commander Jong Myong-do were promoted to full generals on Kim Il-sung's 98th birthday last Thursday. They were two of the four lieutenant generals who were promoted the same day. <br><br>Their promotions stoked suspicions here since U was promoted to a full general only a year after he was promoted to lieutenant general. Jong was promoted unexpectedly after his position became uncertain following North Korea's ignoble defeat in the sea skirmish last year. <br><br>"Some of the 13 commandos who left Cape Bipagot before they sank the Cheonan are acquaintances of mine," the alleged officer claims according to the transcript. "It seems it was such an important mission that a semi-submersible which was made originally for a crew of three was remodeled for the mission." <br><br>He claims the Cheonan's sinking lifted soldiers' morale and the 13 commandos "are being treated as heroes." <br><br>"They apparently spent a lot of time practicing camouflage by sneaking around fleet of North Korean and Chinese fishing boats operating near Baeknyeong Island," the officer says. "It seems likely that a bigger event will occur in the future given that they are operating also in the East Sea, camouflaging themselves there." <br><br>Commenting on North Korean broadcasts' denial of the North's involvement, the transcript has him saying, "It's natural for them to deny involvement, isn't it? We're tired since we've always been on emergency alert." </span></p>

              <p>Wow....all the news are now surfacing up they knew it all along and try to hold it back............I don;t know if this President is going to survive politically....What were they thinking of covering up this type of report.....</p>
              <p>The ship did not detect the incoming Torpedoes...is that a concern ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>SEOUL (AFP) - – South Korea's military believes that a North Korean submarine launched a torpedo attack to sink a South Korean warship last month near their disputed sea border, the Yonhap news agency said on Thursday.</p>
              <p>The assessment was reported to the office of President Lee Myung-Bak and the defence ministry immediately after the ship sank last month, an unnamed senior military source told Yonhap.</p>
              <p>"It's our military intelligence's assessment that North Korean submarines attacked the ship with a heavy torpedo," the source said, adding that the subs were armed with torpedoes with 200-kilogram (440-pound) warheads.</p>
              <p>"Since February last year, North Korea has strengthened training that showed the possibility of it launching a guerilla warfare-style provocation, rather than a skirmish."</p>
              <p>The South's military intelligence command had also alerted the navy ahead of the March 26 sinking of the Cheonan that North Korea was preparing an attack, Yonhap said.</p>
              <p>The South's defence ministry refused to comment on the report.</p>
              <p>Seoul has so far refrained from directly accusing Pyongyang and said only that an "external explosion" was the most likely cause of the disaster which cost the lives of 46 sailors.</p>
              <p>Pyongyang has denied it was responsible.</p>
              <p>South Korean Defence Minister Kim Tae-Young has already raised the possibility that a mine or torpedo may have sunk the ship, following deadly naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 and a November firefight.</p>
              <p>The November incident left a North Korean patrol boat in flames and local media reports said one North Korean sailor was killed and three wounded.</p>
              <p>The North has vowed "merciless" military action to protect what it sees as its Yellow Sea border.</p>
              <p>South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper meanwhile quoted defectors as saying that North Korea had formed suicide attack squads known as "human torpedoes" in its navy.</p>
              <p>It said the North's navy operates a brigade of suicide attack squads, which have many mini-submarines capable of carrying torpedoes or floating mines.</p>
