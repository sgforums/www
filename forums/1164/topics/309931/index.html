              <p>The Seasprite project dates back to the early 1990s, when the navy wanted a helicopter for its planned "Offshore Patrol Combatant", a smaller warship it planned to build in partnership with Malaysia.</p>
              <p>When <span style="color: #ff0000;">the Malaysians pulled</span> out, Defence should have axed the project, but the Seasprites were then earmarked for the Anzac-class frigates, with a contract finally signed in 1997.</p>

A review of the programme was initiated in May 2006 and, in May 2007, the RAN decided to continue with the project rather than pursue alternatives. The helicopters are expected to achieve initial operating capability in 2011. The RAN SH-2G(A) are armed with Kongsberg Penguin mk2 mod 7 air-to-surface missiles, with a range of over 30km, and mk46 torpedoes.

              <blockquote>
              <p>In 1997, Australia signed an $A 667 million contract with Kaman to purchase 11 upgraded SH-2G (A) “Super Seasprites,” with modernized avionics. This compact helicopter design was thought to be well suited to operation from the RAN’s ANZAC Class frigates, <span style="color: #000000;">and even from</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> patrol boats with helicopter decks</span>. The first helicopter was unveiled in 2003, <span style="color: #ff0000;">but by 2005 up to 40 deficiencies had been identified including inability to operate in bad weather and low-light conditions,</span> and inability to meet Australian airworthiness certification standards. Placing modern avionics into a<span style="color: #ff0000;"> 1960s airframe</span> proved challenging indeed; the helicopters were restricted to <span style="color: #ff0000;">“passenger and supply transport in good weather</span>” in 2005, then grounded in May 2006.</p>
              <p>The project is now 6 years behind schedule, costs have risen over 50% to $A 1.1 billion (currently about $900 million) for 11 helicopters, and the program is being used as a case study in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Australian Defence College’s leadership and ethics course</span>. It’s estimated that at least $A 45 million more and 29 months of work would be required to make them serviceable, with full operational status unlikely until at least 2010. Other SH-2 operators include New Zealand (from its ANZAC frigates), Egypt, and Poland.</p>
              <p>In 2007, Australia’s Liberal Party government elected to continue the Super Seasprite program - but their successor Labor government has now reversed that decision…</p>
