Hell, another guy and I had a company pinned down for two hours sitting on top of a knoll with a couple of M16s and a few boxes of ammo, and hell, they knew where we were after we took about ten of them down.  Mind you, this was on an exercise with MILES gear, but the umpires did a great job of counting the number of kills.  The ones who stayed standing in the first ten seconds were the ones who got hit first.  By the way, we were firing from a seated position, resting the handgrip on one knee, and I'm trained in demolitions, not sniping.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">Hell, any sane man would be scare in a situation where the possibility of death is as good as 100% but what makes a soldier different is his ability to control his fear &amp; use it as a fuel for survival.

However, I put nit to you that the objective of controlling your fear is to retain the capacity to properly assess the situation - what the SAF calls a thinking soldier - instead of following drills by rote.  That's how you survive - you use your head instead of firing blindly.</div>

Again, I think you're showing where you're coming from if that's an issue to you.  What with training equipment and methods these days (and we're not talking about Xbox here), do you really have to kill someone to prove your combat skills?  I think not.  Geez, if nobody had combat skills before going to war, wouldn't there be a fatality rate of 100% on both sides in an actual war?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by John Ching:</div><div class="quote_body">Assessing a hostile situation is not wrong but doing so while some kid with a gun is trying to make a name for himself with your death, is wrong.
