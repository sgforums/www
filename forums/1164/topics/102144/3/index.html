Not a good example for as toy gun. Everyone knows there is a armed guard in the bank. Our idiot robber, ran inside when the guard is upstairs, letting the guard time to thing as he came down, and of course idiot pay for it. In real life, if you look at all professional robberies oversea, they alway make sure, the moment they enter, the guard is alway in the clear, which they will be able to take him out first.<br><br>Yes there is a lot of factors that terrorist groups may take on soemthing when they are not fully equipped. that I totally agreed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean guys,you gotta look at it this way,before Sept 11,who on earth would have thought of slamming a fuel-laden aircraft into a building to send a message that Terrorism will always be around?Honestly,no one but those creative people in Afghan who are essentially seen as a 3-World people.Although it did not succeed in bringing the US Military or the entire nation as a whole to its knees,can anyone be certain that they won't get creative of ramming something else and cause massive damage?The fact here is that you CAN'T.Thats why,each and every citizen should be prepared and ready for whatever crap those tangos decide to throw at us.<br><br>So far in my given scenario,several of you have said that the only way is to surrender to the SOF/Star,but have you thought of this?What if one day,they are going against tangos who are ex-Special Forces/have military experience and are trained to think the way all CT units will think?Terrorists are everyone and noone.They can be someone you love and they can also be someone whom you feel would never do such things.<br><br>And to be honest with some who posted that the only way to defeat the situation is to do it the Russian Security Forces way,which is to go in,kill every single thing that moves in the train or use Valium sleeping gas,then what will you have at the end of the day?A massive massacre.Why?Simply because the tangos inside have gas-masks,and are preped up for any type of assault coming their way.And do you think a train ful of dead innocents are an acceptable result due to an offensive on the part of the security forces?The SG SOF and Star are shaped like our western CT counter-parts.A successful mission is in actual fact minimal damage to property and innocent lives but a maximum damage to the tangos.And that is the only acceptable outcome.<br><br>Not forgetting,the 21st century terrorist is a willing matyr.Are our SOF/Star troopers willing to give up all and take on these mean dirtbags?You may claim that the Singapore SOF has already proven itself in the SQ hijacking by going in and killing those tangos who manage to takeover the plane with knives.But have they faced a full-in-the-face fireflight yet?You know the definitive answer.<br><br>The only way to defeat tangos in this day and age is to fight them using their way.Small team tactics,divide and conquer.With the least effort,obtain maximum results.Only by fighting them using their own rules do we stand a chance in winning and getting back a safer society.<br><br>Lastly,the fact about NVGs is that as some have posted,they have a control which limits the maximum amplification of the NVGs.Okay,so lets say the authorities decide to cut power to the train and its surroundings,total darkness right?Now,these tangos having rigged up the halogen lamps wait till the entire force is within the specified killzone,presses ther button and illuminate the whole killzone.Do you know what effect we get here?Its like shooting at sillhoutte targets,pure and simple.Don't tell me that the troopers can take out the lights,but do you think they can do so when they are engaged in a balls-to-the wall fire-fight?In any gunfight,research has shown that all operators do the same thing,they react and fight back by sheer instinct and the drills that have been drummed into them.They simply do not think,what is going through their minds is so fast,its zapping along.When times like this,pure survival instinct takes over.<br><br>Enough said,I would like all who are reading this,to know that I am against terrorism all the way and that I am a strong believable of being ready for the unexpected.Then can we live to fight another day in this long conflict.</div>
