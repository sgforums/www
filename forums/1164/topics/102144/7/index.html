However, the Canadian government would not talk about it for political reasons. The kill range was from 2,430 metres, or nearly 2 1/2 kilometres, on the second shot.  The first shot blew a bag from the hand of their target, an Al Qaeda fighter walking on a road.

If you play Audie Murphy and end up becoming a Figure 11, you'd feel pretty stupid, wouldn't you?  Don't know how you were trained, but I learned right quick to hit the deck before doing returning fire, and that kind of common sense works just fine by me.  If you don't know where the shot came from and stick around to shoot in the wrong direction, the bugger would get 10 targets instead of 3.

If you play Audie Murphy and end up becoming a Figure 11, you'd feel pretty stupid, wouldn't you?  Don't know how you were trained, but I learned right quick to hit the deck before doing returning fire, and that kind of common sense works just fine by me.  If you don't know where the shot came from and stick around to shoot in the wrong direction, the bugger would get 10 targets instead of 3.  If you take a second to figure out what's going on, you can return accurate fire and advance towards the shooter - or would you call the boys from Hereford inexperienced?</div></blockquote>Well, actually, you've to have seen the picture to understand what I had been saying about the Marines that were caught in a "sniper"s trap.  But since you can't see it, I can't explain it clearer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>When a shot is fired at you, its more then likely you'll know where the shot is coming from unless your deaf.  Your 1st reaction is to fire in the general direction of the shooter while at the sametime moving for cover.  This is done in an attempt to disrupt the shooter/sniper from getting a clear shot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Of course, if you'ven't attended any counter ambush or anti-sniper course, also conducted in Hereford, you won't learn about it.  But Marines have.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>Its because you won't have a second to think about anything, you've got to react regardless of whether or not a civilian is in the way.  Its war &amp; the civilain should know better then to be in a line of fire.  In an ambush situation, the reaction of the ambushed soldier is not wronged.  Its war &amp; not shooting in kill house.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>By the way, SAS are the ones who 1st suggest shooting through a hostage to kill a terrorist, in their anti-hostage shooting.  Are they wrong?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

If you're able to fire off more firepower against an ambush party or sniper, you stand a chance of getting to a cover position.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,actually to return fire upon being shot at is a natural human instinct if one is armed.But however,be sure to control your fire.AS if return of constant fire may help the enemy snper pin-point your location by its muzzle flashes and sound.So best to return fire and instantly take cover before seeking the enemy and returning accurate deadly fire.</div>

Max range of 5.56 is 2600+m or 2800+ yards.  Till date, snipers in urban area haven't got the chance to shoot at target more then 300+m unless the sniper is facing a long stretch of road without other building blocking.</div>

If your only spot of cover is located half a football field away, are you going to run all the way there before firing off suppression fire?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>The ideal of suppression fire is to fire off blindly &amp; then look for cover or until a fellow soldier sound off the direction of where the fire should be aimed at.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>By the way, I'm sure even in a small man team of 7 to 14 men, not all of them are just carrying M4s.  So the responding fire power would be impressive enough to temporary scare off the opposing party.  If you still think this drill is rediculars, you've got to ask the IDF why they too practice such drill?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So you're telling me that the Israelis stand around like John Wayne returning fire?  I have experience with senior IDF staff that is the complete opposite of what you've just written, but unfortunately that stuff's covered by OSA.<br><br>You overestimate the effect of suppressing fire.  It only scares the sniper off if it's too close for comfort.  If your guys are missing him by 25 metres and he runs, he's not much of a sniper, is he?<br><br>Besides, while if the bugger's three floors up, you're going to present the same-sized target if you're standing or proning, you present a smaller target proning if he's on the same level as you.  Common sense, isn't it?<br><br>Between trying to find the sniper and making less of a target of myself, I'll pick being scarce as a target, thank you very much.</div>
