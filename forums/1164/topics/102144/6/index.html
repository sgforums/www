            <div class='col-md body'>Its not impossible to capture one of them,but the possibility of capturing one of them is difficult.Look at the movie The Negotiator,Samuel L. jackson's character also manage to capture like 2-3 SWAT Operators,this shows that the possibility of them being captured no matter how elite they are.But its just that the possibility is low.<br><br>And besides,if you are prepared to capture them alive,then I will recommend that you be prepared for a helluva fight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  We Dare!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SpecOps, i notice an increasing frequency of you referencing your discussions to MOVIES, i.e. Samuel L. Jackson capturing Spec Operators or Guns in Briefcases ala AD2000. Whilst i'm not fully aware of your training/background, its <strong>STILL silly</strong> to reference movies, even if they are based on actual events.<br><br>SF operators get captured (Bravo 2 - 0, and other unpublished incidents) and killed in action on a regular basis in any campaign like in Operation Just Cause, SAS storming of the Iranian Embassy, even Sayeret Mekhal suffered a loss of their commander in the Entebbe Hijack Incident. My point? the possiblity of SF being killed or captured are not as low as you think.<br><br></div>

In any case, its not a secret since you'll be able to see it when they deployed.  As for the placing of the blade, I should think its up to the individual operator to decide as to where he prefer to wear his blade since its for his comfort &amp; easy accessibility.  To have the blade worn at a standard area of the vest or body would only indicate that the operator does not really know how to appreciate the uses of a blade &amp; possibily not even knowing how to use the blade.  By the way, SAS &amp; American SpecOps would usually carry more then 1 blade.  American SWAT would carry 1 fixed blade &amp; 1 folding blade.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, if the SOF commander and the Home Affairs minister evaluate the situation, they may just decide to negotiate. Don't forget, this is also a valid option. Some people may say that the government has given in to the terrorists demands. But this depends on what has been given. It may be a poor compromise to the terrorist (e.g. we will let you go and let you be interviewed by a TV station,  if you release all the hostages, however we would not release any of your friends in prison). But the terrorist may accept. End result, we still save lives which is the important thing.<br>Afterall, the terrorist if he has not already blown himself and the hostages up, obviously has some other level of demand satisfaction that he will be prepared to compromise.</div>
