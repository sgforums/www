            <div class='col-md body'>if some group who want to go for the sof/star instead of just blowing up the train, then there is every chance of these folks having the resources, training and knowledge that maybe even above the sof/star. They infact have the advantage, as they have months to pre-plan and setup, they have hostage (bait) to ensure the SOF/Star comes. They also control the environment and the timining.<br><br>One thing they would be expert in explosive till they can double trap the claymores and blood traps that even the SOF/Star cannot just disarm. They may purposely let the SOF/Star to disarm a few simple ones to trick them, into mistake in some later traps. Also they would prevent any car or truck or train to ram in. All service entrance is covered.<br><br>Also layer of defensive positions an extra defenses bloody traps will be set, so that in case of a decisive rush, the group is able to cut down the momentum and stop it dead.<br><br>The MRT is the bait. In military, usually it is the reserve force that win the battle, the bait is just used to draw it out and trick it to focus its attention there. So the staging area is alway the nearest MRT, if enemy is resourceful enough, the kill zone is here, this is where the reserve force have the buffet tables waiting. If well plan, the initiate recon group of sof/star will be injuried and all hell break loose at the staging area. This is where the buffet bell get ringed, in the middle of the hell, a few pre-pared claymore, bomb, sniper, shoot team, hell just came to earth. Combine with those on the MRT can use this change to break out.<br><br>That is a very frightening scenario, remember when someone who plan to take on SOF/Star as imagined, they don't sit and wait in the mouse trap, they have buffet planned, they go for the kill not impossible when you dealing with equally resourceful nut case.</div>

If I am a terrorist, I will plant explosives in the train and blow it up together with the passengers and make a statement. It is not a very bright idea to make demands in an MRT train, stuck in the middle of nowhere.</div>

That where the counter blood traps come in, thunderflashes in the tunnels where the kill zone is set. Usually the kill zone will have claymore and explosive. Thus you can never have a overwhelming number to swarm as limited by the tunnel which allow the enemy to concentrate fire with very small squad, also there be fall back defensive position, which will sure to stop the swarm momentum.<br><br></div>
