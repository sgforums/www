After 9-11, flight passengers have no qualm battling it out with the terrorists on the plane, since they know doom is imminent. Perhaps our MRT passengers are like that also?<br><br>Maybe that day Military Nuts happen to have an outing and people like SpecOps87, chunyong, sidestep1984, storywolf all in the train. Then add in commandos like lion02, Gendaken etc. So when you all hear the terrorist plan, all shake your head. Even chunyong, who seems to be "in the know", also shake his head and mutter "our STAR cannot pull this off, definitely". And the commandos suddenly admit "Our SOF never execute this kind of rescue mission succesfully before."<br><br>Then how? All suddenly become very garang and fight it out with the terrorists?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>Hey, how did I get dragged into the train? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>First, the "sudden bright light" scenario is exactly the situation that monocular NVGs are designed for - the eye that is not looking through the NVG is still good.<br><br>Second (qualifying this with the caveat that this is the theory), one of the original aims for instituting NS in Singapore is the diffusion of military-trained personnel throughout the population.  The scenario quoted above may not be entirely unrealistic.  As in the case of United 93, people can be capable of surprising things when the outlook is grim enough.<br><br>Third, the scenario hinges upon the terrorists getting what they demand - that's their Archilles heel and that's why pre-9/11 hijackings were a losing proposition.  Think Entebbe, Mogadishu and the Achille Lauro - time was on the good guys' side and they didn't need to be in a rush to storm in.  In order to get what they wanted, the terrorists would have to leave their prepared positions, and that's where they're weakest.  The scanario is therefore moot - why try to hit them at their strongest point?<br><br>Fourth, just to entertain the idea of a storming at that time, flashbangs aren't the only pre-storming method of incapacitating Tangos, are they?  The train's got speakers built in and can be used in place of the flashbangs' "bang" effect.<br><br>Apart from that, I can't say anything that nobody else has covered, or that won't be a breach of the OSA.</div>

If a terrorist is on a suicide mission, there's not a lot you can do about it.<br><br>However, I do believe that the scenario involves hostage-taking, in which case the objective of taking the hostage comes into play, and this gives negotiators and hostage rescue teams more free play.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..having just read my post above, i realize that it sounds abit Guai Lan. Sorry bout that - it was posted in the wee hours of the morning..<br><br>Anyway, my point is that we shouldn't elevate the SOF to near mythical status. They are but men, albeit highly trained. When they go in, they are going into what is probably a lose-lose situation already. THe SQ terrorist are not what i call meticulous, disciplined or determind.<br><br>The Russian school yard incident illustrates my point. The Military were stumped and helpless in the face of terrorists which actually did some planinng and some preparation and had technical knowledlge of rigging bombs etc.<br><br>The military had to resort to trying to storm the building. 200 died. I would say the terr won in this case. They would have inflicted more if they had more explosives and if they had more knwoledge of demolitions.<br><br>Anyway the scenario given is not really that stoopid. If the terr were determind to die anyway, and their demand was for the release of their comrades etc and not for personal financial gain, then they couldnt have chosen a better place. Confined area + explosives = big headache. If they had knowlegde of structural stresses, then i imagine they could even engineer the tunnel for collapse. Even bigger headache. Also, if the terr uses the able bodied males in the train as negotiating chips, even better. The can't control too many anyway, and males may give them trouble. Use those ppl as a sign of goodwill, you retain say 150 old women, children, and weak women/men. At the same time you get rid of those that may pose a threat to you and may have some fight left. Further, the infirmed may be in need of madical care. You may then be able to use that to add more pressure.<br><br>And the qn of how to "repel" the SOF/STAR? Ans is to blow up the whole damn place. The fact that the government sent them in means that the govt doesn't want to  negotiate. The best way then for the terr to cut "losses" is to kill everything in the train, including the SOF/STAR invovled.<br><br>- An Armchair Warrior.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The SOF playbook is developed from the experience and with the assistance of proven units such as the SAS and GSG9.  As for their level of training, their performance in overseas courses shows that they're up there with the best.

            <div class='col-md body'>Gedanken,I have to agree that our operators playbook follows the guidelines of proven CT units like SAS,GSG9 and so on.But don't you agree,that each and every hostage situation is different from the previous one?And there is no fixed way of ensuring that the tangos do not kill the hostages and themselves even if the demands are met right?Besides,so far there have been no hostage situation being carried out underground,in a train yet i belief.But do correct me if I'm wrong.(Post the webby link so we can analyse how the CT team involved fared)<br><br>Now since many say that the MRT hijack situation is a bad example...what about this:<br><br>Tangos have managed to take ver a school in Singapore,say ACS Independent.They chose the school as they have intel that the school have many students whose parents are influential interms of wealth and power in Singapore.And many are highly educated,and thus begin to pressure the relevant authorities to take action and save their kids.<br><br>Now the situation in the school is this:<br><br>The tangos sneaked in posing as contractors as the school is undergoing upgrading.<br><br>All entry and exit points in the school has been booby-trapped or are under survillenence by the security cameras placed in the school.The security cameras are watched by tangos to ensure no hanky-panky on the part of the security forces.Now,the students are rounded up and placed in the hall,but some are placed seperate from the other,in classrooms on the upper levels with the blinds drawn to prevent snipers from shooting at them.While another group is tied up and placed in the middle of the parade square,rigged with explosives.Any attempt to escape will cause it to blow,and there is a pair of tangos with their guns constantly trained on them,this group is in full-view of the media.A group is also placed tied up on the ceiling,any attempt of rescue will cause them to be shot too.**bare in mind,the only way onto the roof is by heli-rappeling or by the roof-access hatch which is guarded by the tangos.The adult staff of the school are placed seperate from the students,and when the security forces arrive to begin negotiations,the adults are used as bargaining chips.<br><br>Also,the hall where the students are held is rigged with explosives.And all stairs are either rigged with explosives or mined to prevent the possible take-over by security forces,leaving only one which will be used by the tangos.And this stair case is guarded as well,and rigged with a remote detonation device.And the remote device is controlled from the command centre where the survillence cameras can see what is goin on in most parts of the school.<br><br>Demands:<br>-US$100,000,000<br>-Prisoners being held by ISD<br>-Fellow tangos imprisoned by other countries in the region<br>-A safe passage to an undisclosed destination by sea.(Not by air as they are scared that the Air Force may be sent to blow them out of the sky)<br><br>Weapons/equipment of the tangos:<br>-Assault Rifles<br>-Sniper Rifles<br>-SMGs<br>-Pistols<br>-RPGs<br>-Grenades<br>-Semtex and C4 explosives<br>-Claymore and Bouncing Betty Mines<br>-Bullet-proof vests<br>-NVGs<br><br>You are the groundforce commander,presurred by the PM,your commanding officer,the CDF,COA,parents,various ministries etc...what are you going to do?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Short answer, you've got two choices.  Either leave it to the negotiators to bore the terrorists to death, or storm the building with the assumption that losses are unavoidable and that you job is just to keep the number as low as possible while ensuring a bunch of 100% dead tangos.<br><br>If it helps you sleep better at night, think about how much work it would take for the setup you described.  If upgrading is in progress, it will not be across the whole school grounds.  If the work was on such a scale, it would be done at a time when the students weren't there.  Also, the work would be supervised - you know how sticky customers can get about having work done that they haven't ordered.  Also, you're probably going to need up to a platoon strength of terrorists just to keep track of all the students in all those locations.  Overall, it's an unlikely scenario.  Besides, regardless of how influential the parents are, there's not much they can do to the government if the government's done everything within its power to resolve the situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Great answer Ged!<br><br>SpecOps enemy seems to be state-sponsered. Its not that easy to get that kind of material. Even if you do, your operatives have to be technically trained to an exceptional degree.<br><br>How do you get such men? Where do their motivation come from? SG is a friendly state. Its awful hard to find enough peeps with that kind of agenda. And this is the reality, not a half-hashed scenario.</div>
