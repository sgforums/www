Chu, undersecretary for personnel and readiness, said Tuesday.<br><br>That means Â“less shouting at everyone, in essence, which some of you may remember from an earlier generation as being the modus operandi,Â” he said.<br><br>The changes started about a year ago, as defense officials looked for ways to make drillmasters more effective, said Lt. Col. Mike Jones, head of Army National Guard recruiting.<br><br>He said the old way was to Â“talk loud, talk often, get their attentionÂ” Â— shock treatment to teach discipline and mold the newly recruited civilian into a soldier.<br><br>But trainers found todayÂ’s generation responded better to instructors who took Â“a more counselingÂ” type role, Jones said, using strong tactics when needed but keeping them the exception instead of the rule.<br><br>No longer training in fear<br>The approach has had two positive results, he said: It has lowered attrition among those who go through training each year and has eased one of the greatest fears of recruits Â— their fear over whether they can make it through basic training.<br><br>Other changes aimed at improving graduation rates include such things as letting recruits with injuries or minor medical problems remain in the service, heal, and then go back to training. Before, an injury would have meant discharge, training officials said.<br><br>Numbers differ from service to service and depend on what the recruit is being trained for. Those training to be Navy SEALS or other special forces may wash out at the rate of 70 percent. Those training to be truck drivers may have an 80 percent graduation rate.<br><br>But Chu said that across all services, generally, some two-thirds of recruits finish their enlistment period Â— typically three or four years.<br><br>Some drop out within six months<br>Of the third who donÂ’t make it, half bomb out in the first six to 12 months, Chu said, adding that the attrition rate is better than most private sector firms.<br><br>Keeping a balance in the number flushed out of the service is important. Too many dropouts and you lose people you really want to keep. Too few dropouts, and you are keeping people you should have let go, Chu said.<br><br>Both the military and police academies are moving away from harder-edged approaches to training, he said.<br><br>Â“However much it may be satisfying from the shouterÂ’s perspective, it really isnÂ’t the best way to shape young people for the future,Â” Chu said.<br><br>He made the comments as he announced that all active duty services had met their recruiting goals for the budget year ended Sept. 30. The Marine Corps Reserve met its goal and the Air Force Reserve exceeded its goal, but they were exceptions among guard and reserve forces, some of which have seen Â“heavy useÂ” due to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Chu said.</span><br><br></div>

But the main reason they fought the Americans was because they wanted to rescue North Korea. China needed North Korea then, as they still do today, as a buffer against a US-dominated South Korea.<br><br>PLA soldiers in North Korea were called "volunteers" for propaganda purposes, but this gives you an idea that the PLA engaged the Americans not because they felt threatened, but they were there to aid their NKPA allies.<br><br>China's "line in the sand" wasn't the Yalu river, but the 38th parallel. Basically, China is saying that the US has punished NK enough, the NKPA is nearly destroyed, so please go back south of the 38th parallel and we'll call it quits.<br><br>Of course this wasn't acceptable to the Americans.<br><br>But back to the topic.<br><br>US troops in 1950 were a soft bunch. WW2 had just been won. Evil was defeated. No one was expecting trouble.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes it does. I believe that shouting and threats of punishment is essentail.<br><br>We've all seen how perfectly intellelligent people seem to screw things up when someone is at his back shouting at him or when he has the threat of (yet another) 50 pushups haging over him. I've been shouted at and i've screwed up. I have also observed that all the shouting and all the pressure being heaped on recruits makes them less confident of themselves, less sure of themselves with the result that common sense seem to desert them - and they screw up.<br><br>We also know that on OPs, soldiers may well have to work under pressure or whilst being shouted at.<br><br>I am sure everyone who has been in the army will agree with the observcations above. With that in mind, how can it be said that piling on the pressure has no part in recruit training?<br><br>Shouting = pressure = screw up. The aim of shouting at recruits then, is so that soldiers may be conditioned to operate with less screw ups under pressure.<br><br>Looking at the article, we see why the US army wants to adopt this nicer approach - they do not want recruits to 'wash out' and they want to cut cost. This therefore seems to be an initiative thought up by some pu-ssy civil-service bean counter. Of course, the notion that people who 'wash out' of something as easy as US army recruit training might not be wholly suitable to serve as a soldier seems to be lost on him...<br><br></div>

At Muchon-ni, when our disciplined, competent 27th Infantry re-captured positions fled by 2/24 they found the battalion's abandoned crew-served weapons still in place.<br><br>Even more tragically shameful, when some of our best men in other regiments were wounded, they were abandoned by their comrades to the cruelties of the enemy."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few things.<br><br>1.  I totally advocate the use of "un-niceties" during BMT.  Every blur recruit steps into BMT with their own ideas and fantasies of what Army life is like.  Some too garang, some too slack.  There is no time for them to slowly discover how to fit into military life at their own pace.  With only 2 years in NS, and 3 months in BMT, there is a need to condition the civies to soldiers rapidly.  There is little time to counsel each individual recruit to action when action needs to be taken immediately.  Thats when they need to wake up their ideas n comply.  Not happy, thrash it out in the AAR.<br><br>2.  IA-drill. I was rather unconvinced about this entire "Enemy right! Charge!" myself. I believe this is really a case by case basis action.  What my OC taught us was, if the enemy is less than 20 or 25 meters (can't remember), chances are we'd both discover each other's presence. And who wins the skirmish is the one who takes the initiative first.  Hence, charge.<br><br>Of course, being a impudent recruit, i asked, "What if the enemy decides to ready against a charge by going low and respond with heavy fire and hand grenades? " Reply, "Hong kan lor.  In war, there is no sure win situation."<br><br>PS Moca: In the jungle @ 100m all you see is green.  You're lucky to be able to see 20-30 meters sometimes.<br><br>3.  The Americans and South Koreans never crossed the Yalu.  But it was their intention to liberate the Korean Peninsular of Communist influence.  China saw this as a threat and pre-empted it.<br><br>More details here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War</a></div>

With the United States mired in the Korean War, in November 1950 a reporter asked President Harry S. Truman whether U.N. forces might cross the Yalu River into Manchuria. Truman responded, "We will take whatever steps are necessary to meet the military situation, just as we always have." <strong>Asked whether that included using atomic bombs, Truman responded: "That includes every weapon we have."</strong> A few minutes after the press conference ended, the lead of the United Press wire story read, "President Truman said today that the United States has under consideration use of the atomic bomb in connection with the war in Korea." [7]<br><br><strong>Nearly three years later, Truman's successor, President Dwight Eisenhower, also wielded the threat of U.S. nuclear use.</strong> In May 1953, Eisenhower authorized an expanded Korean bombing campaign, prompting the North Koreans and Chinese to respond by increased ground action. As part of the heightened military activity, the Joint Chiefs presented six different scenarios for ending the war, "most envisioning the possible use of atomic weapons," according to an official Pentagon history. "After the NSC reached a seeming consensus on May 20 to employ atomic weapons both strategically and tactically--that is within and outside the Korean Peninsula--the administration communicated its resolve to the Chinese and North Koreans. . . . Both Eisenhower and [Secretary of State John Foster] Dulles believed the message had the desired effect" of ending the war, the history reads.
