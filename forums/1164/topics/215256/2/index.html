Even in a simulated firefight, it is basically organised chaos at best, with loud noises, smoke and pple yelling their heads off. In a situation like that, one needs to be able to operate to stay alive, i guess, and all that screaming and shouting did help to some extent to help us function a bit better in stressful conditions.<br><br>That said, I have to point out that altho we did recieve a fair bit of insults and vulgar language, our instructors were also quick to give us credit for a good job. This, I believe, lies the crux of the issue. The shouting and screaming forced us to work together, but the credit given also built up our confidence and encouraged us to push further. Encouragement and tough words must go together to ensure that troops maintain their morale and learn to fight at the same time. </div></blockquote><span style="color: darkred;">Everything has its place and time.<br><br>Being nasty all the time will not be of any use, and being nice all the time will definitely not help to mould the fighting spirit desired of a soldier.<br><br>Good Commanders and Instructors know when to grind and when to praise, and it is their job to ensure that trainng is made as realistically safe as is possible.</span></div>

The new curriculum focuses on producing soldiers who can immediately contribute to their unit following advanced individual training (AIT).<br><br>Developing Individual Skills<br><br>Gone are the days of sterile phase testing--soldiers standing in line at parade rest at field tables covered with camouflage net, score cards neatly tucked under the camouflage bands of their helmets, waiting to be tested on individual tasks. The hours of perfecting drill and ceremony and sitting in large lecture-style classes have been slashed.<br><br><strong>In place of sterile phase testing comes judgment-based training in the form of end-of-phase situational training exercises </strong>(STX), where soldiers perform critical individual tasks under replicated combat conditions. Squad tactical movement, urban operations, and convoy operations have replaced many of the hours formerly devoted to marching. Small group, performance-oriented training, taught by a new breed of warrior-focused drill sergeants, characterize most of the instruction once taught by committee, or at the very least, in a classroom with a platform instructor addressing 220 students. Combat-focused courses are constructed so that teamwork events, such as litter carrying, water and ammunition resupply, and fighting position construction, replace the noncombat-related teamwork development course.<br><br><strong>The first step was to change the training methodology and preserve this methodology through the application of an updated mission essential task list (METL) for BCT. The second step was to incorporate individual skills developed and mastered during the first weeks of BCT into a new training strategy called "warrior challenge," which empowers drill sergeants and BCT soldiers to focus on combat-oriented, squad-level tactics.</strong><br><br>At the core of this transformation is the new Basic Combat Training Methodology, which is shown in Figure 1. As indicated in the upper "individual" band, soldiers are trained in key individual tasks that are relevant to the force's current needs. Instead of sterile testing at the end of each training phase, soldiers' performance is validated during the execution of critical collective tasks in the form of STXs. Every effort is made to ensure these STXs are as realistic as possible, to include media, civilians, urban areas, improvised explosive devises (IED), and a healthy dose of ambiguity, information overload and/or deprivation, uncertainty, and unpredictability. These training standards are ultimately measured by mission accomplishment within the commander's intent, rather than performance measures accomplished in specific order.<br><br>[FIGURE 1 OMITTED]<br><br>During the final five-day field training exercise (FTX), soldiers conduct an intensive squad external evaluation (EXEVAL), which challenges soldiers and drill sergeants in executing warrior tasks and drills. By the end of nine weeks, soldiers have been exposed to many of the same situations they will face in combat. They will make tough decisions, just as they will in combat, and for many, combat is just around the corner. The STXs and the final EXEVAL add focus to BCT and require drill sergeants to develop training strategies to prepare them for these events; battle-focused training improves soldiers and leaders.<br><br><strong>The current goal is to preserve this methodology and consolidate gains made over the past year, making BCT more realistic, relevant, and rigorous.</strong> Recent headway was made when the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) approved changes to the Infantry School's BCT program of instruction. However, resources are only part of the effort--ensuring BCT battalion and company METL are battle-focused is another critical component.<br><br>"Conduct BCT" has been the usual METL task briefed by nearly every BCT battalion and company commander <strong>far too long</strong>. This task might work at the battalion level, but it is not adequate to focus company commanders and their cadre. U.S. Army Field Manual 7-0, Training the Force, states, "Battle focus is equally applicable in TDA organizations," and "mission essential tasks should include critical training tasks." (1) The critical training tasks in the new BCT are the foundation for the STXs, which include establishing a checkpoint, occupying an assembly area, conducting tactical movement (mounted and dismounted), and conducting tactical movement in an urban area. Moreover, accomplishing these collective tasks enable soldiers to execute many of Task Force Soldier's recommended 40 core warrior tasks and nine core warrior drills. (2)<br><br>All U.S. Army BCT organizations must accomplish identical functions to get the most from the new BCT POI. To accomplish this, every BCT organization must have a standardized METL for common tasks. <strong>At the battalion-level, the METL can be organized into three essential tasks, which include conducting BCT, exercising command and control, and maintaining certification and readiness. </strong>Each of the battalion's METL tasks has supporting battle tasks that logically feed into the company's METL. For example, the battalion METL task of conduct BCT has supporting battle tasks of establishing a checkpoint, conducting tactical movement (mounted and dismounted), and conducting tactical movement in a built-up area. The company's METL would then include tasks such as establishing a checkpoint, conducting tactical movement (dismounted), conduct tactical movement (mounted), and conducting tactical movement in a built-up area. The company battle tasks then logically become critical collective and/or individual tasks on which drill sergeants can focus their efforts. For instance, the company battle task of establishing a checkpoint would have supporting battle tasks that include tasks such as handling enemy prisoners of war/detainees, determining location on ground, reacting to media, and performing first aid. The majority of these battle tasks, critical collective tasks, and critical individual tasks are, in fact, core warrior tasks and drills.</span><br><br></div>
