              <p>They all made a pact before they went to war.   <br> <br> Whatever happened to them in Afghanistan no one  -  dead or alive  -  would be left behind.  <br> One night in Helmand Province, that pledge was put to the test.  <br> <br> In a terrifying split second, the close-knit group from one of the
              Army's most battle-scarred units came under fire from a hail of Taliban
              bullets and rocket-powered grenades. <br> <br> Four men were hit and several others temporarily blinded by phosphorus.
              Their screams of pain cut through the darkness as the ambushed platoon
              was pinned down by gunfire from two sides. <br> <br> But the men of 2nd Battalion the Mercian Regiment knew precisely what they had to do.  <br> And today the extraordinary heroism which allowed the young soldiers to
              keep to their pledge at any cost can be revealed as they are awarded
              some of the highest military honours. <br> <br> The men repeatedly braved enemy fire to rescue their injured and fatally wounded comrades from the hands of the Taliban.  <br> <br> Private Luke Cole, 22, carried on fighting after half his thigh bone was blown away.  <br> When another bullet ripped open his stomach, he simply tucked his shirt
              in tighter "to hold everything in" - and carried on keeping the enemy
              at bay until back-up arrived. <br> <br> Sergeant Craig Brelsford, 25, continued to command his men long after
              he was critically wounded - and right up to the moment he died. <br> <br> <strong>In a singularly selfless act, he ran to put his body between the enemy and his wounded comrades. </strong><br> <br> It protected them from Taliban gunfire, but cost him his life.  <br> <br> And the 25-year-old platoon commander, Lieutenant Simon Cupples, led a
              rescue party into the killing zone to carry the injured to safety and
              recover the dead - again and again and again. <br> <br> Their astonishing courage - and that of scores of other British
              servicemen and women serving in Afghanistan and Iraq - is marked today
              with a raft of 184 awards. <br> <br> They include the biggest batch of medals since fighting began in
              Afghanistan nearly seven years ago - a reflection not just of the
              ferocity of the conflict, but of the conspicuous bravery of British
              troops. <br> <br> The ambush near the frontline town of Garmsir underlined the extreme
              danger that troops face daily in what has turned into a bloody and
              difficult war. <br> <br> It played out into a six-hour pitched battle as both sides poured in
              reinforcements. But true to the pact, Lt Cupples and his men refused to
              withdraw until the bodies of two fallen comrades were recovered. <br> <br> Telling their families back home that no one knew what happened to them, he decided, was "simply not an option".  <br> <br> His valour and dedication is recognised with the award of a Conspicuous
              Gallantry Cross - the highest bravery medal after the Victoria Cross. <br> <br> Yesterday he told the remarkable story of that night last September.</p>

              <p>The young officer, now a captain, recalled how his men were advancing
              under cover of darkness when they came under devastating fire from a
              Taliban trench just 20 yards away, and then from other enemy positions.
              <br> <br> "I could tell we had taken serious casualties." he said. "There was
              screaming from the men around me. Because we were so close to the enemy
              it was very difficult to withdraw and regroup, but we couldn't leave
              the casualties. <br> <br> "It was asking a lot for the blokes to run forward into enemy fire like that."<br> <br> "But they did it because their mates were out there. When you live and
              serve with your men like that it creates a very special bond. You would
              do anything for those guys. That's what drove the soldiers forward." <br> <br> Captain Cupples, from Derbyshire, who married his sweetheart, Louise,
              shortly before deploying to Afghanistan, is due to return with his unit
              next year. <br> <br> Also involved in the September firefight was Private Cole, from Wolverhampton, who is awarded the Military Cross.</p>

              <p>A Taliban bullet smashed into his right thigh in the first few seconds
              of the battle, shattering five inches of bone. As he tried to crawl to
              safety he was shot through the stomach and left hip. <br> <br> Not realising how badly hurt he was, he managed to drag himself to a
              badly-wounded friend and give first aid - saving his life - before
              grabbing his rifle and firing almost 200 rounds at enemy positions to
              help cover the withdrawal. <br> <br> "The pain didn't hit me at the time," he said. "I thought it was a
              flesh wound. But I looked down and it was a mess, to be honest. I knew
              it was serious but I thought, 'This can't be the way I go out'. So I
              carried on. <br> <br> "I could see muzzle flashes of the enemy weapons in a ditch behind some
              trees so I kept shooting and gave my mate first aid when I could. <br> <br> "Then I got shot again. I looked at my stomach and it was cut open, so
              I tucked my shirt in to keep it together and kept on firing until more
              lads from the platoon arrived. <br> <br> "I only realised how bad it was when they finally dragged me off into cover." <br> <br> Medics dug out the bullet from his thigh and he now keeps it in his bedroom at home. <br> <br> Sergeant Brelsford, from Nottingham, who was only days away from his
              26th birthday when he died, is also remembered with a posthumous
              Military Cross. <br> <br> He was described as "an extremely professional soldier" who
              demonstrated calm leadership under pressure and "incredible bravery in
              the face of the enemy". <br> <br> He was killed as he led his men through heavy fire in a successful operation to bring back the body of Private Johan Botha.  <br> <br> General David Richards, formerly Britain's top commander in
              Afghanistan, congratulated the decorated soldiers at a ceremony
              yesterday. <br> <br> "It doesn't surprise me that there is such a haul of medals," he said.
              "It is the toughest fighting we have seen since Korea half a century
              ago ... a reflection of the tenacity of our soldiers, and of the
              enemy." <br> <br> "All these men fully deserve their recognition, but we should remember
              it is always representative of many others who also showed immense
              bravery." <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_01/jamesPA0703_100x110.jpg" border="0" alt=""><strong>Staff Sergeant James Wadsworth</strong> Staff Sergeant James Wadsworth of the Royal Logistics Corps
              successfully defused the largest roadside bomb ever found in southern
              Iraq - while his fellow-soldiers fought a gun battle against local
              insurgents trying to overrun the site. <br> <br> He is today awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for his 'extraordinary, selfless courage.' <br> <br> The massive bomb containing around 120lb of explosives was spotted
              buried beneath a pavement opposite a hospital in the centre of Basra
              last July, ready to flatten the area and cause untold carnage when a
              British convoy passed. <br> <br> Staff Sgt Wadsworth, 29, from Cambridge, said: "Normally you would
              spend three or four hours dealing with a device like that but we were
              under fire in the city centre. The greatest danger is spending time on
              the ground. <br> <br> "I made it safe in 27 minutes. We only realised how big it was when we came to move it. <br> <br> "I remember it was 55 degrees in the shade. Our unit was so busy we hadn't slept for days. <br> <br> "I haven't really told my wife about what I did. You just get on with the job." <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_01/donaldPA0703_100x110.jpg" border="0" alt=""><strong>Lance Corporal Donald Campbell</strong> Lance Corporal Donald Campbell, of the Royal Corps of Engineers is
              awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for driving an unarmoured and
              unprotected vehicle into an enemy killing zone "whilst under very
              intense, accurate fire for a considerable amount of time" - to help
              bridge a water-filled ditch which was holding up an advance in Helmand
              Province. <br> <br> The 26-year-old from the Scottish island of Benbecula, moved his 'front
              loader' vehicle towards the enemy, offering a huge and vulnerable
              target, then climbed out of the cab to undo straps so that he could
              drop a 'fascine' - a huge bundle of pipes - into the ditch allowing
              armoured vehicles to cross. <br> <br> He refused to seek cover even when bullets, rocket propelled grenades
              and mortar fire shattered the windows of the cab and badly damaged the
              vehicle, missing him by inches. <br> <br> He said: "My folks are really happy about the award, but I don't think they quite appreciate what the medal means yet."<br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_01/paulDP0703_100x110.jpg" border="0" alt=""><strong> Private Paul Willmott</strong> Private Paul Willmott, 21, receives the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for
              taking command of his unit during a battle when his sergeant was shot
              dead in Afghanistan last year. <br> <br> The young private from the Mercian Regiment watched as a Taliban sniper
              killed Lance Corporal Paul Sandford near the town of Gereshk, leaving
              the unit leaderless. <br> <br> Although other soldiers were more senior he assumed command, laying
              down suppressing fire as they withdrew, and then stayed to drag his
              fallen comrade's body to safety. <br> <br> Two weeks later he suffered severe head injuries from a rocket
              propelled grenade, but insisted on returning to his unit after a week
              of treatment rather than flying home to Britain. <br> <br> "We were undermanned," he said. "We were down to 13 blokes in our
              platoon and needed every soldier available, so I asked to go back."<br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_01/ruthDP0703_100x110.jpg" border="0" alt=""><strong>Captain Ruth Earl </strong> <br> Captain Ruth Earl is awarded an MBE for her dogged determination to
              keep British troops' vehicles and equipment fit for battle, commanding
              a dusty workshop in the deserts of Afghanistan. <br> <br> The 34-year-old Cambridge science graduate, who was a part-time TA
              reservist before joining up as a regular officer in the Royal
              Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, spent six months working 18-hour
              days in the 'brutal summer heat' of Camp Bastion in Helmand Province,
              according to her citation. <br> <br> She commanded 150 men tasked with keeping essential weapons and combat
              vehicles in working order in the punishing surroundings of the Afghan
              desert. <br> <br> "Despite her junior years and experience, she sustained operations in
              this theatre in a way that few others could match," the citation reads.
              <br> <br> Yesterday married officer from Stoke-on-Trent said she was left 'speechless' by news of her award.<br> <br> <br> <em>Source: Daily Mail, UK Mar. 7, 2008</em></p>
