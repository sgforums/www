A demonstration was organized to demand their release and the police called in army reinforcements. After some demonstrators threw rocks and attempted to storm the police station, security forces used tear gas and gunfire in response.[1]<br><br>Hundreds of local people, mostly young men, were arrested. They had their shirts taken off, bound with their hands tied behind their backs, and made to lie face down on the ground. Video footage shows soldiers kicking and beating those already bound and helplessly lying on the ground.[2]<br><br>Later that afternoon, those arrested were thrown by soldiers into trucks to be taken to an army camp in the next province of Pattani. The prisoners were stacked five or six deep in the trucks, and by the time the trucks reached their destination three hours later, many had suffocated to death.<br><br>Reports claim that 7 died as a result of gunshot wounds. The rest are believed to have died either from suffocation or beatings.[3]<br><br>This incident sparked widespread protests across Thailand. VCDs were made by Muslim groups showing footage of the events as well as some speeches. These VCDs were circulated among Muslims in Thailand.[4] The government said that it was illegal to own copies of the VCDs and said it could prosecute anybody who has a copy.[4]<br><br>Shortly after the incident, PM Thaksin Shinawatra's first response defended the army's actions and said the men died "because they were already weak from fasting during the month of Ramadan."[5]<br><br>As of January 1st, 2006, no members of the security forces responsible were brought to justice.[6]<br><br>Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont gave a formal apology for the incident on 2 November 2006.[7]</blockquote>stack like that inside a very hot truck....one survivor said everyone around him died one by one, screaming in agony.<br><br>search also the vid in youtube...tag: Tak Bai</div>

Of course, that is one of the more spectacular incidents. These people are basically treated like parasite in a land where their forefathers lived for generations. Those parts aren't merely Malay-dominated. They were a part of Malaysia.<br><br>Basically, these people of Pattani are Malays, not " Thai Muslim ", and they had been fighting the Thais for as long as any of us had been around.<br><br>The Brits gave Pattani to Thailand, and to pacify Malaysia, the Brits later gave the Malaysians a big fat piece of meat called Sabah and Sarawak - chocked full of natural reserves and very few people.<br><br>In essence, the Malaysian government of that time betrayed the Pattani Malays by signing their fate away to the Thai Buddhists.<br><br>The irony is that the real Malays of Pattani were given away while the non-Malay indeginous peoples of Borneo (Sabah &amp; Sarawak) are taken into Malaysia. And Malays are still not dominant in Borneo today.<br><br>And present day, while the Malaysian Malays sympathise with and support the Pattani Malays, the KL government continue to do its best to keep away the Pattani Malays insurgents.<br><br>First of all, if they don't it'll lead to conflict between Malaysia and Thailand. Secondly the Pattani rebels will bring with them Islamic radicalism which is the thing Malaysia fears most.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lets read the history of the Pattani first then we could understand....the thai regard it as legend and story, yet many historian and archeologist disagree.<br><br><blockquote>Patani probably rivals Kedah as among the oldest Malay states on the Peninsula. The lost Second Century kingdom of Langkasuka may have spanned the peninsula from Patani on the east coast, to northern Kedah on the west. Wu-pei-chih, certainly firmly places a Lang-hsi-chia to the south of Songkla (Singora), up to the Patani River and the fabled spirit land of Lakawn Suka still features in the mythology of Patani Malays. Patani was probably one of the Sri Vijayan empire's conquests and ' Ilangasoka, undaunted in fierce battles' was certainly recorded as one of Rajendra Cola's conquests in his raids into Southeast Asia into the empire in 1025.Patani is also probably one of the earliest Malay states to convert to Islam - certainly well before Melaka. The Hikayat Patani tells the story of its king Raja Phya Tu Nakpa who falls gravely ill, with no apparent cure to his ailment in sight. A holy man by the name of Syeikh Said claims he can cure the ruler but only if he promises to convert to Islam as soon as he is healthy. The desperate ruler promises to do so and, as a result, he makes a miraculous recovery. However, he forgets his promise and falls ill, and again seeks the holy man's blessings. This happens three times - but he finally makes good on his promise the third time and becomes a Muslim, calling himself Sultan Ismail Shah.It is under Sultan Ismail Shah's reign that the state takes on the name 'Patani'.<br><br>Seeking a location for a new capital, he comes across an ideal spot on the coast and exclaims to his followers 'Pantai Ini!' ('This beach!). Another account says that he finds a farmer's hut at this spot and calls his capital 'Pak Tani' ('farmer'). This capital is thought to be in modern day Kampong Grisek (Kru Se).Patani was certainly known to the Portuguese, who first visited the port in 1516, with Godinho de Eredia going as far as describing 'Patane' as the first seat of the Malay Empire.<br><br>The fall of Melaka to the Portuguese in 1511 certainly increased Patani's popularity with India's Muslim traders. Its location on the east coast of the Peninsula gave it the added advantage of being the ideal emporium for goods from China. This economic growth may have strengthened its military power as well. Taking advantage of a massive invasion of Ayutthaya by the Burmese in 1563, Sultan Ismail's successor, Sultan Muzaffar Shah, launched an attack on the Siamese, with 200 ships and thousands of men. He died suddenly during the campaign and is said to be buried at the estuary of the Menam Chao Phraya.In 1584, Patani entered its golden age with the rule of four successive Queens, Ratu Hijau ('The Green Queen'), Ratu Biru ('The Blue Queen'), Ratu Ungu ('The Violet Queen') and Ratu Kuning ('The Yellow Queen'). Patani expanded its borders to include Kelantan and Trengganu and became the most powerful Malay state after Johor.<br><br>It was during this time that Patani became renowned for manufacturing cannon, producing three of the largest bombards ever cast in the region - 'Mahalela', 'Seri Negara' and 'Seri Petani'. With each measuring over six metres in length. Certainly, this technology may have contributed to Patani successfully beating back no less than four Siamese invasions in - at times with the help of Malay forces from Johor and Pahang.However, by the middle of the 17th Century, during the reign of the last of the Queens, Patani fell into gradual decline. This decline probably prompted her to submit to Siam as a vassal state and send the 'Bunga Mas' to Ayutthya. She died without an heir and the country descended into decades of political chaos and conflict.<br><br>Fortunately for Patani, Siam was too weak to take advantage of the situation, being too busy driving off crippling Burmese invasions into her territory, culminating in the pillaging and complete destruction of Ayutthaya in 1767.The Siamese general Phraya Taksin led a war of independence that drove the Burmese out of Siam and his successor Rama I established the Chakri dynasty, which was to rule Siam to this day. A resurgent and much stronger Siam demanded troops and supplies from Patani to face yet another Burmese raid. When Patani's Sultan Muhammad was reluctant to send troops, Rama I's son, Prince Surasi, attacked Patani in 1786. Sultan Muhammad was slain in battle and his capital was burned to the ground. 4,000 Patani Malays were brought in chains and marched barefoot the 1,300 km to Bangkok. It was said that the captives had to have their ear lobes and legs sewn together with strong rattan to prevent escape. In Bangkok, they became slaves and were made to dig the city's system of canals or 'klongs'.<br><br>As the ultimate humiliation, the symbols of Patani's strength and power - the 'Seri Negara' and 'Seri Patani' cannons - were brought in triumph to Bangkok . Both can still be seen today gracing the entrance to Thailand's Ministry of Defence building.Further rebellions erupted in Patani in 1791 and 1808, following which Patani was partitioned into seven states - Patani, Teluban (Sai), Nongcik, Jalor (Yala), Jambu(Jering), Legeh (Rangae) and Reman - and administered directly by the Raja of Ligor. There were few months of independence when four of the states joined the Kedah Malays in driving the Siamese out of the peninsula - but their success was short-lived and they were re-conquered easily. In 1906, the seven states were reconstituted into a single province. From the mythical Langkasuka to the seat of Malay empire, the province of Patani was now formally annexed as an administrative division of the Kingdom of Thailand.</blockquote></div>
