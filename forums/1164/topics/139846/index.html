Apparently, the Bionix mounts MEXAS composite NERA armor over a VHS hull, which makes it very well protected for its weight. IIRC, the rough estimate was 12.7mm all around protection, and 30mm APFSDS and RPG-7 frontal protection. </blockquote>Bionix 40/50 is abt 21,500kg and the stripped down w/o composite armour with only remotely fire HMG version Bionix ICV is abt 17,000kg, thus the composite armour is abt 4 tons!!!<br><br><a href="http://www.janes.com/defence/land_forces/supplement/lav/lav_bionix.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.janes.com/defence/land_forces/supplement/lav/lav_bionix.shtml</a><br><br>In conclusion, the Bionix IFV is the most well protected IFV in SEA, whether the frontal armour could withstand a old RPG-7, I think it could, at least greatly limit the devastation as we see in the Condor which only offer up to 7.62mm protection.<br><br>In fact, after Somalia, MY bought some Korean KIFVs(modified M113 with spaced armour) for UN mission in Bosnia rather than using the Condor becos of it's poor protection.</div>

Israeli Sabra MBT is mounted with NERA , not ERA anymore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True that the Malaysian APC's was part of the UN operation. But u gotta admit..if it were not for the APC's, the US will be picking up more body bags. I gotta give the US credit though..they NEVER leave no one behind. As long as u are an American citizen..soldier.. the will send the army in just to get ur sorry ass outta there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although in the operation to capture adid's top leaders and himself ended in disaster with the downing of 2 Blackhawks.It created many heroes of the troopers on the ground who fought for the lives of each other not for any political reasoning or motive,but purly for the survival for their fellow brothers-in-arms.<br><br>Everytime the operation in Somalia is mentioned...amongst the many heros,the two most distinct who pop into my mind are Randy Shurghart and Gary Gordon.Selflessly requesting to be landed to protect Mike Durant's crashsite.People who barely know each other by looks and not name,willing to scarifice their very lives for them.That's a really noble act. A salute to Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon.</div>
