              <p>President Aquino: Ship symbol of our defense</p>
              <p>The Philippines’ newest warship, which sailed on Tuesday into <a id="KonaLink4" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline !important;" href="#"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="kLink" style="position: relative; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">Manila </span><span class="kLink" style="position: relative; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">Bay</span></span></a> after a 14,679-kilometer voyage from the United States, was hailed by President Benigno Aquino III as a symbol of the country’s determination to defend its claims in the disputed West Philippine Sea (South China Sea).</p>
              <p>“This is just the beginning. Expect more good news because we will not stop at one ship,” Mr. Aquino said as the refurbished Hamilton-class cutter BRP Gregorio del Pilar dropped anchor, ending a 33-day voyage across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
              <p>“This ship symbolizes our newly acquired ability to guard, protect, and if necessary, fight for the interests of our country,” the President said.</p>
              <p>The 3,390-ton, 115-meter Gregorio del Pilar, a decommissioned US Coast Guard vessel, is 46 years old. It replaces a World War II-era destroyer as the country’s flagship vessel.</p>
              <p>Mr. Aquino said the “new” flagship vessel would help protect the country’s exclusive economic zone and its oil and gas exploration activities in the contested sea.</p>
              <p>“This will upgrade our capability to guard our exclusive economic zone as well as the service contract areas,” he said in a welcoming speech.</p>
              <p>Many of those areas are claimed by China, which insists it has sovereign rights to almost all of the disputed territory, even waters approaching the coasts of Southeast Asian countries.</p>
              <p>Other parts of the West Philippine Sea, including a cluster of isles and reefs called the Spratly Islands, are believed to be rich in oil and mineral resources and straddle <a id="KonaLink5" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline !important;" href="#"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: blue 1px solid; position: relative; background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">vital </span><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: blue 1px solid; position: relative; background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">sea </span><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: blue 1px solid; position: relative; background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">lanes</span></span></a>. They are also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.</p>
              <p><strong>Revival of Philippine Navy</strong></p>
              <p>The Philippine Navy chief, Vice Adm. Alexander Pama, hailed the Gregorio del Pilar as a timely boost to the Philippines’ military power.</p>
              <p>“[It] now symbolizes the revival of the Philippine Navy,” Pama said at the welcoming ceremony.</p>
              <p>“The Gregorio del Pilar’s ability to operate in adverse conditions… will be vital in securing our maritime nation’s territory and asserting our sovereignty in areas where our capability is now seriously needed, he added.”</p>
              <p><strong>US Navy impressed</strong></p>
              <p>Officials said the 95 crew members of the Gregorio del Pilar impressed the US Navy with how quickly they learned how to operate one of the largest ships ever built for the US Coast Guard.</p>
              <p>Led by Capt. Alberto Cruz, the 13 officers—three of them women—and 82 enlisted personnel trained rigorously in the United States from February before setting out for the Philippines.</p>
              <p>“They were quite impressed with our troops,” Pama said.</p>
              <p>An initial batch that included Cruz and 20 other officers and enlisted personnel underwent rigorous training on board the USCG Boutwell, a sister ship, for two months.</p>
              <p>The 21-member team then trained the next batch of 74 crew members.</p>
              <p>The ship was acquired under the Mutual Defense Treaty that gives the Philippines access to decommissioned US defense equipment.</p>
              <p>The Philippine military’s budget of about $2.5 billion this year is just a fraction of China’s published defense spending of about $90 billion.</p>
              <p><strong>China warning</strong></p>
              <p>Manila clinched the deal to acquire the Gregorio del Pilar—named after the youngest Philippine revolutionary general who fought the Spanish and died in combat against American forces—early this year before the tensions with China flared.</p>
              <p>The United States has since promised to help upgrade the Philippine military further, but no details have been released.</p>
              <p>China’s state-run media this month warned the Philippines it could pay a “high price” for building up its military presence in the West Philippine Sea.</p>
              <p>But bilateral ties remain strong in other areas, and Mr. Aquino will pay a state visit to China next week.</p>
              <p><strong>Jets, armored carriers</strong></p>
              <p>Mr. Aquino spent nearly two hours in a tour of the vessel. A select group of reporters were also allowed to tour the ship.</p>
              <p>The President has set his sights on acquiring more ships, trainer fighter jets and armored personnel carriers.</p>
              <p>“I want everything. But what we will acquire (are) lead-in jet trainers to keep the skill (levels) of the fighter pilots,” Mr. Aquino said.</p>
              <p>He also mentioned acquiring for the <a id="KonaLink6" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline !important;" href="#"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="kLink" style="position: relative; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">Philippine </span><span class="kLink" style="position: relative; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">Air</span></span></a> Force defense radars, a long-range patrol aircraft and support aircraft.</p>
              <p>He also cited the need for amphibious vessels, offshore patrol vessels, at least three naval helicopters and Coast Watch stations.</p>
              <p>For the Army, the Philippines plans to buy new assault rifles, armored assets and force protection equipment such as helmets, bulletproof vests, night-fighting equipment and radios, Mr. Aquino said.</p>
              <p>“There’s a whole list of modernization items for the (Armed Forces of the Philippines) and also the (Philippine National Police) and the Coast Guard,” the President added.</p>
              <p><strong>Defenseless in airspace</strong></p>
              <p>The country has been defenseless in its airspace since 2001, when the <a id="KonaLink7" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline !important;" href="#"><span style="color: blue;"><span class="kLink" style="position: relative; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">Philippine </span><span class="kLink" style="position: relative; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">Air </span><span class="kLink" style="position: relative; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue !important; font-weight: 400;">Force</span></span></a> last flew a fighter jet. The obsolete F-5 jets were decommissioned in 2005.</p>
              <p>Mr. Aquino said the country had to carefully weigh whether acquiring a submarine is “practical, whether or not it meets our needs.”</p>
              <p>He cited the experience of a Southeast Asian country, which he did not name, that bought submarines from Eastern Europe for a “bargain” price of $12 million.</p>
              <p>But the buyer discovered that the submarines had to be refitted for tropical purposes so it ended up spending the same amount it would have spent had it bought new submarines.</p>
              <p>Pama said the Navy planned to acquire at least two more decommissioned ships from the US Coast Guard.</p>
              <p>The Philippine Navy has an old and badly equipped fleet of fewer than 80 ships to protect its coastline and vast marine interests. The fleet is mostly made up of aging World War II vessels. AP News</p>

              <p>Vietnam boosts naval power with new frigate</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Vietnam on Monday received the second of two Russian-made <a title="guided missile" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.defencetalk.com/tag/guided-missile/"><span style="color: #000000;">guided missile</span></a> frigates, local media reported, boosting its naval firepower amid maritime tensions with <a title="China" href="http://www.defencetalk.com/tag/china/"><span style="color: #000000;">China</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The Gepard class frigate -- which an analyst called Vietnam's most modern warship -- arrived at Cam Ranh port on the country's south-central coast, reports said.</p>
              <p>The first frigate reached Vietnam in March, state-controlled Tuoi Tre newspaper said.</p>
              <p>"It alters the naval game," said Carl Thayer, a veteran Australia-based analyst of Vietnam. "A boat of that kind provides muscle for Vietnam."</p>
              <p>The frigates were ordered several years ago as part of a naval upgrade by Hanoi, which is also buying six Russian submarines and foreign-built <a title="maritime patrol aircraft" href="http://www.defencetalk.com/tag/maritime-patrol-aircraft/"><span style="color: #000000;">maritime patrol aircraft</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Beijing and Hanoi have a long-standing territorial dispute over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagos, which are potentially rich in oil and gas deposits and straddle vital commercial shipping lanes.</p>
              <p>Relations reached their lowest point in years when Vietnam in May accused Chinese marine <a title="surveillance" href="http://www.defencetalk.com/tag/surveillance/"><span style="color: #000000;">surveillance</span></a> vessels of cutting the exploration cables of an oil survey ship inside the country's exclusive economic zone.</p>
              <p>Vietnamese fishermen working in disputed waters have reported numerous seizures of their catch and equipment in recent years.</p>
              <p>Thayer said the new helicopter-capable frigates will back up the fishermen with a more powerful vessel than the lightly-armed civilian-run Chinese surveillance ships.</p>
              <p>Other nations in the region have also accused China in recent months of becoming more aggressive in enforcing its claims to essentially all of the South China Sea.</p>
              <p>The Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also staked claims to the Spratlys. AFP</p>

              <p><br><strong>Nope:</strong> Indians can keep them on hold for a while unless it becomes nuclear. But then Pakistan would join Chinese and Indians would loose. Others can make a difference in this game. Plus Americans and Russians would get in as well.</p>

              <p><strong>The outer triangle should comprise Japan, South Korea, and Australia, all American allies, along with India, the next great rising power in the region.</strong> The basic political and social values shared by these three countries, along with their commitment to global free trade, provide a common foundation for promoting democratic governance, civil society, and rule of law throughout the region. Each is involved with numerous countries, providing aid, concluding free-trade pacts, and sometimes doing joint military exercises. Most important, each is influential among its neighbors, so all four might take leadership roles in their immediate neighborhoods, in partnership with U.S. military forces. Washington should aim at a permanent high-level forum with these four liberal nations to discuss region-wide security issues, identify common threats and challenges, and pursue a common voice when possible in regional and international institutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While it might be easier initially to work with America's three current allies, no realistic diplomatic and security initiative is possible without India's participation. U.S. policy should encourage all four nations to commit to shaping regional political institutions in a liberal vein and to committing resources to uphold regional security both broadly and, more specifically, in their immediate areas. <strong>Working with the U.S., each should slowly expand the range of its maritime patrols, conduct larger and more regular military exercises, enhance and share intelligence, and work with smaller nations to encourage liberal development.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> </strong> While this outer triangle is focused on the grand strategy of the Indo-Pacific region, <strong>the U.S. should also build an inner triangle, focused on Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam.</strong> This triangle is centered on the lower South China Sea and, particularly, crucial sea lanes including the Malacca Strait, through which over 50,000 vessels and one-quarter of global trade passes every year, not to mention half of global oil shipments. This area is the hinge between the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans, linking together the two halves of the Indo-Pacific. These countries are strategically located, deeply involved in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), pressed by Chinese maritime territorial claims, economically crucial, and (with the exception of Vietnam) liberalizing in varying degrees...</p>

              <p>Tactics to surround used by both sides (and more effective by China). Eg India. China managed to surround India with Pakistan on the left (sold AEW, fighters and even gifted fighters until Pakistan now calls China an all-weather friend). China also has close relations with Bangladesh and Burma (in some cases, considered better than ASEAN). That effectively surrounded India and isolates Tibet from any secession potential.</p>
              <p>In the west, China has bond ties with SCO + north = Russia. That is very important due to oil pipelines.</p>
              <p>In both areas above, US has very little influence. It is only in the pacific rim that US has influence eg alliances with Japan, Korea, Philippines + Australia/NZ. Good military ties with ASEAN. TRA with Taiwan. The pacific rim unfortunately is where China territorial concerns are most at risk eg Taiwan &amp; South China Sea.</p>

              <p><br>A RSN mini carrier can possibly be more effective than a chinese CV. </p>
              <p>- if it operates stealth aircraft eg F-35B, this contrast with non-stealth J-15s.</p>
              <p>- F-35B will eventually be able to operate very long ranged weaponry eg 925 km ranged JASSM-ER missiles or 300km ranged JSM ie it can strike first with stealth missiles.</p>
              <p>- A vstol carrier can generate more sorties than a stobar and coordinate better with helos ie more efficient even if the chinese CV can carry twice as many aircraft.</p>
              <p>Having said that, there is no indication the RSN intends to get one. The F-35B is also at risk of being cut due to US cost pressures. And most important of all, Singapore does not own any territory claimed by China ie no reason to fight.</p>
