They use MD 500 and OH-58D Kiowas.<br><br>As for the Fennecs, my thoughts are that they could also serve as armed recon helos. US Army usually pair a Kiowa with either 1 or 2 Apaches. Of course the Kiowas have the mast mounted sight that can designate lasers for the Laser guided Hellfires fired from the Apaches.<br><br>On the other hand, the Australian Defense Force (Army) uses Kiowas for long range scouting missions.<br><br>The Fennecs still can play many roles, from recon, transport escorts, to special ops. I would however, first get ST Aero to interface the HeliTow system with Spike LR <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

It was working with the makers to solve the problem, officials said.<br><br>But defence sources said there were serious concerns that the debris could damage the main or tail rotors, causing the helicopter to crash.<br><br>The Army is buying 67 Apache helicopters at a cost of at least Â£27 million each. They are being built in Britain by Westland under licence from the US manufacturers Boeing.<br><br>The US has restricted its Apache helicopters to firing missiles only during wartime and to launching them only from the right-hand side of the aircraft to try to ensure that the debris does not hit the tail rotor which is on the left-hand side.<br><br>The WAH-64 Apache, which is due to take over the anti-tank role currently performed by about a quarter of the Army's Challenger 2 tanks in three years' time, normally carries a total of eight Hellfire missiles, four on each side.<br><br>The problem comes amid worrying signs from Afghanistan that the helicopter, which is seen as providing devastating frontline firepower, may not be as effective as was hoped, particularly in hot, dusty conditions.<br><br>Five out of the seven Apache attack helicopters sent to attack al-Qa'eda terrorists during Operation Anaconda two weeks ago were disabled by machinegun fire or ancient Soviet RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launchers fired from the ground.<br><br>The five helicopters had to be taken back to the US base at Bagram, north of Kabul, and replaced by new aircraft flown out from America.<br><br>Charles Heyman, editor of Jane's World Armies, said yesterday that there were also serious problems with sand and dust getting into the engines.<br><br>"In northern Europe you would expect to have around 90 per cent serviceability for these aircraft," he said. "But we are hearing reports that in Afghanistan it may be as low as 60 per cent."<br><br>The introduction of the Army Air Corp's first operational Apache squadron has already been delayed by at least eight months by software problems with the Full Mission simulator that will train the pilots.<br><br>The Apache problem is the latest in a series of embarrassing equipment problems to hit the forces. The SA-80 rifle had to be modified at a cost of Â£80 million after it consistently jammed on operations in Kosovo and Sierra Leone.<br><br>And the 12-year Bowman project to replace Army radio sets that dated back to the Falklands was abandoned 18 months ago. Soldiers operating in the Balkans were forced to use their mobile telephones to contact each other.<br><br>During the Kosovo campaign the RAF ran out of precision guided weapons that could bomb through clouds. </blockquote><a href="http://www.helis.com/news/2002/wah64debris.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.helis.com/news/2002/wah64debris.htm</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is clearly biased reporting...<br><br>the missile derbis thing has been cleared up after a defectively designed missile exaust ring which caused excessive derbis ejection had been replaced...<br><br>the rpg damage is also highly misleading, which helicopter in the world is supposed to be able to take hits from anti tank weapons? new or old? that thing is armored but it's no flying tank. any helicopter or aircraft will be in trouble when hit by an anti armor weapon, be it the spanking new AT-4 or WW2 Panzerfaust. What is remarkable about the apache is not that it was damaged by rpg fire, hardly surprising, but that it was survivable enough to take these hits and bring the crew back... what do those people who write these article want? A flying tank that shrugs off rpgs like an Abrams? Or prehaps they want to fly around in cheap tin cans that will come apart under RPG fire or rambo's exposive arrow?</div>
