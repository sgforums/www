              <h1>Victoria Cross hope for Marine who leaped on a grenade to save friends</h1>
              <p>A Royal Marine has been recommended for the Victoria Cross after he
              threw himself on to an exploding grenade to save the lives of his
              comrades. <br> <br> Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher stepped on a tripwire which triggered
              the grenade during a night raid on a Taliban compound in Afghanistan. <br> <br> He realised instantly that all four members of his patrol faced being killed by the blast. <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_01/croucherDM3003_468x551.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> Matthew Croucher insisted he must carry on fighting<br> <br> Instead of fleeing he deliberately smothered the explosion, twisting on to his back to let his rucksack take the full force.  <br> <br> The explosion hurled him across the compound leaving him stunned,
              bleeding from the nose and almost deaf, while kit from his shredded
              backpack was sent flying through the air in flames. <br> <br> But within minutes L Cpl Croucher, from Birmingham, was on his feet
              again and demanding to be allowed to continue the patrol. He even
              helped set an ambush - knowing that the Taliban would come and
              investigate the blast - and shot dead an armed insurgent during the
              subsequent firefight. <br> <br> Stunned by his bravery, the 24-year-old's comrades urged commanders to
              put him forward for Britain's highest honour for valour on the
              battlefield, and his citation will be considered by the armed forces
              honours and awards committee later this year. <br> <br> If a VC is awarded he will become only the third man to earn it since
              the Falklands Conflict 26 years ago - and the first surviving recipient
              from the war in Afghanistan. <br> <br> The incident happened during a pre- dawn raid last month when Marines
              from 40 Commando raided a suspected bomb-making factory close to the
              town of Sangin. <br> <br> As a team of four crept through the maze of mud-walled homes, L Cpl
              Croucher's foot brushed the trip-wire. He heard the distinctive click
              of the grenade's pin and spotted the device at his feet through his
              night-vision goggles. <br> <br> His colleagues barely had time to react to his yelled warning, and were
              still in the open when the grenade went off. By then he had thrown
              himself on to the grenade, pulling up his legs in the hope of avoiding
              fatal injuries. <br> <br> He recalled: 'I thought, "I've set this bloody thing off and I'm going to do whatever it takes to protect the others".  <br> <br> 'There have been a few times when they've saved my bacon. I figured
              that if I could keep my torso and head intact I'd probably survive -
              although I fully expected to lose a limb.' <br> <br> L Cpl Croucher told the News of the World: 'All I could hear was a loud
              ringing and the faint sound of people shouting, "Are you OK? Are you
              OK?" It took 30 seconds before I realised I was definitely not dead.' <br> <br> Senior officers stressed that the remarkable incident has been 'one
              among many' during 40 Commando's six-month tour of duty in Helmand
              Province. <br> <br> The unit is due to return to Britain shortly after months of often
              intense fighting, and will hand over to Paras from 16 Air Assault
              Brigade. <br> <br> Three years ago Private Johnson Beharry of the 1st Battalion the
              Princess of Wales Royal Regiment received the VC for saving comrades
              during two ambushes in southern Iraq. <br> <br> And in 2006 Corporal Bryan Budd, 29, of 3 Para, earned a posthumous VC
              for storming a Taliban machine gun post after he was injured in an
              ambush in Afghanistan. He killed several enemy but died in the process.
