            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Singapore's aggressive expansion of its coastal territory and its land reclamation policy have sparked problems with neighbors Indonesia and Malaysia. The issue has evolved into a two-pronged maritime border dispute.<br><br>Nipah Island, one of 83 border islands serving as points of reference for Indonesia's sea borders, is at the center of Singapore's current dispute with Jakarta. Nipah lies dead in front of the main reclamation work and is now almost submerged. Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Rokhmin Dahuri points out that if the island sinks completely the international boundary between Indonesia and Singapore will change - to Singapore's advantage.<br><br>Though the two countries have an existing agreement on marine territory, they have not yet settled their continental coastlines and economic exclusive zones (EEZs). The Convention on the Law of the Sea states that marine territory is measured based on the coastal base line. Jakarta is concerned that in the future, some Riau land could thus be claimed as Singapore's on the basis that if Singapore gets wider, its territorial line will also get wider</blockquote><a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/EG31Ae01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/EG31Ae01.html</a><br><br>I think not many people know about this dispute with Indonesia as there is hardly any media coverage on this as compared to the protests brought about by Malaysia on land reclamation in the Straits of Johore.<br><br>I think Singapore is one of the very few if not the only country in the world where the land mass of the country is constantly growing! And with that the EEZ also inceases as well! I hope someone can provide a map on what Singapore will look like in 10 years time based on government plans.<br><br>This creates a problem. Can we defend the land and waters which we have created at the end of all this land reclamation? Will this create a military conflict as both Malaysian and Indonesian intrests are at stake? Can we handle it? Comments please.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
