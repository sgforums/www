            <div class='col-md body'>I do understand the limitations of carbines,and thats their short range and their accuracy tends to drop at longer ranges compared to full-sized rifles..But that's not the whole picture here.You see the fact is that carbines i meantioned,are not entirely a seperate weapons system.The M16,M4 and Car-15 all accept the same magazines,the way it is cocked is the same,the way rate of fire is selected is the same,the way IAs are cleared is the same.The essential difference is the weapon length,the ability for the butt-stock to be extended or retracted and the handguard is rounded.</div>
