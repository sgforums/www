Not to mention you need to factor in special ammo types.<br>5.56 AP/Tracer, 40mm HE/Smk, 84mm RR rounds.<br></div></blockquote>*save me trouble*<br>So with the above post as an example, let us examine what different parts exist between a M16S1 and an M4 carbine.<br><br>Accordingly, the difference between<br>Models  614S and 720<br>are as follows.<br><br>Telescopic butt-stock.<br>Shorter barrel length.<br>Various other small teeny-tiny things.<br><br>But as it is, the two main difference mean that the armorers and storemen will have to maintain, fix, and indent an wholly different part stock than a unit which uses M16s.<br><br>Furthermore, if the unit uses a different weapon for drivers/service personnel such as the MP5k or FN P90, a wholly different ammunition stock and part stock will need to be maintain.<br><br>In simple mathematical terms.<br>To support one weapon = 1 $.<br>3 weapons = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.<br>That is 3 $.<br><br></div>
