            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,just wondering,if you have read why the shorterned or carbine versions of full-length Assault Rifles like M16,G36,M16A2,AK47 etc are developed.The manufacturer or designers  of these assault rifles/sub-machine guns are always quote that the purpose of haveing a carbine or SMG is to allow support troops like drivers,logistic personnel etc. to have a weapon capable of defending themselves and share the common rounds used by the general combat troopers.Like the CAR-15 and M4,when it first came on,they published a statement that these weapons are for troopers who require a full-calibre weapon but are unable to use the standard issue to the regular combat troops as they work in cram spaces and lack the luxury of space to house such a weapon,right?<br><br>But consider this,have you ever seen any driver or logistic personnel using/being equipped with a carbine?I have never seen lorz.Usually is either those recce troopers,infantry,guards,commandos,Armoured crews and SF personnel (NDU/SOF) right?So isn't it strange...the only people I see who sometimes use such weapons are those in SIW or Armourers...And those drivers,logistic personnel are often armed with the full-scale service weapon.Although they sometimes go out unarmed...so what do you think of these irony?It exists in all militaries in the world!!!</div>

But what you may not know is that most weapons used by the SWAT officers are really their own personal weapon bought with their own hard earn money.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>If you're wonderring why this is so, the reason is because of budget.  Different SWAT dept from different county or district, have different budget alocated.  On top of that, the budget is not just for the SWAT but for the whole police dept.  Meaning the budget has to be shared by te other depts within the precinct such as, Robbery &amp; Homicide, Anti-drug, Vice, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>As for the U.S military, they have a larger defence budget to spend on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

But he gets issued a full-size weapon.<br><br>The long and short of the whole supply thing is that...<br>One weapon = one system to support it.<br>Parts, ammunition, documentation, training, all that.<br>All this costs MONEY.<br><br>Two weapons = twice the cost.<br>And if it uses a different ammo, ammo resupply must be counted in also.<br>So consider this: a Platoon armed with 7.62mm MGs, 5.56mm rifles, 9mm/.45 pistols, 40mm GLs, assorted heavy support systems such as 84mm RR, 67mm LAW...<br><br>Requires SEVEN types of ammunition resupply.<br>These seven types of ammunition need to go through these processes.<br>Requistioning and purchasing.<br>Collating and packaging.<br>Indenting and sending.<br>Lastly, parceling them out to the troops as needed.<br><br>The strain is already hard enough on the poor storemen and armourers, do you think they want more? Not to mention you need to factor in special ammo types.<br>5.56 AP/Tracer, 40mm HE/Smk, 84mm RR rounds.<br><br>Isn't it ironic that at the end the Army asks for money from civilians?<br><br></div>
