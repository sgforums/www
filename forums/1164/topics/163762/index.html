            <div class='col-md body'>There is an article in the Straits Times yesterday about this. Their job is obviously intelligence gathering. But aren't their job done by the commandos? If i am not wrong one of the roles of the cdos is to infiltrate behind enemy lines to gather info.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what the newspaper say, this 1MI uses toys and have a peacetime role so while there are overlaps in intelligence gathering function with commandos, the form of this gathering differs.<br><br>For those who did not read the ST article -<br><br>Nov 17, 2005<br>SAF battlefield sleuths - hush hush no more<br><br>IF YOU attended this year's National Day Parade, or one of its rehearsals, chances are you were caught on film by intelligence gatherers from a new army unit.<br><br>Patrolling the crowds dressed in civilian clothing, more than 100 soldiers from the 1st Military Intelligence Battalion (1 MI Battalion) worked with the police and security agencies to secure the area around the Padang, using remote-controlled cameras.<br><br>The sensors they carried allowed them to send images to their headquarters instantly.<br><br>For the first time yesterday, this once hush-hush unit, formed on Oct 11 last year, showed off its suite of battlefield sensors to the media.<br><br>The 1 MI Battalion is the only unit whose sole job is information-gathering. Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Kuan, commanding officer of the battalion, said the unit was formed to support the intelligence requirements of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) during peacetime.<br><br>Its motto - First In - underlines its responsibility to be at the front line, even before a front line exists, to provide intelligence for the SAF. 'Until this battalion was formed, we didn't have the people to plan for and provide this capability,' Lt-Col Kuan said.<br><br>His unit works with the police to safeguard events that could be targeted by terrorists. The unit, based at Pasir Laba Camp in Jurong, also helps test sensors and concepts for gathering intelligence. And though it is an army unit, it operates sensors both on the ground and in the air.<br><br>The 4.5kg Sky Lark miniature unmanned aerial vehicle is one type of drone used by the unit. Operated by two soldiers, it has a camera for aerial surveillance up to 8km away, day or night. And its single propeller is powered by batteries, making it impossible to hear once it is in the air.<br></div>

We're going to use a lot of unmanned technology and imaging technology to pass more information, more accurately, quicker and faster back to headquarters for them to act on.<br>'At the same time we also increase the survivability of our scouts and recce<br>troopers because they can do all these things from a safe position ... instead<br>of exposing themselves to danger to report on the enemy.'<br>The battalion has more than 100 personnel, of whom more than 70 per cent are full-time national servicemen. One of the NSFs, Third Sergeant Cheng Wei Han, 19, a recce (or reconnaissance) specialist, said: 'We're at the vanguard of testing new information-gathering technology in the SAF. We experiment with<br>whatever new sensors or so-called toys that the defence scientists and<br>engineers develop to give them feedback so they can improve them.' - DAVID<br>BOEY.<br><br>I think the cam of this UAV can swing.</div>
