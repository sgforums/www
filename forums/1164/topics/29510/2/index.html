ITS america...<br><br>Forthly... malaysia's MRCA purchase may not produce the numbers that is truely capable of holding off a determned PLAAF assault... assuming that PLA has gain complete control of the entire south china sea and has establish a forward base at taipin island...<br><br>5th... there is nothing to be gained from attacking malaysia as far as PLA is concerned... either economical, military or politically...<br><br>6th... in a war of attrition... malaysia is guarantee to loose... as it could never hope to replace lost fighters and pilots as fast and as massively as china can...<br><br>The conditions for a war between malaysia and china just does not exist as yet.... under the current geopolitical climate...<br><br>For malaysia to think that china is a threat... is overestimating malaysia's defensive capability...  and against all logical analysis...<br><br>Thus... there are only 3 real threat to malaysia... THailand... indonesia... and singapore....<br><br>of the 3... singapore is the least threat to malaysia despite it having the most capable military of the 3... and unless attacked by MAF or forced diplomatically into a war... its safe to say.. singapore wont go to war for fun....<br><br>thailand's major security concerns are burma... not malaysia... even laos and cambodia outrank malaysia in terms of potential threat to the thais.... therefore... unless malaysia openly support thailands southern muslim separatist... its highly unlikely that the thais would start charging south (assuming a civilian govt is running the show)<br><br>indonesia... ... currently ok... but if indonesia break up.... god saves all of us...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  malaysia... east malaysia will be the first kenna shit  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br><br>a quick dig around about the number of Block 52 Vipers RSAF pretty much confirms Viper52's count:<br><br>See:<br><a href="http://www.lmaeronautics.com/products/combat_air/f-16/f16_customers.html#Singapor%5B/ur%5D&lt;br%20/&gt;&lt;br%20/&gt;%5Burl%5Dhttp://www.f-16.net/reference/users/f16_sg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lmaeronautics.com/products/combat_air/f-16/f16_customers.html#Singapor[/ur]<br><br>[url]http://www.f-16.net/reference/users/f16_sg.html</a><br><br>What most people missed in their count are the 12 Block 52 (leased) in 1996 in the Peace Cavin II deal. The lease was for 2 and a half year which would have expired in early 1999.  Given that RSAF has possesion of these aircraft still and training continuing at Luke AF base (where my cousin current is stationed - hee), it means Singapore had exercised the options to purchase and NOT returned them to Lockheed Martin.<br><br>Thus the count stands at<br><br>7   F-16 A/Bs (man, I cannot account for the 2 attrition aircraft that was supposed to be purchased to replaced the lose A viper in the mid-air collision)<br><br>18  1994 Peace Carvin 2<br>12  1996 Peace Carvin 2 (based in Luke AFB - leased for 2.5 years and option to purchase there after, still in RSAF hands =<br>RSAF exercised the option).<br>12   1997 Peace Carvin 3<br>20   2000<br>-1   Crashed by USAF.<br>---------------<br>68  Total<br>==========<br><br>BTW,  in my opinion, I would upgrade the A/B vipers with MLU and PW 220E engines to make them comptible with the C/D vipers. Can't sell them anyway since the Thai decided to purchase ex-USAF ones anyway. Sigh!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the 1996 deal is the most interesting one. The lease-to-buy deal was struck directly with LM and DOES NOT come under the Peace Carvin FMS sales program. Under US State/Defence Dept law, companies are allowed a certain amount of such non-FMS sales each fiscal year. So it is not called Peace Carvin II.<br><br>The Viper loss in May was a bird from this '96 batch. Source: AFM<br><br>From reports of foriegn plane-spotters, the Arizona and Luke detachments contain aircraft serials from all 3 batches (94-xxxx/96-xxxx/97-xxxx). An Aussie friend with the RAAF confirmed during Pitch Black the 5 Vipers that took part in Pitch Black 2002 also carried serials from ALL 3 batches.<br><br>Flight testing on the F-16 CFT program is quite advanced already, it has been offered for sale to export customers too I think.</div>

I believe RSN is heading towards that direction but I won't sure that A19 is a sure thing yet. Given RSN only recent purchased the Sjoormen class subs, the ownership cost of these subs plus buying new subs are just too much for the RSN budget, not to mention that RSN next focal point is the deployment and commission of the Delta frigates. It is reported that DSTA and Kockum are working on the details for a possible use of the Sterling AIP for a future class of submarines for the RSN, presumedly a Kockum or HDW design. So A19 or German U212 design are possibilities but at this point, I don't believe we are going to see any sub purchases.</div>
