            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, I have heard of some old US experiments in visual stealth... Appears that a plane wearing glossy paint and mounted with flourescent lighting can actually 'wink' out of visual sight!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>This seems to be the theory:<br>People see planes by spotting the shadow of it against the bright sky. Therefore, a plane that is brightly lit in natural colours can actually blend into the background!<br>Info on this is rather limited (can't find much), but it appears that US sub-hunters in WW2 achieved some surprises over surfaced U-boats using this system of lighting.<br><br>Anyone heard about this phenomenon?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanna add something to the F-16 numbers earlier on, there are only 2 F-16A with the RSAF now, sometimes used for Black Knight shows, other than the one lost, another one was taken over by Singapore Technologies as a demonstrator for their Falcon ONE upgrade program, so it should be 67 Falcons, if the information form earlier posts are correct,<br><br>however, this site here lists less than 30 falcons!!!<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/spyder355a/f16.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/spyder355a/f16.html</a><br><br>also, I heard that RSAF has 4 F-16 sqn, 67 planes in 4 sqn??<br>or are there more sqn??? i have no idea. . .<br><br><a href="http://www.scramble.nl/sgbase.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.scramble.nl/sgbase.htm</a><br><br>this website is even crazier, it lists<br>SIXTEEN F-16A<br>TEN F-16B<br>THIRTY-FIVE F-16C<br>FORTY-FIVE F-16D<br>thats a total of 106 F-16!!!<br><br>PLEASE CORRECT ME!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read the 1st website again carefully, its lists less than 30 *Singapore-based* Falcons. It also list the purchases for the 2 US-based squadrons. Even the order for 20 birds in 2000 is listed. Still adds up to 70 (minus 2 write offs) to me.<br><br>4 squadrons are technically correct:<br>2 local based<br>1 in New Mexico, US<br>1 in Arizona, US<br><br>The F-16A/Falcon One is leased to STAe, its still RSAF property.<br><br>As for Scramble's numbers, I would like to see their breakdown on a contract by contract basis, before deciding who's correct. Unless they included the leased Block 42s which have since been returned.<br><br></div>
