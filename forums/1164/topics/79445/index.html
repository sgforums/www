            <div class='col-md body'><br>I am a ex-NSF and used to serve in a Manpower Br, so i got to know too much about these things.<br><br>The officer corps in SAF is polarized among "scholars" and "farmers". Which is to say, you either enter with high qualifications, and rise fast, or enter with average qualifications and rise slow. Of course, promotion does count on performance. I knew an CPT who rose to his rank in 4 years. Inspirational?<br><br>I cannot answer about the Navy or the Air Force, but there does seem to be too much 2LTs and LTAs in the Army, so there are a lot of supernumary posts. (Project Offr anyone?)<br><br>In the SAF there is allowance for many things. Overseas posting is one. So... lets say your a Army offr, and your posted elsewhere for a year. You'd be rich.<br><br>Take it from a NSF, and one that had to lock up after too many officers who did overtime.<br>Your working hours is anything the unit requires you to.<br>If there's something important the next day, you'd better do it right now, and don't go home.<br><br>Your not exactly on call 24 hours per se, but.... as you rise in rank, and appointment, you WILL be on call 24 hours/7 days.<br>Im sure ex-NSFs would know... something called KAH.<br>If your a KAH, your every move must be documented, and it's a incident that needs to be reported to GSOC if your sick. Furthermore, if your a really important KAH, you may not go abroad if the other important KAH are abroad too.<br><br>Also.... the stress! The stress!<br><br>Here is a feedback that you may not know of. If your a female enlistee and you commit suicide, or any other chargeable offence, it's brushed over and your discharged.<br><br>Also.... suffice to say that .... you will be targeted by Wolfpacks, and shielded by Hunterkiller groups.<br><br>Every female in the SAF has "Property of SAF" emblazoned on them. Hands off!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Washer,<br><br>1.Officers who aren't scholars are less likely to be able to get very high up in terms of rank ?<br>Yep, scholar will have a good start, but for a degree holder and if can perform, no problem of going above major.<br><br>2. There are more young officers in the Army than in the Navy and Air Force so it's tougher to rise in the ranks ?<br>Well all depends. but air force have more role of female officers, so may have more chance.<br><br>3. The army is more physically challenging while the Air force and navy is more mentally challenging ?<br>All is the same, you will still have to survive the basic training and OCS ( both female version).<br><br>4. The pay in the navy is higher...<br>Air force pay is higher ?<br><br>5. ...but it's due to the allowance as most of the time is spent sailing<br>Yep, but is life on the sea for you ? unless you like the sea, don't sign up just because it pay better.<br><br>6. Will I be on call 24hours a day? How will my working hours/ schedule will be like?<br>Yes, expect sometime you be on call. Working hr and schedule all depend on your assign role ( sometime beyond your control).<br><br>7. How much time will I spent sailing? Will the time I spend sailing slowly be cut down as the years go by?<br>You may not need to sail at all. All depend on your assign role. Even need to sail, after a few years can request for transfer to more of base or desk job.<br><br>Washer, think you must first of all ask what is your interest! Strange but your question seem to be more focus on promotion, pay and time. Forget about the rank, pay and time, if you are too focus on that, you are not going to make a good officer and everyone is going to give you a shit time. Seriously consider, what your interest is, and whether your interest is in army, navy or air force.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Navy pays more? well, it is indeed to compensate for the sailing...<br>Concerning sailing, it depends on which platform/class of ship u are in.... and to an extent of which ship....<br>Usu MCVs and MGBs sails less where as the APVs n PVs are the workhorses of the navy... Which means they sails most of the time... MCV n MGB goes for Ops/Exercise, PV goes for patrol while APV(All Purpose Vessel <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) goes for Exercise and Patrol... So which ship u are posted to, greatly affect how much sailing u r subjected to.... But I think MGB and MCV is not available for female personnel due to accomodation problems...<br>Female can goes to APV/PV, LST, MCMV... LST and MCMV are cool... MCMV and LST are not bad too... Accomodation is the best on these 2... Sailing wise also...<br><br>Talking about whether the higher rank u get, the less sailing u have is not true... Usu on your tour of duty or ur career in navy, u will be post to ship and also have some stint at shore units like maintenance base, MSD, Gombak... But the initail years when u r junior usu u will be with ship which means sailing unless u are medically unfit...<br><br></div>

I am prepared (and in fact look forward ) to go sailing for weeks but as long as I am able to spend time with my family when I am back in Singapore.
