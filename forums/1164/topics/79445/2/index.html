            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,..<br><br>i'm just a regular guy working in the force for about 6 yrs. i have my fair share of the ups and downs. after reading the postings here, especially some really enthusiastic about military life and yearning to work there, i'm just wondering, if having know the kind of environment we are in, had we in the first place still choose to join? i know there are people who are involuntary 'forced' by their circumstances to join.<br><br>No offense to any one here, i'm just curious, especially for those already in the force for some years, are they discouraged by their work, will they discourage others outside, will they want to get out as soon as possible, or very simply, they never regret the kind of decision they make before joining.</div>

Your experience gained in the navy, airforce or army will not be applicable commercially outside should you want to change jobs.<br><br>2) Taking orders, remember, you have to take order from superirior. if he or she is an "As****e" , you will be in for a tough time for a long time.<br><br>3) You will under a term contract for a few years. Be prepared!<br><br>4) As for Navy, you got to like the sea, outdoor life, sun and lots of crocodiles on the ship.<br><br>remember, unlike 'land jobs' you cannot take urgent leave to do something important.<br><br>you will be dark from the sun, cut off from most of your friends and family most of the time.<br><br>I have alot of navy friends, they make alot of sacrificers.<br><br></div>

However, theres 1 question that I hope she had asked herself before looking into the service of the military &amp; that question is, why is she looking into a career in the military?  Why not the police force?<br><br>Do take into account the former trainee officer on the RSN COURAGEOUS.  As CJ Young Pang How said ( summarize version ), as an officer in the military regardless of whether you are undergoing trainning, your actions &amp; decessions must always be accountable for( heavy burdern ).<br><br>And remember that even though SAF is just trainning for war in peace-time, the whole world is covertly at war with terrorism.  Meaning that as a military personel/ officer, you stand a chance to put your trainning to work.</div>
