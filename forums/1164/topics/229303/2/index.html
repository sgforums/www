Where's your finger pointing?<br><br>Your comment is an implication on the discipline of the troop and his organisation.  It is also an implication of their accounting system at the ammo dump for weapons and explosives.  On top of that, it a contravention of the agreed terms of use of SWBTA and if it's the SAF fault could result in restriction on further use of the facility ... not good for us and most certainly not good for the local commercial enterprises that have grown around us.<br><br>I wouldn't have jumped on ya except for your comment above <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Don't get me wrong,I'd love for it all to be found to be a huge mistake,where no-one is entirely blamed,certainly not the SAF.At first I didn't even believe it could of been SAF issue,it doesn't seem right for it to of happened.But it has happened,and now I'm sure it will never happen again.No matter who was at fault,there are always mistakes made,but once they are made,people learn from them.Don't worry,it doesn't matter who's fault it ends up being,the media will cover it int he same way,whether SAF's fault or PIQ's.There will be no favouring anyone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </strong></blockquote>I'll agree with the rest of what you're saying <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I got it from the email response from the Singapore Ministry of Defence (Mindef), cut and pasted it directly for the story.<br><br>It's wrong. The correct name is Primary Industries, as you pointed out.<br><br>I checked with Mindef yesterday (Tues Jan 16) after I read your posting (haven't been here for awhile) and Mindef said there was a typo in their response.<br><br>I suppose this is the approach wikipedia has taken in their fact checks.<br><br>I'll buy you a cold one next time I'm in your neck of the woods.</div>

Having used Matadors around would not contribute to the crime rate... and I seriously doubt they would be useful in a robbery given their size and weight and how much they slow down the user and leave him vulnerable to REAL small arms. The suspicious black bag that contains a "bomb" would work a lot better.<br><br>It boils down to human stupidity, airsoft can be abused in many ways as well but it's up to the inividual to be responsible about it. In Singapore they take a lot of this responsiblity away by passing laws to make up much of our choices for us, but I think this shouldn't be the case in other countries.<br><br><blockquote><br>But military surplus you can pick up in Singapore does not include weapons or munitions or even parts thereof ... ?<br><br>Anyway, the git should have applied for his license pronto as IINM he wanted it for his theatre group?<br><br>"Only armourers, theatre groups and other legitimate persons who applied for a replica permit were permitted to hold the weapons." </blockquote>I won't say much about this, but just go sniffing around and you will be very surprised by what you can find and what some people sell at the flea markets.<br><br>But yeah, that git really ought to have applied for a permit... or at least kept it under wraps instead of waving it around.</div>
