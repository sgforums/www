            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys......I live in Rockhampton...and I also work for the local logistics group that supplies everything for the SAF when on exercise at SWBTA.....as you may know,the company is called P.I.Q.  The refusal dump where this "weapon" was found is actually in the town of Yeppoon,approximately 1 hours drive from the nearest SWBTA entrance. I highly doubt this "weapon" would be SAF equipment.....as it is illegal to remove any SAF weapons or weapon meterial from SWBTA. And considering the size of the material....it would be impossible for any member of staff to remove it from SWBTA without being noticed. Yes, all used,discarded,weapon material is supposed to be left at the ammo dump, closest to each camp at SWBTA. I highly doubt that any member of the SAF would have any reason,or even want to remove the material from SWBTA either. I have personally seen what happens to all material left at the ammo dump at the end of exercise,and I can telly ou it alol gets packaged up,wrapped in plastic wrap,and shipped to the proper disposal place,as far as I know,taken care of by the A.D.F.<br><br>I just want to say, a lot of Australians like to collect military materail,and to someone of that description,which whoever the person is that had this item before dumping it,may of had it in their possession for quite some time.This type of material would most likely be quite a find for them.How someone has come across this item,I cannot say.....but rest assured the authorities willl find out it's origin.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From The Straits Times, Wednesday 10 Jan 2007, H5<br><br><blockquote>(excerpt from "Used SAF Launcher sold at Aussie recycling Centre" by David Boey)<br><br>Mindef's investigation so far showed that the used launcher belonged to a batch that was formally handed over to the local Australian contractor, Private Industries (Queensland) Private Limited.<br><br>Col Lim said the company "was engaged by the SAF to carry out the proper disposal of used military items in compliance with Australian regulations and laws"<br><br>He said equipment to be disposed "would have been crushed or cut up, to ensure the original shape is not retained, before being transported out of Shoalwater Bay Training Area for disposal".<br><br>He added: "The SAF takes a serious view of the fact that there was a failure to ensure proper disposal in this instance.  We are also reviewing and tightening up the system to ensure that the materials used in training are properly disposed of by our contractor, in lines with our requirements as well as with Australian regulations."</blockquote>which means to say SAF did dispose of the items properly but most probably did not exercise due diligence in auditing.<br><br>Which now begs the following questions ...<br><br>1) Is the Oz contractor going to claim that he sub-contracted the disposal to the recycling centre and that they didn't do it properly?<br><br>2) Why wasn't there a MINDEF/SAF personnel onsite to verify the destruction? If there was, was that person on a canteen break? Where I'm coming from is that commercially when my company sent "sensitive" documents to a commercial shredding company, we would have someone witness the actual destruction and would also receive a certificate of disposal. Will the review and tightening up of the system now include this then?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for one.....thast article is stupid......he didn't even get the company's name right....and he does not know much about the situation because the discarded items are not crushed/destroyed at Shoalwater Bay,they never have been.like i said earlier,they are packed on pallets,plastic wrapped,and shipped to wherever the proper disposal place is.maybe they are crushed before disposal,but not at Shoalwater Bay they aren't.the reason it is believed that it was inproperly dumped in a rubbish bin is because the ammo dump is at camp growl.....which is on the otherside of Shoalwater Bay to where this launcher was found.it was found in yeppoon,the closest camp at Shoalwater Bay from there is sam hill....an hour and a half away.camp growl is 2 and a half to 3 hours from yeppoon.</div>

Again as I mentioned, there exist a possibility that P.I.Q sub-contracted out their part of the contract.<br><br>IF the contractor did not properly crush/destroy the items before removal from SWBTA then that will be a fault on their part.  The blame will also partly lie with the SAF for not observing due process of auditing proper compliance.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ozzy_gurl:</div><div class="quote_body">But as far as we can tell,it seems to be the initial mistake of one of the troops,who has been too lazy to send it to ammo dump,but instead has disposed of it in a rubbish bin</div></blockquote>I find this scenario kinda hard to imagine.  Accounting of ammunition in SAF training in Singapore is relatively strict.  It requires that all expended ammo be returned to the Ammo Dump.  This includes parts of expended items such as grenade safety rings.  While the accounting for small and voluminous items like 5.56 empty casing may have a margin for error, there is little to no margin for error for larger items, esp. expended tube launchers.<br><br>I doubt that the SAF will implement a different system from what they normally operate from, unless the armoury in question in SWBTA is not operate by the SAF ...<br><br><blockquote><strong>for one.....thast article is stupid......he didn't even get the company's name right...</strong></blockquote>easy there gurl ... you never know who's who in forums. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Out of curiousity ... what is the correct company name?</div>

It is not such a big deal here as it is to you guys apparently. It is being looked inot at work,and will be dealt with. Im not saying it's completely at fault by the SAF,it quite obviously wasn't noticed by contracting staff either.Don't get me wrong,I'd love for it all to be found to be a huge mistake,where no-one is entirely blamed,certainly not the SAF.At first I didn't even believe it could of been SAF issue,it doesn't seem right for it to of happened.But it has happened,and now I'm sure it will never happen again.No matter who was at fault,there are always mistakes made,but once they are made,people learn from them.Don't worry,it doesn't matter who's fault it ends up being,the media will cover it int he same way,whether SAF's fault or PIQ's.There will be no favouring anyone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
