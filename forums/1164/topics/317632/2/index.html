              <p>It seems that the PLA Air Force is still technologically weak in terms of the latest electronic suites that are nearly standard with most western makes of aircrafts that allow 'All Weather Operation'.</p>
              <p>Cockpit instrumentation in all  the latest aircraft types would have allowed for flight in bad weather - that include flying through cloud or fog.</p>
              <p>For military helicopter operation, the basic cockpit instrumentation that include digital map, GPS, inertial reference unit, Doppler radar, attitude and heading reference system - will probably help the PLA  to overcome the present difficulties encountered.</p>
              <p>Concerning the use of RSAF Chinooks to assist the DART team in the rescue efforts in China, it is unlikely that it can be done without the approval from the US Government.</p>
              <p>Under the Rules of Purchase between the US and Singapore Governments, it would have precluded the use of the RSAF Chinooks to operate in territories that are considered a threat to US interests.</p>

              <p>intergrating technology with people and usage of equipment sometime goes into planning as well. And it takes an understanding of how it can work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had involved in labor intensive industry between SG and PRC. I can see the different management in implementing and managing a process and using technology to managed factory compare to Chinese base mgt preference of using human skills.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is kind of surprise that with the huge defence budget we now see that support equipment was not considered.   </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Basically every earthquake rescue is the same, before any human rescue is concluded, you have to basically use hand or light hand hold equipments to do the jobs. Even though, the earthquake has essentially whipped out the only road linking inside the affected area. Which means heavy equipments are difficult to be moved in in time. As most posters have already pointed out, the airlifting is initially huddled by the poor weather and the mountainous terrain, would you blunt enough here to tell us, pilot a Helo above the sea surface is exactly the same in a hilly and windy terrain with poor visibility?</span></p>

              <p>well ,u want me to be blunt ,  as a non-pilot , and my limited knowledge aerodynamics and almost no knowledge in the mechanics of piloting a Helicopter,I have to say that ,  to pilot a Helo above the  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">the sea surface is NOT exactly the same in
                  a hilly and windy terrain with poor visibility? Cause one is on sea , the other is in a hilly and windy terrain with poor visibility. lol. Unless the sea is windy with poor visibility too. anyways.. its not easy and safe in both situations<br></span></p>

              <p>Not necessarily-- IIRC, during that period they were using China as a foil against the Soviet Union, and so such a sales would improve US-Chinese relations. It has nothing to do with a strong China or a weak China, rather it is whether selling such weapons would advance their national interests or not. If China was pro-US now, I'm sure the US would be doing all it could to sell weapons to it to suppress the resurgent Russians and North Korea. It's just real-politik.</p>

              <h1>Mercury retrograde</h1>
              <h3><em>May 26 - June 19, 2008</em></h3>
              <p>Here we go again... Mercury goes retrograde once again. It happens 3
              times a year and it lasts for about 3 weeks. This time is from May 27
              to June 19, 2008. Then from September 24 to October 15, 2008 and then
              from January 11, 2009 to February 1, 2009.</p>
              <p>Stationing degrees: 21Gem32 and 12Gem58. Watch carefully how the
              stationing of Mercury at these degrees influences your natal chart in
              order to understand the personalized impact on your life.</p>
              <p>This is an important period, and we should be aware of the effects
              associated with this astrological influence. Since it is so often, we
              must learn what it means and how to take advantage of it.</p>
              <h3>Astronomical background</h3>
              <p>There is no real backwards movement of Mercury; it's just that we
              see it this way from Earth, because of the combined movement of the
              Earth and Mercury around the Sun. However, astrologically this is very
              relevant.</p>
              <h3>General influence of Mercury retrograde</h3>
              <p>Mercury rules over the mind's processes, studying, communication,
              businesses, travels and the like. When Mercury reverses its direction,
              all these areas are affected as well.</p>
              <p>The mind turns naturally inwards and people tend to analyze more the
              own thoughts and follow the common thinking patterns, rather then be
              curious and eager of new intellectual experiences or challenges. This
              helps the meditation or the thorough lonely long-term study of a
              specific matter, but it affects the study of new subjects, the
              communication with the others, the attention oriented outwards.</p>
              <p>Businesses, travels and communications tend to experience delays and
              different problems. Computers and other processes that work with
              information may experience crashes, unexpected failures.</p>
              <p>Don't enroll to courses, don't buy expensive Mercurian items (books,
              cars, mobile phones etc.), don't sign important contracts and do not
              marry.</p>
              <h3>What is this Mercury retrograde period good for?</h3>
              <p>It is definitely a very good period for some actions. No time is
              completely bad for anything, there is a reason in everything happens.</p>
              <p>The key is the reversed direction of movement: take any known
              Mercurian action, reverse its flow, consider the keywords "re-doing
              something", "double-checking", "finish the old projects" and there you
              are, you've found the good side of Mercury retrograde.</p>
              <p>For instance, you may want to read again a book you particularly
              liked, a subject you studied before, meet and discuss with old friends
              you haven't met for a long time, travel to places you've already been
              to before.</p>
              <p>This is an excellent time to work on old projects that never got to
              be finished. So, think about the things you started and never finalized.</p>
              <p>Next, you might wish to prevent any bad things to happen to you: so
              double-check your agenda, call your business partners to confirm that
              everything goes as planned, have everything ready before the deadline
              and leave some extra time for unexpected events. Make copies of your
              important files and documents, save your work more often.</p>
              <p>The other solution is to go on vacation or at least slow down the
              pace of your projects. You will find that going slowly during the
              Mercury retrograde period will spare you many efforts of redoing the
              same action that wasn't performed right the first time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Above all, be generous and compassionate: you are already aware
              about the influence of this period, but the others aren't aware of it
              or there may be uncontrollable events. That's why you should have more
              diligence with the others and give them some more time. It'll be your
              mental health that you'll be sparing actually.</p>
