              <p>The People’s Liberation Army is being forced to walk long distance to reach disaster sites. It is in time of crisis are we able to see soldiers being put into real test.</p>
              <p>In Dujiangyan city, <strong>50 kilometres</strong> from the Sichuan capital of Chengdu, 80 per cent of the buildings imploded, corpses were strewn on the streets and dazed residents were taking what they could carry and walking out of town to a “refugee” camp set up on the outskirts.</p>
              <p>More than 50,000 troops joined disaster relief efforts or were moving into the area.</p>
              <p>CAN our very own SAF soldiers cover such distance and perform relief task efficiency? or just complaint!</p>

              <p><br>heli-ops was reported to be risky due to the weather leh. thats why they are walking. and they only heli for severely injured victims. i think the PLA is fine. they sure are solid. they arent poorly equipped. today's china is a force to be reckoned with. i'm into the SAF, yet i haf to say china is much more powerful than we r if not as efficient. china's technology is advance. so much so tt the americans fear them. in a situation like tt in chengdu, its really impossible to heli-ops or clear the road. debris is everywhere, disrupting even roads. and its not one portion of debris. its the entire road being covered with huge chunks of debris. no engineer will be able to quickly remove them all. imagine the entire singapore suddenly implode...den to make things worse, the weather gets all stormy and cold.</p>

              <p>Actually this disaster shows a severe weak point in the chinese armed forces.</p>
              <p>A severe lack of rotary air lifting capability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only bird they have strong enough to climb up the mountain regions are 20 year old blackhawks which were bought before the US embargo.</p>
              <p>As a result, soldiers have to hike 90+ kilometres in mountainous region for 21 hours just to reach the area.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although we can see how fast they can mobilise and i think agencies around the world should learn, especially the US when you compare the katrina response but however, different political systems were in place and i think we shall leave that for debate another day.</p>
              <p>The fact is we also get to see those poorly equip units. Those that wear tennis shoes with number 4 uniform. Although rapidly moving forward, large chunks of the armed forces are still back in time in terms of standard equipment.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I guess it has something to do the reality, when everything that links to the outside world is cut off. And Copters are impossible to land in a mountainous terrain during storm with poor visibility and strong wind, and walk by foot will take number of days and can bring little heavy equipments, the Parachuting maybe the last resort. A small number of paratroopers may risk their lives, but can bring in the necessary communication equipments into the epicenter and feedback the 1<sup>st</sup> hand info of the isolated area soonest.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Furthermore, those elite paratroopers can later provide ground guidance to the Helicopter landing in the later stage at bad weather and complicated terrain.</span></p>

              <p><br>PLA Army Aviation got 2 dozens of S-70 Black hawks since 1980s, 20 belived still functional. As a matter of fact, the 1st copter landing in Wenchuan, the isolated area was done by the blackhawk, yet another impressive performance by the blackhawk:</p>

              <p>I was thinking maybe they can do heli rappling? Then drop supplies from the copters down to the epic center..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>Then they can also set up temp aid stations or hospital using the uber big tent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was thinking if they could use motorbikes.. like you know those scramblers... just maybe 1 bike and 1 soilder with medical supply and food and water? No idea leh..</p>

              <p>Actually... for 130,000 troops mobilized.... which is what i got a saw on the web... there is only 110 helicopters... something on another posters...which is a very lousy ratio...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am not saying the SAF is better then the PLA... please! it is like saying an ant is stronger then an elephant!...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but the PLA is suppose to be modernized.... and become a '3G' type army with modern equipment... but from the soldier hiking article, it is largely still a "foot" army... with 'leg' infantry....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe only a very very small elite force is heli-capable.... the rest are still 'leg' infantry or 'motorized' only.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think probably the 101st Air assualt division will have more heli-lift then the entire 'rescue' effort.... of 110 copters...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another likelihood is that the central govt is not really mobilizing all their forces... and is reserving their strategic reserve for other contingencies....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I doubt the chinese govt will 'accept' help in the form of Chinook helicopters from sgp or any other govt.. it will be a loss of 'face'...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>actually, you can see the US, Indian or Russian military planners... to see how crippled the PLA is when the roads are destroyed.... what they have on their mind...</p>
