Is this part of the side effects as mentioned by the doctor before the LASIK? Or is it unexpected such as a result of a complication or botched job?

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, on the subject of specs, in my years in NS and the reserves, I never got my specs broken. Only once did I drop my glasses on the Pasir Laba parade square ( this was not because of training but rather I took them off to wipe them and drop them by accident  ..hahaha careless me !). Even then, there was only a small chip to a corner of the lens.<br><br>I have been doing various things with the specs on... river crossing and swimming, heli- rappeling etc etc.  Only a few times I have used one of those straps to secure the spectacles, e.g. during assualt boat training . Most of the time I carried a spare in my backpack.<br><br>The only time I never had specs on was sparring during unarmed combat training.  But I still "beat" my buddy in the 5 minute sparring session !<br><br>The only time I was inconvenienced by specs was during very humid nights in the jungle and the lens fogged up everytime I took a deep breath. But that happen once in awhile.<br><br>For those going to train in Australia or Thailand , or where the environment is really dusty... the good practice is to clean your multi coated hi -index lens is to flush them with a bit of water first, then apply a very dilute soap mixture and wash them under a tap. Do not wipe dry with a tissue but use a tissue and just sponge off the water. Because if you don't, which I learnt by trial and error, you will get many tiny scratches on your multi coating.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Training is different from real combat.  Did you ever get blood, mud,  debris,  from hits and near misses from bullets , shrapnel &amp; explosive detonation splattered on your glasses when you are sweating profusely, tearing ( from smoke and haze ) &amp; deaf when your heart is racing at 100 mph in a shooting war ? I have not, but I guess it will have a marked effect on my glasses when in the combat zone.</div>
