Firstly , these terrorists are just using Islam as a medium of spreading their influence throughout the world and mislead the world into thinking that Islam approve of brutality , killing of innocent civilians and instilling fear into hearts and minds of the people of the world . Islamic scholars all around the world have unanimously criticised the terrorists' acts done by Al-Qaeda and other terrorist factions around the world and asked them to return to the straight path as they have sinned ,. If any of you read about the Islamic civilizations in the ancient times , Islamic rulers have always been tolerant of non-muslims staying in the lands in which the muslims have conquered . The non-muslims are free to worship what they believe in and they do not kill non-muslims without any reason . This is why the world needs to realise that these terrorists are not muslims .<br><br>About the killing of the terrorist by shooting them using bullets rubbed with pigs' blood and fat , i just think that this is a not-so-brilliantly thought of idea there is . By doing this , the terrorist factions will just want to retaliate and kill more innocent civillians in which these civilians have no say in the way of killing these terrorists . We muslims CAN touch or eat a pig in conditions when we really need to . Nobody decides whether he or she goes to heaven or not but god .</div>

The Islamic scholars all around the world (esp. from Middle-East) , condemn the suicide bombings and killing of innocent civilians by Al-Qaeda and other terrorist faction . The muslims look up to these scholars as they are there to replace the caliphs to lead the muslim people .

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry it have to be this long.<br><br>One can have plenty of reasons for not 'enlisting' and yet can remain sympathetic to the cause of an organization. I do thing one can do much more damage by keeping quite than by picking up an assault rifle.<br><br>And if you're talking about condemnations, it's been awfully quite in the papers. The pictures of celebrating Palestinians after 9/11 were some contradiction. And some of Arab's editorial staff was not sorry to see the beheading, saying it's payback for Abu Garib.<br><br>If by division in religion you meant the occult, where the teachings of a religion was twisted to suite one's purpose, then of course there are examples aplenty. However, to re-interpret a religion in such a way as to encourage mass killings and indiscriminate killings, no I've not really read any. Unless you're talking about the Middle Ages, then yes. And these Muslims are the lost souls, as you have asserted, then anyone who failed to correct such wayward thinking have to share the blame. How can they know of such a sickness and not do anything to correct it? If there are lawyers out there, do we call such persons accessory to murder in a homicide case?<br><br>For the claim of Zionist lobbyist have excessive influence in America, maybe it's true or maybe it's not. Repeating it umpteen times in the mainstream media does not make it true. It might be Holocaust guilt or, more likely money, but it seem to be take as the gospel truth without any prove. Maybe you can try reading a piece in the ST and have a second opinion. I know it's Shit Times, but still, some things are worth spending your 10minutes for.<br><br>Insufficient media coverage on Palestinian's sufferings? Remember the killing of the boy and his father in the crossfire? It was captured and broadcast to the world. And if you watch western documentaries enough, there are actually a rather reasonable amount of Palestinian footages. Funny how people's memory suffers and can blame and applause the same tool in a similar situation. And it's my belief that there can never be objective coverage in any given situation, unless you're an ET.<br><br>Terrorism: the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion; terrorist: adjective or noun. With this definition, how can one call an organization anything else if its modus operadi is terror?<br>They hijack planes (Hamas split from PLO, I think), blow up planes, kill hostages etc. And the label terrorist has been used since the 80s, when the shooting started. They might be your freedom fighters but the fact remains that the kill innocent and engage in undeclared combat and is from irregular outfit. Any even if you're from regular outfit in declared war, the belligerent can execute summarily if they caught enemy soldier, in plain cloths behind their line. (remember the Saigon police killing the NVA spy in Vietnam War). Incidentally, there are also footages of hostage killing, hijacking and beheading, if you're interested.<br><br>You seems to imply, near the end of your posting, that it's okay to retaliate, even if you use terror means and your avow purpose is to destroy a nation state that is created by the UN, when said state seek your destruction by playing your own game. It means you see yourself as morally right and can, therefore, play outside the rule where the UN created state have to play by rules of conventional combat sit there and take it? Maybe you can explain it better but my logic certainly can't. Disparity in armaments is no reason to slaughter civilians. If that's the case, maybe we can raise Gandhi and let him arbitrage. In any case, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh should not be around. And I think is childish and non-constructive to say one can do no wrong as long as one walk around with a big stick.<br><br>I think we can agree that to get out of the current situation, the Middle East problem will at least have to be iron out to deny ammunition to the terrorist. And let not engage in word play, too, because they truly are terrorist. I would further suggest that one should not be blind to the real problem by embracing the Muslim Brotherhood concept. One should be rational and not clouded by emotion when faced with an emotive issue. Easier said than done, but will have to be done nonetheless. And one should also remember one's national allegiance and geographical peculiarities. One can only fulfilled one's religious obligations when one national obligation is place in the first place. Maybe Islam has similar teachings. I stand corrected.<br><br>Just a thought, do they Muslim executioners utter prayers, as they do when they slaughter livestock, when they killed the hostages?<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Let me tell you something , if many or most of us believed that they are matyrs , we would have gone to "enlist" ourselves .

We can show what these people really are behind the videotapes they sent out.

These terrorists who kills innocent civilians (not the teachings of islam) would not enter heaven even if they die naturally . What political ? .
