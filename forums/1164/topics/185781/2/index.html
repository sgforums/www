This is my heartfelt stand.Why so?Believe it or not, Singapore is like Taiwan, held to the world by international law, the only difference being actualised independance versus de jure independance in a disputed status of negated sovereignty.Should China be allowed to retake Taiwan unilaterally, it will open up a can of worms in the international arena, and lead to a dangerous precedent of historical claims by larger nations over smaller, current autonomous/independant territories.<br><br>Even if Singapore is not under threat of this scenario, do we have the diplomatic gumption or ammunition to even support this course of Action?Logic will dictate we will oppose such an action when push comes to shove.The new UN regime is more interventionist, and there is a serious need for greater global cooperation against unilateral action against a democratically elected government of a territory without legitimate claim of self-defense.<br><br>Yeah sure, self-defense against a future rallying declaration of independance.In any case, before they determine their status of sovereignty, there's still that niggling matter of a armstice to be signed and civil war ceased.The amount of goodwill that PRC would inevitably get in the international arena should they renounce the unilateral use of force as a first response against peaceful Taiwanese independance, is worth more than the bloodshed that any war or pre-emptive occupation will surely bring.<br><br>Common sense and brotherhood through peace and choice should be allowed their day in the sun, not just force.<br><br>So, should we stomach another repeat of the Timorese annexation?I think not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Well, first of all, only about 65% of the intervention is about communism.<br><br>2) If International Law is concern, Taiwan cannot declare independence.. that itself is a provocation to China. Then again as I say They are still in Civil War.<br><br>3) Should China retake Taiwan unilaterally, situation as you describe is different from that around. Name another nation which has this situation.<br><br>4) Taiwan is not defenseless at all....<br><br><blockquote>The amount of goodwill that PRC would inevitably get in the international arena should they renounce the unilateral use of force as a first response against peaceful Taiwanese independance, is worth more than the bloodshed that any war or pre-emptive occupation will surely bring.</blockquote>Initial goodwill to PRC will be as good as it last.

Most military novels revolve around the invasion of taiwan and nothing is said about the negative effect( other than china loss) like the economy of east asia or USA itself.<br><br>They view taiwan indepedence as a good thing, as it would mean democracy can withstand against communism. Some view that almost all countries will support the idea, like NATO.<br><br>They hardly had a idea about the Pan-blue party of taiwan and most of them thought the whole of taiwan support indepedence. I hate it how they love to play the situation  as a basic of their story.<br><br>I've heard a worst part, saying that taiwan should join USA as a state and hence given full protection by the US military.<br><br>Do you agree?</div></blockquote>I absolutely agree with u when u said that most westerners have little idea about reality of the straits. Western media always love to cite Taiwan as a role model for China to follow but ever since Ah Bian came to power, everything is going downhill for Taiwan( I do mean everything). Taiwan's economy is shrinking and unemployment rate is soaring. As a result, crime rate is also skyrocketing. Read here:<br><br>http://th.gio.gov.tw/show.cfm?news_id=8615<br><br>High unemployment rate also resulted in high suicide rate:<br><br>http://www.asianpacificpost.com/portal2/4028818208a0ac650108c0e0bbc5010f_Credit_card_slaves_turn_to_suicide_and_crime.do.html<br><br>As a result, more and more Taiwanese are losing confidence in the current administration and are migrating elsewhere. Mainland China, Canada, Australia and the USA are the favourite destinations for emigrating taiwanese. Here's an article about Taiwanese migrating to Shanghai:<br><br>http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A14284-2001Apr27?language=printer<br><br>The Taiwanese have more confidence in mainland china than their own country and would rather migrate there instead.<br><br></div>
