            <div class='col-md body'>In most westerners mindset, they have hardly a single clue about what is really going on in the straits and what harm it will cause. Most military novels revolve around the invasion of taiwan and nothing is said about the negative effect( other than china loss) like the economy of east asia or USA itself.<br><br>They view taiwan indepedence as a good thing, as it would mean democracy can withstand against communism. Some view that almost all countries will support the idea, like NATO.<br><br>They hardly had a idea about the Pan-blue party of taiwan and most of them thought the whole of taiwan support indepedence. I hate it how they love to play the situation  as a basic of their story.<br><br>I've heard a worst part, saying that taiwan should join USA as a state and hence given full protection by the US military.<br><br>Do you agree?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And your point is that we should cheer happily that a state that has been de facto independant, should be given back to a larger entity that has no claim over this?<br><br>Sorry.I'm not an American, but the facts tell me that Taiwan should remain as it is.If they want to reunify, it should be of their own choice, NOT China's decision.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at the history of Taiwan, u should know that Taiwan was a land that was ceded to the Dutch during the Ming dynasty. China still have a claim over Taiwan based on the historical roots and therefore entitled over taiwan.<br>The British return Hong Kong back to China because they can deny the historical roots that China has.<br><br>While the western looks at Taiwan, they will have the same mindset over the rule of China over Taiwan as what China has over Hong Kong.<br>Basically, the Amercian cannot do anything if China wants to regain Taiwan.<br>It is only a matter of time. China is a domineering force which will overtake Amercian in the next few years. America greatest enemy at the moment is not China but Terrorism. You can observe that terrorism have not set it feet on chinese ground because it is a country where terrorism is not be tolerated.<br><br>Btw, Taiwanese are still chinese. You can deny the fact that when a war breaks out between America and China, where will they stand. The answer is quite obvious.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me, I see Taiwan as the "aggressor" now. They don't seem to want peace with China. They keep claiming that China is massing an huge array of weapons to attack them bla bla bla. They even reject China's gift of 2 pandas.<br><br>Taiwan seems to be trying to piss China off. Few months ago they still go abolish the don't know what unification board. Add oil to fire only.<br><br>China is probably planning to regain Taiwan in a more "legit" way by winning the hearts of the people. Ah bian scared he lose keep on accusing China this China that.

            <div class='col-md body'>the way i see it, taiwan belongs to china, despite what ever ah bian is trying to do within is territory, we cannot ignore the fact that there is a strong pro-unification party within taiwan. now we have ma ying-jeou and lien chan banding together against the forces of green, i would say the 2008 elections results will be a determining factor of taiwan's policy towards china. over the years, china has been building up a credible military and walked towards a new generation army. its navy is rapidly transforming from a 'brown water' navy towards a 'blue water' one like what the russians and americans are having.. granted their military tech may be abt a decade or two behind US but the rapid growth in its defence industry has allowed china to grow and catch up with the westerner. while the western society may have a skewed mindset towards the tension within the taiwan striats, i would think that if ever a war really breaks out, the aid of the US will not be so forthcoming. now given china's military strength, even if US is to help taiwan, they may win, but suffer enough casualities to hurt the public opinion back in the States. so what i tink is that while they may act concerned, who rules taiwan ultimately makes no difference to the west. cuz no matter be in ah bian in power or is it the CCP, the businesses in taiwan will still grow since the CCP is now more open towards capitalism and even harnesses its power to feature in its philosophy of "socialism with chinese characteristics" so when it comes to interests, the western society is not really concerned abt the issue. as a root to all foreign policy, interests are paramount and i would say, that in event of a merger or whatever, the interests of these western powers are not going to be dramatically affected, thus western authors and politicians would thus give a more neutral stance regarding china and taiwan</div>

People just seldom hear of it because the Chinese press is government controlled.<br><br>The British leased Hong Kong for 99 years from the Chinese after the 2nd opium wars under the Convention of Peking. Which also saw China cede parts of outer manchuria to Russia. I'm not sure what the French got, but they signed it too.<br>Same think with Macau and Portugal.<br><br>The Americans and NATO can actually do ALOT should China want to invade Taiwan. What you may ask?? For one, trade sanctions can and will bring China to her knees. Why? because it's a net exporter. Exports make up a huge part of it's GDP.Stop trade and you stop the people from having trade. The rest of the world can pick up the slack. Though economically it'd be bad for everyone. It's worse off for China.<br>Next, with the Chinese fleet and Airforce fully occupied with defending the taiwan straits to safeguard it's troops and logistical lines, the US and whoever doesnt like China can simply start cutting off China's oil.<br><br>The US can also deploy some 7 Aircraft carrier battle groups into the region and it's Airforce leaving China's hold on the Taiwan straits shakey at best. Even if they dont, those ships and planes can start blasting other parts of China or enforcing a blockade.<br><br>Anyway, Taiwan is part of China and the people are Chinese. I see no reason why they shld not reunify. Honestly the might go the German way. Wait for China to turn Democratic and then rejoin. Heh</div>

Right ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Nobody has said that they do not support and favour a peaceful reunification. But look at it this way, military option is only the last resort and the ball is on Taiwan court. China, Actually don't even need to enact the Anti-succession law, because they are still technically under civil war, and that there were no call for Truce, and cease-fire, and no Armistice was ever signed (Unlike the Korean Situation.) So there is actually no grey area.<br><br>Though you may feel offended that it is not up to the Taiwanese. But don't you think that it is simply not just a Taiwanese problem ? On the another aspect, China also has to look at their own defense and soveriegnty issues. An Independent Taiwan, could well station a historically opposing military power right at china's vital shipping lanes and at  their border doorstep - 'USA'. Should this occur, chances is cross straits tension will persist. This time, It would certainly be US's interest play it up to curb China's growing economical prominience. Another war will be bliss for them... of course they won't say it so. The usaul tactic is to force a hand and say "There ! you see, I told you so.. China is threatening Taiwan.. an Independent and Democratic Soveriegn state", "Freedom" and other load of usual Crap!<br><br>Consider this...<br><br></strong></div>

I think they would have. And thus, China would have under taken a military option long ago, wouldn't it ? Ther will not be any Status quo to talk about.<br><br>Of course, it would be easily then said, Since most of us are not in China position. As many has said, if the US are in the same position as china/Taiwan, what would they have done ? Need no imagination.<br><br>If China is really serious in militarily take over in Taiwan. I seriously doubt US or UN, can defend Taiwan successfully or in time. Human toil will be serious. You cannot imagine the need to defend one's soveriegnty when the times comes. One cannot imagine the resolve of China to gain back national properties. Since the 8 nation plundering.<br><br>There has been many discussion done in the "what if" senario, and the US always will win. But in reality, without an air base and logistic support, that is easilier said then done. CVGs need time to assemble, technological advantage will also need basic logistic support to function. CVN are great, but also vunerable, especially Fuel, in a intense situation, CVN has only a days fuel. Then the will have all the launching and recovering sorties, and still need to be out of harms way. All the hype about the CVG impentratable defence is nonsense - "propaganda". Not say there are useless, but overrated. You only need 8 "sunburn to come their way" to mess things up. Then there are the SSN and SSKs. The PLA &amp; PLAN invasion mostly likely be sudden and intense. And of course I'm not saying taiwanese defense are unless and weak. But even if the China's invasion fails, economically Taiwan will be trashed and in ruins.  And suddenly, US will be the Devil advocate in their own interest.. as usual. Only China and Taiwan are the loser.<br><br>I'm not advocating a force reunification, but situation sometimes forced it's own hands. The US really like to divide and mess up people's lives.<br><br>Besides, if you go into the legal aspect. I assure you I will win, because I have done intensive arguments with arrogant Americans and some Taiwanese. Thus I have tons of facts by now.<br><br></div>
