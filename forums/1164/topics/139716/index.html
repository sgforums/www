            <div class='col-md body'>FORMIDABLE CLASS MULTI-MISSION FRIGATES, SINGAPORE<br><br>Six Formidable Class multi-mission frigates are being built for the Singapore Navy. The first of class, RSS Formidable, was launched on 7 January 2004 at the Lorient dockyard in Brittany, France. The Republic of Singapore Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) awarded the contract in March 2002 to DCN in France for the design and construction of the frigates. The contract includes a technology transfer program under which the construction of the first frigate is carried out in France and then five further frigates are built in Singapore by Singapore Technology Marine (STM) at the Benoi shipyard. The frigate programme is named Project Delta and is being managed by Singapore's state-owned Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA).<br><br>Following the launch of the RSS Formidable in January 2004, work started on fitting the combat and platform systems. The frigate will arrive in Singapore in 2005 and will enter service in 2007. All six Formidable class frigates will be in service by 2009.<br><br>As well as RSS Formidable (6, the class will consist of: RSS Intrepid (69), RSS Steadfast (70), RSS Tenacious (71), RSS Stalwart (72) and RSS Supreme (73). RSS Intrepid, constructed by STM, was launched in July 2004. RSS Steadfast was launched in January 2005.<br><br>The frigates will replace the six Sea Wolf Class missile gunboats that entered service in 1972 and are approaching the end of operational life.<br>FRIGATE DESIGN<br><br>The Project Delta design is a smaller derivative of the French La Fayette class stealth frigate with low radar, acoustic, infrared and electromagnetic signatures. A high level of automation and closely integrated combat and ship management systems have been selected to allow the frigate to be operated with a crew of just 70. The overall length is 114.8m with a beam of 16.3m and draught of 6.0m. The full load displacement is 3,200t.<br>FRIGATE COMMAND AND CONTROL<br><br>The Combat Management System was developed by the state owned DSTA with ST Electronics to meet the operational requirements of the Republic of Singapore Navy. DSTA also has responsibility for the combat systems integration. The Standard Operating Common Consoles, with 20in LCD displays, are supplied by Singapore Technologies Electronics, a subsidiary of ST Engineering.<br><br>The Integrated Communications System is also supplied by Singapore Technologies Electronics.<br>FRIGATE MISSILES<br><br>The frigate is armed with the Boeing Harpoon surface-to-surface anti-ship missile. The Harpoon missile has a range of 130km and uses active radar guidance. The missile is armed with a 227kg warhead.<br><br>The frigate is fitted with the DCN Sylver vertical launch system with MBDA Aster 15 surface-to-air missiles. There are four eight-cell SYLVER A43 launch modules with 32 missiles. The two-stage Aster missile is a very high agility and high manoeuvrability defence missile for deployment against incoming sea skimming anti-ship missiles which use evasive terminal manoeuvres and re-attack modes. In anti-missile mode the Aster 15 has a range of 15km. Aster also provides protection against manned and unmanned aircraft to a range of 30km.<br>FRIGATE GUN<br><br>The main gun is the Oto Melara 76mm/62 Super Rapid gun which fires 6kg shells to a range of 16km at a firing rate up to 120 rounds per minute.<br>ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE<br><br>The EDO Model 980 ALOFTS active low frequency towed sonar provides long-range detection and classification capability against submarines. ALOFTS comprises a variable depth sonar (VDS) towed body with a towed array. The frigate has two triple-barrelled lightweight torpedo launchers and is armed with the Eurotorp A244S torpedo.<br>FRIGATE AIRCRAFT CAPACITIES<br><br>The frigate has the capacity to operate a single medium size helicopter in the 10t class. The helicopter deck at the stern, approximately 22m x 16m (360mÂ²), has a single landing spot. The hangar is fully equipped with helicopter support and maintenance systems. The frigate carries an additional 15 aircrew for helicopter flight operations.<br><br>The Republic of Singapore Air Force will fly the shipborne helicopter and helicopter mission crew will be from the Republic of Singapore Navy. In January 2005, MINDEF placed an order for six Sikorsky S-70B Seahawk helicopters to operate from the frigates. Deliveries are scheduled from 2008-10.<br>FRIGATE SENSORS<br><br>The Herakles multi-function radar, supplied by Thales, is the frigate's primary surveillance radar. The phased array radar is a passive, three-dimensional, search and fire control radar operating over E- and F-bands. The radar, installed in a radome on top of the main mast, carries out long-range air and surface surveillance and weapon control. The Herakles radar is integrated with the Aster air defence missile system.<br><br>The frigates surface search and navigation radar is the Terma Scanter 2001, operating at I-band.<br><br>Countermeasures systems are yet to be announced.<br>FRIGATE PROPULSION<br><br>The frigate is powered by four MTU 20V 8000 diesel engines in a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) configuration. Each engine is rated at 8,200kW. The engines drive two shafts with constant pitch propellers.<br><br>The cruise and maximum speeds are 18 and 27 knots and the range is 7,200km (4,000 nautical miles)<br><br><img src="http://www.ships-net.co.jp/detl/200502/010-011.jpg"><br><br>COPIED FROM THE ORIGINAL POST BY MODERATOR CENTURION[/img]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ASTER SAAM<br>Surface-to-Air Anti Missile (SAAM) weapon system<br><br>ASTER 15 SAAM is the new generation of naval Medium Range Air Defence systems providing self-defence and nearby ship protection<br><br>The ASTER family<br>The current Aster family is a set of two missiles originally designed as anti-missile missiles, capable of defeating Air Breathing Threat. This family is characterised by a common kill vehicle, the booster (15 or 30) depending on the operational requirement. Both variants are delivered as a full up round of missile within their nitrogen pressurised canister. Vertically launched to ensure 360Â° coverage, they can operate with new generation radars, subject to implementation of an up-link in one of the following bandwidths : I/J, G or F.<br>The kill vehicle control relies on an innovative combination of strong aerodynamic control (Â‘PAFÂ’) and pyrotechnic control (Â‘PIFÂ’). The latter operates at the centre of gravity of the vehicle to provide the highest agility and the highest probability of achieving a Â‘Hit-to-KillÂ’ intercept (even against highly manoeuvring targets) within a large intercept domain. Fitted with an active RF seeker, a proximity fuze and a blast fragmentation warhead, the kill vehicle provides a proven multi-engagement, multi-environment and multi-target capability, satisfying land and naval requirements. These full up rounds are developed within the Â‘Future Surface-to-Air FamilyÂ’ (Â‘FSAFÂ’) and the Â‘Principal Anti-Air Missile SystemÂ’ (Â‘PAAMSÂ’) programmes, developed by three European nations.<br><br>The Aster-based systems are :<br>ASTER 15-SAAM (Surface-to-Air Anti-Missile) for naval anti-air self defence and consort ship protection,<br>ASTER 30-SAMP/T (Ground-to-Air Medium-Range/Land) for ground based anti-air self-defence, projected force protection and national or allied asset defence, with an Anti-Tactical Ballistic Missile capability,<br>ASTER 15 &amp; 30 - PAAMS (Principal Anti-Air Missile System), the only system able to integrate three operational naval missions: self-defence,  local area defence of nearby vessels and fleet area defence.<br><br>ASTER 15 - SAAM<br><br>Operational requirement<br>Provide outstanding protection of high value naval platforms against highly manoeuvring supersonic anti-ship missiles, non manoeuvring subsonic sea-skimmers, Anti-Radiation Missiles (ARMs), Fighter Aircraft and Maritime Patrol Aircraft. The protection of nearby ships against the same type of air threat is also required.<br><br>The MBDA solution<br>A medium range anti-air vertical launching missile system is based on the ASTER 15 missile. The system comprises: a Fire Control Unit implementing or coupled with an up-link operating in one of the I/J, G or F radar bandwidths, which offers 360 Â° coverage and requires low manpower. The Aster missiles fitted with an all weather capable active RF seeker require no target illuminator. This allows such a system to be integrated onto a naval platform of up to 2, 000 tonnes. The MBDA solution also responds to the power projection requirement and can operate in either a stand alone mode or in conjunction with the ship Combat Management System.<br><br>Description<br>The SAAM system comprises:<br>A Fire Control System based on a new generation radar implementing or coupled with an up-link (either I/J or G or F bandwidth),<br>A 43 Sylver Vertical Launching Systems, each containing eight ready-to-fire missiles,<br>The ASTER 15 anti-missile missiles.<br><br>This system provides 360 Â° defence and an all weather capability. It also features an extremely quick response time, a high firing rate (8 missiles within 10 seconds) and the capability to engage up to 8 targets simultaneously. The main equipment is designed with a high built-in test capability and requires limited logistics. No more than two people are required to operate the system and the engagement sequence or on board maintenance tasks can be managed in a very comprehensive manner. This is due to the use of standard conventional symbology and a Man Machine Interface (MMI) optimised with the end user.<br><br>MAIN FEATURES and ADVANTAGES<br><br>High effectiveness<br>The design drivers of this system were to overcome the threat posed by Anti-Radiation Missiles, including highly manoeuvring, stealthy, lately discriminated and unmasked targets. This capability relies on the short reaction time of the Firing Control Unit, the high speed of the Aster 15 weapon (Mach 3+) and their innovative control mode which provides the backbone of a true Hit-To-Kill performance. Although it is designed as a Hit-To-Kill missile, the Aster kill vehicle has a blast fragmentation warhead efficient against the most hardened targets within a large intercept volume.<br><br>Outstanding manoeuvrability and unequalled agility<br>The Aster kill vehicle is small and lightweight, enabling it to defeat the new generation of threat, especially highly manoeuvring targets. It is able to provide a high level of manoeuvrability through strong aerodynamic control (`PAFÂ’) and the implementation of pyrotechnic control (`PIFÂ’) that acts at its centre of gravity. This additional control device also acts as a compensator for the aerodynamic control response time and provides lateral acceleration without the need to generate an angle of attack. This enables the system to achieve the shortest response time to a control order, offering unequalled agility, the predominant characteristic of an anti-missile missile. This mixed control has proven its outstanding performance, especially at high altitude where air density is low. As a consequence of this concept, the Aster weapon is a two-stage missile currently with two possible booster sizes.<br><br>Guidance accuracy<br>The Aster missile computes the predicted intercept time according to the target and environmental data it receives during the launch sequence. From the missile flyout and up to the point at which the active RF seeker switches on, the missile is inertially guided, receiving periodic target position and environment updates from the Firing Control Unit via the up-link. This data allows the missile to update its own computations continuously as well as its optimum trajectory towards seeker switch-on and intercept and the predicted intercept time. As soon as the seeker has switched on and achieved target lock, the missile can home onto the target. The risk of acquiring the wrong target is avoided by means of sophisticated functions within the seeker and the onboard computer. Just before intercept and as determined by the on board computer, the pyrotechnic Â‘PIFÂ’ is initiated, operating in conjunction with the aerodynamic control, the Â‘PAFÂ’ to significantly reduce the predicted missile/target miss-distance, to the point of achieving a direct hit.<br><br>Status of programme<br>The French and Italian ASTER 15-SAAM systems are qualified. The French aircraft carrier, Charles de Gaulle, is the first warship to have had the system installed, in this instance, with the Arabel Multi-Function Radar. It has now been operational for over two years, after completion of a successfull operational live test.<br><br>5 ASTER 15-SAAM systems have already been ordered.<br><br>Mass 310 kg<br>Length 4.2 m<br>Diameter 0.18 m<br>Propulsion<br>solid propellant, two stage,<br>Terminal velocity<br>Mach 3<br>Manoeuvrability<br>50 g<br>Guidance updata link and active radar seeker in final phase<br>Altitude of interception10 km<br>Range In excess of 30 km<br><br><img src="http://www.mbda.net/site/img_imp/prevpge_aster15.jpg"><br><img src="http://pvo.guns.ru/images/other/france/aster/mbda/aster15__3.jpg"></div>
