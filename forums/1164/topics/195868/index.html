So far more than 600 have been ordered with production still underway.<br><br>Bronco has already undertaken extensive trials in Finland and more recently in France as both countries have a requirement for a vehicle of this type.<br><br>Also competing for both of these requirements is the BAE Systems HÃ¤gglunds BvS 10, which is in service with the Netherlands and UK Royal Marines and has also undergone extensive trials in France, including the Alps.<br><br>The French Army programme is called the VÃ©hicule Haute MobilitÃ© (VHM) with a total requirement, funding permitting, of up to 400 units. Both contractors have submitted their bids to France. A decision is expected early next year, with first order expected to be for about 50 to 60 units.<br><br>For the French market STK (Stand H10) would send the vehicles to French company CEFA, which would fit specialised mission equipment. The vehicles would then go to Thales, which would fit the electronic equipment.<br><br>At Eurosatory, a Bronco is being shown in French Army markings and fitted out as an Artillery Forward Observation Officer (FOO) vehicle. Mounted over the front unit is a remote controlled overhead weapon station supplied by Thales and armed with a 12.7mm machine gun.<br><br>Singapore has already deployed a number of versions of the Bronco, including ambulance, repair and recovery, load carrier, troop carrier and fuel resupply vehicle. Other versions are under development, including one carrying the STK 120mm SRAMS (Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System).<br><br>Bronco is already being expanded, including use as a robotic vehicle, as well as being fitted with a new advanced patented coupling that links the front and rear units. This unique feature allows the user to Â“plug and play Â“ so that different units can be attached as required by the mission.<br><br>In addition, each unit can be transported slung under a tactical helicopter and then rapidly linked at their final destination.<br><br>The units provide the crews with protection from small arms fire and shell splinters, with higher levels of protection being an option. The Caterpillar diesel engine meets EURO III requirements, with the total available payload currently being 5,000kg.<br><br>The Bronco is also fully amphibious, being propelled in the water by its tracks at a speed of 5km/h.</blockquote><img src="http://eurosatory.janes.com/docs/eurosatory2006/sections/moxiepix/a295.jpg"><br>Export target: STK Bronco in French Army markings<br><br><strong><a href="http://eurosatory.janes.com/docs/eurosatory2006/sections/daily/day4/bronco-seeks-first-export.shtml" rel="nofollow">JDW </a></strong><br><br>2.The issue here is not few bucks Sg earn fr the sale,if any.<br>this show our products,though not 100% sg stuff,is in par<br>with G8.The main platform is developed by sg.<br><br>600 units !!<br><br><strong><a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search/images?ei=UTF-8&amp;p=bronco%2BATTC&amp;fr=FP-tab-news-t&amp;b=1" rel="nofollow">more images</a></strong></div>
