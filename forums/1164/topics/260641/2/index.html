And the Americans, they procastinated until their Pearl Harbor get bombed.  If they have done something earlier, things might be different.  Then again, why shld they, the happenings in Europe &amp; Asia prior to Pearl Harbor has got nothing to do with them.</div></blockquote>The Americans were not much in a position to threaten the Japanese fleet until after Midway and Coral Sea as its carrier fleet was too small. Most of the fleet action was led by the Yorktown class, i.e. Enterprise, Yorktown and Hornet or one other carrier I think. Until the Essex class arrived, the US Navy was in no position to retake anyhting.</div>
