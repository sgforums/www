I've got a hard time swallowing the excuse of unrestricted German submarine warfare because if the Yanks were using passenger liners to transport war materials, it doesn't count as unrestricted warefare - these liners were legitimate targets by virtue of their cargo.  The question is why did the Yanks wait so long to stop sneaking around?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's an older gentleman who shoots regularly at our gun club. He's often there during the week in the evenings, usually shooting his pristine-condition M1 Garand rifle.<br><br>I've known him for a couple of years as I'm regularly at the club in the evenings too, especially in summer when the sun doesn't set till after 9 p.m. He's exceptionally friendly, easy-going, and helpful. If we're shooting from adjacent benches, we'll regularly spot and call the shots for each other if we happen to be shooting non-scoped rifles that evening.<br><br>His name is George, and for whatever reason, it never occurred to me to ask what his last name was. He's 82 years old and had served aboard the destroyer, <a href="http://www.ussmassey.org/" rel="nofollow">U.S.S. Massey</a>, as part of her commissioning crew during WW2.<br><br>This past May, I happened to glance at his membership badge for the very first time, and noticed that his last name was <span style="font-style: italic;">Patton</span>. Half-jokingly, I asked if he was related to <span style="font-style: italic;">the</span> General George S. Patton.<br><br>"He's my uncle," he replied.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Anyway, here's a picture I took of George last May. He's on the right; the gent on the left is his friend Warren Laursen, a Korean War vet who flew the F-86 Sabre during that conflict.<br><br><a href="http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t194/screwthepap3/GeorgeP_WarrenL_DCGC_20070525.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t194/screwthepap3/th_GeorgeP_WarrenL_DCGC_20070525.jpg"></a><br><br></div>
