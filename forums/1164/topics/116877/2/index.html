Also, one of the nails in the Comanche's coffin was the cost of the Hellfire-armed Predator, in particular the number of which that could be funded out of the savings from cancelling the Comanche program.  Whether or not the Hellfire predator goes ahead is another matter.</div>

The F-111 project was long considered an expensive failure, but the end result was a capable, albeit costly, aircraft.<br><br>the f-18 is still in its infancy....the a6 is too slow...<br><br>the aardvark had a low level speed of Mach 1.2 and a high level speed of mach 2.5<br><br>the aardvark can carry a whole lot more than the f-18 and a6.....<br><br>plus the aardvark falls under the SAC(Strategic Air Command) and the f 18 and a6 falls under the US Navy....so its also a case of different services....</div></blockquote>The 'Vark used during the Operation El Dorado Canyon were not assigned to SAC but TAC (Tactical Air Command) or specifically USAFE (US Air Force Europe). The SAC 'Varks are <strong>FB-111A</strong> whilst El Dorado Canyon 'Varks are F-111E (or is it F?). The reason the Vark were used is that they are the only USAF planes with the required capability to whack point targets - B-52s can only carpet-bomb at that time (no AGM-142 capability). Nowadays, it would be the job for F-117s, if not F-15Es which replace the F-111s.</div>
