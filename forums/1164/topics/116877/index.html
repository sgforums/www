The F-111 project was long considered an expensive failure, but the end result was a capable, albeit costly, aircraft.<br><br>the f-18 is still in its infancy....the a6 is too slow...<br><br>the aardvark had a low level speed of Mach 1.2 and a high level speed of mach 2.5<br><br>the aardvark can carry a whole lot more than the f-18 and a6.....<br><br>plus the aardvark falls under the SAC(Strategic Air Command) and the f 18 and a6 falls under the US Navy....so its also a case of different services....</div>

Just because an aircraft is less technologically advanced does not mean it's a "failure". Conventionally designed non-stealth aircraft will be around for quite a while more. Aircraft like the B-1B still have some "shelf life" left.<br><br>While stealth is definitely going to be needed on the modern battlefield, an all-stealth force is rediculously expensive. Realising this, the USAF &amp; other US services have formed a strategy where there remains a stealth first strike, followed by a conventional non-stealth "follow up" action.<br><br>Thus, conventional aircraft capable of hauling larger payloads like the B-1B will still be around.<br><br>Also, stealth is not the only decisive factor in the performance of a good combat aircraft. Afterall, even the Commanche programme got cancelled.</div>
