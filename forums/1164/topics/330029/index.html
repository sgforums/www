              <p>As we can see, heightened tensions in the region due to Pedra Branca and rivalry between the US and Russia over the issue of Georgia, i believe we have to be prepared as in go up one rung from "Standby" to operational readiness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our PT/91m MBTs and A4 skyhawks can be upgraded, although it may seem pointless, it is still beneficial to our needs, should we have a inter-pacific war(US landing on Georgia to clear Russian forces and push into Moscow, but i dont think it would affect South Asia.However there will still be hostility from Kremlin.</p>
              <p>Conflicts can just be powershoving and flaunting of assets, as shown by Russia and it was very tense if not, nervy when US deployed its chinooks into Georgia to evacuate (or is it deploy Georgian forces from Iraq to thier homeland)?.Had Russian forces shot down a chinook just cause of a trigger happy RPG or Stinger A/A personnell , im sure that US will make a big hoo ha, if not threaten the use of force to clear Russian Forces out.</p>
              <p>Right now, the stituation on Georgia is still  unknown.The last i have heard is  Russian Forces breaking the ceasefire and staying in Georgia.Has Georgian soveriegnity been returned ?</p>

              <p>I believe we are ready. I have seen other Western armed forces at work in other countries. Their training standards are the same. In any case, peace time training only brings the soldier up to a competent level but not to a "honed" level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What other armed forces do is that prior to executing a deliberate mission or to deploy overseas, they will get all the units together and rehearse and rehearse ... and rehearse. Sounds familiar to us SAF guys !?! These rehearsals will hopefully bring the competency level up. At least, it will iron out the coordination problems and minimise friendly fire incidents during the mission.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, all these cannot replace combat experience. Which the SAF only has a small number of regulars who have experienced such. This is something the SAF would have to take its chances. Learn fast during the first few engagements and correct and adapt its tactics. Hopefully, we are not KO'd before then.</p>

              <p>Ideally big powers will resort to diplomacy. Also, rational people ( politicians included ) know that war is a lose-lose situation.</p>

              <p>Our PT/91m MBTs and A4 skyhawks can be upgraded, although it may
              seem pointless, it is still beneficial to our needs, should we have
              a inter-pacific war(US landing on Georgia to clear Russian forces
              and push into Moscow, but i dont think it would affect South
              Asia.However there will still be hostility from Kremlin.</p>
              <p>Conflicts can just be powershoving and flaunting of assets, as
              shown by Russia and it was very tense if not, nervy when US
              deployed its chinooks into Georgia to evacuate (or is it deploy
              Georgian forces from Iraq to thier homeland)?.Had Russian forces
              shot down a chinook just cause of a trigger happy RPG or Stinger
              A/A personnell , im sure that US will make a big hoo ha, if not
              threaten the use of force to clear Russian Forces out.</p>
              <p>Right now, the stituation on Georgia is still  unknown.The

              <p>every country would say they are ready. what defines them as ready is really the capability to respond to such threats in the shortest possible time. it is also really the intelligence that plays a part in spotting potential threats and mobilise the armed forces in time.</p>
              <p>so its really no use copy and pasting and telling others what they already know. im sure many folks here have been through NS and they know how operationally ready the SAF is.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Further fm my view, war is not the option in civilized world. Its bitter than you guys ever think. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">If you’re talking about your military power might, it means nothing when you read about Serbian VS NATO war. The combination of Israel doctrine including the mobilization of air strike, artillery, and tanks with infantry is no use during recent Lebanon war isn’t it? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Most of their air strike didn’t effective when it came to tunnel or heavy jungle war and you need to consider SU30MKM, MIG29N and other aircraft also . Even their Merkava 111 and 1V which been admire worldwide as one of the finest tanks been destroyed with Mentis M and RPG29. Hesbollah guerilla never use tank to destroy Merkava. They only use tank hunter infantry, which consist 2-4 people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">If you’re talking about MY, they got special force infantry specialized to hunt the tank with 1<sup>st</sup> class weapons more than Hesbollah. If you read recent defense article, the era of tank as “king of the battlefields” been obsolete long time ago.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span> </span>I didn’t talking about PT91M MBT because during Serbian war VS NATO, most of their tanks survive fm air strike and that why US never dare to use M1 Abramas tank in Serbia. You got what I mean. With artillery shells (always highly mobilized to prevent detection) and tank hunter infantry rip out most of the Leopard tanks all the way. At the end, PT91MBT came out fm nowhere for face-to-face fighting. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">20 apaches long bow? Why they don’t use it in Serbia?<span>  </span>Its because of missile since apache need to stay still before they start firing target isn’t it. A soft static target for missile since latest tank doctrine move along with air defense battery + infantry equipped with short range missile </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Your Generals must be realize it why Serbian been called as BALKAN and Balkan advantage 3 times more in MY. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Recently, MY brought 2 Scorpene submarine to strengthen their army. You’ll should read about Falkland war and how 1 sub marine can possibly change the entire war.<span>    </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Guys. Yes. When we describe about war machine (tanks, aircraft, surface platform etc), it got a lot of remarkable advantage and specification but when it come to real war, its performance far fm we imagine. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Say no to war but yes to peace. We might fight muscle to muscle if we met in 1<sup>st</sup> link because of disagreement but it doesn’t mean we need to go for war.<span>  </span>Learn how Israeli soldiers and Lebanon civilian cry during the war.<span>  </span></span></p>

              <p>if you realise, we exist in a conundrum of possibilities. logically, if you think about singapore as a jigsaw piece, we wouldnt fit into our part of the world. too many complications, too many differences in the core. case in point, we wouldnt exist if not for the intereference of external events and players. some would like to call it, living on "suffrage" of the region. It isnt a warrior ethos in society, but moreso of how you understand defence</p>
              <p>in that same manner, we are probably closer to Meiji japan and its "strong army, strong nation" concept. defence not only as a physical concept, but multi layered.defence of the national idenity and psyche.</p>
              <p>go figure, if you understand it you'd get it. if you dont, its pretty hard to convince you that we arent a nation of war mongerer's.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When I start writing a few hrs ago, I thought I’m only talking to young NSmen who really eager for war. A reflection from their military training to builds self confidence probably and nation as a whole. Seems somebody really understand it and that what I’m trying to say indirectly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yes. One of the messages, all soldiers and civilian too, should pray for peace. We had gone through a lot of war before, communist, confrontation, Japanese, Portuguese and British. It’s long enough and we can’t bear a new scar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In other point of view, that’s the psychology mold how Singaporean built up its society. I mean no harm when I told them the reality of true war. At least they realized what should happen during war to add on some respect into young NSmen of their “enemy “. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span> </span>Over confidence always brings careless but respect make them more careful and efficient soldiers isn’t it?</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";    '>Further more, what I’m trying to say is, all war’s machine got it own weaknesses and depending to it’s alone as a measurement for true wars always brings loses at the end. <span> </span></span></p>

              <p>Seems to me the only person really happy to go to war and flaunt "military might" in here would be lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>But in all people in here have their head screwed on correctly, we go our job as soldiers for the precise reason that we hope that we will never have to do our job for real.</p>
              <p>But then again if push comes to shove you've have to do what you're trained to do to the best of your capacity.</p>
              <p>Though if we wanted to point out bare facts I must say that your whole thesis on how jungle warfare trumps technology as a force multiplier is poorly written in the sense it relies on the "vietnam media" bias.</p>
              <p>Simply put it is the unrealistic and unreasonable expectation that simply because you have superior technology you will be able to pwn your enemy completely, with encountering difficulties or taking as losses as "proof" of failure.</p>
              <p>This theory is greatly flawed for the simple reason that technology is just a tool, something that you use. What matters in war is how you play your cards. Vietnam was not an indication of the inability of the American soldier or military to fight (in fact they've have been through more brutal battles in WW2 and Korean) but the inability of its political leaders to give the soldier a mission they could actually win the war with.</p>
              <p>Also the worst example to quote is Lebanon. While the war was a media victory for Hezbollah, due a lot in part of the Israelis being slow to come up with their own side of the story, it was actually a military disaster for them. They actually took heavy losses fighting the IDF. The engagement was much like the Tet offensive: a military disaster but a media victory. Most telling was the reluctance of Hezbollah to go round 2 after that incident, for they were running low on matyrs.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day technology is a card to play, unless you are lionnoisy who thinks that bigger guns and better stuff means you just rush in to pwn everyone. But if push comes to shove any military would rather have the better stuff.</p>
