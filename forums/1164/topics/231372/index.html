I know that the Ardennes had pretty thick forest that the French thought the German couldn't pass through. The route via the Low Countries were well-anticipated by the Allies but why did the German General Staff consider using that route as the main axis of attack? Surely that would have been some pros in using that route.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They were using Blitzreig as their strategy, so suppose they made a quick one by land a nd air o secure the pass, followed by Panzers going in with Infantry at the back, they could do it in a quick time.</div>

Think about it, imagine if Hitler didn't meddle, replaced idiot Keitel with Manstein, the world might well have turned out differently. Or at least the Allies would've taken a lot longer to reach Berlin.<br><br>As for their autobiographies, sure they might've exaggerated a bit here and there, but most objective histories of WW2, written by British and American authors (their enemies) give them full credit for Germany's early blitzkrieg (1939-41) victories.<br><br>And Guderian WAS the father of the armored force. Even Patton gives him credit for his innovative ideas.</div>
