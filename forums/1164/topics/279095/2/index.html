            <div class='col-md body'>Here's something to deflate Russian's ego:<br><br>( RIA Novosti ) - The U.S. has a 14-ton super bomb more destructive than the vacuum bomb just tested by Russia, a U.S. general said Wednesday.<br><br>The statement was made by retired Lt. General McInerney, chairman of the Iran Policy Committee, and former Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force.<br><br>McInerney said the U.S. has "a new massive ordnance penetrator that's 30,000 pounds, that really penetrates ... Ahmadinejad has nothing in Iran that we can't penetrate."<br><br>He also said the new Russian bomb was not a "penetrator."<br><br>On Tuesday, the Fox News television channel said: "A recent decision by German officials to withhold support for any new sanctions against Iran has pushed a broad spectrum of officials in Washington to develop potential scenarios for a military attack on the Islamic regime.".<br><br>Commenting on the report, McInerney said: "Since Germany has backed out of helping economically, we do not have any other choice. ... They've forced us into the military option."<br><br>McInerney described some possible military campaign scenarios and said: "The one I favor the most, of course, is an air campaign," he continued.<br><br>He said that bombing would be launched by 65-70 stealth bombers and 400 bombers of other types.<br><br>"Forty-eight hours duration, hitting 2500 aimed points to take out their [Iranian] nuclear facilities, their air defense facilities, their air force, their navy, their Shahab-3 retaliatory missiles, and finally their command and control. And then let the Iranian people take their country back," the general said describing the campaign, adding it would be "easy."<br><br>McInerney is well-known among the U.S. conservatives. He is the chairman of the Iran Policy Committee co-chaired by James Woolsey, former CIA director, William A. Nitze, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and Richard Schifter, former Assistant Secretary of State, and Professor Raymond Tanter, former Personal Representative of the Secretary of Defense to arms control talks in Europe.<br><br>The McInerney statement was made following a Fox News report that U.S. "officials are making plans to attack Iran as early as next summer," since Washington believes diplomatic efforts have failed.<br><br>From <a href="http://news.trend.az/cgi-bin/readnews2.pl?newsId=1003934&amp;lang=EN" rel="nofollow">http://news.trend.az/cgi-bin/readnews2.pl?newsId=1003934&amp;lang=EN</a><br><br>Their copyright.
