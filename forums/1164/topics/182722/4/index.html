He said a report had been submitted to RMN chief Admiral Datuk Ilyas Din pending salvage operations or demolition of the missile.<br><br>The missile, measuring 2.5m in length and 25cm in diameter, and weighing 145kg, has been used by Brazil, Germany, South Korea and Turkey.<br><br>Malaysia purchased the missiles and firing system from Britain through manufacturers Matra Bae Dynamics four years ago.<br><br>A Super Lynx, named Rentap Missile, fired the Sea Skua guided missile, intending to hit a 40-metre surface target barge eight nautical miles away.<br><br>The armed helicopter fired its starboard missile from an altitude of 90 metres but the booster failed to ignite as it should have, within 2.5 seconds of separation from the helicopter.<br><br>On the Malaysia-Philippine naval exercise, Aziz said it had given both navies a chance to be involved in war games. Among the objectives of the exercise was to enhance co-operation between the two navies and test their capabilities. Philippine Navy Fleet commander Rear Admiral Alfredo O. Abueg Jr said the exercise provided an opportunity for the two navies to co-operate on common objectives.</div>

Hopefully, this will not happen again," he told reporters at a dinner reception here.<br><br>On March 16, a Sea Skua guided missile failed in the first test conducted in Southeast Asia, in the waters of Kuala Beruas near Pantai Remis in Perak.<br><br>In the test conducted by BAE Dynamics, the missile was fired at 11am from a Super Lynx 300 attack helicopter at the wreckage of a ship eight nautical miles away. It failed to hit the target and fell into the sea without exploding.<br><br>The RMN later located the missile about 32 nautical miles north of Kuala Beruas.<br><br>According to Meighan, all the anti-ship missiles produced by the company have always been in top form, including those supplied to RMN and ready for use at any time.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">"We find that the problem was not the operator or the helicopter. It was the missile. We find this quite hard to believe as the Sea Skua missiles have been successful elsewhere," he said.</span></strong>\<br><br>The 2.5-metre-long Sea Skua, weighing 145 kilograms, is an all-weather, day-and-night sea skimming anti-ship missile equipped with a semi-active radar homing head that can sink a ship from a distance of 18 kilometres.<br><br>Sea Skua missiles were used in the Gulf War of 1991 and 2000, fired from the Lynx helicopters of the British Royal Navy.<br><br>The missiles are being used by the armed forces of Brazil, Germany, South Korea and Turkey.<br><br>The missile test was the first to be conducted in Southeast Asia because Malaysia is the only country in the region to purchase the missiles under a package costing about 20 million pounds.<br><br>An agreement to purchase the missiles was signed in 2001 and the supply to RMN began last year.<br><br>Asked about the possibility of a second test, Meighan said this would be carried out after the company was satisfied with the system's capability and able to overcome the problems which contributed to the failure of the first test.<br><br>However, he added, the second test is expected to be held before the Defence Services Asia Exhibition in Kuala Lumpur in April 24 this year.<br><br>-- BERNAMA<br></div>
