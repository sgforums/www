On closer look, when fuel oil reach a certain level where alternative fuel (like palm oil) will kick in.  This will sort of help to limit the rise of fuel oil price to a certain level and eventually at equilibrium with the alternative fuel price.<br><br>It is good that Malaysia had developed a program to plant palm oil in a big way.  It is also proven that palm oil can be converted to biodiesel, and many other products.  It is a matter of further improvement into the efficiency of conversion etc, as an on ongoing process.  Hope that Indonesia will catch on with this development also.</div>

We are all South East Asians. Sheesh.. Look a war is going to break out in the middle east in a few months. Japan N.Korea and SK might fight too. China and Japan dun say.
