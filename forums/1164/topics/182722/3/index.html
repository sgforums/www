Much of this about 80% was consumed within russia itself used as shortening agents and fats for the bakery and confectionery industries. With the collapse of the USSR and introduction to capitalism this markets has steadily grown and since 1993 the russians have started importing 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes of palm which eventually grew to 100,000 tonnes in the last few years. Our largest palm oil buyer today is china purchasing 2.5 million tonnes, followed by the European Union, India, Pakistan , Egypt and Singapore buying about 400,000 tonnes.<br><br>Originally it was sunflower oil that played a major part in the huge food/edible oil processing industries but because of poor sunflower crops in Ukraine over the years has led to a premium in the price of sunflower oil that many processers are switching to the more stable priced palm oil as a viable alternative which has fueled the demand. Ukraine remains the fastest growing palm oil market for malaysia today importing abt 500,000 tonnes annually.<br><br>So you see there's nothing shameful or backward about doing palm oil deal, palm oil is a valued commidity that people want. But I'm getting the impression that a lot of your countrymen think palm oil is worthless and the russians are desperate to seal any deal hence at first reluctant but later willing in the end to agree to a barter deal of sorts with palm oil for arms and in doing so making us look like cheapskate and indebted to the russians thanks to your media but it show really how much you gulp down everything your media tells you as gospel truth no?<br><br>It's true we were badly hit in the asian financial crisis as such we had to shelf many programs due to lack of funding setting back progress and nearly jeapordising our national security but we found a way to ease the problem and that way was not something new only difference is that before we sold palm oil for cash or foreign currency and used this currency to buy things only now we do it better bartering goods for goods without either party using up valuable foreign currency for exchange, a win win situation.</div>

I used the word majority seeing as how a handful of forumers(if you read through the thread) seems to scoff at the idea of palm oil for arms deal.<br><br>I'm assuming here many singaporeans don't know much abt palm oil industry as it stems from the fact you don't have one so I gave a summary abt it just in case to clear any doubts abt what palm oil is and what it isn't.<br><br>The post is drectly mostly to Tvdog and other forumers who have mentioned palm oil in their posts.</div>

This is afterall SGforum. You can see such commentary in most, if not all of the country-based forums, military ones included and yours as well. It could have been an entirely different issue if it`s an international one arguably. Nevertheless, one would assume that you could provide a reasonable explanation to the missile incident. But that`s hard I agree. But at very least you could afford to join in a discussion of the possible reasons.<br><br>And most military discussion would have political under-tones affecting/mentioning other countries because the growth of a country`s military is a reaction of external events in countries, region and the world at large. The same goes with discussions of a political nature which could pull in other countries as well. These involves comparisons; overt or otherwise; wittingly or not. That`s natural.<br><br>If you`re going to par-take in the discussion guns blazing by shooting down the host/s, i should expect replies of the same nature as well. I suppose that includes information and facts not correctly protrayed. Your comments about Singaporean posters acting without decorum notwithstanding when as a guest poured the kerosene earlier on and lit it.
