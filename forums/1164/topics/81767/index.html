            <div class='col-md body'>The theory that the Americans deliberately allowed PH to be attacked is not all that far-fetched.  Two things to keep in mind here are:<br><br>1) FDR was in a deadlock with US congress at the time.  He wanted to get the US military into the ETO, but congress would only go so far as shipping weapons and materials to the British (and having secret meetings aboard ships in Canadian waters).<br><br>2) Looking back to WW1, the US stayed out of the war until 1917, when the Lusitania was sunk by a submarine, galvanising the American public into action.  Oddly enough, the Lusitania was supposed to be carrying non-war related supplies to Europe, but there is a hole in the side of the ship that is way too large to be explained by a torpedo hit.  Similar to the Peral Harbour runour, there has always been a suspicion that the Lusitania's sinking was deliberate on the Americans' part.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Did a bit of a search and came up with this website:<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6315/pearl.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6315/pearl.html</a><br><br>If the documents cited in this site are genuine, it does make a pretty interesting case of how the US allowed Pearl Harbour to happen, so that they could get into WW2.<br><br>Hmm - a series of incredible intelligence failures that allowed an attack in which a couple of thousand of Americans are killed, opening the gates for an all-out US-led war.  That sounds so familiar, but, damn, I can't put my finger on where I've heard something like that in recent years.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hard 2 accept dat the Americans wld turn 2 such a costly alternative to go 2 war wif Japan ... surely there muz be a better way ... well, if the attack didn't happen, and the Americans entered the war much later, Europe &amp; the rest of the world wld have 2 endure more of Nazi Germany and WW2 wld hv dragged for a longer time ... more lives wld hv been lost  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The US loses werent as bad as it would seem...sure 3 BB's sunk....8 more almost sunk some 10 destroyers and cruisers hit.Planes gone and men dead but honestly the BB's were all outdated,the planes too.The 3 aircraft carriers were called out for an excerise at a convient time werent they?most of the better planes werent even depolyed there yet.Overall while many lives were lost,the lost to material and stuff werent much.All in all it looked real but i think it's a ploy to get into a war</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by method:</div><div class="quote_body">[1] An American destroyer was sunk by a German U-Boat in 1941/1942 (can't remember the exact date) so that would have drawn the U.S. into the war against Germany.<br>The Alliance would still include U.S., Great Britain, the Free French &amp; Russia. Nothing would have changed, the tide of war against the Axis powers in Europe would have gone as planned.      </div></blockquote>This I beg to differ, the sinking caused a diplomatic furore back then and there was much protesting and argument but the Americans remained neutral. The US Congress voted and unanimously rejected President Roosevelt's call to declare war on Germany while Churchill had to sit back to sulk for a while longer.</div>
