            <div class='col-md body'>By JOHN KAY<br>Chief reporter<br>JULY 17, 2007<br><br>ADD COMMENT<br><br>THE commander of the SAS is to be axed for being too BRAVE, it was revealed yesterday.<br><br>The tough Who Dares Wins regimentÂ’s CO will be relieved for defying top brass Â— who ordered him to stop going on Â“gung-hoÂ” ops with his men. The move has left his loyal soldiers Â“spitting bloodÂ”.<br><br>When the highly-decorated ex-Para took over the SAS, he insisted on grabbing his weapons to go out on ops with his men in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br><br>The Colonel was involved in fierce firefights with Taliban fighters and insurgents in Iraq.<br><br>But top brass became perturbed by his heroic actions and insisted that he should remain behind his desk to plot the Â“bigger pictureÂ” of the regiment.<br><br>Last night an SAS insider said: Â“The CO was a hero to his men and they are gutted and spitting blood that he has been forced out.<br><br>Â“He led from the front and risked his own life fighting alongside his men.<br><br>Â“He took the view that he couldnÂ’t ask them to do anything he wouldnÂ’t do himself.Â”<br><br>The Lt-Col is being relieved of command and is to quit for repeatedly defying orders from top brass to stop going out on daring operations with his men.<br><br>The officer, who cannot be named for security reasons, is the first SAS CO to be chopped since the legendary Who Dares Wins unit was formed in 1941.<br><br>He had already won medals for his Â“gallant and distinguished servicesÂ” in Afghanistan, where he served between 2001 and 2002.<br><br>He had served for just over 12 months and was expected to carry on for up to three years.<br><br>But the CO clashed repeatedly with his Special Forces bosses and refused to toe the line.<br><br>When the row reached boiling point he was told he was being relieved of command Â— and he then asked to resign.<br><br>The extent of his disgust over his treatment is underlined by the fact that he is quitting the Army altogether.<br><br>The 40-year-old officer, who went to public school and holds a university degree, joined the SAS from the Paras.<br><br>The Colonel had been tipped to go right to the top and achieve the rank of a General.<br><br>Last night members of the 500-strong regiment were said to be Â“devastatedÂ”.<br><br>An insider said: Â“He is just the sort of officer the SAS needs Â— but thatÂ’s not what the top brass inside the Ministry of Defence wanted.<br><br>Â“They felt he should be more political and more of a thinker and not so close to his men.Â”<br><br>A defence source said: Â“The CO of 22 SAS is resigning from the Army for personal reasons after many years of successful service.Â”<br><br>A senior officer said: Â“The role of the CO, whether of the SAS or any other regiment, is to properly command the entire unit from his HQ and not to go out on front-line missions.Â”<br><br>j.kay@the-sun.co.uk<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Wah piang..how many of our SAF paper generals got the balls to have this kind of spirit and leadership qualities..?

            <div class='col-md body'>You're right. Remember the 101st Airborne officer in the "Band of Brothers" who first came up with the idea of neutralizing those german artillery units in occupied France during WW2?<br><br>He is the perfect example of an ideal officer who lead from the front but once he was promoted to Major, much of the actual fighting and leading were given to more junior officers. The men still respected him alot because they have been together with him since recruit days and have witness that he has fought for them all the way.</div>

He continued to lead operations even after escaping form capture, rape and torture by the Turks.<br><br>During the fight down the Malayan Peninsula WW2 the Brits/Allies lost officers even higher than the rank of Bn CO. Casualties among officers especially those commanding Indian units were extremely high as the Japs went all out for them. The Japs knew that losing officers will severely affect the units' fighting abilities.<br><br>So, in a sense, I do agree that this SAS officer is risking the combat effectiveness of his unit.<br><br>(Though this is not the popular view.)<br><br>Maybe he should've been a bit more diplomatic and say YES to his superiors, and then carry on as before after they have turned their attentions elsewhere.<br><br>His having to leave his unit benefit no one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before my encounter with wisefool, I would argue that this is the kind of CO I would die to fight under. The very kind of officer, all officers should be. A soldier's soldier.<br><br>But upon explaining to me, I realized that yes such officers hold the utmost respect from their men, being in the crap and getting shot at as well. But with rank, and appointment comes certain privileges, such as calling for immediate arty, air-strikes, naval support or hot extracts. And if he's out...who else can call for such support? Thus I would say that he makes a good PC, PS, Sec.Commander or Sergeant Major.</div>

Why do you want to take the job of your soldiers who are very very likely much better than you in doing the ground work? Who else is going to coordinate all your other troops? A colonel has so much authority, experience and expertise in command and control, but he go and waste all those precious skills (possessed by only 1% of the people in the whole regiment) to go and do something the other 99% of the people in the squad can do. Stupid.<br><br>A colonel being at the front line, is like having a minister of education teaching in the classroom: derelict in his duties as a minister.

When he was promoted to Major, he delegated the fighting/leading part at the front to his ltas and sergeants.<br><br>Perhaps, our Col who was from the paras wanted to prove a point - that the paras are juz as good, if not better than the regular SAS troopers he is leading. Let's see how the new CO fares - this guy is from one of the Guards unit.<br></div>

The very kind of officer, all officers should be. A soldier's soldier.<br><br>But upon explaining to me, I realized that yes such officers hold the utmost respect from their men, being in the crap and getting shot at as well. But with rank, and appointment comes certain privileges, such as calling for immediate arty, air-strikes, naval support or hot extracts. And if he's out...who else can call for such support? Thus I would say that he makes a good PC, PS, Sec.Commander or Sergeant Major.</div></blockquote>Well that type of officer may be popular with the men, but he is doing them more harm then good. With him hanging around, first lower commanders have less chance of growth and lead !!! He may even undermine the authority of the lower commanders as the men will alway compare him and his orders with his lower commanders .... !!!<br><br>Officer are there to win battles - Sometime senior officers have to take into consideration of the bigger pictures , in fact sad to say - sometime they may have to make sacrifice of some soldiers to win the war !  Thus a well like and respect officer may not be the one that win the war, they need to learn when to turn into a bastard also to win it.<br><br></div>
