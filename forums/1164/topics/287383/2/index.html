Auto shotguns also allow you to fire at a faster rate than pump-action (unless you really CAN pump that fast). But never hold down the trigger like an M16.<br><br>If you can fire non-stop on a shotgun you must be made of.. erm..<br><br>N.B. Forgive my terminology. It's been awhile. I'm not exactly sure if you call it co.cking the gun after each shot for a pump action shotgun. <img src="http://forums.clubsnap.com/images/cs/smilies/ne_nau.gif"></div>

The delivery of the large number of projectiles simultaneously makes the shotgun the most effective short range weapon commonly used, with a hit probability 45% greater than a submachine gun, and twice as great as an assault rifle[1]. While each pellet is only as effective as a small caliber handgun, and offers very poor penetration against an armored target, the multiple projectiles increases the likelihood of one or more peripheral wounds<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unless you want to employ a fully-auto 0.5 Browning HMG at vehicle checkpoint on Singapore, your next less "lethal" and "intimidating" weapon is a shotgun loaded with solid-shot. There are solid shots designed to engage on-coming thin-skinned vehicle frontally.  They can penetrate the radiator without losing much velocity and shatter the engine block, stopping the vehicle in it's track with a few well-aimed rounds.<br><br>You might have seen demo where the full-metal jacket 5.56mm round and 9mm round penetrate the doors of ordinary sedan and maiming the subjects in the cabin.  Those shots are fired at the side of the vehicle, a broadside.  To hit the driver from the front is a different story.  The 2-litre engine block is in the way and the slopped wind-screen may deflect off the puny 5.56mm and 9mm rounds.   You don't want to take chances when you engaged an explosive-packed sedan with a suicide bomber behind the wheel.  He/She might have rigged the vehicle to crash in the event that he/she met a "pre-mature" death.  You want reliable stopping power from well-aimed shots in a crowded and flammable environment.<br><br>Gun designs in the 60's and 70's are built around the cartridge.  In terms of gun design, we have reached a plateau in gun performance i.e., design-wise, we have max out on ergonomics, weight, reliability and etc.<br><br>So, if you want to design the next revoluntionary kinetic energy based assault rifle, please start on the cartridge.</div>
