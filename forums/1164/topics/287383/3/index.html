            <div class='col-md body'>Ever been to Jurong Island? After you exchanged your ID for visitor pass, please observed closely the layout and human traffic at the main vehicle checkpoints that all vehicles commute through to gain access to the island proper and the refineries.  There are flammable and toxic oil-tankers and chemical-tankers entering and leaving via the checkpoints. There are also SBS buses and civilian vehicles entering and leaving the island as well.  Armed police and soldiers are prowling the area.  This is a crucial choke point.<br><br>In such confined area, do you want to fire the following weapons and cause fratricide among civilians and fellow POI personnel:<br><br><strong>40MM AGL<br>M203<br>GPMG<br>SAW<br>LAW lah..we have so many now since the matador is introduced..(just dont miss this MFker lands with a boom)<br>Claymore - this is one big big boom.<br><br>Anyway, any KINS will be barricaded and sand bagged</strong>[/b]<br><br>Check out the kill radius and maximum effective range of the weapon suggested above.  Sure, they are the most effective tools to stop soft-skinned and armour vehicles but do you want to employ their effects in close proximity to friendlies.  Not to mention there is no clear front-line and there are concentration of highly-flammable and toxic materials in the confined area.  Woah, great John Woo's Hollywood effects hit the news, terrorist organization rush in to claim of resounding success even if you managed to vapourize their attack before it reach the refineries.  Loss of Home Team and SAF's credibility.<br><br>You want to minimise collateral damage to your assets and reduce the propaganda value of a terrorist's bombing attack. A war zone is the last thing we want in Singapore.<br></div>

There are solid shots designed to engage on-coming thin-skinned vehicle frontally.  They can penetrate the radiator without losing much velocity and shatter the engine block, stopping the vehicle in it's track with a few well-aimed rounds. </div></blockquote>I think you are referring to what is called shotgun "slugs".<br><br>Basically, instead of 9 buckshot pellets, you have just one big, chunk of lead with a diameter about 20mm, estimation. (By comparison, a .5 bullet is only 12.7mm.)<br><br>This round penetrates by sheer force, as opposed to being sharp-pointed, AP qualities and velocity.<br><br>A shotgun slug may indeed disable a car engine as you said. It may laso do so by imply shttering some parts of the engine casing etc.<br><br>Uses include being the ultimate man-stopper with the most knock down power and being used by SWAT and spec ops as a "universal key" - i.e. door lock buster. And by buster I mean the lock is simply smashed by brute force rather than by penetration, which is what a normal bullet would do.<br><br>Because of the lower velocity and shorter range there is more safety from over-penetration and ricochet.<br><br>A .5 is not suitable for police work for the obvious reason of over-penetration.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some slugs have what is known as "sabots" like the APFSDS tank rounds. This allows a more aerodynamic slimmer slug to be fired through a shotgun barrel. This sabot packs around the slug as it travels down the shotgun barrel but leaves the slug once it exits the barrel. THis is how it is packed inside the shell:<br><img src="http://www.gunandsport.com/images/ammo/hornady-sst-slug-2.jpg"><br><br>...<br><br><img src="http://forensic.iwate-med.ac.jp/lectures/firearms/slug.jpg"><br>THis picture shows a rifled, un-saboted slug.<br><br>...<br><br><img src="http://forensic.iwate-med.ac.jp/lectures/firearms/20gage.jpg"><br>This picture shows a typical 12-gauge "shot" shell. this one is probably filled with "birdshot".<br><br>...<br><br><img src="http://images.outdoorinteractive.net/mgen/292310_d.jpg"><br><img src="https://www.bandpusa.com/Shopping/images/red%20box%20shot%20gun%20shell.jpg"><br>By comparison, 12-gauge with " 00 buckshot".

You plan to minimise the chances of own-goal.<br><br>Special forces employed special rounds in ships and passenger jets to limit the chances of igniting volatile substances and penetration to sensitive objects.<br><br>A good combat leader must cultivate a habit to survey any potential area of operation they encounter and improve his tactical awareness. Lessons can be gleaned from legendary past battles where victory was claimed against all odds due to superior employment of tactics and weapon effect in dynamic setting.</div>
