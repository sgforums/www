Like they said, they can't retain the pilots they trained.  Losing a lot of them to airlines.<br><br>The Mig-29 has never been a very favorable aircraft internationally.  If they were that good, China would have gotten them, India would have gotten them.  These are the experts on good Russian hardware.

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that very often they fail to consider the type of air force they want to build, and measure it against what is required in the region.<br><br>Russian jets are highly capable combat fighters that unfortunately have very high servicing requirements and need often repairs.  But, they come cheap with low initial costs!<br><br>These fighters are great for countries where regional open war is common, and combat attrition is high, at a very lean price.  You need to scramble fighters against a potentially hostile track, u send the Russian made ones up to intercept.  This way, you don't lose too much $$ if it gets shot down.  Pray the pilot ejects and you can use him again!  This way, you have 1 less jet to service anyways.<br><br>But we are not in a region with common open wars.  In a way, we are in a rather peaceable region.  Where readiness is more important.  Being able to scramble on notice means jets need to be in tip top condition at any time.  Russian aircraft that needs to serviced so much more often than western counter-part may not be available to deliver this kinda readiness to countries in our region.<br><br>This is where I feel the RMAF have lost sight on. Unless, they are really preparing for open war...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

Just like their rifles, they've gotten the Steyrs and a few variants and now, they are looking for a replacement weapon like the M4 Carbine for the Steyrs...</div>
