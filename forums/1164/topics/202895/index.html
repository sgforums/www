            <div class='col-md body'>OK, here it is.<br><br><strong>Malaysia to place MiG-29s in storage</strong><br>Dzirhan Mahadzir JDW Correspondent<br><br>Kuala Lumpur<br>28-Jul-2006<br><br>Malaysia will de-activate its Russian Aircraft Corporation (RSK) MiG MiG-29N multirole fighter aircraft fleet in 2007 to ensure enough fighter pilots are available to operate the Sukhoi Su-30MKMs that will be delivered that same year.<br><br>The decision was made by the Malaysian Armed Forces in light of the fact that the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) has a shortage of qualified pilots and cannot make up the numbers in time to accommodate the entry of the Sukhois into RMAF service.<br><br>The RMAF's shortage of pilots stems from a combination of a lack of sufficient aircraft for lead-in fighter training, currently about 11 Aermacchi MB-339As, and shortcomings in the pilot training programme that were addressed in 2003, the ramifications of which are only now being felt.<br><br>In addition, a number of RMAF pilots have opted to leave the service for civil aviation, particularly in light of the demand for pilots by Malaysia's low-cost aviation carrier, Air Asia.<br><br>Currently the RMAF has one operational MiG-29 squadron, Squadron 19 based at RMAF Kuantan, that contains all 16 aircraft in the inventory. However, readiness problems have resulted in a low number of the fleet being operationally ready, although the newly appointed squadron commander is working to improve the situation. While details of their de-activation schedule are still being worked on, the MiG-29s are due to be placed in storage rather than being sold off to a third party because the RMAF hopes to bring the aircraft back into service once sufficient pilots are available.<br><br>The shortage of lead-in fighter aircraft trainers will be addressed through the purchase of eight MB-339 C/Ds, which is currently being negotiated.<br><br>Meanwhile, the RMAF's plans to purchase an undisclosed amount of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) bomb kits appears to be stalled owing to the fact that the purchase would also require upgrades to be made to the RMAF's Boeing F/A-18Ds in order to operate the JDAMs. The upgrades would entail additional funding that is expected to be unavailable given Malaysia's budgetary constraints.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho</div>
