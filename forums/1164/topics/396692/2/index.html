              <p>According to the <a title="2007 Constitution of Thailand" href="/wiki/2007_Constitution_of_Thailand"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Constitution of the Kingdom</span></a>, serving in the Armed Forces is a duty of all Thai citizens. However only males over the age of 21 who have not gone through reserve training are subjected to a random draft. Those chosen randomly are subjected to twenty-four months fulltime service, while volunteers are subjected to eighteen months service, depending on their education.</p>
              <p>i had work in thailand for couple of years. if u are rich kids family, you can buy your exemption. the drating system is not clear, even some thai could not explain it themselves clearly. however i would say, most dreaded it.</p>

              <p>well, most thai are peaceful ppl. the split is mainly because over the years, the majority poor thai have no say in the thai politics often rule by the thai elite class until the arrival of thaksin. i would not dwell into the characters of thaksin and his political agenda but he is very famous among the farmer class and north of thailand( his homeground).</p>
              <p>thus is ousted from politics by the elite bangkok class causes upset in the north of thailand and the general poor thai class.</p>
              <p>i would say, you fight for what you want. whether the majority poor farmers with no say forever or standup and be counted or support someone who had fought for their rights.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>militarily wise, i think soldiers all around the world dread the same thing--&gt; the need to open fire on the very people you have sworn to protect. that probably best explains the impasse in Thailand now. No matter how tough you are, firing on your own civilians is a tough thing for any man to do. however, militarily speaking, dun think the thai military is bad or wad, they have conscripts like us too, but i think they can really take hardship much better than we did. remembered a thai guide for us during an exercise telling me his war stories ( i speak thai), its incredible how much skirmishes they fight that is not reported. from insurgents to cambodian solders, this guide fought them all and probably that sums up their military capability. not stronger or weaker, but probably more experienced, and that in a military sense, works.</p></div>

              <p>aknoo you are right. no one would ever fancy firing at your own ppl. however i think the situation would be change as i read the top miliary command are due for a change. any aspiring general who dare to do what others dreaded could have the post.</p>
              <p>during the xinjiang crackdown, one of my drivers who has a brother serving the PLA told me, how they are order to shoot from holicopters at any mass gathering of crowds. the actual dead is much higher than official report coming from china. some soldiers hesitated but with their career at stake, most follow orders.</p>
