            <div class='col-md body'>Am I the only one who thinks the LSV is just a white elephant showpiece?<br><br>Sure they look sexy and dangerous but other than recce, they can do nothing more than harrassing or nuisance "shoot &amp; scoot" attacks. They are not even capable loading more stores for longer "LRRP" missions.<br><br>It provides no protection even from someone armed only with a pistol as it is almost completely open concept.<br><br>And what good is a LSV's cross-country ability in Singapore? Bash thru the jungle? So in our tropical zone they will be road-bound a lot of the time. And being road-bound, you better have armour. So like some others say, Hummer might be better.<br><br>So their real strategic value is not very clear.<br><br>I have a feeling SAF is fielding them to look more "garang" and also help in marketing these LSV Spiders to overseas clients.<br><br>China's PLA also has these "for show" units mounted in missile-armed open-concept jeeps. All these troops wear dark glasses and have helmet-mouted scopes and radios etc. Sure they look the business and are probably very capable fighting men. But again, nothing more than showpieces to give the impression that PLA is advanced.</div>

Think it also comes with an auto gearbox.<br><br>There is also another kind of jeep for the MILAN gunners as well as covered command jeeps. All are built on the Merc 240 chassis.</div>
