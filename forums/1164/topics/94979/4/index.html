            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Additional Piranha LAVs for Denmark </strong><br><br>(Source: Mowag AG; dated Oct. 7, 2004)<br><br>On October 5, 2004 the Danish Army Materiel Command (DAMC) and Mowag AG - a General Dynamics company - signed a contract for the delivery of 91 armoured vehicles of the Piranha IIIC 8x8 type with a total value of close to 140 Million Swiss Francs (approx. US$ 112 Million). This is already the third order from the Danish Army<br><br>At the beginning of this year, the Danish Army announced that it intended to use the Mowag Piranha III 8x8 as the standard platform for future procurement activities of protected vehicles in this category, after having ordered the first 22 Piranhas in 1997 and a further 22 Piranhas in 2003. The vehicles ordered in 2003 are at present being manufactured in Kreuzlingen.<br><br>The newly signed contract comprises 69 Piranha IIIC 8x8 in the APC, Ambulance, Command Post, and Reconnaissance vehicle versions and also the 22 APC and Ambulance vehicles contracted already in 2003. Delivery will start in February 2005 with the Ambulance vehicles being delivered first.<br><br>Mowag's CEO, Simon T. Honess, was proud and pleased about the close cooperation with Denmark, and he declared: "This contract is further proof of our customers' confidence in the performance and reliability of our Piranha, and of the good strategic partnership between the Danish authorities and Mowag AG".<br><br>The Piranhas of the most recent order, too, will be used primarily within the framework of international missions of the Danish Army, and thus signifies the changed focus of Danish Armed Forces. The threat situation in such missions specifically calls for a high level of protection for the vehicle crews against mines and ballistic weapons. With the Piranha IIIC 8x8, the technology-minded company from Kreuzlingen offers a proven vehicle, which fulfils this high-ranking requirement of protection. With its third order, the Danish Army continues to trust in the reliability and performance of the successful product from Kreuzlingen.<br><br>With the Piranha III, which is manufactured in the 8x8 and 10x10 versions and was first presented in 1997, Mowag has set the standard in the domain of armoured wheeled vehicles in the weight class of up to 20 t. The Piranha IIIC 8x8 is 7.58 m long and 2.66 m wide. The total useful volume in the interior is approx. 12 m3. On the road, the Piranha III reaches a speed of up to 100 km/h; it manages gradients of up to 60%, obstacles with a height of up to 60 cm, and fording depths of up to 1.5 m without problems.<br><br>The 400 HP Caterpillar engine, in connection with the ZF 7-speed automatic transmission, the modern independent wheel suspension, the tire pressure regulation system, and the disengageable all-wheel drive give the Piranha an outstanding mobility even in difficult terrain<br><br>Mowag AG of Kreuzlingen develops, designs, and manufactures technologically advanced special vehicles for military use. Far more than 10'000 armoured wheeled vehicles of the Mowag Piranha, Mowag EAGLE, and Mowag DURO series are fielded all over the world. Since October of 2003, Mowag is part of the General Dynamics European Land Combat Systems group, and employs a qualified staff of more than 500 in its Kreuzlingen site.<br></div>

ONR coordinates, executes and promotes the science and technology programs of the Navy and Marine Corps as well as providing technical advice to the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of the Navy.<br><br>The patented SeaCoaster catamaran design features cavities in the bottom of each hull into which air is blown providing lift to the vessel, reducing resistance, and thus allowing higher speeds to be obtained. Designer-inventor Don Burg expects speeds of up to 56 knots. Following its successful evaluation by ONR, American Marine Holdings expects various departments of the US military to decide on potential applications for the air-inducted technology and possibly order additional vessels for specific uses.<br>American Marine Holdings President, Mr. Mike Collins, said Austal was selected to build the vessel for ONR due to its expertise in aluminum vessel construction.<br><br>Â“Austal USA brings to this market a new dimension in high speed marine transport, utilizing the companyÂ’s leading edge technology and construction capabilities that were not previously available to US customers,Â” he said.<br><br>Principal particulars<br><br>--Overall length: 31.2 metres<br>--Beam: 9.75 metres<br>--Hull depth (moulded): 3.35 metres<br>--Main engines: 4 x 1045kW Caterpillar diesels<br>--Propulsion: 4 x ZF surface-piercing propellers<br>--Speed: 56 knots<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> F-16 Pilots Adopt New JHMCS Sight </strong><br><br>(Source: US Air Force; issued Oct. 13, 2004)<br><br>SPANGDAHLEM AIR BASE, Germany --- F-16 Fighting Falcon pilots here can now look, lock and launch on an enemy target in the blink of an eye. Because split seconds can mean the difference between life or death for a pilot in combat, the 52nd Fighter Wing here adopted an advanced approach to high-tech man-machine interaction with the Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System.<br><br>The system provides an electronic interface allowing the helmet and jet to communicate putting critical data less than three inches from a pilotÂ’s right eye. Human retinal nerve impulses and eye movement can be faster than one-twenty-fifth of a second. Pilots quickly locate, track, identify and lock onto airborne and ground-based targets at longer ranges and safer altitudes -- all by simply looking at a target, said Staff Sgt. Terence Zelek, a life-support technician with the 23rd Fighter Squadron. Â“By keeping their eyes pointed outside the cockpit, pilots will be better equipped to support the formation via visual lookout and avoid potential midair collisions in crowded airspace,Â” said Lt. Col. David Youtsey, 52nd Operations Support Squadron director of operations.<br><br>Avoiding such collisions is part of what makes the nearly $100,000 price tag per system money well spent, Colonel Youtsey said. Â“Compared to the cost of a trained pilot, the cost of the (F-16), or the cost of many weapons that are used only once, the price is not an issue,Â” he said. Â“(With) more survivable air attack engagements or faster destruction of enemy ground forces during a close-air support mission, the benefits are easily recognized. Â“Colonel Youtsey said the new system also pays dividends in training.<br><br>Â“Our young pilots will learn the skills and tactics necessary to transfer to more capable aircraft,Â” he said. Â“The skills acquired via (the system) will support the fielding decisions and employment tactics of those future stealthy platforms in an even more networked and sensor-dense battle space.Â”<br><br>One pilot said the ease of the helmet system makes the idea of returning to the Â“old-fashionedÂ” system unappealing, but he also recognizes the importance of meticulous training, fitting and assembly on the new system.<br><br>Â“Your head is connected to the end (of the cord) and inside the helmet,Â” said Capt. Kevin Lord, 23rd FS life-support officer and F-16 pilot. During an ejection or other mishap, Â“if the (system) is improperly connected, it could rip your head off.Â”<br><br>Three dedicated rides with an instructor, coupled with a regular flight schedule, should keep pilots proficient with the new equipment.<br><br>Â“When you know how to wear (the helmet) and itÂ’s properly fitted, itÂ’s awesome,Â” Captain Lord said. Â“ItÂ’s first look, first lock, first kill and now we can track altitude, speed and just about any information we need to keep the aircraft level and in our control.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Thailand Favors Gripen for F-5 Replacement </strong><br><br>(Source: Gripen International; web-posted Oct. 15, 2004)<br><br>Following the visit to Sweden by the Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra 23-24 September, and following a meeting with the Swedish Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson, he stated that Thailand is in favor of Gripen as its F-5 replacement aircraft.<br><br>This very positive statement has recently been confirmed by the C-in-C of the Royal Thai Air Force, Air Chief Marshall Kongsak Wantana, saying to the Reuters news agency in Bangkok on 8 October Â“We have decided to select Gripen fighters to replace our F-5 fleetÂ”.<br><br>However, the Thai interest in Gripen dates back to earlier briefings given by Gripen International to Thai officials. Gripen has also been presented to the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) on several occasions, including when the C-in-Chief of the Royal Swedish Air Force, Maj.Gen Jan Andersson, was on an official visit on the occasion of the RTAFÂ’s 90th anniversary on 26-27 March 2004.<br><br>While visiting the RTAF, Maj.Gen Andersson invited the RTAF to visit Sweden and familiarize itself with Gripen. The invitation was accepted and on 24 May, two pilots from the RTAF - Wing Commander Punpakdee Pattanakul (call sign Â“KaiÂ”) and Wing Commander Manat Chuanprayon (call sign Â“MaverickÂ”) - arrived at Swedish Air Force (SwAF) base F7 at SÃ¥tenÃ¤s, 120 kms north of Gothenburg in the west of Sweden.<br><br>The F7 wing is the home of two Gripen squadrons and the Gripen Centre, where all Gripen pilots undergo conversion and tactical training on Gripen. The Thai officers were given an introductory course on the Gripen aircraft which included 10 hours of flying.<br><br>In parallel, Swedish industry and Swedish authorities have held extensive talks with their Thai counterparts. A joint Swedish-Thai group, at the highest political level, will meet on a regular basis to prepare for a widespread bilateral agreement. The aim is to further develop the relations between Thailand and Sweden and to create a bilateral co-operation program serving as a base for a possible future sale of Gripen to Thailand. An acquisition of Gripen for the RTAF could be part of such a co-operation program, as could other products of the Saab Group or other companies.<br><br>Â“We are naturally very pleased with the positive signals we have received from ThailandÂ”, says Kaj Rosander, Thai Project Manager at Gripen International.<br><br>Â“The Thai Air Force is well known for its high standard of operations and with Gripen being seen as the prime replacement for their F-5Â’s, it is a further evidence of GripenÂ’s capabilities both in terms of performance as well economicallyÂ” he added.<br><br></div>

"The RFP will be available to qualified shipbuilding organisations that have entered into agreements with the Commonwealth in relation to confidentiality and related matters."<br><br>Senator Hill said tender documents for the $4.5-$6 billion project have been developed by Defence in consultation with independent commercial adviser Carnegie Wylie &amp; Company.<br><br>The tender for the construction of the AWDs will remain open for approximately nine weeks. Defence will then evaluate tender responses, with Government to receive a recommendation on the preferred shipbuilder in March 2005.<br><br>Once appointed, the preferred shipbuilder will be in a position to assist the Commonwealth select the preferred design for the AWD in mid 2005.<br><br>Senator Hill said tenders will be sought on an alliance-style contract basis, with the vessels to be built in Australia. The successful shipbuilder will be majority Australian-owned and be required to satisfy a range of price and non-price criteria, including:<br><br>--Commitment to the principles of a long-term risk sharing arrangement with the Commonwealth and other industry partners for the construction of the AWDs;<br><br>--A cost, overhead and pricing structure that will enable the cost effective delivery of the AWDs, including the ability to build designs considering 'whole of life' costs;<br><br>--A sound record of past performance in building naval vessels;<br><br>--Commercial viability and financial backing;<br><br>--Access to the skilled workforce required to produce ships to the Commonwealth's requirements;<br><br>--Willingness to provide open financial accounting data - including visibility through to the sub-contractor level - to the Commonwealth;<br><br>--Capacity to provide the Commonwealth with transparency and contractual influence over major sub-contractors; and<br><br>--Capacity to access sensitive technology required for the AWD project.<br><br>Companies bidding for the AWDs will be required to include Australian skills and training programs in their tenders, with Defence to fund companies for extra skills generation and training benefits in the programs.<br><br>The AWDs represent a quantum leap in the air warfare capabilities of the Royal Australian Navy. The vessels, which are to be introduced into service from 2013, will be equipped with the world-class AEGIS radar that is capable of detecting and defeating multiple hostile aircraft and missiles at ranges in excess of 150 kilometres.<br><br>The AWDs will also have an anti-submarine and anti-shipping capability, together with the potential for the ships' sensors to be used to detect ballistic missiles in flight. They will provide significantly increased protection from air attack for troops being transported and deployed and long-range air warfare defence for a Navy task group.<br><br>As outlined earlier this year, the Government has asked the international design houses Blohm &amp; Voss of Germany; Gibbs &amp; Cox of the Unites States and Izar of Spain to produce evolved concept designs based on their existing ship classes the Saschen Class F124 Frigate; the Arleigh Burke Class Guided Missile Destroyer; and the Alvaro De Bazan Class F100 Frigate respectively.<br><br>The AWD project provides a massive opportunity for Australian industry to participate at both the prime and sub-contractor level. The project will also create new Australian jobs and skills and strengthen Australia's strategic industrial base.<br><br></div>
