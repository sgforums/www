            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Greece Receives New SHORAD System </strong><br><br>(Source: Rheinmetall DeTec; issued Oct. 5, 2004)<br><br>The delivery of the Advanced Short Range Air Defence System ASRAD Hellas to Greece is an important step in the transformation of the Hellenic Army. ASRAD Hellas will enhance the combat power of light, air-transportable units in combination with mechanized forces, enabling the effective engagement of all types of aerial targets.<br><br>ASRAD Hellas is the most advanced and most formidable short-range air defense system anywhere. It was designed especially with the new tasks of the Greek Armed Forces in mind, and for international missions in particular, where the Hellenic ArmyÂ’s air defense capability will prove to be a valuable asset.<br><br>In August 2000 the Hellenic Army decided to procure 54 vehicle-mounted Stinger systems. In the face of stiff international competition the Bremen-based company Rheinmetall Defence Electronics GmbH (RDE), formerly known as STN Atlas Elektronik GmbH, won a contract encompassing co-operation agreements with Hellenic Defence Systems (HDS), its Greek partner, then known as EBO, as well as extensive offset agreements. Since June 2004 the Hellenic Army has taken receipt of the first three systems Â– which have now already entered service Â– out of a total of 54 ASRAD-Hellas fire units.<br><br>The ASRAD Hellas is configured to enable reliable target detection, identification and engagement at day and night under all possible conditions of visibility and weather. Thanks to its modularity and flexibility the ASRAD Hellas fire unit embodies significant growth potential, permitting it to operate with passive and active surveillance sensors such as infrared search and track devices and external 2D or 3D surveillance radars. The system is operated by a 2-man team, consisting of the driver, who has the secondary task of air space observer, and the operator of the weapon system.<br><br>ASRAD Hellas is related to the German ArmyÂ’s LeFlaSys light mechanized air defence system, and especially to its OZELOT fire unit, a very light, highly mobile and air transportable system. A modular missile system featuring high firepower for day and night operation, each ASRAD-Hellas weapon system carries four ready-to-fire Stinger missiles and holds an additional four missiles ready for a fast reload.<br><br>This Stinger platform is identical with the platform of the OZELOT fire unit of GermanyÂ’s VSHORAD program, which is one of the most modern VSHORAD systems worldwide. As carrier vehicle the Hellenic Army opted for the HMMWV produced by ELBO/AMG. The complete ASRAD weapon system is installed in the rear of the vehicle. It comprises the pedestal with a sensor package containing an infrared camera (FLIR), a daylight camera and a laser rangefinder. The pedestal can be elevated for operation and has a 360Â° pivot radius as well as an extensive elevation range (-10Â° to +70Â°).<br><br>The sensor and system electronics include missile interface electronics, an automatic video tracker and two multipurpose launchers for four ready-to-fire Stinger missiles.<br><br>Besides the Stinger, ASRAD fire units are generally capable of firing other types of missile as well. A modified version of the Russian IGLA missile is qualified and approved for use with the German LeFlaSys, while the ASRAD-R configuration of the system can fire laser-guided missiles such as RBS 70 and Bolide, both produced by Saab Bofors Dynamics of Sweden.<br><br>The main advantages of the ASRAD-Hellas are:<br><br>--Rapid deployment (less than five minutes after unloading e.g. from a helicopter)<br>--Rapid reaction (ready to fire in less than ten seconds)<br>--Reliable multi target capability<br>--High operational availability<br>--Automatic system operation mode (avoidance of human errors)<br>--Ease of operation, training and maintenance<br>--Automatic system test (built-in test equipment/BITE)<br>--Stationary defense (fixed assets, area defense, remote control mode)<br>--Mobile defense (convoys, task forces, maneuvering elements)<br>--Cooperative logistics among user nations<br>--Large growth potential due to the modular system concept<br><br>For integrated system operations during national and international missions, the ASRAD Hellas can be equipped with additional C3I interface software for network-enabled operations and links to upper echelon allied operation centers.<br><br>The system can be deployed in either stationary or mobile mode. Limitations of the Stinger missile with respect to pitch and roll acceleration on the move have had to be taken into account. During stationary operation the control and display unit (CDU) can be separated from the vehicle and connected to the system by a cable for remote operation. The maximum distance for remote control is 100 meters.<br><br>Following Germany and Finland, Greece is now the third European nation relying on SHORAD know-how from RDE.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> US May Beef Up Forces in Asia Pacific </strong><br><br>(Source: Voice of America; issued Oct. 6, 2004)<br><br>The Pentagon is planning to add another submarine to two others already deployed to the Pacific island of Guam, and is considering stationing an aircraft carrier strike group there as well. The deployments would put the U.S. military in a position to respond more quickly to a crisis in Asia, including one on the Korean peninsula.<br><br>A third nuclear powered submarine is set to arrive at the U.S. naval base on Guam in December. The island is already home to two other attack submarines able to seek and destroy enemy vessels and the Navy is reported to be considering basing three more there as well, each with a crew of about 150 sailors. In addition, the Defense Department has long been looking into moving an aircraft carrier battle group to either Guam or Hawaii.<br><br>Guam is strategically located about four hours flying time from the Asian mainland, significantly reducing the travel time needed to respond to a regional crisis. The enhanced U.S. military presence would be part of an on-going realignment of U.S. forces overseas, with the Pentagon shifting personnel and assets to regions where threat levels suggest they may be needed.<br><br>While no final decisions have been made, the top U.S. military commander for the Pacific region has told Congress tensions on the Korean peninsula and the China-Taiwan issue demand an improved force presence and increased agility.<br><br>James Lilley served as American ambassador to South Korea during the 1980s. The threat posed by North Korea, he says, does not come from the countryÂ’s military, but from the risk that Pyongyang will use or pass on nuclear weapons to other nations or terrorists.<br><br>Â“Their military can be handled,Â” he said. Â“[ItÂ’s] their weapons of mass destruction. They know if they ever use nuclear, biological, chemical weapons in South Korea or Asia, they will be obliterated. Even [President] Clinton said this.Â”<br><br>But South Korea is still wary of doing anything that could be read as a sign of weakness by the north. On Wednesday, the United States and South Korea announced both countries had agreed to a much slower withdrawal of some 12,000 American troops from the Korean peninsula than initially planned, a redeployment that will be carried out in stages over the next four years.<br><br>Â“As youÂ’ve seen in the paper this morning, the South Koreans are pleading with us not to cut back unilaterally too soon and weÂ’ve adjusted this to their time schedule, phasing it out over the next four or five years,Â” James Lilley said.<br><br>North Korea is already reacting to news of the possible enhanced U.S. military deployments. The countryÂ’s official news agency calls them a very dangerous option by the United States, one that amounts to placing military pressure on Pyongyang, and suggests Washington should consider the consequences.<br></div>

The 321 armored and non-armored vehicles represent an investment of $93 million, and will replace the ArmyÂ’s current fleet of ageing Land Rovers.<br><br>At the handover ceremony, Mark Burton said that this was another significant step towards achieving governmentÂ’s goal of a modernized, sustainable Defence Force.<br><br>Â“Purchasing these new vehicles reinforces once again the positive progress we are making in re-equipping all three services of the NZDF. Along with new field communications systems, Light Armoured Vehicles, weaponry, and technology upgrades, this government has already invested close to $1 billion in the Army alone.<br><br>Â“Earlier this week, I signed the contract for a $352 million mission systems and communication and navigation equipment upgrade for our fleet of P-3 Orion aircraft. These planes are critical for surveillance of New ZealandÂ’s Exclusive Economic Zone and surrounding waters, search and rescue, and meeting our South Pacific obligations. This upgrade will ensure interoperability with our security partners, allow New Zealand to participate in a range of operations, and provide support to the Defence ForceÂ’s other maritime and land force elements.<br><br>Â“When this government took office in late 1999, we inherited a force suffering from nine years of neglect and an ad-hoc approach to funding and acquisitions. IÂ’m proud to say that we have brought an end to that era with the Defence Long-Term Development PlanÂ—a planning tool that will enable the government to make acquisition decisions in the context of defense policy, priority of projects, and affordability over the next decade.<br><br>Â“Since the PlanÂ’s release in 2002, 22 major re-equipment projects have been advanced. They include investments in seven new purpose-built naval vessels, a 15-year life extending upgrade of our C-130 Hercules aircraft, the purchase of two 757-200 jet aircraft to replace our ageing 727s, an upgrade of the runway at Ohakea Air Base, and the invitation of proposals for the replacement of Air Force utility and training helicopters.<br><br>Â“We have ended the shameful level of neglect visited on our Defence Force by National throughout the 1990s,Â” said Mark Burton.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Boeing Sees $208Bn Market in Northeast Asia </strong><br><br>(Source: Boeing Co.; issued Oct. 7, 2004)<br><br>YOKOHAMA, Japan --- Boeing sees a $208 billion market for new commercial airplanes in Northeast Asia during the next 20 years, according to the company's 2004 Current Market Outlook. That report is widely regarded as the industry's most comprehensive and respected analysis of the commercial aviation market.<br><br>The Northeast Asia market consists of Japan and Korea . In terms of U.S. dollar value of airplanes delivered, it's the largest in the Asia-Pacific region, with the majority of forecast deliveries being intermediate twin-aisle airplanes such as the Boeing 777 and 7E7.<br><br>"The long-term market outlook remains positive," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes Vice President of Marketing Randy Baseler during the Japan Aerospace 2004 tradeshow. "Even severe downturns such as we've experienced during the past few years do not change the fundamentals of economic growth and the need for people to travel."<br><br>Boeing projects that Northeast Asia airlines will need almost 1,600 new passenger and freighter airplanes over the next 20 years. More than 50 percent (807 airplanes) will be intermediate twin-aisle airplanes. In dollar terms, these airplanes are nearly 63 percent of the $208 billion that airlines in the region will invest in new equipment.<br><br>In addition, 35 percent of the deliveries, or 553 airplanes, will be single aisles. Ten percent (156 airplanes) will be for 747 and larger airplanes, and nearly one-third of these (51 airplanes) will be new large freighters, while five percent (72 airplanes) will be regional jets.<br><br>The new freighter market is 81 units, valued at $19 billion. In addition, passenger airplanes will be converted to freighter configuration to help serve the region's air cargo markets.<br><br>A key finding in the 2004 Current Market Outlook is the increase in the number of frequencies and city pairs between Japan and China .<br><br>In 1990 there were only 59 weekly frequencies of direct service between cities in those countries, and ninety-five percent went through Beijing or Shanghai . Today the number of Japan and China city pairs has increased more than five times, while weekly frequencies have risen eight-fold, to 463.<br><br>"Passengers want the freedom to go where they want to go, when they want to go," Baseler said. "In a competitive market, airlines will continue to meet passengers' demands for more nonstop, point-to-point flights and increased frequency choice, which doesn't rely on larger airplanes."<br><br>Boeing expects this trend of increasing frequency choice and more nonstop service to continue because that is what passengers want.<br><br>"The same pattern is true for the Japan domestic market where airplane size decreased after deregulation in 1996," said Baseler. "This resulted in an increase in frequencies and nonstop markets to accommodate the air travel growth and reduction in airplane capacity to the benefit of the passenger."<br><br>Average air traffic to and from Northeast Asia will grow 6.1 percent annually during the next two decades, exceeding the world average growth of 5.2 percent; while traffic within Northeast Asia is forecast to grow at a 5.4 percent annual rate.<br><br>In the period of 2004-2023, air travel growth in the combined Asia-Pacific market is expected to grow at 6.0 percent.<br><br>Worldwide, Boeing projects that operators will invest $2.0 trillion for approximately 25,000 new commercial airplanes during the next 20 years.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> US Navy Retires AIM-54 Phoenix Missile </strong><br><br>(Source: US Navy; issued Oct. 7, 2004)<br><br>PATUXENT RIVER, Md. --- After 30 years of highly accomplished service, the U.S. Navy retired its first long-range air-to-air missile, the AIM-54 Phoenix, Sept. 30.<br><br>One of the worldÂ’s most technologically advanced tactical missiles, the AIM-54 Phoenix was the first operational radar-guided air-to-air missile that could be launched in multiple numbers against different targets from an aircraft, making the Phoenix the NavyÂ’s main fleet air defense long-range weapon.<br><br>Â“The heart of the F-14 Tomcat (soon also to retire) weapons system is the Hughes AWG-9 fire control system, capable of tracking 24 targets and firing six AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles engaging six different targets,Â” said Capt. Scott Stewart, the NavyÂ’s program manager for Air-to-Air Missile Systems. Â“With a range of over 100 miles, the AIM-54 gave the F-14 the greatest stand-off engagement capability of any fighter in the world. For years, Soviet air crews flying Badger, Bear and Backfire bombers feared the unprecedented capabilities of the Phoenix Missile.Â”<br><br>Â“As we retire the AIM-54 Phoenix missile, we pay tribute to the men and women of Naval Aviation, Grumman and Hughes who designed, tested and operationally employed the Phoenix for over 30 years,Â” added Stewart. Â“Since the earliest days of carrier aviation, air superiority fighters have been called upon to provide air cover for the fleet. None have been more formidable in performing this mission than F-14 Tomcats armed with AIM-54 Phoenix Missiles.<br><br>Â“I know IÂ’m just one of many that will miss the Phoenix, but IÂ’m also fortunate to be involved with the development of transformational missile technologies,Â” he added. Â“I am confident that our warfighters have the best warfighting capabilities in the world, even with the Phoenix retired.Â”<br><br>A product of two U.S. missile programs Â– the NavyÂ’s Bendix AAM-N-10 Eagle and the Air ForceÂ’s Hughes GAR-9, Phoenix long-range intercept concept development began in 1960. The Hughes Aircraft Company was first selected to develop the Phoenix in 1962, with the Raytheon Company joining later in 1988.<br><br>After five years of research and development, the first prototype flight tests were conducted in 1965. Sept. 8, 1966, an A-3A Skywarrior performed the first successful full-scale test using all missile control system functions over the Navy Pacific Missile Range near San Nicholas Island, Calif.<br><br>Nov. 21, 1973, marked a milestone for Phoenix with the first full arsenal testing on an F-14 operating over the Pacific Missile Sea Test Range. Within 38 seconds, the Tomcat launched and simultaneously guided six Phoenix missiles, at six separate targets 50 miles away, scoring four direct hits.<br><br>The AIM-54A entered service with the U.S. Navy in 1973 and became operational in 1974. The first F-14A Tomcat squadrons to use the Phoenix were Strike Fighter Squadron (VF) 1 Â“WolfpackÂ” and VF-2 Â“Bounty Hunters.Â”<br><br>After several variants, the long-range concept ultimately evolved, providing Phoenix the capability to initially guide itself using the semi-active radar mode and the TomcatÂ’s AWG-9 weapon control system, and when close enough to its target, assume guidance control using the active radar system. The C variant incorporated a new active radar fuse and higher-thrust motor. Combining these upgrades improved its overall effectiveness and intercept capabilities. The AIM-54C was introduced to the fleet in 1981, and entered full-rate production in January 1984.<br></div>

The fires were in the electrical circuits and have caused extensive damage. HMCS Chicoutimi has lost power and propulsion and efforts are currently underway to restore steering. The submarine was on the surface at the time of the fires.<br><br>HMS Montrose arrived at the scene at 1300 6 October. A medical team was transferred by boat to the submarine HMS Marlborough and RFA Wave Knight have also now arrived at the scene. Two Search and Rescue Sea King helicopters and a Merlin helicopter are deployed to Northern Ireland on standby to provide assistance if required. RFA Argus is also on route to provide assistance. Argus has the ability to support helicopters for an extended period close to the scene. A specialist tug, the MV Anglian Prince is also en route to provide assistance and a specialist vessel the MV Carolyn Chouest, a US submarine support vessel is en route from Faslane expected to arrive later today.<br><br>Following the evacuation by Royal Navy Sea King of three casualties suffering from smoke inhalation last night the Canadian government announced the death of Lt Chris Saunders, as a result of his injuries sustained in fighting the fire on board. Two other casualties are receiving medical treatment in hospital in Northern Ireland.<br><br>The Royal NavyÂ’s objective is to support the Canadian submarine and help provide logistics, medical, aviation and moral support to the crew. Efforts are also being made to restore electrical supply to the submarine. The crew has plenty of food and water on the submarine and the ambient temperature remains good. Specialist technical support is being provided on HMS Montrose.<br><br>Weather conditions remain difficult with strong winds and wave heights of some 5 metres. It is hoped the weather will moderate by the morning of Friday 8 October to provide an opportunity to take the submarine undertow to safe waters if her propulsion cannot be restored..<br></div>

He said Paris would push the European Union to lift its embargo as swiftly as possible. But the French president acknowledged strong reservations remained on the part of the United States and of some EU members about rescinding the embargo.<br><br>Germany has sided with France in favor of lifting the arms embargo. But other European countries, such as the Netherlands and Sweden, oppose doing so.<br><br>Washington and Taiwan are also opposed to lifting the weapons ban. Indeed the publication of Mr. Chirac's remarks Thursday came as a top U.S. official was meeting with EU diplomats about maintaining the ban.<br><br>Mr. Chirac's interview with the Chinese news agency comes ahead of his state visit to China, which begins Friday. The French president is currently in Vietnam.<br><br>In January, France launched a special cultural year on China, which included hosting China's President Hu Jintao and featuring Chinese writers in its annual book fair in Paris.<br><br>During Mr. Hu's visit in January, Mr. Chirac also appealed for the EU to lift its arms embargo on China. And he criticized plans by Taiwanese politicians to hold a referendum on separating from China as "irresponsible and dangerous."<br><br>Along with politics, economics is central to Mr. Chirac's upcoming visit to China. Trade between the EU and China is booming. The French president told the Chinese news agency he hopes to double the number of small and medium-sized French companies doing business in China, and would push for a French company to secure a contract to build a high-speed rail link between Beijing and Shanghai.<br><br>Meanwhile, two French human rights groups Thursday called on Mr. Chirac to stress human rights issues during his talks with Chinese officials during his visit.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Poland, Latvia to Join Mine Ban Treaty </strong><br><br>(Source: International Campaign to Ban Landmines; issued Oct. 1, web-posted Oct. 6, 2004)<br><br>Poland says it no longer sees any obstacles to joining the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty and Latvia confirms it will come on board by the Nairobi Summit on a Mine-Free World (29 November - 3 December 2004). These positive steps put Finland to shame: Helsinki recently reversed a previous commitment and now only plans to accede to the treaty in 2012.<br><br>On 22 September 2004, Polish Minister of Defence Jerzy Szmajdzinski announced that he informed the Foreign Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz that he did not see any obstacles for Poland to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty. This is a welcome breakthrough and an important departure from PolandÂ’s long-standing arguments for not starting the ratification process. Poland signed the Convention seven years ago and needed to ratify in order to become a treaty member and thus be bound by its obligations. It is now in the hands of Mr Cimoszewicz to ensure that Poland becomes a Party to the Convention soon. Given the administrative procedures involved in ratification it is thought that this might not be possible before the landmark Nairobi Summit.<br><br>The calendar is more favourable to Latvia, where the accession law seems to be ready and waiting for the next Cabinet of Ministers meeting before it goes to the Parliament for adoption. On 1 October LatviaÂ’s Ambassador in Geneva Janis Karklins said he was confident that this process would be completed before the 28 of November. Latvia is a non-member state of the treaty and needs to complete the process of accession in order to become a treaty member.<br><br>The good news coming from Northeastern Europe was unfortunately clouded by the Government of FinlandÂ’s decision to accede to the Treaty in 2012. On 2 September, the Finnish press reported that the government was going to propose that Finland would accede the Ottawa Treaty in 2012, in its White Paper on defence policy. Stockpiled mines would be destroyed by 2016, according to the proposal and the Defence Force would receive EUR 200 million to replace outdated mines and would need to save EUR 100 million in future spending. Additional funding would be staggered over a period of eight years.<br><br>In a press release, the Finnish CBL denounced, Â“ this decision as an intolerable attempt to escape the international responsibility. In the previous Security and Defence Policy Review, Finland was scheduled to accede the Treaty in 2006. The decision cannot be delayed again. The present government cannot make decisions that would bind the next government or the one following that. (Â…) It is impossible to continue the policy of double standard, where Finland is supposedly committed to the Ottawa process goals but still intends to keep the landmines until the end of their technical life cycle.Â” The White Paper will be transmitted to the Parliament for final decision. A debate on its conclusions, including the accession to the Mine Ban Treaty, should be scheduled during the Fall.<br><br>The three are the only States not party to the Mine Ban Treaty amongst the European UnionÂ’s 25 members. Neighbours, Belarus, Estonia and Lithuania joined in recent years. Globally, there are 143 members of the treaty.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Germany Mulls Tank Sale to Turkey </strong><br><br>(Source: Deutsche Welle German radio; issued Oct. 12, 2004)<br><br>Barely a week after the European Commission recommended initiating membership talks with Turkey, the German government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country.<br><br>Government officials are mulling the shipment of several hundred Leopard 2 tanks to Turkey, according to the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper.<br><br>The German defense ministry has denied any such plans, adding that Turkish officials haven't made an official request so far. But German Defence Minister Peter Struck said last week that the progress Turkey has made on opening negotiations to join the European Union mean arms sales should no longer be a taboo subject.<br><br>The Bundeswehr, the German military, no longer needs the tanks, which were built for combat in central Europe's open and flat regions. The vehicles no longer suit the military's new concept of being able to quickly respond to crisis situations abroad.<br><br>Five years ago, the proposal to sell the tanks to Turkey already provoked one of the worst conflicts within Germany's ruling coalition of Social Democrats and Greens. At the time, the then parliamentary leader of the Greens, Kerstin MÃ¼ller, voiced her party's concerns.<br><br>"We think this is the wrong decision," she said. The Greens' resistance eventually blocked the sale of 1,000 Leopard 2 tanks for about EUR 7 billion ($8.6 billion). Now, the junior coalition partner is once again raising questions about a possible deal with Turkey.<br><br>"The European Commission recommends negotiations (with Turkey) and Germany starts talking about tanks," said Claudia Roth, the party's new co-chair, adding that the discussion left a bad taste in her mouth.<br><br>Roth added that she wasn't necessarily opposed to a sale. But "there's no blank check for a single country in the world -- no EU country, no NATO country," she said, adding that the Commission's recommendation on Turkey did not automatically justify an arms sale. "Every single application has to be examined and then people will have to make a decision," Roth said.<br><br>Germany had previously rejected arms sales to Turkey because of concerns about the oppression of the country's Kurdish minority. German arms export laws prevent sales to countries in which the arms could increase tensions or conflicts.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> US Army to Trial New Night Sight </strong><br><br>(Source: Northrop Grumman Corp.; issued Oct. 12, 2004)<br><br>GARLAND, Texas --- Northrop Grumman Corporation has delivered its first Fused Multispectral Weapon Sight (FMWS) to the U.S. Army.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Rafale F1 Operational with French Navy </strong><br><br>(Source: Snecma; issued Oct. 12, 2004)<br><br>This announcement comes almost three months after the F1-standard Rafale (air-air) was officially declared operational by Admiral Jean-Louis Battet, Naval Chief of Staff, at a ceremony on the naval airbase of Squadron 12F in Landivisiau. This is the base to which the first production Rafales were delivered in July 2000.<br><br>Four years after this first delivery, Admiral BattetÂ’s announcement marks the culmination of a long maturing process in which several Snecma Group companies took part each in their particular domains, ranging from propulsion to equipment. The next stage in the power ramp-up of the Â“omnifunctionÂ” fighter will be the delivery of F2-standard aircraft (air-air and air-ground) to the French Air Force by the end of 2004 for an operational evaluation scheduled to last until 2006.<br><br>The entry into operational service of the F1-standard Rafale M (single-seat models of the French Navy) was declared on June 25th on the Landivisiau naval airbase. This facility is the base for the 12F Squadron, the first Fleet Air Arm unit to fly these fighters, located in the Department of FinistÃ¨re, Brittany. The ceremony gave Admiral Jean-Louis Battet, Naval Chief of Staff, the opportunity to underline the efforts made by the personnel of the French Navy, the DGA (General Delegation for Armament), and the various industrial players involved, in what he described as a Â“a maturing process spanning four years, from delivery of the first production aircraft in July 2000Â”.<br><br>The attainment of F3 standard, that is to say the validation of the acquisition of new operational modes, primarily concerned the electronic and weapon systems, both of which incorporate several remarkable technological advances. At the same time, dozens of modifications were made to other systems and equipment, with a view to the overall optimization of the RafaleÂ’s performance.<br><br>To give an example of this optimization, the first M88-2 engines designed and produced by Snecma Moteurs that equipped the first Rafales delivered to 12F Squadron were provided with retrofit kits to increase the critical component lifetime and reduce fuel consumption. The Rafale engines have fully earned their reputation as true Â“thoroughbredsÂ”: their power, speed of response, reliability and ease of maintenance have won over all the 12F Squadron personnel, pilots and mechanics alike.<br><br>As Lieutenant Christian Cosmo, Head of the Technical Services of the 12F Squadron, points out: Â“the M88-2 engines have demonstrated excellent reliability in spite of the most taxing climatic conditions: relentless heat and very high levels of humidity. Technical interventions have been very rare, and we have shown that an engine can be replaced in less than one hour. We even managed to remove and reinstall two M88-2 engines in 1 h 45 min. And the modular design of the engines has made maintenance operations considerably easier.Â”<br><br>Another item of equipment produced by a Snecma group company has also proved its worth, namely the landing system designed by Messier-Dowty. This landing system, the only one of its kind in the world, has a Â“jumperÂ” landing gear capable of springing out when the aircraft is catapulted by the nose-gear strut. In mere fractions of a second, this gives the Rafale Â– the only delta / canard fighter operating from aircraft carriers Â– the ideal angle of attack for takeoff. Feedback on the experience in the particularly demanding operating conditions of the Navy has been very favorable, coming from thousands of catapult launch-arrested landing cycles performed by the 12F Squadron aircraft.<br><br>Having reached full operational maturity, the F1-standard Rafale has shown itself to be capable of accomplishing the entire spectrum of offensive and defensive air-air missions: air superiority (escort or sweep), sky policing (identification and inspection) and air defense of the Fleet Air Arm Group and of the national territory. The first nine aircraft of the 12F Squadron commanded by Commander Pierre Vandier have totaled more than 4,500 flying hours and 2,000 arrested landings on the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier.<br><br>The know-how acquired by the pilots and technicians of 12F now enables them to use the Rafale to the utmost of its capacities, even in extreme conditions, as they recently demonstrated between March and May during the Agapanthe 2004 deployment in the Middle East and India. The results of engagements against other fighter aircraft used by allied countries exceeded the highest expectations. According to the pilots of 12F Squadron, the Rafale is indeed an exceptional aircraft, and the score of victories obtained against F-14 Tomcats, F-15 Eagles and F/A-18 Hornets is remarkably high.<br><br>Entry of the first F2-standard Rafales B/C models (two-seater/single-seater) into service with the French Air Force by the end of 2004 will give a new impetus to the Rafale program, as the progressive build-up to omnifunction capacity is going to be accentuated with the coming deliveries. They should allow the creation of an operational evaluation unit for the new Rafales at Mont-de-Marsan as of the end of the year, and the setting up of the first squadron at Saint-Dizier in 2005. The French Navy, for its part, should start taking delivery of its first Rafale F2s in 2006, with a view to equipping a second Squadron in 2007.<br></div>
