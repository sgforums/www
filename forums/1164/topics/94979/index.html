            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Rabbit Brand new land-attack cruise missile </strong><br>By Wendell Minnick 21 September 2004<br>(Source: Janes News Brief)<br><br>China has test-fired a new land attack cruise missile (LACM) designated Dong Hai-10 (DH-10), or East China Sea-10.<br><br>A US defence source identified the DH-10 as a ground-launched second-generation LACM with a range of more than 1,500km. He said it is likely to be equipped with an integrated inertial navigation system/Global Positioning System, supplemented by a terrain contour mapping system and digital scene-matching terminal-homing system able to provide a circular error probable (CEP) of 10m.<br><br>China is also expected to field a second LACM within the next few years. The Ying Ji-63 (YJ-63), or Strike Eagle-63, is described by the source as a first-generation LACM with a range of 400-500km and the ability to carry a 500kg high explosive warhead at a speed of Mach 0.68. The missile is believed to be fitted with combined inertial and GPS mid-course guidance, plus some form of electro-optical terminal guidance. The latter is expected to provide a CEP of 10-15m, but it will probably be limited by weather. If it is a TV homing system rather than an autonomous scene-matching sensor, this will require a line-of-sight communications link with the launch aircraft or another platform.<br><br>The US source further pointed out that Harpy unmanned aerial vehicles obtained by China from Israel in 2001 are now operational.<br><br>These three sophisticated weapons pose new challenges to Taiwan, which has been engaged in extended debate over the ballistic missile threat from China. "Taiwan has not met the growing LACM threat head on," the source complained.<br></div>

Indeed, some observers harboured doubts as to the authenticity of the original images.<br><br>However, the emergence of additional images now suggests that the Yuan is indeed a new class. The design would appear similar to a model that previously appeared in People's Liberation Army Naval Journal that clearly mixes Russian and Chinese design influences..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>A New Concept in Combat Vehicle Self-Protection  </strong><br><br>(Source: Grintek Defence; issued Sept. 27, 2004)<br><br>Avitronics, a South African company jointly owned by Grintek (South Africa) and Saab (Sweden), has launched a revolutionary new system at African Aerospace and Defence 2004.<br><br>When installed in full configuration, the Land Electronic Defence System 100 (LEDS-100) will offer main vehicle battle tanks comparable protection against engagement by weapons like the RPG-7, anti-tank guns, missiles and artillery shells.<br><br>The LEDS-100 system consists of a warning sensor system, a central computer and a high-speed directed launcher. The control computer integrates to the vehicle intercom, command and control system and obtains data from the vehicle wind sensor. The control computer also has a global positioning system (GPS) capability.<br><br>The fully integrated system provides automated warning to the vehicle occupants and dynamically and intelligently screens the vehicle from attack in any direction in less than 700 milliseconds. The screen will obscure the attackersÂ’ line of sight and give the vehicle and occupants a chance to get behind cover. The screen is multi-spectral and cannot be penetrated by thermal imaging equipment used to aim weapons or guide missiles. The screen can be deployed hemispherically around the vehicle without having to turn the vehicle or the gun turret. This is achieved by the use of a high-speed directed launcher which can turn to any position in the protected hemisphere in less than 100 milliseconds.<br><br>An option is to add an infra-red jammer to the system. This jammer interferes with the guidance of older generation anti-tank guided missiles. These missiles have proliferated in Africa and together with the RPG, currently form a major portion of the threat against combat and support vehicles.<br><br>The LEDS system has applications for local Army requirements such as the future infantry combat vehicle and ground based air defense system. Due to its exceptional flexibility and modular growth it is also well suited to meet foreign vehicle self protection requirements.<br><br>Use of the LEDS system is not only restricted to combat vehicles. It has been designed to be used on fast patrol boats intended for riverine patrols or special operations and is light enough to fit into vehicles used by Non-Governmental Organisations engaged in medical and other humanitarian relief in conflict areas.<br><br>Avitronics has been successful in entering the world electronic warfare (EW) self protection market with innovative products in the past. Last year the company, together with its partner SaabTech, was rated amongst the top 25 EW companies in the world in an international survey in the USA.<br><br>Two years ago the company launched a world-leading laser warning system for use on combat vehicles. This system was designed to form the baseline sensor system for a self-protection concept that will provide main battle tank comparable protection to light and medium combat vehicles like the Mamba and Ratel types used by the SA Army.<br><br>macam mini ciws for tanks!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Virgin Galactic </strong><br><br>(Source: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty; issued Sept. 27, 2004)<br><br>PRAGUE --- Â“I hope with the launch of Virgin Galactic and the building of our fleet of spacecraft that someday, children around the world will wonder why we ever thought that space travel was just a dream weÂ’ve read about in books or watched with longing in Hollywood movies.Â”<br><br>That was British tycoon Richard Branson, announcing his new commercial space venture, Virgin Galactic, at a news conference in London today.<br><br>Each sub-orbital flight, preceded by three days of training, is expected to cost five customers around 170,000 euros ($209,000). Flights are expected to leave from the United States, last up to three hours, and include periods of weightlessness.<br><br>The Virgin transport, entertainment, and communications group signed an agreement with pioneering aviation designer Burt Rutan to build an aircraft based on RutanÂ’s SpaceShipOne.<br><br>SpaceShipOne became the first private space flight in June by flying 100 kilometers above the Earth -- above the distance scientists widely consider to be the boundary of space.<br><br>Â“In the early hours of Saturday morning, [Virgin] signed a historical deal to license SpaceShipOneÂ’s technology to build the worldÂ’s first private spaceship to go into commercial operating service,Â” Branson said.<br><br>Branson said the new company intends to launch its maiden flight in three years, and added that he plans to be aboard the first trip himself. He said he has Â“dreamt of seeing the beauty of our planet from spaceÂ” for many years.<br><br>In addition to his business savvy, Branson is known as an adventurer, having achieved a number of records in ballooning and other pursuits.<br><br>Branson said Virgin Galactic will be run as a business, but a business with the sole purpose of making space travel more affordable. He said plans call for building five spacecraft capable of soaring 130 kilometers above the Earth.<br><br>Space experts warn that BransonÂ’s plan, while technically feasible, is riddled with potential difficulties and unlikely to immediately begin a new era of mass space travel. French news agency AFP quoted Andre Balogh, a professor of space physics at London UniversityÂ’s Imperial College, as saying that Â“space tourism is likely to remain an expensive business for a very long time.Â”<br><br>SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan was standing beside Branson during todayÂ’s press conference. Rutan said those involved in SpaceShipOne had always wondered about the future application of the technology.<br><br>Â“Throughout these three years of development on this research program, occasionally weÂ’d wonder as to what will happen later,Â” Rutan said.<br><br>RutanÂ’s SpaceShipOne is a capsule with stout wings and several circular windows on the nose. The SpaceShipOne launch involves takeoff while attached to a broad-winged mother ship called White Knight, which was also designed by Rutan. It is then released like a cruise missile as the spacecraftÂ’s own rocket engines ignite.<br><br>SpaceShipOne is now aiming to win the so-called Â“X-Prize,Â” a $10 million bounty on offer for sending a private craft capable of carrying three people into space twice.<br><br>SpaceShipOne is scheduled to fly again on 29 September, and then once more on 4 October<br></div>

In November 2004, a second production aircraft will take-off, and next year, a third flying sample of the aircraft will join the trials. Besides, two more aircraft are used in the static ground tests. The whole cycle of the static and flight trials will be accomplished by the end of 2005.<br><br>In the course of the tests, take-off and landing performance, stability and controllability, aircraft systems and power plant operation have already been checked. The auxiliary power unit and the main engines were successfully started in flight at 6,000m and 8,000m correspondingly. During the trials, the aircraft achieved speed of 750km/h, 5G overload and flight altitude of 10,000m.<br><br>The Yak-130 is equipped with a quadro-redundant fly-by-wire system enabling application of the aircraft for basic and advanced training of all current and prospective fighters. Due to availability of 9 external suspension points that provide fitting of up to 3 tons of combat load (including weapons, external fuel tanks, homing pods, reconnaissance equipment, EW systems) the Yak-130 can be used as a light combat aircraft.<br><br>In 2002, the Yak-130 won a tender of the Russian Defence Ministry to deliver a training and light combat aircraft for the Russian Air Force.<br><br>In terms of operational and technical performance as well as training efficiency, the Yak-130 considerably surpasses its competitors and has a good export prospective. The global fleet of training aircraft is expected to be replaced fully in the period to 2010 because of life time expiry and new requirements to pilots education level for the 4th and 5th generation aircraft. The Yak-130 aircraft is included in the Â«General list of military purpose products approved for export.Â”<br><br>IRKUT Corporation is a vertically integrated holding company providing development, manufacture, sales and after-sale support of civil and military purpose aviation products.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Medium Armor and the Transformation of the U. S. Military </strong><br><br>(Source: The Lexington Institute)<br><br>Released September 2004<br><br>The war in Iraq has made one fact clear: the U.S. Army and Marine Corps need units organized around medium armor. Light forces and vehicles are maneuverable but lack force protection and striking power. Traditional heavy forces, while providing excellent protection, are strategically ponderous, logistically expensive and largely inappropriate for peacekeeping missions. Had more medium armor been available in Iraq, American lives could have been saved.<br>From this premise, the authors of this report analyze the US militaryÂ’s current plans to set up, equip and deploy units equipped with medium armored vehicles that are Â“more mobile, digital, survivable and lethal.Â”<br>The centerpiece of the Future Force is expected to be the Future Combat System (FCS). The FCS is more than a single weapons platform and will serve more than one kind of warrior. It is an array of up to 18 platforms, manned and unmanned, ground and airborne. It is envisioned as a network-centric Â“system of systemsÂ” centered on a common vehicle chassis.

The government is well-aware of our interest, and we're just awaiting a decision," he said.<br><br>The company issued a statement recently after closing a satellite office in Taiwan that Northrop Grumman remained in the hunt for Taiwanese contracts for submarines and surface combatant ships.<br><br>Based in Pascagoula, Miss., 66-year-old Ingalls Shipbuilding is the largest private employer in the state, with nearly 11,000 workers.<br><br>Harvey Feldman, who helped craft the Taiwan Relations Act and is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said Northrop Grumman and other companies could build the submarines -- but "for a price."<br><br>"That price might be high," he added.<br><br>Mr. Feldman said he doubted the submarines would be built, and questioned whether they were the ideal weapons for Taiwan against other submarines.<br><br>Citing naval analysts, Mr. Feldman said it could take eight to 10 years to train an effective submarine force. A force of anti-submarine warfare helicopters equipped with dipping sonars would be easier and faster to deploy.<br><br>China, Mr. Feldman added, would publicly react by saying that "this is a horror and the most heinous act the United States could possibly do, that it threatens the entire foundation of Sino-American relations."<br><br>But "what they would say amongst themselves might be something quite different because they know how long it takes and how difficult it would be to train an efficient submarine force," he said.<br></div>

The test capability at Indian Head allowed the missile to be launched while secured to a ground test stand and test the entire weapon, including the rocket motor, engine and guidance and navigation systems. A U.S. Navy Tomahawk block IV missile, with an inert warhead, was installed into Indian HeadÂ’s Functional Ground Test Facility and Â“launched,Â” completing a simulated mission.<br><br>A second test was conducted Sept. 21 aboard USS Stethem (DDG 63), an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer under way in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern Calif. A U.S. Navy Tomahawk cruise missile was launched and flew a land-attack mission, launching from the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) sea ranges. The test marked the first such use of a new Tomahawk block IV production missile.<br><br>Seconds after launch from the shipÂ’s vertical launch system, the Tomahawk missile transitioned to cruise flight, utilizing global positioning satellite navigation to a target site on the NAVAIR land range. The block IV missile flew a fully-guided 674-nautical-mile flight.<br><br>Â“Both of these tests were good indicators of the quality of the Block IV missile being built by Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson,Â” said Capt. Bob Novak, program manager for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round Programs (PMA-280). Â“We took two missiles off of our production line and tested them in environments that allow us to learn about our quality and the capability that we are delivering to the fleet. We are very pleased at the initial assessment of the missile test data. It reflects well on the tremendous team effort of the Navy-Raytheon Team.Â”<br><br>Tomahawk missiles are deployed throughout the worldÂ’s oceans on numerous surface ships and submarines, including Aegis-class cruisers, guided-missile destroyers, and Seawolf- and Los Angeles-class submarines.<br><br>As in all Tomahawk flight tests, air route safety was carefully planned in coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration.

Given ChinaÂ’s size, we believe there are good prospects for civil sector sales of the vehicle if its PLA trials are successful.Â”<br><br>The unique HMEV was designed, developed and manufactured in Bendigo by ADI to meet an Australian Army light engineering tractor need. The HMEV is believed to be the only military vehicle in the world that offers the off-road capability of a four wheel drive, a highway speed of 100 kph speed and the functions of a tractor with back hoe attached. The PLA also require a capability to operate at high altitude.<br><br>The Australian Army has 27 HMEVs in service. The US Army has purchased 40 High Mobility Engineering Excavators (HMEE), a variation of the HMEV. Several of these vehicles are currently deployed in Iraq. The US Army subsequently contracted ADI to develop three new generation HMEEs for trialing for a 750 plus vehicle contract. An HMEV is also operating in Canada and in the harsh environment of the UAE.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>US Navy Accepts Tactical Tomahawk Missile to Fleet</strong><br><br>(Source: US Department of Defense; issued Sept. 29, 2004)<br><br>WASHINGTON --- The Navy has placed another arrow in its quiver as it celebrated the acceptance of the Tactical Tomahawk cruise missile to the fleet during ceremonies at the Pentagon today.<br><br>John Young, Navy assistant secretary, called the missile system "an elegant solution" that adds new capabilities to the fleet while costing taxpayers half of what the current Tomahawk costs.<br><br>The system, built by Raytheon Missile Systems, has already been loaded aboard some ships and has new capabilities that make it far more useful to warfighters, said Navy Capt. Robert E. Novak Jr., Tomahawk program manager. The new "Block 4" missile carries a two-way satellite link that allows operators to reprogram the missile in flight.<br><br>"This gives commanders targeting flexibility," Novak said. Commanders can switch the missile from one target to another after launch. The missile can also loiter over an area to wait for higher-value targets.<br><br>The new missile also delivers messages of its health and accuracy back to operators and can transmit limited battle damage imagery. The system has enhanced anti-jam global positioning system receivers.<br><br>The total buy is up to 2,200 missiles over a five-year cycle. The total cost of the program is $1.6 billion. Each missile will cost about $729,000, down from the $1.4 million each for the Block 3 Tomahawks, now in the fleet.<br><br>The Tomahawk cruise missiles are the "weapon of choice" for engaging well- defended targets, Young said. Tomahawks were first used at the beginning of Operation Desert Storm in 1990. They have been used in all conflicts since then, including Operation Iraqi Freedom. The missiles are extremely accurate and have a 1,000-mile range. They hug the earth and travel at 550 miles per hour. This makes them extremely difficult to detect and even harder to shoot down.<br><br>The missile can be launched from surface ships or submarines and carries a 1,000-pound warhead.<br><br>The missile buy is the first multiyear procurement contract to reach this stage. Young said the Navy-Raytheon team effort made this work well and helped drive down the missile price. He said the working relationship can be used as an example for other similar procurements. He specifically mentioned applying the procurement lessons learned in this buy to the Standard missile. Raytheon Vice President Harry Schulte said the company is also applying them to the Joint Stand-off Weapon.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>S. Korean Navy Tests Lightweight Torpedo</strong><br><br>(Source: Korean Information Service; issued Sept. 30, 2004)<br><br>The South Korean Navy has successfully tested an anti-submarine lightweight torpedo called the Cheongsangeo (Blue Shark), which can be launched both at sea and from the air, a researcher at the Agency for Defense Development said.<br><br>The Cheongsangeo, developed with Korean technology for the first time, will boost the NavyÂ’s anti-submarine combat capability, said Lee Jae-myung. It can be launched from warships and from the air by P-3C maritime surveillance patrol aircraft.<br><br>In eight-shot test-firing sequences between July and September, the torpedoes hit unmanned targets at depths of 40 to 50 meters in the East Sea.<br><br>The 280 kilogram, 2.7-meter long torpedo, which can attain a speed of more than 45 knots (83 kilometers per hour), was developed at a cost of about 50 billion won ($43 million) beginning in 1995.<br><br>Each torpedo carries an estimated one billion won price tag, almost half that of a similar foreign-made torpedo.<br></div>
