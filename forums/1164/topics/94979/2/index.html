            <div class='col-md body'><strong>JSF Engine Logs 1,000 Test Hour </strong><br><br>(Source: Pratt &amp; Whitney; issued Sept. 29, 2004)<br><br>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. --- Earlier this month the Pratt &amp; Whitney led F135 System Development and Demonstration (SDD) team completed the programÂ’s 1,000th test hour. This testing milestone represents the cumulative hours of F135 SDD Testing and includes both the Conventional Take-Off and Landing (CTOL/CV) engine tests, as well as the Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) system test runs.<br><br>Â“The achievement of this testing milestone is positive proof of the overall health and maturity of the F135 Program,Â” said Bill Gostic, F135 Program Vice President at P&amp;W. Â“Accumulating 1,000 test hours only 15 months after completing Critical Design Review has put us in a great position to reach our testing goals for 2004 and beyond. I thank the entire F135 Team, without whose tireless efforts this accomplishment would not have been possible.Â”<br><br>Since testing began in October of 2003 both the CTOL/CV and STOVL configured F135 systems have achieved some very impressive testing milestones. The F135 program has seen FX631 - the first CTOL/CV configured system to test - complete several test runs to full afterburner power during which it demonstrated over 39,000lbs of thrust, meeting the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter performance requirements. And earlier this year the F135 Team celebrated as FX641 performed sustained runs to Â“hover thrustÂ” demonstrating over 39,000lbs of thrust in the vertical take off mode; satisfying a very important STOVL performance requirement.<br><br>This latest milestone comes on the heels of the F135 ProgramÂ’s delivery of the second Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing Propulsion System to test, engine FX643. The Propulsion System was delivered to P&amp;WÂ’s test facility in West Palm Beach in the middle of August and began testing on August 20. FX643 is focused on endurance testing.<br><br>Next up for the F135 team will be the delivery of the remaining two F135 STOVL Propulsion Systems to test under the testing portion of the teamÂ’s SDD contract. Delivery of the two remaining systems, FX642 and FX640, is expected before the end of October. FX642 will be delivered to Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) at Arnold Air Force Base near Tullahoma, Tenn., where it will perform simulated altitude testing. Testing on FX640 will be focused mainly on aircraft integration.<br><br>The F135 Propulsion System Team consists of P&amp;W, the prime contractor with responsibility for the propulsion system and system integration for all variants; Hamilton Sundstrand provider of the F135Â’s control system, external accessories and gearbox; and Rolls-Royce, providing the Rolls-Royce LiftFanR, 3 Bearing Swivel Module and Roll Posts to the STOVL (Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing) F-35B. The technologically advanced F135 has evolved from the highly acclaimed F119 engine powering the F/A-22 Raptor.<br><br>The F135 will power all versions of the F-35 - CTOL, CV, and STOVL. Among the aircraft the F-35 will replace are the AV-8B Harrier, A-10, F-16, F/A-18 and United KingdomÂ’s Harrier GR.7 and Sea Harrier. Potential orders for the JSF are anticipated to be almost 4,000. The F135 is the only propulsion system in the F-35Â’s System Development and Demonstration phase, and will power the first flights of the F-35. Development of an interchangeable engine is planned for future production competitions.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>US Navy to Upgrade EP-3E</strong><br><br>(Source: US Navy; issued Sept. 30, 2004)<br><br>PATUXENT RIVER, Md. --- A new technology project called Story Maker will bring critical improvements to the capability of the Navy EP-3E to identify potential hostile targets. The EP-3E is the NavyÂ’s sole land-based signals intelligence reconnaissance aircraft.<br><br>In mid-August, the Office of Naval Research Missile Defense, Future Naval Capabilities, transitioned the science and technology of a composite combat identification and data fusion technology development project to Maritime Surveillance Aircraft Program Manager (PMA) 290, Capt. Steven R. Eastburg for use in the EP-3E aircraft.<br><br>Â“The Story Maker project will provide our EP-3 crews with greatly improved information gathering capability,Â” remarked Eastburg. Â“We must continue to develop new systems to strengthen the quality and accuracy of this information. This will be critical to ensuring our success in the global war on terror.Â”<br><br>Through the application of newly developed algorithms funded by the Office of Naval Research, Story Maker fuses and reasons with on-board and off-board collected data, building evidence for track identification. The result is faster and improved target identification accuracy, critical in the reduction of missed engagement opportunities and the prevention of fratricide.<br><br>In early 2004, comparison testing was conducted with an EP-3E operational crew engaged in a simulated wartime scenario at the EP-3E Systems Integration Lab in China Lake, Calif. The test results found that the addition of Story Maker enabled identification of 10 times as many tracks with 98.6 percent accuracy, a significant improvement over current capabilities. The new technology will be fielded on the EP-3E Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture Modification Common Configuration aircraft as a systems upgrade in mid-year 2006.<br><br>Based on the P-3 Orion airframe, the mission of the EP-3E is to provide national, fleet and theater commanders with near-real-time signals intelligence information. With sensitive receivers and high-gain dish antennas, the platform exploits a wide range of electronic emissions from deep within targeted territory. The Story Maker project will further support this mission.<br><br>Â“We will continue to provide our Sailors and air crew with everything they need to ensure that the U.S. militaryÂ’s best operational Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance aircraft continues to improve,Â” said Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Special Missions Aircraft Department Head Cmdr.

Sherman served as Chief of Naval Operations from November 1949 until his death on July 22, 1951. Following World War I service, he was designated a naval aviator and later served on USS Lexington (CV-2) during the carrierÂ’s first year in service.<br><br>He twice held squadron commands on USS Saratoga (CV-3) and served as navigator on USS Ranger (CV-4) prior to joining the staff of Commander, U.S. Fleet. When World War II began, he served in the War Plans Division under the Chief of Naval Operations. After assuming command of USS Wasp (CV-7) in May 1942, he attained the rank of Captain and earned the Navy Cross for his leadership during the early phases of the occupation and defense of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.<br><br>After a Japanese submarine sank Wasp on Sept. 15, 1942, he became chief of staff to Commander Air Force, Pacific Fleet and served in that capacity until November 1943, when he became deputy chief of staff to Adm. Chester W. Nimitz.<br><br>He earned a Distinguished Service Medal for his role in planning the capture of the Gilberts, Marshalls, Marianas, Western Carolines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Following a brief tenure as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Mediterranean, Sherman became the youngest man ever to serve as Chief of Naval Operations on Nov. 2, 1949. One previous ship, USS Forrest Sherman (DD-931) (1955-1982) was named in his honor, earned a Navy Unit Commendation and performed distinguished service off Lebanon (195<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, Quemoy-Matsu (195<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, Cuba (1961), and in the Indian Ocean (1980).<br><br>Forrest Sherman is the 48th of 62 Arleigh Burke class destroyers currently authorized by Congress. This highly capable multi-mission ship can conduct a variety of operations, from peacetime presence and crisis management to sea control and power projection, in support of the National Military Strategy. Forrest Sherman will be capable of fighting air, surface, and subsurface battles simultaneously. The ship contains myriad offensive and defensive weapons designed to support maritime defense needs well into the 21st century.<br><br>Cmdr. Michael G. Van Durick of Pennsylvania will become the first commanding officer of the ship, which has accommodations for 383 officers and enlisted personnel. The 9,200-ton Forrest Sherman is being built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems. It has an overall length of 509.5 feet, a waterline beam of 59 feet and a navigational draft of 32 feet. Four gas turbine engines will power the ship to speeds in excess of 30 knots.<br><br></div>

But with the Senate adjourning earlier than expected it meant that I could sneak up half a day early.<br><br>Journalist:<br>What is the importance of ceremonies like this for the Defence Force?<br>Senator Hill:<br>It's very important. I've done several recently, I laid a wreath over the wreckage of Canberra off Guadal Canal and now here.  Serving personnel, it reinforces their links with previous generations that served and gave sacrifice including in some instances their lives.  It reinforces that collegiate spirit, that sense of responsibility.  Serving personnel are regarded as very important and I think that it's equally important for the public to recognise that fact.<br><br>Journalist:<br>I guess with the war in Iraq the defence force has been playing a fairly important part of these.  Is that something that you think down the track we could see commemorations like this one as well.<br>Senator Hill:<br>Well, I'm pleased that we haven't lost anyone in Iraq.  Sadly we lost one person in Afghanistan and we do everything possible to ensure the safety of our forces.  But we do have about 900 personnel operating in the Middle East area of operations and the work is very dangerous.  We said farewell yesterday to Air Force crews that will be manning the new C130Js.  They face the threat of missiles every day that they fly into Baghdad and I think it's very important for the public to understand that the threat continues and the risk to our people continue.  Because the fact that we've been able to avoid loss of life or injury they shouldn't think the task is getting any easier or less dangerous.<br><br>Journalist:<br>Just for our crew in Townsville....?<br><br>Journalist:<br>Sorry to interrupt is that your phone Minister?<br>Senator Hill<br>Yeah (laugh)<br><br>Journalist:<br>The announcement about the helicopters which are going to be based there, what's that going to do for the defence capability of the north?<br>Senator Hill:<br>It enhances it even further.  These are the new European troop-lift helicopter.  They carry almost double the number of personnel than the Black Hawk, they can travel up to 900 kilometres in distance, 300 kilometres speed, they can lift 4000 kilograms of whatever needs to be carried, they are a very capable state of the art helicopter.  They are particularly suited to amphibious work, they are marinised, they are certified for ditching, they have an electronic blade folding system.  They will work in very close conjunction with our Amphibious Ships and particularly the new larger Amphibious Ships that we are going to purchase and I think that will mean that Townsville will become more important in terms of our whole Amphibious strategy. I mean there will be more visits from amphibious ships and the link between the army operating these helicopters and the navy will be evidenced on a regular basis in the Townsville area.  So not only is it important that the new squadron be based in Townsville, around that there will be jobs, they have got to be supported and also I think the place that Townsville plays within the amphibious strategy of Australia will be enhanced by this new project.<br><br>Journalist:<br>Minister who actually makes these helicopters?<br>Senator Hill:<br>They are a European helicopter, NH Industries I think is the name, but then they - the company we deal with is Australian Aerospace, they are a subsidiary of a number of different subsidiaries.   So basically they are a European consortium of EADS but the name is NH Industries and they are basically the same company who is producing the new Tiger Armed Reconnaissance helicopter.<br><br>Journalist:<br>And will they be compatible with the current stock of (inaudible) aircraft currently operated by the Navy?<br>Senator Hill:<br>No they won't, they will be operated off, currently they will operate off the Kanimbla and the Manoora, our two LPAs, and when we purchase the new large amphibious ships they will operate off them.  The new ships are designed to be able to operate six helicopters simultaneously off the deck and these will be the helicopters that we would be using for that purpose.<br><br>Journalist:<br>While you are in Cairns have you been briefed on Warrant Officer Ian Chill?<br>Senator Hill:<br>Who?<br><br>Journalist:<br>Warrant Officer Ian Chill who was injured in the Solomons, he is Cairns sailor, he was crippled.  Are you going to be speaking with him or the crew?<br>Senator Hill:<br>Which person is he, was he the one that fell down the crevasse?  I haven't heard anything recently.<br><br>Journalist<br>So are you going to be speaking to his crew mates over in Cairns at all?<br>Senator Hill:<br>I don't know, I don't think so.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Lockheed to Develop Radars for MEADS </strong><br><br>(Source: Lockheed Martin; issued Oct. 4, 2004)<br><br>SYRACUSE, N.Y. --- Lockheed Martin's Maritime Systems &amp; Sensors (MS2) unit has received contracts with a combined value of $625 million for radar development associated with the design and development phase of the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), an international air defense program.<br><br>This follows the September 28 announcement that MEADS International - a multinational joint venture of Lockheed Martin, MBDA-Italia, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company, and Lenkflugkorpersysteme of Germany - signed a multiyear design and development contract valued at approximately $3 billion. Lockheed Martin MS2 received its contracts from MEADS International and several of its constituent organizations.<br><br>Lockheed Martin's Syracuse, NY, facility will perform engineering development work for the new surveillance radar for MEADS. It also will contribute significant software and hardware components of the MEADS Multifunction Fire Control Radar (MFCR). As a result, the facility expects to hire 40 additional employees for the program by the end of 2004, with another 300 onboard by 2007.<br><br>"MEADS will be the largest radar program this site has ever undertaken," said Dr. Dennis Beres, vice president, airborne and land-based radars at Lockheed Martin in Syracuse and a MEADS International board member. "When the design and development phase is complete, the full-scale radar production that follows is expected to continue for decades."<br><br>MEADS is a new mobile air defense system, under development by the United States, Germany and Italy, which will replace the Patriot and Hawk missile systems. It will combine superior battlefield protection with unprecedented flexibility, allowing it to protect maneuvering ground combat forces, as well as provide homeland defense, against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles and aircraft. MEADS incorporates advanced ground-based radars to provide 360-degree defense capability against all airborne threats, far exceeding the capability of the currently fielded Patriot radars. When completed, MEADS will be the only air defense system capable of rolling off troop transports and almost immediately beginning operations with a "plug-and-fight" capability. It will provide greater firepower with less manpower than current systems, dramatically decreasing operations and support costs.<br><br>"We're proud that Lockheed Martin's facility in Syracuse was chosen to produce advanced technology radars for MEADS, which will significantly improve the defenses of U.S. and allied armed forces around the world," said Congressman Jim Walsh (R-NY-25). "This program is a model of transatlantic cooperation, and the Salina facility's participation is a real tribute to Central New York's highly skilled workforce."<br><br>In 2001, Lockheed Martin's radar business was awarded a $45 million contract for the Risk Reduction Effort phase of MEADS, which was successfully completed in 2004.<br><br>In 1999, MEADS International, Inc., was selected by NAMEADSMA, a chartered organization of NATO, to develop MEADS. A multinational joint venture headquartered in Orlando, FL, MEADS International's participating companies are MBDA-Italia, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company and Lenkflugkorpersysteme in Germany and Lockheed Martin in the United States. Together, these companies have focused an international engineering team in Orlando to develop systems and technologies for the MEADS program, which continues as a model for collaborative transatlantic development.<br><br>Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin employs about 130,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture and integration of advanced technology systems, products and services.<br></div>

They include investments in seven new purpose-built naval vessels, a 15-year life extending upgrade of our C-130 Hercules aircraft, the purchase of two 757-200 jet aircraft to replace our ageing 727s, and the recent acquisition of a new fleet of Light Operational Vehicles.<br><br>Â“Our Orion fleet is critical for surveillance of New ZealandÂ’s Exclusive Economic Zone and surrounding waters, as well as meeting our South Pacific obligations. The Orions are also used for search and rescue operations, and were recently deployed to the Arabian Sea area in support of the international campaign against terrorism.Â”<br><br>Mark Burton noted that the upgrades had been developed from a whole-of-government approach, involving extensive consultation with a range of government agencies to ensure that the planes will meet both military and civilian agency requirements.<br><br>The mission systems and communication and navigation equipment will both be upgraded together, with the two projects running in parallel to maximise efficiency and cost effectiveness.<br><br>The mission systems upgrade involves the installation of new imaging radar electronic sensor equipment (video and infrared camera), and mission management systems. The upgrade of the communications and navigation will ensure the aircraft are able to comply with pending mandatory global air traffic regulations. The upgrades also include ground-based support and training facilities.<br><br>Â“This government has been committed from day one to building a modern, sustainable, well-equipped Defence Force, and this investment in our P-3 fleet is another clear example of that commitment. This upgrade will ensure interoperability with our security partners, allow New Zealand to participate in a range of operations, and provide support to the Defence ForceÂ’s other maritime and land force elements,Â” said Mark Burton.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> MBDA Details MEADS Contract </strong><br><br>(Source: MBDA; issued Oct. 4, 2004)<br><br>On 28th September 2004, the industrial consortium MEADS International (MI) received a $3 billion Â“Letter ContractÂ” to progress the Medium Extended Air Defence System (MEADS) programme into its design and development phase. The contract was awarded by NAMEADSMA, a charter organisation of NATO, set up to develop MEADS.<br><br>The contract award follows a series of successful system demonstrations and the signing last week of a Memorandum of Understanding between the United States and Italy to develop the advanced ground-mobile air defence system. A decision by the German parliament to sign the agreement is expected in December 2004. MI is a multi-national joint venture involving MBDA Italy, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) and LenkflugkÃ¶rpersysteme (LFK) in Germany and Lockheed Martin in the United States.<br><br>MBDA Italy will carry out work on the launcher, BMC4I and MFCR (Multi-function Fire Control Radar) in Rome, Italy, Lockheed Martin will perform contract work at various locations in the USA while EADS/LFK will perform work on the BMC4I, launcher, Surveillance Radar and MFCR elements at plants in Munich, Germany. The development work will be allocated in accordance with national funding. The United States funds 58 % of the MEADS programme and European partners Germany and Italy provide 25 % percent and 17 % respectively.<br><br>"MBDA is proud to be at the heart of such an important international programme and also to be participating in such an effective multi-national partnership, " said Marwan Lahoud, MBDAÂ’s Chief Executive Officer. "This contract signing marks a major milestone for the MEADS programme. MBDAÂ’s involvement in the programme is an endorsement of the companyÂ’s expertise and internationaly recognised status as a technology leader in the area of next generation air defence systems," he said.<br><br>MEADS is a mobile air defence system designed to replace Patriot systems in the United States and Germany and Nike Hercules systems in Italy. Also meeting the requirements of GermanyÂ’s Â“capabilities orientedÂ” air defence concept, MEADS will provide greater firepower with less manpower than current systems, resulting in dramatic operational and support cost savings. MEADS will provide capabilities beyond any other currently fielded or planned air defence system. The system is designed for rapid deployment and tactical mobility to keep pace with fast-moving manoeuvring forces. When completed, MEADS will be the only air defence system capable of rolling off tactical transports along with the troops and begin operations almost immediately. More importantly, its open architecture will provide for 21st century air defence system-of-system integration capabilities that allow operational mission-tailoring for homeland defence or the defence of manoeuvring forces.<br><br>MEADS is being developed in accordance with International Common Operational Requirements that call for capabilities not met by current systems. MEADS incorporates the proven hit-to-kill PAC-3 missile in a system that includes 360-degree surveillance and fire control sensors, netted-distributed battle management/communication centres and high-firepower launchers. The system combines superior battlefield protection with unprecedented flexibility, allowing it to protect manoeuvring forces and to provide homeland defence against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles and aircraft.<br><br>During Design and Development, MI will finalise designs for equipment and complete integration into the 21st century air defence system. The systemÂ’s six major equipment items are: Multifunction Fire Control Radar; Surveillance Radar; Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (BMC4I); Certified Missile Round (PAC-3 Missile and canister); Launcher and Reloader.<br><br>In May 2004, MI successfully demonstrated technical progress of the MEADS prototype hardware and software under control of the systemÂ’s battle management prototype. MEADS successfully demonstrated its ability to acquire, track and conduct simulated intercepts of targets using simulated PAC-3 hit-to-kill missiles. The demonstration fulfilled expectations that system development issues had been addressed and cleared the way for the Design &amp; Development contract award.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Panel: Change JapanÂ’s Defense Strategy </strong><br><br>(Source: Voice of America news; issued Oct. 4, 2004)<br><br>TOKYO --- A government advisory panel is recommending sweeping changes to Japan's defense structure. This come as news reports say Japan will ask the United States to move some of its troops out of the country.<br><br>A panel of academics, business leaders, and former government officials is calling for Japan to consider acquiring the ability to launch pre-emptive military strikes. That would move the country away from its purely defensive security policy.<br><br>Analysts say the recommendations from the panel will strongly influence the government's official defense review, expected to be issued in December. It will be only the third such review since Japan's defeat in World War II.<br><br>The advisory panel to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on Monday also urged the government to discuss expanding an overseas policing role for the Self Defense Forces. And it recommends relaxing the ban on weapons exports to the United States and other countries, as well as on acquiring advanced spy satellites.<br><br>By far the most controversial proposal recommends that Japan obtain a first-strike capability, allowing it to hit enemy missile bases to prevent an attack. That recommendation, if adopted, would be certain to anger Asian neighbors, especially China and North Korea.<br><br>The panel, however, came out against Japan having nuclear weapons, saying it must not pose a threat to neighboring countries.<br><br>The recommendations come as Japan and the United States continue discussions on plans to scale back the U.S. military presence in the country.<br><br>Japan's largest circulation newspaper, the Yomiuri, on Monday reported Tokyo will ask Washington to move some Marines now on the southern island of Okinawa outside the country.<br><br>Regional security expert Sheila Smith at the East-West Center in Hawaii says there is no doubt some changes will be made to the Okinawa forces. "The U.S. Marines are a tremendous burden in Okinawa, particularly the infantry and the training needs of the infantry in Okinawa can't really be met on the island, given the sensitivities there," said Ms. Smith.<br><br>Okinawa accounts for less than one percent of Japan's land, but hosts about two-thirds of the 40,000 American forces in the country.<br><br>In recent years, Okinawans have grown increasingly angry about the military presence, because of land disputes and highly publicized violent crimes committed by a few U.S. troops.<br><br>The Yomiuri report says in return for moving troops outside the country, Japan would provide pre-positioning facilities for weapons, fuel and other equipment for the U.S. military.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Marines Retire AV-8B Harriers </strong><br><br>(Source: US Marine Corps; issued Sept. 30, web-posted Oct. 5, 2004)<br><br>MARINE CORPS AIR STATION CHERRY POINT, N.C. --- Marine Attack Training Squadron-203 retired the original AV-8B Day Attack Harrier in a flyby ceremony Sept. 30 at Cherry Point.<br><br>Combining tactical mobility, responsiveness, reduced operating costs and flexibility the AV-8B Day Attack Harrier has been an essential element for the special combat and expeditionary requirements of the Marine Corps.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve been flying AV-8B Harriers for 18 years,Â” said Lt. Col. Richard W. Regan, the Commanding Officer at VMAT-203. Â“They have been globally deployed since the summer of 1986. They served exceptionally well in Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm and during the Kosovo Conflict. During Desert Storm, they were the closest to the front of any tactical aircraft.Â”<br><br>Harriers have been able to serve a special purpose flying off of aircraft carriers. Part of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Unit, they have been an invaluable element of strategic planning.<br><br>Â“Flying off of aircraft carriers we give the MEU commander deeper striking ability,Â” said Regan. Â“This in turn changes the shape of the battlefield.Â”<br><br>Employed as a ground-attack fighter-bomber they have proved there worthiness after 20 years of faithful service.<br><br>Â“Over the years we have improved on the original model,Â” said Regan. Â“The updated AV-8B Day Attack Harriers have now become operationally obsolete, and will either be sold to foreign countries or scrapped for parts.Â”<br><br>The original Harrier has been constantly improved. The AV-8B II Night Attack was designed for flying at night and has a forward looking infrared system. Its engine was upgraded from the 406 to the 408 engine, giving the aircraft more thrust, better performance and the ability to carry heavier ordnance loads. Another added feature is a multi-purpose color display, or a moving map.<br><br>Â“The Harrier has changed over the years as the way the Marine Corps war-fighting tactics have changed,Â” said Regan. Â“The need for a more powerful engine is critical to the Harriers ability to fly off and land on air craft carriers. Smart bombs, advanced precision bombs, better censors are all changes that the Harrier has experienced over the years.Â”<br><br>The AV-8B Night Attack II+ is the latest addition to the growing Harrier family. With radar installed, itÂ’s the most advanced Harrier in VMAT-203Â’s arsenal.<br><br>Â“At one time we had eight Squadrons of 20 Harriers each,Â” said Regan. Â“They have served us skillfully over the years, in fact the bird I landed today is fully operational and completely ready to fly right now.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> US Navy Decommissions First Aegis Cruiser </strong><br><br>(Source: US Navy; dated Oct. 1, web-posted Oct. 5, 2004)<br><br>PASCAGOULA, Miss. --- Friends, family members, plankowners and former crew members said farewell to USS Ticonderoga (CG 47), as she was decommissioned in a traditional Navy ceremony at her homeport, Naval Station Pascagoula, Sept. 30.<br><br>With current crew members manning the rails just prior to the ship's demanning, Rear Adm. Charles Bush, program executive officer for Integrated Warfare Systems on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations, told the crew and assembled guests, "We are not going to talk of sadness today. We are going to celebrate the storied accomplishments of the guided-missile cruiser Ticonderoga, the first AEGIS cruiser."<br><br>Bush was the seventh commanding officer of Ticonderoga from June 1995 to December 1996, and was the commanding officer when Ticonderoga changed homeports from Norfolk, Va., to Pascagoula, Miss., in June 1996. He is also a Ticonderoga plankowner, serving as the ship's first operations officer when it was commissioned in January 1983, and was responsible for the firing of almost 100 surface-to-air missiles, completing the most extensive live-fire test and evaluation program ever undertaken in the history of surface combatant ships.<br><br>"Ticonderoga has a proud record of service," he said. "Throughout her career Ticonderoga has served as an example of personal excellence, and excellence found in the hundreds of officers, chief petty officers and enlisted personnel who have served on her. Regardless of the missions or fleet assignment, the constants in Ticonderoga have been the pride and professionalism of the men and women who served her.<br><br>"The people have made the difference. It was the men and women who brought life to this ship, manned its revolutionary combat systems, tended her gas turbine propulsion system, painted her decks," he added. "They are the reason Ticonderoga is the grand lady she is today, the day of her retirement."<br><br>Ticonderoga was the first ship of the AEGIS guided-missile cruiser class, built locally at what is now Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Ingalls Shipbuilding. Many of the people who helped build the ship still live in the Jackson County area.<br><br>TiconderogaÂ’s adventures took her to duty in the Gulf of Sidra, off the coast of Beirut, to the Arctic Circle, the Equator, and through the Suez and Panama Canals. She was one of the first Navy ships to report on station in support of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm in 1990. She has been deployed to the Mediterranean Sea, the Caribbean Sea and the Eastern Pacific Ocean.<br><br>"You represent the finest this Navy has to offer," Cmdr. Glenn Zeiders III, Ticonderoga's 11th and final commanding officer, told his crew. "I am proud to have served with you." He then gave the order to deman the ship.<br><br>The crew walked off the ship to a standing ovation. The ship's commissioning pennant was lowered, and Lt. Perry Summers, the final officer of the deck, presented the ship's logbook and spy glass to Zeiders.<br><br>"This ship's done it all," said Summers after the ceremony. "It's sad to see her go, but I am proud to have served on her."<br><br>"We who served in Ticonderoga are the ship," concluded Bush. "We have taken in her lines, set sail for foreign shores, and returned home again, and again and again. For as long as we are around - those who served on her - there will always be a Ticonderoga."<br><br>Immediately following the decommissioning ceremony, tug boats tied towing lines to the ship and pulled Ticonderoga away from the pier. She is being towed to the Inactive Ships' Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia. No decision has been made on the final disposition of the ship.<br><br>The current Ticonderoga was the fifth U.S. Navy ship to bear the historic name. She was named in commemoration of the capture of Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain in eastern New York in May, 1775, by Ethan Allen and his 'Green Mountain Boys.' One of the first military successes of the American Revolution, the seizure provided desperately needed cannons and supplies to George Washington's army.<br><br></div>
