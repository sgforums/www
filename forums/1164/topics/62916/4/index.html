            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Let me take this opportunity to tell you about the SSKs fielded by japan. Most if not all are new build subs.</blockquote>Let mi take this opportunity to bring u back to geography. Japan is in Asia-pacific but not SEA. Get it?<br><br><blockquote>Are you saying that subs built originally in the 60's, and refurbished in the 90's are superior to new subs? And built by japan, one of the few countries that has Aegis. And a buncha other US Tech, which we'd never see, or smell. F-15J's to start with.</blockquote>Ur first point is crap , i wont borther u read this.<br><br><blockquote>So i see, DSTA has come  up with a torpedo faster than ADCAP, or the Brit Spearfish? *Applauds* But the base speed of our torps is given as 30kts. Even if we take into account disinformation, and add  10kt to the max speed, a SSN has a even chance of evading our torps. </blockquote>U are someone who dunno wat our Sjoormen is meant for. Basically u lack threat analysis. If u realli know , u wont be toking abt wat ADCAP or Spearfish.<br><br>Ask urself whelther our Sjoormen was first purchased to fight SSN.  From where threat of SSN come from ? Russia or USA? The SSN from china onli run at 22knts , so wont u think that our current torps is adequate?<br><br>When the time comes when there are real threats from SSNs or other faster moving SSK plateforms that can endanger our security , they will certainly purchase faster torpedoes. Our current torpedoes are adequate and affordable and that is enough for us. More money save on torpedoes , more money speed on other investments.<br></div>

Don't know why?<br><br>Also upgrade of sonars and tactical consoles to Vastergotland standard b4 their most recent upgrade.<br><br>So not that bad lah. But in our waters (shallow and noisy) are they really useful as you mentioned?<br><br>Actually I think RSN still not sure that SSKs are relevant in our waters? No matter how sophiscated. Of course if u looking further out (Star Wars concept), ya.....we will need a Kursk class SSBN.<br><br>Maybe a bigger 'chariot' type like the one on display in Langkawi a few years back would suit us better rather than a 'huge' SSK.</div>
