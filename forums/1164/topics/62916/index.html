If you are talking about mini-carriers like that of Thailand's, then ok, many have the techncal expertise. But building a carrier like that of the Charles De Gaulle (least of all the papa of all carriers, the Nimitz class) would require expertise over and above most. Its not just the technical stuff of steam catapults (which is actually a guarded secret), but the layout of the deck for flight operations, how to handle having a thousand people on board a ship, how to get the whole system to <span style="font-style: italic;">work</span>, that's a WHOLE different story, and that, as posted in the above post, requires experience. Something which only America has abundant supply of. Not even the Soviet fleet was a carrier power, even at its peak. This was due to the thinking of one particular admiral (can't remember his name) who didn't believe in carriers....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you read my message carefully, you would find that I meant the same thing too.<br><br>Compared to finalizing operational concept, designing/experimenting with new technical details like arrestor gear, carrier a/c landing system, arming/refueling of aircraft, specialize maintenance tool in a cramped enviornment, how many crew and how many crew of each "type", their training/development and so on  and so on. All this will consume a lot of resources and time. And also can be achieved only if the country go about in a systematic basis.<br><br>After they have done and mastered the above , "building" a carrier as in hull and structure is relatively simple.<br><br>For the RSN to operate a submarine we have to "learn" for more than 2 years. And we have a mentor in the Swedish Navy.<br><br>If the PLAN wants to develop and built their own carrier on their own, even if they have help from Russia it will probably take a while.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Woon Chong<br></div>

With the La Fayette frigates coming n if new subs acquisation are to be announced in few yrs time, then RSN seems to needs lotsa more manpower which will become a critical issue when RSN is the smallest force in terms of manpower in the SAF. So although RSN may have plans for helo carriers which maybe good to haf but not practical.</div>

It will be a very important node in the future scheme of things.</div></blockquote>I then to dis-agree. I think Sgp should keep our presence in PB as "civilian" as possible. Although I am sure that the "navigation radar" on the island (visible in public domain), have military uses such as having visibility and early warning from threats arising from West Malaysia's East Coast and the South China Sea, it looks very civilian with its white and red stripes. I think we should keep it that way as I don't think it will help our cause (legal wise) if we are fighting the ownership of the island just to convert to a naval base. We are basing on the fact that we have been assisting navigation on the island for upteem years.<br><br>Anyway the island is really very small, what can we do that. Even if have a space for a base there, it would be miserable posting as it will be so far away from the mainland and will not have any recreational facilities.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Russian had a carrier....name started with a V...sold it to China.(Valkriye or something? cant remember)The Thai carrier is frm Spain...which i believe a few other counties have bought also.Anyway the other main problem with big carriers other then design is it's powerplant.Not many countries have Nuclear abilities and even less have the ability to put that on a ship!!Infact the Charles de Gulle had problems with it's powerplant all through it's life that was only fixed in the 2nd ship!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You mean the Clemenceau class carriers? Cos the Charles De Gaulle is still rather young and it's sister ship is still on the drawing board. But both the Foch and Clemenceau carriers are powered conventionally.</div>
