I think Sgp should keep our presence in PB as "civilian" as possible. Although I am sure that the "navigation radar" on the island (visible in public domain), have military uses such as having visibility and early warning from threats arising from West Malaysia's East Coast and the South China Sea, it looks very civilian with its white and red stripes. I think we should keep it that way as I don't think it will help our cause (legal wise) if we are fighting the ownership of the island just to convert to a naval base. We are basing on the fact that we have been assisting navigation on the island for upteem years.<br><br>Anyway the island is really very small, what can we do that. Even if have a space for a base there, it would be miserable posting as it will be so far away from the mainland and will not have any recreational facilities.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well if you travel by helicopter, it's not that far. You know oil riggers get to do 2 weeks each time they land on a rig.<br><br>Sensors not limited to just navigation radar....btw I wonder if the Ericcson surveillance radar is still there?

Think they can somehow hide and run away by going further underwater like said from 10m to 20m n further below sea level, but the regional waters surrounding sg aren't really deep. Anyway, ASW aircraft r the best way to detect a sub n the sub may not even know they are being targeted...
