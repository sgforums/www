            <div class='col-md body'>A warrior dies<br><br>By BRODIE FARQUHAR<br>Star-Tribune correspondent Tuesday, January 03, 2006<br><br>Samuel N. Blatchford, 81, great-great-grandson of Navajo war chief Manuelito and decorated war hero with service in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, died Dec. 23.<br><br>A memorial service will be held at Holy Rosary Catholic Church in Lander at 11 a.m. today, with interment of his cremated remains at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., later this spring.<br><br>To say that he qualified for that military honor is an understatement. His military service included:<br><br>* Scouting for the 7th Cavalry before it switched from horses to tanks.<br><br>* Serving as a radio operator and gunner on a B17 Flying Fortress in Europe and getting shot down four times.<br><br>* Working with the French Resistance until his capture by the Gestapo.<br><br>* Numerous escape attempts from Stalag 17-B.<br><br>* Combat flying missions in Korea.<br><br>* Combat service as a ground forward air controller with an Army unit in Vietnam.<br><br>Blatchford earned 28 medals, including the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross with one oak leaf cluster, four Purple Hearts, six Air Medals and the Prisoner of War Medal. The French government presented him with its Freedom Medal for his work with the French Resistance, a Citizenship Medal bestowing honorary citizenship, as well as the key to the city of Lisio.<br><br>Along the way, he earned a bachelorÂ’s degree in civil engineering, a masterÂ’s degree in business administration and served as a site manager for Boeing Services International at an Air Force base in Turkey. In addition to his native Navajo and second language of English, he also learned to speak Turkish, French, German and Japanese.<br><br>Yet Sam Blatchford was more than a warrior: He lived a love story in which he waited 56 years to wed his first sweetheart, the former Cecelia Birdshead.<br><br>Â“We both were working for the (Civilian Conservation Corps),Â” Cecelia Blatchford said. Â“I worked in the office, and he drove a truck before the war.Â”<br><br>The two fell in love and were engaged on July 15, 1941, before he enlisted with the 7th Cavalry.<br><br>When the 7th Cavalry switched over from horses to mechanized armor, Blatchford transferred into the Army Air Corps, where he served as a radio operator and gunner for a B17. He and his crewmates were shot down three times, ditching twice over the North Sea and in a third incident, a flaming crash landing in England. A standard tour of duty was 25 missions, and BlatchfordÂ’s crew was assigned a Â“milk runÂ” for its 25th mission n a bombing run over submarine pens near Nantes, on the coast of France.<br><br>Their B17 was shot down, and Blatchford was the last one out.<br><br>Â“He couldnÂ’t get out, trapped by centrifugal force as the plane spiraled down. He was thrown free when it blew up,Â” Cecelia Blatchford said. He managed to pull his ripcord before he blacked out.<br><br>Because no one saw their parachutes, the entire crew was pronounced missing and presumed dead.<br><br>Blatchford was found by a French farmer, who hid the badly wounded airman from roving German patrols. Members of the French Resistance smuggled him to the isolated town of Lisio, where the local butcher used a carving knife to remove the shrapnel. Blatchford recalled that his friends made him drink a lot of cognac and champagne before the operation. Dosed with boric acid, water and sunlight, BlatchfordÂ’s wounds healed.<br><br>Meanwhile, Cecelia waited and hoped, but with no news of Blatchford, came to accept that he was dead. Cecelia married in January 1945 -- about the same time Blatchford was working his many escape attempts from Stalag 17-B.<br><br>Blatchford was lucky he wound up in the prisoner of war camp. HeÂ’d been working with the French Resistance in Paris for about a month, before the Gestapo swept Blatchford up in a raid. He and his compatriots were lined up against a wall, and three machine guns opened up. Abruptly, a German officer kicked over a machine gun to save someone for interrogation. That act saved BlatchfordÂ’s life, but set him up for months of brutal beatings. Finally, German authorities decided he was an airman and not a spy, and shipped him off to Stalag 17 in February 1944.<br><br>He remained a prisoner of war until May 5, 1945, when he was liberated by PattonÂ’s 14th Armored Division, near Braunau, Austria, where the prisoners had been marched at gunpoint.<br><br>Returning to the United States, Blatchford left the Army Air Corps and went to find Cecelia, only to discover sheÂ’d thought him dead, had married someone else and was pregnant with her first child. Cecelia returned her engagement ring to Blatchford in what she described as Â“a bad scene,Â” and he left. Two months later, CeceliaÂ’s husband was killed in Okinawa. She eventually remarried and raised eight children.<br><br>Blatchford re-enlisted in 1952, after earning his civil engineering degree.<br><br>He served as a radio operator in a troop carrier, flying combat missions between Japan and Korea before being wounded again and sent back to the United States with another Purple Heart. After recovery from his wound, Blatchford was one of the first Air Force people trained in computers.<br><br>Shortly after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Blatchford was shipped to Bien Hoa as a computer operator to the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing. When officials found that he had a radio background, he was reassigned as a ground forward air controller with the 173rd Infantry, 1st Army Division, calling in air strikes on nearby enemy positions near the Cambodia border. While he was riding with his captain in a jeep, a land mine blew up, killing the captain and sending Blatchford to the hospital for his fourth Purple Heart.<br><br>Reassigned back to the United States, Blatchford served another 10 years in the Air Force, retiring as a master sergeant on Dec. 30, 1976. He worked about 15 years for Boeing Services International in Turkey, then a few more years at Scott Air Force Base with the land mobile radio section.<br><br>He had married, raised a daughter and a son, and retired in Illinois.<br><br>Cecelia was widowed after 33 years of marriage and retired in Albuquerque, N.M.<br><br>When BlatchfordÂ’s wife, Dorothy, died in open-heart surgery, he decided he needed to make peace with Cecelia.<br><br>Their ensuing courtship led to an Aug. 1, 1998, wedding ceremony atop Snow King Mountain in Jackson. Sam and Cecelia attended sun dances on the Wind River Indian Reservation and house sat for three winters in Fort Washakie for CeceliaÂ’s niece, Stephanie, who is married to sculptor Richard Greeves.<br><br>Â“Sam asked me if I wanted to move to Lander,Â” Cecelia said. Â“We loved it here.Â”<br><br>They moved into a house on Wood Street in 1999. Their home is filled with paintings of SamÂ’s Navajo country, as well as sculptures by Greeves.<br><br>-----<br><br>RIP brave warrior.His love story is touching too..<br><br><a href="http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2006/01/03/news/wyoming/dc459a30c3678743872570eb00067649.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2006/01/03/news/wyoming/dc459a30c3678743872570eb00067649.txt</a></div>
