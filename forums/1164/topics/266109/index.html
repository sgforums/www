In fact, the occupation of the Netherland by the Nazis was essential due to the importance of ports such as Rotterdam and Antwerp in order to suffocate the British in trade and secure shipping routes from Scandinavia which supplied important iron ores etc. In terms of the point of an invasion, the Netherlands is generally a flat country with no strong defences on it's border and had a pretty prehistoric land force with only one World War One flak gun and it's air force was pretty much made up by old Allied World War One plane. Thus, when invasion came, the German took all but two days to succumb the Dutch forces into surrender. For Switzerland, it's surronded by the Alps on it's border, the Swiss had already planned for the defences of Ã­t's land by building forts and strongholds in the mountains. The doctrine for the Swiss forces became a  deterrance force from a static defene force. In fact, if memories didn't fail me, there were as many as eight level of defences in the Swiss Alps border with Germany. The system of defence fortress was called the Reduit. A large militia force was also mustered by General Henri Gusain.The German probably realise that an invasion would have resulted in large number of casaulties for a country that would have gain zero advantage for the them. Additionally, the Germans would probably have realised that the Swiss as bankers would probably be able to help them lauder the money they made through the explusion and murder of the Jews.These were pretty much the economic concession they gave to the Nazis.<br><br>In World War Two, neutrality is pretty much a grey thing. Thailand although declared neutral assisted the Japanese in the invasion of Malaya and Singapore.Sweden actively traded with the Nazis in iron ore and other important resources that helped the Nazis in their war effort. Ireland as a neutral country actively assisted the Allies in the Normandy invasion and in shipping. In Switzerland, due to it's close proximity with Germany, like any other neighbours of Germany, they have a Nazi sympathise group which called for a union with Germany in 1938. However, it must be noted that it is now common knowledge that Swiss police actively assisted the SS and the Gestapo in regards to Jews or political enemy going over to Swiss border. In banking, the banks actively assisted and helped lauder Nazi loot and blood money, with some of it still in some of Switzerland's banks.<br><br>I hope this reply wil give u some inside to the interested but little known history of Switzerland and the Netherlands during World War Two</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The reason for the conquest of the Netherlands is simple. It's location allows the Nazis to have airfields to deploy aircraft towards Britain. Also, they were planning to invade the Soviet Union, and thus it made plenty of strategic sense to control the Baltics and prevent any possible Allied intervention etc. etc. As it is, it allowed the German Kriegsmarine to station warships there to intercept convoys heading for Russia.<br><br>As for the Swiss, why isn't it obvious that they have the biggest treasure chest of goods? Obviously they will be annexed eventually!</div>
