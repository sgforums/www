            <div class='col-md body'>They were saying that this special king of nuke produces alpha radiation, unlike normal nukes which produce garmma radiation. Thus, there was little danger and only those close to ground zero who inhaled the particles will be in danger. According to the site, this also explains why nothing registered on the Geiger counter.<br><br>Anyway, jus read it with a pinch of salt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please, this writer is pure bunk.<br><br>Russia does not by any means currently have the resources required to deploy and develop the middle-east as its renewed territorial protectorate. Russia is still an economically bankrupt state struggling to recover.<br><br>Russia has its own significant problems with Muslim states, not least of all Chechnya...it's not about to place strategic nuclear missles in Iran, Syria or WhateverStan just to thwart Jewish or American interests. Does anyone remember the Russians were in Afghanistan fighting muslim taliban and jihadists not so long ago? Thousands of Russians lost their lives in that war...the Russian people aren't likely to be arming muslims with WMD anytime soon.  Moreover, despite thousands of Russian jews migrating to Israel, many russian scientists and academics are jews who remained in Russia. In fact, the Russians are probably quite happy the Americans are drawing all the Islamic whackos out of Chechnya and Bosnia who are running off to Iraq to fight the Americans instead.<br><br>Maybe there are some rogue ex-Soviet scientists with equipment for sale -- true, but Putin is an ex-KGB man who is well aware of the score and the dangers in the middle-east. Fact is Reagan made a huge mistake forcing the Soviets to lose in Afghanistan by supporting the Mujahiddin -- that was the start of Osama, the Taliban and other Islamic extremism. If the Soviets had crushed the muslims in Afghanistan the extremeists would have never dared attack the U.S. on 9/11. Another FACT is that the Russians allowed the U.S. to operate special ops bases out of Russian border states when the U.S. went into Afghanistan and even provided intel...the U.S. is probably still using Russian bases. To Russia the threat of the future is not particularly the U.S., who will more than likely increasingly depend on Russia for its oil and gas needs. Nor is it the soft-bellied Western Europe.  Like many others the ascendency of an aggressive and belligerent China is a much greater long term threat...coupled with the middle-east problems on its doorstep. Russians continue to die daily fighting muslims in Chechnya, and muslim terrorists blow things up in Moscow regularly...read the papers.<br><br>The term "Zionist" in this context is mostly used by anti-Jewish proponents, Neo-nazis and historical revisionists. It's clear this incendiary writing is a blatant attempt to stoke the flames of anti-Jewish and Amercian sentiment. "successful holocaust industry"...WTF. Moreover, the Jews do not play up their nuclear capability, it is a last resort deterent. The guy who spilled the beans spent years in jail.  Israel is so small 5 nukes would wipe its population from the face of the earth, compared to the size of its many enemies.<br><br>Look at the picture of the Chinese FuZhou destoyer...even that looks doctored if indeed that is even a Sunburn missle system.<br><br>Just cause it's on the Internet -- it doesn't have to be true folks.<br><br>Why don't I write an article saying that the Zionists have placed strategic tactical nuclear Harpoons in Sg to protect it against external threats after Sg provided 1 billion in funding for the Israeli military industrial complex. One of the new submarines Sg has acquired is secretly from the Zionists, and of course has missle tubes. Sound plausible even without a whole lot of write up?  Let's see if the countries around Sg like the sound of that?<br><br>Come on people, i America loses its war against muslim terrorists it will do one simple thing, turn itself into fortress America; shut off from the world and throw up every kind of economic and military barrier it can around North America. This would include forcing all its MNCs to repatriate production to the US for security reasons. That is not in anyone's interests except for the Muslims who want to return to living life in the 15th century. If America does that I hope you all like praying 5 times a day, cause Singpaore is not far from the top of their conversion list, and is definitely on Osama's blacklist.<br><br>Oh, and if that Bali bomb was a nuke of any sort, by now Australia, Japan and even New Zealand would be developing nuclear arsenals faster than the PAP can change a GRC zone. One nuclear strike on any US interest even anonymously and the odds are better than even that Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan will go up in flames.</div>
