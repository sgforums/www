            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore Navy is not that impressive as the other Asian Navies , eg India ( not malaysia ~!!! ) is because the Mindef will rather the Navy to focus on to  littoral water protection , rather than force projection seen in carrier groups or blue water defence seen in frigates and destroyers.<br><br>A major leap is when Singapore obtain our SIx MCV which pose quite a threat to neighbouring countries due to our impressive ECM and long-range offensive capabilities. However due to the structure of the corvettees , it cannot be under the catagory of blue water defences yet. The next leap is when the Navy obtain the MPA which truely expands our naval SAR and Strike capacity. Then comes the LST and the LALEE which expands the RSN projection and surveillence area.<br><br>Good news. WIth the aqquring of the Frigates , it can really show the change in warfare tactics from littoral defenses to blue-water defenses and force projections. Thus jus sit back , i believe the RSN will be ready to take in larger amphibious craft however for carriers it may be a longer destination......</div>

SAF emphasis on THINKING SOLDIER... not garang, but reckless type. Yes...using a LAW, you may be successful in disabling the tank from moving, *IF* you manage to take out the tracks. But the tank will most likely kill you,  then radio for a track replacement. You only slow them down slightly....yet lives of many with you will be lost. What has you achieved?...Nothing!<br><br>The smarter move is to either avoid contact, and report their movements ...and await reinforcements.....or radio their postion, hit at what you can take out successfully, and withdraw. Remember...tanks do not operate alone. What you encounter, may only be the tip of the iceberg...wiser to inform the HQ, and bring in the heavy weapons....Bottom line...Think smart!...Live to fight another day, will creating maximum damage to the enemy. We are not China, and can't afford to use the "ren hai zhan su". But for those who still insist be a "rambo"....be my guest, but make sure you blow up the tank with you when you die!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If you are talking abt defending our coastal waters....it's not needed. The range of our land based fighters are sufficient to cover that...and way beyond. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Also you need a fleet of ships to protect &amp; support the carrier. It is very expensive to operate, and extreme manpower intensive. Being able to afford to operate one, does not mean we get one. SAF operations currently do not have the need for an carrier. Also...it is politically sensitive too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are advantages of owning a carrier.<br><br>1) it helps in force projection.<br><br>2) it immuned the risk of all vital base to be destroyed in an enemy offensive attack.<br><br>3) roles in humanitarian mission.<br><br>4) roles in forward supply depot.<br><br>however we must understand singapore's constraints and the disadvantage of owning a carrier.<br><br>1) a carrier is on big piece of metal which needs alot of pple to run.Not onli u need pple to run the carrier , u need pple to run the other ships which make a carrier fleet.<br><br>2) it expensive to keep a carrier operational. It will burn alot of tax payers money , then tax have to go up liao.....<br><br>even if singapore have the capacity to turn the ship automated , and have the money to run the fleet , then another problem is...<br>3) it will cause a arm race in the region!!!<br><br>I believe a LPD is enough for singapore's force projection ambition , however obtaining a carrier isnt impossible but quite a long way for us......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if we r toking abt defending our sea lines, den we definitely dun need any aircraft carriers coz our sea lines aren't exactly big and our fighter planes can easily reached those places from our own airbases. furthermore an aircraft carrier will give a lot of constraint to the navy and our defence budget will hv to increase considerably...<br><br>as for transportation purposes, we hv more than enuff LST...</div>
