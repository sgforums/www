            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]<br><strong>on thing about the LAW though... its crap...<br><br>i think if they HAVE to make infantrymen lug that stupid load around, it might as well be good for SOMETHING! its demoralising to know that the LAW cannot be used effectively against modern armour...<br><br>but u can't use it for an AP role as well cos the HEAT warhead won't generate the BIG explosion to maximise casualty in the open.<br><br>what are the chances of infantrymen meeting a jeep or some other soft-skinned vehicles which they MUST take out with a LAW??? totally bizarre if u ask me... </strong><br><br>Let me clarify the use of LAW. This weapon was never designed or intended to be use against MBTs. The term Light Antitank Weapon is just an acronym for against armour, inclusive of light armoured vehicles. It was meant for APCs, AIFVs and light tanks such as our SM1s. For those guys out there who had been in the army, you should rememeber the instructor stressing this point; this is not for hitting MBTs!!! For MBTs, we got Milan 2 and Spike. Milan 2 may be a bit ineffective against tank with reactive armour, but still packs a punch though.  And remember the Carl Gustav 84mm RR. Yes, i know it is cumbersome and heavy (I was the gunner for a few months) but it is effective against up to 3rd generation tanks. To use it against the PT91 or T84s, we just have to buy the latest round for this weapon, eg FFV-751, with tandem warhead for reactive armour.<br><br>For SM1s, its role in SAF has never been to go up against MBTs. When they were bought, there was never a threat from MBTs, only AFVs. Tanks in our doctrine were more for fire support, never to fight like the european terrain. We do not have wide plains like in Europe (believe me, I mean really WIDE). In this region, the only areas where you can see that FAR is the rice padi fields, and I don't think anybody is going to use tanks en-massed there. Cos they will be sitting ducks!!! I will simply put LSVs at the edge of these fields with Spike to utilise their range to the max.<br><br>Some posts here have compared My's MBTs (forthcoming) to our SM1s. Bearing in mind the terrain and tactics used, this is like comparing apple and orange. For those who have trained in jungle like terrain, you should know that traversing a turret with a long gun such as those on the MBTs would be almost impossible in a dense jungle with track roads.<br><br>Just my 2cents worth....(don't flame me)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi CX, actually IF (BIG ONE) in the event of a war with Malaysia, and IF their armed forces is totally destroyed, UMNO would have lost its right to the leadership mantle in any new Government that is to be formed.<br><br>Granted that there will be some who will resent our presence, but we will work with those who are willing to rebuild the relationship with us, and allow us to return to status quo before the "war".<br><br>We could bring all the other Malaysians - who have felt themselves being discriminated for ethnic or political reasons and help them to rebuild a NEW Malaysia.<br><br>There are some Muslim Bumis who resented being sidelined and have not accepted UMNO's policies under the present leadership; and there are many NON-Muslim Bumis - (sons of the soil:- the native tribal people from the long houses of Sarawak, the native Kadazans and other tribes of Sabah) - all of whom are entitled to privileges but never benefitted from such a policy as much as the Muslim Bumis received.<br><br>With this catastrophic defeat, UMNO would have lost the moral right to lead the country, and a new political equation can perhaps be forged from an equal partnership of all political parties from Sabah to the smallest state of Perlis in Peninsula Malaysia.<br><br>Call it by any name, (collaboration is not such a dirty word, if they are collaborating with us for an honorable goal), our intent maybe self-serving, but the end result is mutually beneficial and honorable.<br><br>With one stroke, we knock out the crazy politics espoused by UMNO, and bring the vast number of "oppressed" Malaysians to the fore, to work with us. (Hints of War Crime Tribunals of crazy UMNO leaders..???)<br><br>Sabah and Sarawak have once expressed strong desires to leave Malaysia, and join us when we left in 1965 - (but putting the 3-'S' states together had an ominous ring to the name, so the idea was abandoned).<br><br>The one who was kicked out and got kicked around, have returned to kick 'arse', and reform for the sake of all in this region.<br><br>Who better qualified to lead in this role of reforming Malaysia then ourselves, who had experienced the bitter end of dirty politics played by UMNO ? (see footnote below)<br><br>This is poetic justice played to a deserving end.<br><br>Anyway, this is just wishful forum discussions.<br><br>You views concerning time, space, and manpower are correct, and your reasoned approach is not off the mark.<br><br>Footnote:<br>Perhaps this is the very reason for UMNO continuous tirade against Singapore and in particular against PAP rule - the fear is strong, and the reaction speaks volume.<br><br></div>

MBT? screw u...<br><br>if we're issued with the SPIKE SR, then i'll take my chances and take out the sucker cos there's a fair chance it can take out the composite or reactive armour with its tandem warhead. with an armbrust? no way. you'll be wasting your time and your life.<br><br>like i said... u'll be DAMN lucky to achieve a mobility kill with a LAW and the MBT can still shoot u even if it cannot move.<br><br>and the joint between the turret and the chasis is like... what? 5? 10cm? u think the tank sit there quietly there wait for u to shoot him ah?<br><br>its one thing to be brave and well versed in the use of the weapons issued u, but if a weapon has limitations, then we have to know its limitations so we don't waste ammo and lives in the field.<br><br></div></blockquote>have u ever learnt how to shoot its tracks<br>we are not going to use any of our infantry weapons to take out an MBT.<br>we've got our own to take them out</div>
