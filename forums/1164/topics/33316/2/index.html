The SAF outnumbers the Malaysian Armed Forces nearly 2 to 1 in terms of manpower.<br><br>2. The SAF has more combat aircraft, armored vehicles and tube artillery than Malaysia and Indonesia combined (in each category). In fact, we have nearly twice as many combat aircraft as both combined.<br><br>3. The RSN can put more anti-ship cruise missiles into the air at a time than the Malaysian or Indonesian navies and these missiles have longer range.<br><br>So much for strength. I might also add that most of our equipment is considered to be more advanced and in better condition than our neighbors'. Our combat support arms are also considered extremely capable.<br><br>However, as Atobe says, it is not about numbers, but how they are applied (though I think Atobe was arguing in the wrong direction -- we are the ones with the numbers).<br><br>What is the standard of the SAF? It is impossible to say until we see our first real battle. However, my personal opinion is that our troops will hack it. The average Singaporean is not a coward and will fight in a disciplined manner when pressed. Our combat leaders (officers and NCOs) are well-chosen, though the style of leadership they are taught is a little inflexible. Nevertheless, I think they will manage.</div></blockquote>I agree with most of what you say, however, they numbers do not differ so much now, and I think Malaysia, once they have finished buying the tanks they want (variants of PT-91, T-80), they will actually outclass Singapore armour, at least in terms of numbers and the amount of fire power each force is able to field at any one time.  MAF tanks would be limited only by terrain and the ability of logistics to keep up with them yet not be vulnerable to attack<br><br>my two cents</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not every unit in the SAF is sloppy and slack. If yours is, your officers are killing you with kindness. But it depends on what kind of slack you are talking about.<br><br>The discipline of the SAF in general is considered very good. Note that unlike what you see in movies, every army in the world has sloppy and slack parts. US Marines, SAS commandoes, everyone. The vast majority of soldiers are lazy and afraid to die. The vast majority of units neglect training and are totally SNAFU. This is perfectly normal.<br><br>What counts is whether at the vital moment they will perform. When your unit needs to push during an exercise, do you follow orders and push? Do you possess the basic skills needed to fight? If you do, it makes you better than the average soldier, and makes up for all the chao genging, admin fuckups and other day-to-day stupidity at camp.<br><br>The SAF trains its men very well, better than the US Army, though not as well the USMC IMHO. The same CDOs you see sleeping in camp all day (they seem to have the most senang camp life) regularly perform better in exercises and tests than US SEALS and Special Forces. The same softie pilots at our airbases regularly top the class at Top Gun.<br><br>So just focus on your training. The army around you is better than you think it is, and as long as you do your part we will all pull through in a war. Make sure you know your stuff, and have the ability to use this knowledge. If you are an infantryman (like me), make sure you can use and care for your weapons and know how to move in a firefight. Build up your stamina, and learn to be alert at all times. Confidence in your training, condition and equipment will build courage. It may save your life someday.<br><br>Regarding our armor forces vs Malaysia's: I will believe they are getting MBTs when they actually get them, and I see them moving and firing. They have a tendency to buy equipment they are unable to support or effectively use, especially in the airforce. When the purchasing decision comes from the politicians rather than the armed forces, the chance of such a screwup is multiplied.<br><br>Even if they do get all of these MBTs operational, I do not think they are that much of a threat. MBTs need a lot of support to operate effectively, and without this support they are useless. I seriously doubt that Malaysian logistics are up to the task of keeping an MBT force fed with gas, ammunition and maintenance. Or that their engineers are ready with enough breaching and bridging equipment to prevent the force from being bogged down  by mines or destroyed bridges and slaughtered from the air.<br><br>In addition, contrary to what many on this forum think, these tanks CAN be defeated by our AMX13SM1s and even our LAWs, let alone Spikes, Hellfires, mines or DPICM. You need to be much more careful with shot placement, which is not hard at the close ranges of likely battle. There isn't a tank in the world yet that can take a hit from an anti-tank weapon to a hatch, the engine grille without brewing up. There isn't yet a set of tracks that can take an ATW hit without resulting in a mobility kill. Even a hit that fails to penetrate may result in a vision kill. Tanks are far from invincible. They need to be deployed in sufficient numbers to be effective, since they will suffer attrition in battle no matter how thick their armor. The number that Malaysia is buying is too small.<br><br>And of course, we DO have MBTs of our own, more than Malaysia will even after this acquisition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, LAWs are not ideal against MBTs and are extremely risky. That said, the engine grille is still exposed at the rear, and a vision kill from the front is possible, though unlikely. In urban combat, a shot from above has a good chance of finding a hatch. The good thing is that our LAWs have no IR signature, flash or noise when they fire, and can be used from confined spaces. This means you can take cheap shots at tanks with a good chance of not being detected and fired upon in return. Enough cheap shots, and eventually one will find a weak spot.</div>

Just to be on the side of caution, a few questions:<br><br>1) Is the SM1 then, a superior unit then their MBTs?<br><br>2) Can the SM1 shoot from the move?<br><br>3) Is the SM1's 75mm harder hitting and longer ranging then the 125mm? Can it penetrate the frontal armour of an MBT?<br><br>4) Given a choice, would our tankers be in an SM1, or a AGS light tank or even an MBT?<br><br>5) Can the SM1's armour stop 125mm rounds<br><br>6) Are mobility kills or shots to the weak part easily present in the heat of battle?<br><br>If we answer all these questions, we realize that any optimism over the SM1's holding against MBTs quickly fade. Save for a point blank ambush, the SM1's deployment against MBTs will be very limited and restrictive. While we are struggling to aim for the tracks or wait for them to present their rears, they can easily blast us knowing every single round will tear through us like hot wire through butter. Proper shot placement on a critical spot on a moving target in the heat of battle is extraordinary difficult, so much so that considering it to be an area of confidence when fighting MBTs is a little too much on the optimistic side. If it was so easy, we would have had lots of reports of Shermans defeating Tigers what so. Most of the time, if not virtually all, tank battles consist of quick aims at the target and snapping off a shot as fast as you can before he does the same to you. In the close quarter battle you described, would you rather be in an MBT or a tin-can SM1 tank?</div>

Ever fired a LAW before? Finding a hatch at even a modest 25 meters is chancy. You anti tank tatics are a little too gurrelia and that said, takes the iniative away from our side, something which we cannot really afford to have much of. If you do not kill a tank, some infantryman or support would have seen the direction the rocket has zipped in from or worse, even seen the firer and guess if the diameter of the shell returning the favour will be bigger of smaller then your Armbrust?</div>

However currently it seem to mi that the LSV is given a large role in anti-tank warfare . Y do u think the LSV is armed with SPIKEs ? Maybe im not clear on my part of shooting and running. Y not add in surprise + shooting + then running , i believe the enemies will be caught off guard. As i say , anti-tank role will not be a one man show , fire suppport will be given by our RSAF , Bionix/ Ultras , the Artillery ..etc , i personnally to believe that the LSV is an extremely useful vehicle in taking up part of the SM-1's anti tank role.However it cannot fully replace the SM-1.<br><br>*note : the Spike have a range of 4km , it can be fire in the cover of vegetations which make intial visual detection extremely low .</div>

If you are close enough to get a very good hit on a tank with a LAW, you probably will be scared half to death when arty falls on the enemy too. . . depending on arty accuracy. . .how do you know your arty won't get you??, especially if you want to be zipping around in an LSV, possibly close to enemy tanks<br><br>my two cents</div>

However currently it seem to mi that the LSV is given a large role in anti-tank warfare . Y do u think the LSV is armed with SPIKEs ? Maybe im not clear on my part of shooting and running. Y not add in surprise + shooting + then running , i believe the enemies will be caught off guard. As i say , anti-tank role will not be a one man show , fire suppport will be given by our RSAF , Bionix/ Ultras , the Artillery ..etc , i personnally to believe that the LSV is an extremely useful vehicle in taking up part of the SM-1's anti tank role.However it cannot fully replace the SM-1.<br><br>*note : the Spike have a range of 4km , it can be fire in the cover of vegetations which make intial visual detection extremely low .</div></blockquote>That depends, if it's open, tank country, then long range shots are possible, but most of the time, we're gonna engage a lot closer, where a fast reloading 120mm gun is gonna be a lot more useful then an ATGM. ATGMs are good for backup and additional firepower, but unless we have tons and tons of them, stopping tanks with them needs to be bloostered with MBTs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be on the side of caution even more, note that almost all of Malaysian main anti armour systems can take out our armoured units, but only a small fraction of our systems are able to do the same to their MBTs.<br><br>We do need a boosting in area of armor.

Current missile can nv replace  guns in anti-tank warfare , however im jus stating the usefulness of the LSV in fighting the MBTs malaysia is using. Most of the battles will be fought in built up areas and jungles , which make non-line of sight engagement extremely useful.<br><br>To enage tanks , we might not need to resort to close engagment. UAVs will be for scouting , while artillery bomblets can be use to neutralize an advancing battle group , while apaches and friendly ground forces will move in to block any enemy escape routes and to clear up the remaining enemy's tank.<br><br>Being frank , i cant buy the idea that LSV arent useful in anti-tank warfare. Being fast and more agile that the MBT , with fire support from the air and land , the MBT will be doom. Being slow , the MBT will be dead duck in traps formed by those fast running LSVs. Bionix/Ultras and future L. tanks will provide direct fire support , Apachse and the LSV will give precision attack on key moving targets . With the ''stand-off distance'' of the spike and the hellfire , i dun think the MBT can even spot us b4 the missiles come slamming into their face.<br></div>
