            <div class='col-md body'>As said before, if you are badly run and managed, having more people would only mean having more dead bodies to collect at the end of the day. A large army that is ill organized and badly run will panic and be routed a lot faster then a smaller, well armed and trained force. In such a case, having large forces but low quality can be a liability... Once one person breaks, it sets off a chain reaction of panic and fear.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few points that have not been mentioned yet that might cast some light on this discussion:<br><br>1. The SAF outnumbers the Malaysian Armed Forces nearly 2 to 1 in terms of manpower.<br><br>2. The SAF has more combat aircraft, armored vehicles and tube artillery than Malaysia and Indonesia combined (in each category). In fact, we have nearly twice as many combat aircraft as both combined.<br><br>3. The RSN can put more anti-ship cruise missiles into the air at a time than the Malaysian or Indonesian navies and these missiles have longer range.<br><br>So much for strength. I might also add that most of our equipment is considered to be more advanced and in better condition than our neighbors'. Our combat support arms are also considered extremely capable.<br><br>However, as Atobe says, it is not about numbers, but how they are applied (though I think Atobe was arguing in the wrong direction -- we are the ones with the numbers).<br><br>What is the standard of the SAF? It is impossible to say until we see our first real battle. However, my personal opinion is that our troops will hack it. The average Singaporean is not a coward and will fight in a disciplined manner when pressed. Our combat leaders (officers and NCOs) are well-chosen, though the style of leadership they are taught is a little inflexible. Nevertheless, I think they will manage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The SAF is not an army of aggression. It cannot be, since the bulk of its strength is composed of reservists. When the SAF goes to war, Singapore's economy shuts down. This makes war extremely expensive for us, even when we achieve victory.<br><br>Therefore we are not inclined to fight wars for trivial reasons. The reason why many regulars to this forum talk in such strong terms about our military might is because we are fed up with the attitude of the average Singaporean. Many Singaporeans think that we are militarily weak and are inclined to give up in war. That is just sheer ignorance and cowardice. You would think they would give a damn and find out what the real story is. Morale is as important as military strength in war.<br><br>About defending vs. attacking: We cannot defend without attacking. Because Singapore is so small, the only practical way for us to defend ourselves is to attack. We have no strategic depth. A single quick thrust and we are defeated. Therefore, if there is the slightest chance of war, we will attack first, and the war will be fought over the enemy's own land. The war will be a fight by the enemy to retake his own land.<br><br>That is why we have to be so strong militarily. We have no other practical means of defense, therefore we need the strength to mount a devastating attack against determined opposition. That is also why our armed forces are such a source of suspicion. Our neighbors know that if they push us too far, we will attack just to be safe. We are a hair-trigger threat that hangs continually over their heads.  We have no choice but to be this way.<br><br>This is also one of the main issues I have with the SAF. Are our citizens prepared to attack another country, capture her land and resources and subdue her population (at least until diplomacy resolves the issue)? SAF officers and NCOs understand what the battle plan is, and know why this is necessary. The enlisted man may not understand and may quail at this necessary brutality. We should theoretically educate the nation about this, but talking openly about how we need to assault our neighbors is not good diplomacy. That is also why we cannot openly educate our public about our military strength.<br><br>A pity, really.</div>

SAF can be considered one of the strongest army in S.E Asia. However, I think that the Thai Army is also strong, even better than the SAF.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   </div></blockquote>Strong? The thails have problems with fundings , however i shd say their armed force is extremely active....... Dun worry , we have confidence in fighting off the thails.<br><br>However striking deep into thailand may be with difficulty , it is more reasonable to form multiple defensive line along the SCS and the SOM to block any attack. This contributes y singapore have such strong diplomatic ties with thailand.</div>
