            <div class='col-md body'>It has to be either Rommel or Guderain for me<br><br>The latter for his exploit commanding the 7 Panzer Division during the invasion of France and for his drive to Benghazi in 1941 during the African campaign. He helped create the legendary fighting exploits of the Afrika Korps and was considered the most competent German commander at the early part of World War 2. However, he probably did not do as well after the surrender of the Afrika Korps. His command of Army Group E and B in Greece/ Italy was forgettable. His tenuere as Army Group B commander saw him as commander of the Alantic coast and he probably did not perform as well due to conflicts with his superior, Von Runstedt, on the best way to defend the Palais and Normany beach head from an Allied invasion. Although no fault of his when the Allied made deep penetration into the beach head within days, he would have partial responsiblity for the debacle. He also predicted wrongly the site of the Allied invasion and placed large amount of armour and troops within the Calais Sector. Rommel was also considered a wilful commander by the German High Command due to the fact that the 7th Panzer broke off radio contact with it's higher HQ during the drive to the coast and Rommel had acted on his own direction instead of those from the Korps HQ.The legend of Rommel would probably attribute to his flair, leadership and chivalry towards foes. His flair and leadership made him a legend among the troops of the Korps and when he was forced to leave Africa when all was lost , his departure was not announced due to fear of a drop in moral in the Korps. He also cut his own men water ration in order to feed British POWs with enough water. However, what made this man legend was his supposed involvement in the plot to assissinate Adolf Hitler and dying under the orders of Hitler.<br><br>The former was probably the most brilliant commander of tank units in the entire German Officer Corps during the second world war. Guderian can also be considered the creator of the combined arms and Blitzkreg doctrine. His work Achtung Panzer is basically one of the finest military doctrine book ever written. In commend of the XIX Corps in France, he was the commander that made the vital breakthrough at the Meuse that split the Allied forces into two (The Sickle Cut). Later in Russia,commanding Panzergruppe 2, he made the drive towards Kiev and bag 600 000 Soviet POWs when Hitler diverted attack from Moscow. However, this was probably his large great achievements during the War. As well as a brilliant war commander, he stood up to Hitler and openly showed his contempt for him and was duly relieve of his command in Russia.  Guderian was later made the Inspector of Panzer Troops and the Chief of the General Staff where in that post, he had many heated arguments with Hitler and was once again relieved in 1945.<br><br>There are other colourful german generals and field marshal during World War 2. Some like Von Manstein,Hoth,Dietrich,Henrici,Von Mantauffel,Hube,von Rundstedt,Model and Von Weichs. Pick your choice and say why u think he's yr favourite.</div>

However, at the point in time before he bacame naval chief, his superior,Raeder doctrine was to built up a conventional naval fleet. Submarines were never the piority before he became chief.

Raeder demanded the building of capital ships, while Donitz demanded the building of U-boats. Raeder at first won, and large amounts of resources were poured into the construction of warships.<br><br>It was only later on when the U-boats proved their worth in commerce raiding that Donitz finally got the resources that he wanted. I see him having more foresight in acknowledging that the way to defeat the Brits was to starve them out by submarine blockade. Certainly he learnt those lessons as a WWI U-boat lieutenant, and the experience of Germany being starved out by naval blockade in that war.<br><br>Ironically, Raeder himself admitted that his own idea of building capital ships was flawed, considering the vast numerical and qualitative superiority of the British Royal Navy over the German Kriegsmarine.</div>

The main reason why North African was given any piority was that Hitler wanted to tie down as many British and Commonwealth troops in Africa as possible. There was never any plans or ambition on the part of the Germans to drive down to the Suez Canal.<br><br>However, i do read from some non-offical sources that the Germans actually planned to drive down to the Suez to link up with the Eastern Front Armies in Central Asia before making a concentrated drive down to India and linking up with the Japanese in Burma. However, the German operation plan to stop the invasion of the Soviet Union at the AA point makes it virtually impossible for such a plan to exist. THe Germans might be ambitious but they are also aware that the occupation of the entire Soviet Union is almost impossible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fritz Klingenberg<br><br>Notable acts, <blockquote>Klingenberg's direction of artillery during a battle was unique and impressive. Once, during the French campaign, he even called deadly 88mm fire down on his own position to rout an enemy counterattack. That action allowed the entire German column to press forward, taking advantage of confusion among the French. During another engagement, he called Junkers Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers down on his position to stop the enemy from retreating, which resulted in the capture of 55 prisoners. </blockquote><blockquote>Klingenberg also gained a reputation as a first-class scrounger. Whatever his men needed -- ammunition, food, water, etc. -- he managed to furnish. Klingenberg even held a school for scroungers, teaching men to steal essentials for survival. </blockquote>The most awesome act is he was stuck behind enemy lines doing intelligent gathering, taking ONLY  one sergeant and five privates, he managed to get into the city center and managed to capture the ENTIRE damn city with any loss.<br><br>Firing artillery on his own position, ran across 100m with no cover and under fire, and managed to kill 3 man in the machine gun post.<br><br>He had balls of steel.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Klingenberg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Klingenberg</a></div>
