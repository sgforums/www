            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fatum:</div><div class="quote_body">this doesn't happen in Australia alone ... </div></blockquote>The last European country I visisted was Italy near the end of last year. There was virtually no discrimination probably because the Italians are very used to seeing tourists of all races and a hundred million million visit Italy every year.<br><br>But there was still one or two ocassions where I step into a restaurant and they hesistated a split second before they approached to serve me.<br><br>The reason was simple and it's not because of my clothes - I wasn't dressed poorly. (After years of travelling experience I now understand why the Japs ALWAYS dress their best when overseas. People overseas have low opinions of Chinese/Asians, so you better dress well if you wish to be treated well.)<br><br>I walk along the streets of Venice, Rome and you know what I see? Chinese people selling wind up toys on a piece of cloth on the pavements, giving foot massages to fat German tourists and other such forms of street peddling.<br><br>For most Italians, this is the lasting impression of Chinese people in their mind. So when one steps into their restaurant e.g. me, they're not sure if I was there to give custom or to peddle toys.<br><br>So I would advice those of you who still have the idea of backpacking to Europe at least make sure you dress hip, if not expensive, less you be mistaken for a street peddler.<br><br>On the streets of Italy, Chinese people are above the gypsies only because they don't steal or rob.<br><br>I felt a pang of shame but then I quickly reminded myself that this is unfortunately the story of the Chinese diaspora.<br><br>Many of our grandparents came to Singapore the same way, I'm sure - peddling stuff or being coolies. But look at us today. And rags to riches stories happening to these dirt poor immigrants are still happening today as we speak. So if I go back a decade later the street peddler could be a restaurant owner.</div>

Hooray.<br><br>The general rule is that for every drug trafficking mule caught, at least 5 others (or more) go undetected. According to a report i read long ago, Singapore is a MAJOR drug transit point, both the air and the sea port. And worst of all, most drug mules caught are due to tip offs, not the vigilance of our custom officers.<br><br>Surprised? you shouldn't be cos you all know about Singapore's strategic location for trade routes etc. Drugs is simply another form of commerce.<br><br>So to those of you who are prepared to be compassionate to drug traficking stories - stop being naive.<br><br>And you must also remember that it is the Australian govt's job to protest loudly every time their citizens are sentenced to death for something. This is not the first time nor wil it be the last time. You know the SG government won't budge, so it's a little game that will play itself out though all sides already know the score.<br><br>Drug traffickers know FULL WELL the death penalty if caught trafficking in SG or MY, so they don't need your pity. People die everyday, why shouldn't drug trafficers?<br><br>I did not comment on the whole death sentence thing earlier cos the thread was about SAF being welcome in Australia.<br><br>My view is that while Aussie troops seem to have no problem and may in fact find it amusing that English-speaking troops of an Asian ally nation is training there, most white supremacists don't see the same way. And it doesn't need a controversial death sentence to stir this cauldron.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking abt Chinese tourist, and in light of the recent incident that happened in Malaysia regarding the insulting of China tourist, .........this is wat I feel.<br>Of course, those wrong policemen needs to be punished. BUT, the way the China ppls conduct and behave themselves in other nations is deploring, digusting and unacceptable. For example, as a student in a local uni, some China students I see, realli give ppls a bad impression of their nations. For example they sing their folk song so loudly that u can hear them at least 40m away, they discuss in their native dialect during project discussion even when there are other races in the groups.<br>I have also seen Chinese tourist oversea, talk loudly, eat in a loud messy manner in those quiet restaurants in Australia. The locals obviously don't accept their behaviours, some shake their heads while others just take it as a amusement machiam like circus clowns.<br>Actually, some Chinese immigrants also do things that harm reputation of thir country. For example, Some of them are in charge of human smuggling, drug issues and also large crime syndicates. All these definitely make a bad impressions and even in Singapore, there are things like "liu ying" a.ka.a prostitutes, thus some times u can't blame others for resenting them.</div>

But, this is what compassion is all about, to put a human side to the absolute, in this case, mandatory sentensing.  Furthermore, I am not asking the judge to consider "relationship" in his/her judgement. I am just asking fellow fourm members to consider about their views and consider the human side of things even in justice.  Why are some accussed being able to get away with lighter sentenses than others, it is all because they have shown repentance, etc.  The judges would have deemed that they are willingly to change their wrongful ways, etc.<br><br>I am trying to stress that mandatory sentensing in this case is to put an absolute to a judgement, to take the "emotion" out of the equation. The judge can do nothing but to administor this punishment as it is in the law.  Mandatory sentensing is about not giving the judge the opportunity to weigh in different perspective of a crime being committed.<br><br>However, having said this, it is true that bring the last comment about "what if Nyugen is your family member" is tarnishing the argument somewhat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

We are not saying "yes" because we agree with the government, we just agree with the law and the sentence. don't be too quick in jumping into conclusion.<br><br>I do agree with you that in other countries, anybody can insult, criticise or even ridicule their PM or politicians, or any public figures. This is what the Singaporean elites should learn to accept = Ppl don't insult them doesn't mean they are respected. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Well, in bringing up children, in sending children for overseas studies, my family hold very strong guard against two evils, Drugs abuse and gamblings. If my children, at the age of 25, got themselves in debt, involved in peddling drugs, not just in australia but traffick illegal drugs all the way from cambodia, I would still fight within the legal means to save their lives, but I will not go all out to publicize their wrong deeds thus tarnishing the names of the family and bring shame to their teachers and all around him. I definitely will not call my 25 yr old "poor boys".<br><br>Giving birth to children is easy, bringing them up is a lot more difficult, especially in societies infested with drugs abuses. Hang the traffickers before they get your children in trouble!!</div>
