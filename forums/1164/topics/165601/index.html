Taiwan politicians end up physical fighting when things turn sour. You will never see this in Australian politics. There are many country that are either like Taiwan or slightly milder.<br><br>Australian parliament model after the westminister system, and hurling "abuses" is just the "norm" but never crossing the line to physical attacks. How can you then make this comment "they're the next best to taiwan". This is so typical generalisation!</div>

Should compassion then be given to the Bali bombers? What I am pissed is how the media blows up this issue! Most other folks get little coverage. Compassion is good, but letting this fella off without the punishment stated by the law which is as clear and cold as can be, is as good as loosely enforcing law. Loosely enforcing law is crime itself as it leads to others taking advantage of this particular weakness that is often overlooked.<br><br>What I am even more pissed is how Australia continuosly tries to interfere in the affairs of SEA countries. Dr Mahathir is right in calling Australia the "sherriff". This is not the first time they have acted without thought to neighbouring countries. What with pre-emptive strikes and all, who do they think they are?! Do they give thought to how we feel executing our own people and yet letting others go because they have the support of a major country?!</div>
