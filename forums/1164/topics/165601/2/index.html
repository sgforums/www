This is not about if Nyugen has broken the law and deserve the death sentence. It is about having an exception, having compassion. We have to ask outselves do Singaporeans know what compassion is. Do we live in a selfish society where our senses are dead to compassion? Read carefully what the Australian are asking. They are pleading for compassion. There are other Australian who were executed due to drugs in Malaysia and other countries, but why this time?<br><br>The answer is that the Australian see Nyugen as an naive, but kind hearted person. Yes, he has committed a serious crime, but given his remorse, reprent and intend of commit the crime, he deserves at least some compassion, albeit that his stupidity has caused him his life.<br><br>If Singapore is to build a more compassionate society, perhaps it is a good time to reflect the mandatory sentensing in the law.</div></blockquote>Yep everyone have their sad stories to tell, thousands of them from the time they are born.

I'm sure a lot more cost effective training places can be found, besides shipping thousands of men, and tons of equipment to Australia (or new zealand ), India perhaps, or southern China even .... their traning areas would be closer to the type of terrain that we'll be operating in during a real war anyways ....<br><br></div>

Singaporean understands that our government RESPECTS the laws of other countries and that any of its citizens who fall foul of those laws are liable to be punished by those laws.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Joe Black: <strong><br>I think the whole terrorist thingy is different from this drug case and we should treat it as such.

How is that going to be different then?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Joe Black:<strong><br>Please people, do not think that as Singaporean, it is right to hold such moral high ground!<br><br>I personally did not see anything wrong with John Howard or Alexandar Downer in this sad case.

If what the opposition says is absolutely reflective of the general feeling of the majority, why is it that they are not the ones in power? I was around during the last elections and I too was surprised by the appallingly low level of support the current opposition actually polled, as opposed to the expected "close call" that was trumpeted. Are they saying that, using the facade of nationalism, just to boost their political prestige?</div>

If the drug is going to cause problems they will happen in Australia and not in Singapore. The fact that the arguement about how drugs are destroying life (albeit true), is not going to happen in this case in Singapore (unlike the Singaporean students in Melbourne will also be one of the herion consumer).<br><br>Look, I am not saying he has broken the law. I am not saying his crime is not serious. I am saying is that in certain circumstances like this, a little compassion can be shown. I believe in giving some second chance, someone who can repent. and contribute to the society.<br><br>Anyway, I can see that the govt is not going to back down. I sometimes wonder if the people are really ready to build more of a compassionate society or is this only a lip services. I recall how the PM talked about transforming the society to a more compassionate one, only to see that in this case, compassion  is not being shown. How can the people learn....</div>
