Furthermore, the intention was to bring the drugs back to Australia and not to Singapore. The ministers in Singapore govt simply misread the mood of the Australian people.

Compassion can only begin when you start asking yourself questions such as the above.  It is precisely because Singaporeans are so famously self-centred that they are apathetic to issues that do not affect them directly.  They would place absolute premium on selfishly paranoid questions such as "what if my family member became a drug addict?" to the exclusion of all other questions when determining the fate of a fellow human being.<br><br>Proof is in the pudding when you see ludicrous posts here comparing the offence of drug trafficking to terrorist bombings and the blind belief that the death penalty is the only way to go to solve the drug problem, or for that matter, probably any other perceived big problems.  You knew the punishment, you took the risk, you suffer the consequences - that is the extent of Singaporean compassion.<br><br>It is simply too much to ask of this nation a mature and progressive mindset.  The only progress we understand is in terms economic.  There is not even a hint of regret or shame that our nation still resorts to a very barbaric form of punishment.  If we are to change that, then we better damn well start by seriously asking ourselves questions such as the one you have suggested instead of dismissing them all in the name of efficiency.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sadly to say Joe Black you are one of those typical frog in the well ppl in australia where compassion will overwrite any logical and correct decision.<br><br>Compassion is to show to ppl that deserve it like those who are torture by the use of drugs and has been suffering from it and not to one that bring drugs into the country. Yes he may have feel totally repent, but he only does so when he knew of his death sentence. Next even if he is on transit, it still Singapore home soil. Also if you say that he shouldn't be hang cos he is only transiting then what if osama load a planeful of sucide bomber and purposely send the on a destination where they will need to transist in australia airport and blow the whole place up?<br><br>Some situation, we can show compassion by reducing the sentence like Michael Fay where he is cane for vandalism. Think of it a car that got vandalised can be send to a repair shop and repair or worst case change a new car, no big deal since no ife or suffering involve. But when it come tp drug, you think the damage can be repair so easy as send them to hospital and clean their stomach? They will DIE or at least Suffering from the ill effect which they have to live with it till the day they die.<br><br>I live in Melbourne for the past 5 years and i do see drug abuser begging for money on the streets and other thing. Sadly to say in term of social security, Singapore are way ahead of Australia. I would be very safe to walk back from any MRT station to my home then walking back to my home from a train station in Australia.<br><br>Human right and right of speech maybe important, but they are not to be misuse as in this case. Everyone have to be responsible to what they say and what they do. By misusing this two thing only result in one thing social unrest as we can see clearly from many countries that is suffering from it.<br><br>Also if my family members did smuggler drugs, i have no problem with them been getting the same treatment because they are at fault.<br><br>Finally, sanctioning Singapore in anyway will result in losses from both side, but there are many countries out there that are more then willing to fill up the holes left by Australia so in the long run Australia will be at the losing end. So the morale is show your compassion to the correct group of people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The general rule is that for every drug trafficking mule caught, at least 5 others (or more) go undetected. According to a report i read long ago, Singapore is a MAJOR drug transit point, both the air and the sea port. And worst of all, most drug mules caught are due to tip offs, not the vigilance of our custom officers.<br><br>Drug traffickers know FULL WELL the death penalty if caught trafficking in SG or MY, so they don't need your pity. When they signed up for the job, they know the risks.<br><br>People die everyday, why shouldn't drug traffickers? We are not here to rehabilitate all criminals.<br><br>Even with a well-known death penalty, there is already a long queue of people willing to traffick drugs through/into Singapore.<br><br>Without a death penalty, the number of people willing to traffick drugs through Singapore will quadrupple. Drugs would become so cheap in Australia (and Singapore) that it will be even more easily available.<br><br>So if we decide to have a death penalty to discourage drug smuggling, should we spare them after we've caught them? If we don't carry out a well publicised threat to eliminate all drug trafffickers, we'll be seen as a joke.<br><br>We should let the folks and would be drug traffickers Down Under and the rest of the world know that we mean business. We WILL kill every convicted drug smuggler.<br><br>Compassion? You gotta be kidding me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some who argued for Nguyen said that since the drugs were not meant for singapore, death penalty should not apply. Now another one who is speaking for lighter sentence is saying that "singapore is so self-centered that they are apathetic to issues that do not affect them directly." If we do ignore those crimes that do not affect us, we will throughly be self-centered. Head you win tail I lose, hmm.... who to listen to??<br><br>Drug trafficker broke singapore law on singapore land, the oz make a fuss for a lighter sentence because the criminal is an oz. Terrorists bombed cities in Indonesia, the oz also make a fuss but for a heavier sentence because the victims were oz. It is indeed ludicrous to compare drug trafficking to terrorist bombings when different standards are applied to different cases, depending on who are the criminals and the victims.<br><br>singaporean has indeed matured as more are speaking up and defending what they believe is right. The more I read about the arguments for and against the sentence, the more I feel that we need to use the right medicine for the right illness, and strong and bitter medicine is necessary if it reduce the chances of terminal illness. Having a clear mind and putting our compassion to the right people, do not allow emotion to overrule our logic and rationale is a "progressive" mindset, is it not?<br><br>"what if Nyugen is your family member?" I would try all legal means to fight for his life, but I will not generate any publicity for it only brings shame to his family, his teachers and all around him. I will see to it that the problem of his twin brother is handled properly and the drug syndicate that paid Nguyen for the job be taken to task, I will tell the twin brother to "earn his life" which his brother has paid for.

I simply state it clearly that I believe that is a case for compassion for Nyugen this time round. I am not asking Singapore to abolish death penalties. I feel that he has gotten the raw end of the stick with the Mandatory sentencing law. His act was not directed at Singapore. Rightly or wrongly, I know deep down that there is no way now for him to escape death.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>"what if Nyugen is your family member?"

I hope that Khoa (his twin brother) will turn a new leaf and live for his brother. I will pray for his family and Nyguen's spirit. I truly hope he has already been born again and that he will see the Lord soon.<br><br>As for people calling me a frog in a well, mind you, you is jumping to conclusion now. How much of me do you know. How do you know I haven't known of drug addicts, seen people took shots. I have had a beloved one taken a form of drug and OD'ed.  So don't go tell me I don't know what it is like. Melbourne, Sydney, or major American, European cities have their fair share of drugs problem. You can even get drugs legally in Holland. I do not agree with drugs, drugs taking or drugs dealing. My hatred is at the drug lords or barons. Those that harvest drugs for pure profits. Those in the golden triangle. If Singapore is serious about dealing with drugs, go pressure the Burmese govt since Singapore has such excellent relationship with them. Killing a drug mule like Nyugen, I believe, is not effective in reducing the drug trades in the region.<br><br>I always welcome constructive debates. launtpc, please don't feel that I am targeting you. I see a lot of "strong" and unreasonable comments in many forums. My comments are just general in nature. As for people who simply assume I am just "one of those typical frog in the well ppl in australia where compassion will overwrite any logical and correct decision", well you can blame that to my Singapore upbring then huh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Perhaps it was my chinese centric education (1st language chinese) education unlike all these English ed people... ha ha ... just joking....

Also by using the name of god to get away with thing, that why there are so many sucide bombers willing to die just because ppl know how to manipulate them using religion as a tool to brainwash them.<br><br>Firstly, Singapore is still not that stupid as to use extreme policy into getting thing done to their wish like some countries does. Drugs is a sticky issue but not to the extent of waging war or sanction against other country because SIngapore respect the goverment of other countries and therefore we can only enforce heavy punishment to deter anyone that try to bring harm to us.<br><br>Yes this is a running in circles debate, but bringing it to the simplest form i guess that is YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW, so prepare to receive any punishment if you are willing to break it no matter what the reason behind is.<br><br>Well your compassion is based solely on what the bible said without having a thought at the actual situation now where many people maybe suffering if ever the drugs get on the street, so compassion to a drug smuggler isn't it become murderer to others people?</div>

Compassion can only begin when you start asking yourself questions such as the above.  It is precisely because Singaporeans are so famously self-centred that they are apathetic to issues that do not affect them directly.  They would place absolute premium on selfishly paranoid questions such as "what if my family member became a drug addict?" to the exclusion of all other questions when determining the fate of a fellow human being.<br><br>Proof is in the pudding when you see ludicrous posts here comparing the offence of drug trafficking to terrorist bombings and the blind belief that the death penalty is the only way to go to solve the drug problem, or for that matter, probably any other perceived big problems.  You knew the punishment, you took the risk, you suffer the consequences - that is the extent of Singaporean compassion.<br><br>It is simply too much to ask of this nation a mature and progressive mindset.  The only progress we understand is in terms economic.  There is not even a hint of regret or shame that our nation still resorts to a very barbaric form of punishment.  If we are to change that, then we better damn well start by seriously asking ourselves questions such as the one you have suggested instead of dismissing them all in the name of efficiency.<br></div></blockquote>I completely agree.<br><br>Am presently in australia for a few days on some work, and the subject of Nguyen's impending hanging has come up in quite a few of the conversations I have had with people here. Surprisingly, the number of views I have come across that understand that he has to be hung / sovereignty issues etc  is more than 2/3rds. However, [and this to me is the real difference in their social mindset and ours in Singapore] even those who understand that the penalty is mandatory and that it concerns issues of national sovereignty / the boy knew it before he carried the drugs etc ...  - even those poeple's views are tempered with the thinking that there must be a compassionate way out of this, that life is not all about black or white rules.<br><br>That's a reflection of a mature society, where people dont just seek to enforce rules because they exist, but where there is instead a constant questioning about whether the rules need to be re-calibrated. I suppose we're too used to not having to think about rules and punishments at home, because we have too little direct (or indirect, even) input into defining them.<br><br></div>
