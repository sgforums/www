            <div class='col-md body'>Zarqawi's dead... oh no..no...no..no..<br><br>in case, you guys doesn't know Zarqawi was a US invented vilant, just because he was in Baddag for medical operation, before that he was in Kurd's backyard under US control... and for that, the US says his a terrorist and thus forced him to be one. From then on everything was blamed on him, while OBL  was temporary forgotten.<br><br>The US really needs another Bogyman to replace him... to play the fear factor and must have a tangible target... so, wake up children.<br><br>Back to the elusive OBL ?????<br><br><blockquote><strong>FBI says, Â“No hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11Â”</strong><br>June 6, 2006 Â– This past weekend, a thought provoking e-mail circulated through Internet news groups, bringing attention to the FBIÂ’s Most Wanted Terrorist web page for Usama Bin Laden.[1]  (See bottom of this web page for Most Wanted page)  In the e-mail, the question is asked, Â“Why doesnÂ’t Usama Bin LadenÂ’s Most Wanted poster make any direct connection with the events of September 11, 2001?Â”  The FBI says on its Bin Laden web page that Usama Bin Laden is wanted in connection with the August 7, 1998 bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya.  According to the FBI, these attacks killed over 200 people.  The FBI concludes its reason for Â“wantingÂ” Bin Laden by saying, Â“In addition, Bin Laden is a suspect in other terrorists attacks throughout the world.Â”<br><br>On June 5, 2006, the Muckraker Report contacted the FBI Headquarters, (202) 324-3000, to learn why Bin LadenÂ’s Most Wanted poster did not indicate that Usama was also wanted in connection with 9/11.  The Muckraker Report spoke with Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI.  When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on Bin LadenÂ’s Most Wanted web page, Tomb said, Â“The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin LadenÂ’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.Â”<br><br>Surprised by the ease in which this FBI spokesman made such an astonishing statement, I asked, Â“How this was possible?Â”  Tomb continued, Â“Bin Laden has not been formally charged in connection to 9/11.Â”  I asked, Â“How does that work?Â”  Tomb continued, Â“The FBI gathers evidence.  Once evidence is gathered, it is turned over to the Department of Justice.  The Department of Justice than decides whether it has enough evidence to present to a federal grand jury.  In the case of the 1998 United States Embassies being bombed, Bin Laden has been formally indicted and charged by a grand jury.  He has not been formally indicted and charged in connection with 9/11 because the FBI has no hard evidence connected Bin Laden to 9/11.Â”</blockquote><a href="http://www.teamliberty.net/id267.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.teamliberty.net/id267.html</a><br></div>

This 'gang' has only one goal - that is to kill Americans (&amp; that is NOT NEGOTIABLE, unless the US itself becomes a Taliban-style Islamic state).  You don't and you can't negotiate nor win the hearts of such people.  <strong>The only way to deal with such people is to fight <span style="color: red;">fire</span> with <span style="color: red;">fire</span>.</strong><br><br>One must remember, there are 2 main groups leading the insurgency in Iraq - the local Sunnis (primarily) &amp; the above 'gang (led primarily by foreign fighters.  The 1st group, yes you can win their hearts as their interest in running the insurgency is to (1) remind any current Iraqi govt not to forget/ignore them (minority Sunnis) as a spent force in Iraqi politics, (2) not to discount them in the distribution of revenue (oil mainly) &amp; (3) to recover some of 'lost' benefits that they enjoyed under Saddam's rule but lost after Saddam fell.  This Sunni-led insurgency had played their cards and played it well.  Their agenda is not unreasonable and defintely could be accomodated (vis-a-vis 'winning their hearts') in future Iraqi politics and as seen in their representation in the new Iraqi govt line-up and hopefully their insurgency-led could be abated.<br><br>However, the latter group led by gangster Zarqawi does not share the Sunnis agenda.  Their agenda is to create hell for everyone (as seen their targetting of both coalition troops and innocent Iraqi civilians in bombings) and create the atmospher that the Americans are 'losing' the war in Iraq (To me, the Americans may be 'losing' battles there but definitely are not losing the war) and thus mystifying their image as a form of a modern-day Saladin Army against the infidels thus attracting more 'mis-fits' into their ranks.<br><br>I apolgise for hijacking this thread but I believe the successful British experience in combating the communist in Malayan is not applicable to the TAQ (Taliban/ Al-Qaeda) organisation when their hardcore agenda is to portray themselves as a Islamic savior combating 'injustices' suffered by fellow muslims worldwide and see deaths to infidels as glorious and their own death as welcomed and guaranteed to enter an Islamic Heaven.</div>

All were new recruits, largely from Jordan, and they had come to fight in a fratricidal civil war in neighboring AfghanistanÂ—an outgrowth of the CIA-financed jihad of the 1980s against the Soviet occupation there.<br><br>The men were scruffy, Huthaifa mused as he greeted them, and seemed hardly in battle-ready form. Some had just been released from prison; others were professors and sheikhs. None of them would prove worth rememberingÂ—except for a relatively short, squat man named Ahmad Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalaylah.<br><br>He would later rename himself Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </blockquote><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200607/zarqawi" rel="nofollow">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200607/zarqawi</a></div>

Nicknamed " The Untouchables,"  it was given a no-holds barred brief in pursuit of Zarqawi in May.<br><br>To avoid detection, the team dressed in clothes bought from second-hand stalls in Baghdad's back-street markets. They regularly sprayed themselves with a pungent, sweat-smelling odor known as "souk scent." Each man wore contact lenses that turned their eye color brown or black. The goal was to permit them to look like any other Iraqi peasant as they hunted the most bloodthirsty killer in Iraq.<br><br>"The Untouchables" were assured in advance they need fear no investigation into their methods to bring Zarqawi to summary justice.<br><br>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi<br><br>Though Zarqawi was done in ultimately by massive bombs delivered from high-tech fighters, the unit members were each equipped with L115A-338 sniper rifles that allowed them to kill at 1,000 yards. But the key to the mission was the fact that each made high-risk surveillance operations into normally no-go areas in Iraq.<br><br>While officially Israel denies any presence in Iraq, four Mossad assassins were assigned to serve with the unit.<br><br>"The Untouchables" also used thermal-imaging equipment to probe the "rat holes" the terror chief used as he flitted around Baghdad and other cities. They also had at their disposal a CIA-operated Predator unmanned aircraft able to provide a real-time video feedback of any area where Zarqawi was spotted.<br><br>Zarqawi boasted on his website of beheading innocent victims, including the murders of more than 1,000 British and American soldiers in Iraq over the past two years. Zarqawi also led terrorists that killed thousands of Iraqis through relentless suicide bombings and organized attacks. Many of the bombings were directed at large crowds of Shi'ites under a strategy U.S. and Iraqi officials said was designed to trigger a civil war.<br><br>Gen. Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman, Britain's vice chief of the defense staff, had told senior officers in Baghdad that "removing this terrorist will be a massive blow against al-Qaida."<br><br>Maj. Gen. William Caldwell told a news conference today the big breakthrough that led to Zarqawi's location came while U.S. forces were trailing Zarqawi's spiritual adviser, Sheikh Abdul-Rahman.<br><br>"Through painstaking intelligence efforts we were able to start tracking him, monitoring his movements. ... Last night, he went to meet [Zarqawi] again at 6:15 p.m. when the decision was made to go ahead and strike that target," he added.<br><br>Zarqawi came from humble beginnings Â– a former street thug from Jordan. But he remained elusive despite several U.S. military offensives, a $25 million bounty on his head and the capture of what officials said were several of his aides.<br><br>Caldwell said an Egyptian militant trained in Afghanistan named Abu al-Masari, who established the first al-Qaida cell in Baghdad, may succeed Zarqawi as head of the group in Iraq.<br><br>"What everyone needs to understand is the strike last night did not occur in a 24-hour period," he said. "It truly was a very long, painstaking, deliberate exploitation of intelligence, information gathering, human sources, electronics, signal intelligence that was done over a period of time, many, many weeks."<br><br>An Israeli security official told WND final information on Zarqawi's whereabouts came from Jordanian intelligence, saying Egyptian intelligence had the same information.<br><br>There were six people in the house, including a woman and a child, but only Zarqawi and Abdul-Rahman have been identified.<br><br>Caldwell said important information was found at the location that led to 17 simultaneous raids later that night in Baghdad and its outskirts that uncovered a "treasure trove" of information.<br><br>But he cautioned against being overly optimistic because Zarqawi's followers still posed a threat.<br><br>"It's not the beginning or the end but it is a step forward," said Caldwell. "Ridding Iraq of Zarqawi will not instantaneously stop the violence." </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see alot of naysayers here. Fair enough - that he is dead might ultimately mean nothing since another might take his place/ his role has been overhyped/etc etc.<br><br>But I think that is missing the point. This is a guy who boasted of beheading civilians and of carrying out mass murder. The world is a better place because he is dead. I would, of course have preferred him to be captured alive. But I am certainly not going to weep for his death.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interestingly,it seems that someone had already predicted Zarqawi's demise the day before.........<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><a href="http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htmurph/articles/20060607.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htmurph/articles/20060607.aspx</a><br>"Zarqawi Scheduled for Martyrdom<br>June 7, 2006: The relationship between terrorist leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi and and the mainline al Qaeda leadership continues to deteriorate. Zarqawi's recent audio messages have not only attacked the U.S. and the Shia-dominated government in Iraq, but also Iran. He's even claiming that the U.S., Iran, and Shia in general, are in cahoots to destroy Islam. He has also called for continued attacks against Shia.<br><br>Except for his verbal attacks on the U.S. and the Iraqi government, he is almost totally distanced himself from the central leadership. Other al Qaeda leaders have been trying to down play anti-Iranian and anti-Shia rhetoric, and have been strongly discouraging attacks on civilians.<br><br>Given that Zarqawi has become a loose cannon and that his actions are handicapping Al Qaeda's efforts, it seems reasonable to expect that an accident may befall him at some point in the near future. If handled right it can be made to look like he went out in a blaze of glory fighting American troops or that he was foully murdered. Either way, al Qaeda gets rid of a problem and gains another "martyr." "</div>
