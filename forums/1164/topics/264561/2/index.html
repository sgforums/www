The RAM coating actually asborbs the electromagnetic radiation.  The pilot should receive minimal if none at all.  The canopy perspex is coated with gold foil to absorb the radiation.<br><br>Now if you are in a non-stealth aircraft, eg F-5, Mig-29 and you have 2 E-2C Hawkeye or AEGIS painting you, the squigglies won't be anymore.

It is but one part of stealth.<br><br>The performance of stealth aircraft is dependent on a lot of thing, the weather, the kind of radar being used (different frequencies have varying effectiveness), distance to emitter and what have you not. Bad weather was identified as the main reason the F-117 got detected in Kosovo when moisture on the airframe allowed long wavelength radar to track it. Also note that the F-117 was based on with the old facet design due to the limitations of computer technology in its day, and hence less efficient of the kind of find in later generation stealth aircraft.<br><br>It is not impossible to detect stealth aircraft, just that it is extremely difficult compared to conventional designs. And of course being able to detect the presence of stealth aircraft is one thing, but being able to track and get a firing solution is another. And of course, stealth is a useful thing to have if you want to get closer to your opponent to get the jump on him and get out of there before he can see you or get clear enough to get you, so no matter what, so common sense tells you itÂ’s a good thing to have.<br><br>And as for the F-22 mock fights, itÂ’s tough to say for the simple reason the yanks will not be forthcoming about the true extents of this aircraft. In fact they are being tight lipped about just about what it can, and cannot do.<br><br>But I think it does little service to anybody to tamper with anything just to create the amazing story that you canÂ’t acquire the F-22 WVR for propaganda purposes. It is so absurd that people will question it indeed, not to mention give the Raptor pilots no actual training in red flag. So is it propaganda? I donÂ’t know but IÂ’ll leave an open verdict. There is no doubt the Raptor is a stealthy and capable mount thought.<br><br>In most cases the Raptor tactics are to get Slammers downtown before they are even seen, and hence most of the mock fights are over before they even start, and that would be the tactic you would expect them to use.<br><br>Just remember with all technologies there is a hype cycle:<br><br>1. "Technology Trigger" The first phase of a Hype Cycle is the "technology trigger" or breakthrough, product launch or other event that generates significant press and interest.<br><br>2. "Peak of Inflated Expectations" In the next phase, a frenzy of publicity typically generates over-enthusiasm and unrealistic expectations. There may be some successful applications of a technology, but there are typically more failures.<br><br>3. "Trough of Disillusionment" Technologies enter the "trough of disillusionment" because they fail to meet expectations and quickly become unfashionable. Consequently, the press usually abandons the topic and the technology.<br><br>4. "Slope of Enlightenment" Although the press may have stopped covering the technology, some businesses continue through the "slope of enlightenment" and experiment to understand the benefits and practical application of the technology.<br><br>5. "Plateau of Productivity" A technology reaches the "plateau of productivity" as the benefits of it become widely demonstrated and accepted. The technology becomes increasingly stable and evolves in second and third generations. The final height of the plateau varies according to whether the technology is broadly applicable or benefits only a niche market.<br><br>When stealth was first revealed there was a ton of hype going about it, and later when it could be pratically defeated, some people thought it was useless and not worth considering in any argument. But currently the most enlightened and reasonable people know it has its purpose and place. I dunno about you, but if I want a ride to go downtown with, I would certainly want stealth to be part of its package.<br><br></div>
