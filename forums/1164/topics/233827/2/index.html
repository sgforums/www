Of course it really depends each army doctrine on deployment of snipers.<br><br>Say if each bde has a platoon of snipers (too few to deploy around), they will most likely be employed to carry out high value mission, which normally requires they to inflintrate deep into enemy territory and operate far from parent unit. Thus, carry heavy combat load.<br><br>Where as a country with platoon of snipers at company or battlion level may  use them for less valuable targets, harressing enemy advance, take out heavy weapon or defensive missions. These snipers would require less combat load due to their restricted area of operation (close to parent unit)<br><br>All i'm saying is a sniper should be versatile enough to carry out different missions, ability to carry heavy combat load is a BIG BIG plus.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have read that back in the 80s there are snipers deployed at battalion level in SAF, can anyone verify this? If yes, then why did army remove the sniper platoon from the BN?<br>Another question is I seen before pics of 3SIR in Fibua training in defense documentary. There was this segment that they say urban snipers are employed to pick out enemy target. Are these sniper members of the BN or are they from the BDE? I was thinking since most rifle coy have quite a number of spare commanders and men lying around, why not introduce coy lvl marksmen and arm them with sniper rifle that are semi-automatic? They come in handy in taking out MG enemies hidden in well entrenched position.</div>

That's how the mole-like Japs got dug out in WWII.</div>

Of course it really depends each army doctrine on deployment of snipers.<br><br>Say if each bde has a platoon of snipers (too few to deploy around), they will most likely be employed to carry out high value mission, which normally requires they to inflintrate deep into enemy territory and operate far from parent unit. Thus, carry heavy combat load.<br><br>Where as a country with platoon of snipers at company or battlion level may  use them for less valuable targets, harressing enemy advance, take out heavy weapon or defensive missions. These snipers would require less combat load due to their restricted area of operation (close to parent unit)<br><br>All i'm saying is a sniper should be versatile enough to carry out different missions, ability to carry heavy combat load is a BIG BIG plus.<br></div></blockquote>Yea my point exactly.<br>However for police work that's not needed so i guess they can.<br>But the whole point of this thread was can pretty girls shoot?Well i'm sure they can.But if they make good snipers is another matter.For all you know given the chance Miss universe could hit a target 1000m away</div>
