What we've got in the end was wanton slaughter for nothing in WWI.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The LSV is a good concept. I would disagree that its a deathtrap. Surprise is its tactical advantage. If a column of armoured vehicles are caught by surprise by an LSV company, the enemy tanks, APCs/IFVs would be the deathtraps instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> LSVs are not designed for a head-on charge...that would make it a deathtrap...<br><br>According to the simulations that I'm playing out for my thesis, LSVs would be able to inflict a very favourable kill ratio, in return for one of their own. All this is based on surprise, stealth agility. Given the nature of our terrain, LSVs might prove to be a formidable battle opponent that enemy armour would face....in conection to a combined-arms ops I mean... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The LSV is meant to be a weapons platform for the battalion support weapons in Guards units. It provides support fire for the battalion, performs block missions, among others, as well. It is not meant to be tank. In all the exercises I've been in, I have never seen the battalion support company charge at the enemy. They are always supporting the line companies in the battalion operation, not the other way round.<br><br>In other countries, (Eg. Australia, Germany, Malaysia, UK, etc), heavy battalion support weapons for Infantry units are usually mounted on soft-skinned vehicles like the Land Rover.<br>Only in mechanised or armoured units are armoured weapons platform found. The French, for example mount their milans ATGM on their VBL vehicles in mechanised units. In short, light infantry units are not armoured and do not normally have armoured vehicles.<br><br>The LSV is a good vehicle for its intended role (light infantry unit, air mobile or RDF role). It is better than the Land Rover or G wagon found in average infantry units around the world. As for comparisons to the US 101st Div - they have more airlift than the whole RSAF put together.</div>

The LSV is a unique vehicle and has roles and operations that required such a vehicle. No commander in their right sense of mind would just send in the LSVs alone against amoured unit without expecting some serious losses.<br><br>A little scenario to maybe help improve your views on the LSVs.<br>Our amoured unit is currently engaged in battle with the enemy armoured unit, tanks exchanging fires with the IFV in support. The conventional tanks vs tanks scenario. WIth your LSVs' speed, they could manuvuer to an position that allows them to fire their Spike missiles and assist in the clean of the enemy unit. Remember, you do not need a LOS to fire the Spike.<br><br>In this scene, the LSVs are quite same considering the enemy unit will be busy trying to take out the armoured unit that they are currently engaging.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> To further add on... if the enemy tank commander can "see" your missile flying towards them, then your missile is traveling at an awfully slow speed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ... and if they can see you firing at them, then you have chosen an awfully weak firing point and deserve to be shot at.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think bcoy is absolutely correct. The LSVs are certainly faster, lighter and more capable than the other soft-skinned vehicles they replace. They are 21st Century jeeps. I think that if they had simply released the LSV with a version that had no weapons, people would have understood what it was ("infantry support vehicle", "fast armed transport" ) and there would have been no complaints. But because they only released armed versions, people immediately think "fighting vehicle" or even "tank".<br><br>Don't forget that Guardmen also fight dismounted. If the situation is not right for the LSV, they can leave it someplace, pick up their personal weapons and fight as infantry. The LSVs are not tanks and Guardsmen are not tankees. Even if the LSV were completely unarmed they would be useful, simply to give the dismounted guardsment more mobility and allow them to carry more supplies and ammunition.<br><br>As for speed not being a form of protection, the LSVs use their mobility to choose the battleground and to choose the enemy. As long as the LSV is not forced into battle, it can always fight in ground that favors itself and with enemies that cannot strike it back. For example, it can sit on a hill and tear up infantry with the GPMG from 800m away where they cannot shoot back. If the infantry manages to get closer, the LSV just escapes behind the hill. Or it can pop a Spike into a tank at 2-3 km range. By the time the tanks locate the little dot on the horizon and lay their guns on its position, the LSV is gone. The LSV will probably seek to bully infantry and play hit and run with armor, playing to all its strengths and their weaknesses.<br><br>The problem is that this all hinges on the LSV having the initiative and good intel. The LSV will die instantly in an ambush (but so will anything else, even an Abrams MBT). The LSV will die instantly if it is engaged at close range by an unexpected foe. If the LSV is forced to fight defensively, it will also die since it cannot hold ground (hence the "strike" part of the name). So the Guardsmen have to be really on the ball and "ready to strike".<br><br>Could the LSV be improved? The current LSV design is a compromise that takes into account many factors like available RSAF airlift capacity, technology and cost. I think it is a nearly optimal design given the current situation, though the situation can change. For example, if the RSAF had more heavy lift helicopters, we could field a heavier LSV with armor. But it might be less mobile and consume more fuel  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  So it is hard to say.<br><br>So count me as a supporter of the LSV.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The LSV, IMO, is best suited for hit-and-run tactics. It is also a  good transport vehicles for light airborne forces, essentially the Guards units. It can also be employ for recce missions, somewhat like the Australian SAS forces (except they use a 6x6 wheels Range Rover).<br><br>The use of buggys like the LSV was popularised by US Delta and other special forces. LSV was never meant for real full frontal fighting. It will be too easy to take a couple of them with rifle rounds, hand grenades or even, on the extreme, RPGs.<br><br>If, however, they are employ as a hit-and-run vehicles, it would be excellent because of their mobility, agility and speed.  Basically, the poor guards would have to do a high speed shoot and scoot and hope that the enemies are hit bad enuff to return fire or would have to take too long before they can return fire. The LSVs would have long been gone and fight another day.  LSVs can also hunt in "wolfpack" tactics where they hit the enemies very hard in a pack and then run.  Since these LSVs are decently armed with ATGMs, AGLs and HMGs, I can see them doing quite a fair bit of damage.<br><br>Lastly, does anyone know why SAF rejected the French VBLs? I read that a couple was brought into Singapore for trial during the mid 90s together with the AMX-10s. However, they were not being purchased. Just interested to know what the reason behind the decision....<br><br></div>
