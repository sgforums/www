            <div class='col-md body'>Is there any vehicle out there on shelf which provide mobility , agility , firepower and protection at the same time???<br><br>My answer is no . They have to sacrifice a factor for another. Sad to say , many of the world's most agile war machine lack of armour. The Japanese Zero is one example. They sacrifice armour for speed which made the aircraft a spotlight in WW2.<br><br>Our LSV is made for mobility and Agility  , thus very unfortunate , sacrifice some firepower and alot of protection .<br><br>Btw , for those in Guards , will u all be issued NVGs and body armour in combat??? Im rather impressed when seeing those allied forces in combat, their government do make an effort to equip each and everyone of them NVGs and body armour. Their small arms are modified to enchance accuracy . I have seen photos of rifles and even SAWs equiped with 3x scope .<br><br>I believe if Mindef will to adopt such measures , our troop survivability will increase tremendously.</div>
