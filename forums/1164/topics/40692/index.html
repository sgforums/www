            <div class='col-md body'>I dun see how it's agility can help it run from bullets, people anyhow spray in your general direction no matter how fast you can run or dodge with that thing, if the bullet has your name on it you're dead liao. Putting just some panels to protect against 7.62mm will greatly increase survability. Also, it must be some good terrain to allow the LSV 4km of clear ground to get a LOS shoot with a missile. Most of the time engagement distances are much nearer then that.

            <div class='col-md body'>The LSV can't afford to take a single hit, even a single a single bullet on a path intersecting the crew compartment will be disasterous, and seeing how open and exposed it is, virtually any shot you fire to hit the LSV near the center of mass will end up passing through the passanger compartment. Even in areas where resistance is light, you're gonna take some fire. Imagine them using the LSV in areas like Um Qusar or Brasa fighting, or even just to scout. A single infantry man firing at it with aimed shots will be bad liao. How fast and agile can you go to avoid the bead of a trained shooter?</div>

Somalia ] )  and US Marines ( Amphibous operation ).<br><br>However , our needs and the US needs is different . LSV is indeed vulnerable to light arms , but the fact is that LSV will operate in mission whereby in constead friendly support and certainly not a rambo in fighting alone. Im not from the Guards , surely i dunno how the Guards will utilies their cars , however logic will tell mi that if the situation prove too dangerous for LSV , i dun think the LSV will be deployed . Even if it deployed , support will be there for them. All we want is that they move faster than the enemy , punch harder than the enemy and get their ass out faster than anyone.
