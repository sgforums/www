            <div class='col-md body'>The question here is not if the LSV is supposed to stop rounds like a heavy hummer, but if anything can be done to improve it's current protection package, or lack of it. The LSV currently has <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">no</span></strong> protection at all.<br><br>I'm sure doing some modifications to add on certain panels to at least give them proof against 7.62mm rounds will greatly add to the survability of this unit without greatly compromising it's mobility. After all it's mobility appears to be an excessive tradeoff for it's lack of protection and they could shave a few kph off to make it a more pratical unit. Rather then crossing your fingers and expecting the enemy not to hit you, which is insane in a firefight. All it takes it one infantryman... Have they actually even tried to run MILEs test to suppose if their assumptions that their speed and agility can allow them to dodge bullets? My suspision is, unless the LSV can do martix-stunts, dodging bullets will be near impossible, even with its speed. The only way LSV be used in operations and expect to survive where the enemy will not resist or fire back at it, which is madness, considering the roles they want it to take up. It's overgunned, overspeeded and unarmoured. Even light resistance of enemy rifle fire will be bad for LSV crew.<br><br>Said and done, it appears the LSV operations concept is a greatiy flawed one that could be better filled with better protected units.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm , Dino ...okok , i understand u...<br><br>I hope the Mindef will install in panels to protect troops agaisnt small arms ( agaisnt 7.62 , i think alittle impossible in ambush ) in the front and on the side. For the top , i dun think they can offer any protection when the soldier stand up to fire the AGL or ATW.<br><br>Not onli the panels have to be able to protect the troop , it must not restrict the troop firing movement within the vehnicle.

They are build to give the enemy surprises rather then taking surprises from the enemy. Im not sure whelther can it launch a Spike on the move , however if Spikes are fix for launch in fast boats and helicopter of other country , i believe we can launch it on the run too. One unique feature of the spike is their Fire and Forget mode which i believe able them to fire on the move accurately.<br><br>Actually the Spike have a range of abt 2 to 4km for LR versions and 4 to 8km for ER version. I dunno which one the SAF is using. Lets take it that it is the LR version which means that the LSV can engage any ground object at stand-off range of 2 to 4 kms, which mean that they wont need to go so close to raid targets on the move.<br><br>Palastinian Freedomfighters view that Spike as a mini-cruisemissile , i believe by now u all shld know how it works without truely revealing the position of the launcher.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe SAF has the Spike LR variant which has a range to 4 KM.  This is the version found on most Spike-armed LSV. It might also have the ER variant. A picture of the ER variant on SAF LSV is shown in the Rafael homepage. However, I haven't seen any evidence of it yet on any official SAF statement or press release articles or photos.<br><br></div>

Imagine u are in a convey of PT-91 , suddenly out of nowhere over the hills 2 spike missile came picking out the first tank and the last tank . Countermeasure have been made , however too late , more missile came streaking from the sky , picking the remaining tanks one by one through their IR-optic device. Surviving tanks have to face our overwheming spearheading armour columm , the enemies armour convoy had crippled , Bionix and Ultras rush in to pick out their M.Infantrys columm with support of Apaches and Fennecs Scout heli . Anyone try to escape will be chase or be ambush by our fast running LSV. After battle anaylst found that out of 20 LSVs we lost 4 in ambush while the armour faces no losses thanks to overwhemming standoff support from our Apaches and LSVs and intelligence support from the Fennec and SeacherMk2...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
