            <div class='col-md body'>M113s?  Are you serious?  M113s are thin skinned, even 0.5cal can punch through.  The hull is made of aluminium, aluminium burns.  If you take an M113 and grind it up into powder and you'll have a nice pile of rocket fuel.  You can only strap on that much extra applique armour until it can hardly move.  Best to leave the M113s in the roles they are good in, as battlefield taxis.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the biggest advantage that the old M113 have is its swimming capability. It is ready for river crossing with the minimum of preparations, very fast as compared to BX. Those that knew able the preparations for the BX for swimming will know that it is very troublesome and makes it very vulnerable. I think this is the biggest problem with the BX. That is one of the reasons why we upgraded the M113 to the Ultra standard while at the same time producing the BX. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you an actual tankee? My impression was that armored units tried to avoid river crossings as much as possible, even with M113s. Instead, as far as possible they try to get combat engineers to lay a bridge, since it is safer, faster, produces less wear on the machines and is more tactical. You usually need CEs to prepare the banks anyway, otherwise you won't be able to get in or out of the water. It was my impression that the swimming capability was only for use when there was no alternative. Could you or any other guys in Armour confirm this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little difference, all tracks will damage roads to a certain extent.<br><br>The real reason why we dun have heavyweight western MBTs, I suspect, is not because they will cruch our roads or get bogged down at Johor Baru forest (considering the opfor are also using MBTs). The real reason, I believe, is one that of cost and praticality.<br><br>Can Singapore really have an armoured cav.? Will we fight our wars with tons of armour rolling down JB armoured fist methods? If anything, it seems that we are more content with "flyweight" fighting, meaning we fight smart rather then hard. Hence the emphasis on advanced artty support, smart anti-armour units/munitions and the like. Our hope is probably to avoid armoured clashes altogether and destroy the opfor's armoured assets before they can actually make a concerted punch with their steel.<br><br>There is also of course, the fact that this region is generally deviod of large formations of heavy armour. Sure, maybe a platoon here or there of opfor MBTs, but to make any real punch at all they will have to throw everything at us, which leaves them with no way of replacing losses. More likely, their MBTs are not they to roll over, par say, but to provide their forces with heavy mobile armoured firepower, a capability we hope to match with future light armour in team with ground infantry antiarmor units.<br><br>One can only see if time plays out in our favour.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends, on a flat out road march, wheeled units are far more reliable then tracked units... HOWEVER, once you go cross country, you will find that tracked mobility becomes FAR more reliable, able to take far more abuse before requiring maintaince.<br><br>Heavy wheeled units like your LAV however, are not very reliable. While good on roads, once they encounter mud, sand or soil, they require wheel replacements every two weeks or risk failure. A tracked M113 however, can be neglected for 3 months before somebody takes a look at it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes i agree, M113 should not be under estimated. To answer a previous question,yes i am a tankee. And yes, river crossing is not prefered by the SAF for armoured forces. We will usually look for the SCE for support eg the new BLB. Reson why river crossing is not prefered is that AMX-13SM1 tanks are included in the ABG together with the M113 and/or the BX. Both the BX and the M113 can swim but the SM1 can't so river crossing by swimming is not possible without the support by the SCE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
