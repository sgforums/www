            <div class='col-md body'>I predict that the Tempest will stay with us for a longer period of time as its already upgraded to quite an advanced level. So for the moment i dun think that it will be replaced in the next 5 years. However i have a vision that the Isareli Merkeva will take over our SM1. Maybe not as a MBT but a smaller version similar to that of the Delta frigates that the navy is getting. The frigates is only based on the original French La Fayette frigates but not identical. They are to be smaller and needed less crew. Why i chose the Merkeva is because of its design and its combat proven. The Merkeva is used extensively for FIBUA in Isarel. The world that we live in is increasing urbanised so a FIBUA capable armoured force for SAF is beneficial.Please air your views.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that the Merkava is an awesome MBT, but it is definitely too heavy and large for our requirements, but making it smaller also means sacrificing some of its abilities that make it so effective in the first place, such as its main gun, or its ability to carry personnel, or level of protection. Anyway, included a pic of the Merkava 4 autoloader as some eye candy.<br><br>[b]<img src="http://www.fprado.com/armorsite/Merkava-Pics/Merk-Mk4-Autoloader.jpg"><br><br>Caption reads:<br>A microprocessor controlled, fully automated, electrically driven, 120 mm rounds magazine. The system is located in an isolated space of the turret and is designed to protect the crew in case of ammunition explosion. The system is easy to operate from the crew compartment. The loader can select proper ammunition out of four different types and 10 rounds total.<br><br>from http://www.fprado.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tankee1981may i noe which unit were u frm? anyway abt the merkava tank, wat u meant by navy using merkava? merkava is one of the top tanks in the world. if spore were to get it, how would spore train its personal on it? it would be a highly classified thingy. even if there is a chance to train on it, dun think spore will risk sendin pple to israel to train. look at the current situation, pple die almost everyday it israel. if personal was sent there and die, how is saf goin to answaer to their parents. another thing, other pple outside spore will not be happy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've often wondered if the terrain that we are in is actually suitable for MBTs? Historically speaking, I think tank warfare in the South East Asian region has been limited largely to light tanks, such as the Japanese invasion in 1942. Even in the Vietnam conflict, MBTs were limited to certain areas of the country and were vulnerable to ambushes. What was far more useful were the APCs.<br><br>I think it might be better that defence dollars be spent on purchasing light tanks based on the existing Bionix chassis. It may lack firepower and armour, but high mobility and manoeverability would compensate for that. A 105 mm main gun should suffice. What can compensate to the lack of killing power might be to get ST to develop newer types of SABOT rounds, and to put reactive armour on the light tanks.<br><br>My 2 cents.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There has been many changes to SEA terrain since 1940.<br><br>Which city in SEA at that time is over 1 million in population? Now, there are mega highways, tall buildings and probably 1000x more vehicles on the road that those days.<br><br>The vegetation changed, with plantations taking up jungle. Roads are better built, and GPS can accurately help navigate the land.<br><br>Population has better communications, and are more dispersed than previous era. And anti tank weaponary is longer range and deadlier.<br><br>This all means that we have to consider heavier combat vehicles. Light tanks may be good for skirmishes and recon duties, but if you do meet the enemy head on, you need something that can dish it out and take it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm from an anti-tank team, and I can say that its not easy to hit armoured vehicles moving at speed moving under cover. Line of sight may be limited at times. Speed is important here.<br>But, armoured vehicles moving without infanty support are easy prey to close-in ambush. Close urban and jungle terrerin allows for well hidden blocking teams. Heavy or light tanks - should always have armoured infantry attached.<br>We should have both heavy and light tanks to suit the operational needs. Heavy tanks with better protection can operate in urban settings, as proven by the IDF. Light tanks with better speed are good for infantry support and recon.<br>The problem with the LAV-25 and other wheeled armoured vehicles are not with the vehicle itself but the way it is used. Wheeled armoured vehicles are not tanks - they are, to me, transport vehicles only. At most - they provide covering or support fire. Heavy, light and wheeled armoured vehicles are war tools - use the right tools for the right job. I hope to see new heavy tanks here (locally produced??). Light tanks are already being developed and we have the Terrex wheeled light armoured vehicles as well. I read in another forum that Israel is looking for new wheeled light armoured vehicles.</div>

Putting the engine in front however, will indeed add more protection to the unit, but the reason why or most MBT designers put them behind is the simple reason of space and geometry, and of course, to protect the engine.</div>

No diff.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nonsense, the position of the engine mounting has little bearing to do with speed. Putting the engine in front however, will indeed add more protection to the unit, but the reason why or most MBT designers put them behind is the simple reason of space and geometry, and of course, to protect the engine. [/b][/quote]<br><br>If the crew dies, would the engine be useful and talking abt space, i recon they will put diesel,etc(depend wat they use) tank inside it. theorical speaking a diesel tank storage will also protect a rd frm goin through but does not do it better than engine.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One thing is for sure the SAF will constantly look for new ways to upgrade their existing capability and at the same time acquire new technology. I have seen for myself many new secret projects which i will not elaborate further due to security concerns. I think that sending men to Isarel to train is not impossible as SAF already send a lot to many different countries world-wide. So in my opinion, we should keep an open mind about getting the Merkeva MBT. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
