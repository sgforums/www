            <div class='col-md body'>The M113 is not a wonder-vehicle, no matter what its strongest supporter on the web Mike Sparks says. Its armor protection is very weak, compared to modern IFVs like Bionix. If you uparmor it to the same level as the Bionix, it will be underpowered instead. The reason why the armor did well in Vietnam was because the B-70 RPG warheads the enemy used had a high dud rate. The aluminium chassis and armor of the M113 can also burn under the right conditions, releasing toxic fumes. There have been incidents where M113s (and older aluminium Bradleys) have had the whole chassis burned away, leaving only the melted steel tracks, engine and chaingun behind.<br><br>At least newer M113s have the fuel tanks on the outside rather than inside -- the old M113s often ignited their crews when penetrated. Many American AIs in Vietnam rode on top of the M113 instead of inside for this reason, even though this exposed them to fire. Better to die of a gunshot wound than being burned alive. Are the Ultras modified in this way, like the M113A3?<br><br>The M113 is definitely useful in "second-line" roles where they are unlikely to face enemy fire. They make good mortar carriers, medevac, command and even logistics vehicles. But if you are expecting to be shot at, you will definitely be better in a Bionix. The key is to use the right vehicle for the right situation. The Bionix is too heavy for some roles, the M113 too poorly protected for others, so just mix and match. I am glad to see the SAF is doing this.<br><br>The problem with M113s nowadays is that there are other vehicles that are even better second-line vehicles. ST's Terrex and Bronco are two examples, and there are many foreign equivalents. The M113 used to be tough enough to be a front line vehicle, but the improvement in anti-tank weapons means its day is over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please, the Bionix is a superior AFV to the M113. Most of the compliants about it's smaller internal size is pretty much moot, for IFVs in general, will have smaller internal space then any M113. Apples and oranges man.<br><br>Why do you think this is so? Because ST has nothing better to do then to produce AFVs that are more expensive and inferior to the M113? Have you lost your mind of forgotten to think?<br><br>No, due to the addition of the turret, heavier armour protection and other nic nacs that come along with modern IFVs, IFVs will, inherently contain less space and be heavier then an M113, which is nothing more then a thin skinned shoebox on tracks. Sure you have the ultra, but then again you have a shin skinned mobile shoebox with a turret that tends to light up like WW2 Shermans when hit. Why do you think an M113 can swim easily? Because of it's shoebox, think skinned design that makes it little more then a large, slow, target floating box with ten people inside.<br><br>At lest in a Bionix, you can have a chance of surviving an RPG hit.</div>

No mistakes, just like on exercise? The M113 won't ever get hit despite its large profile? Your AIs are magic, and the enemies are idiots? So good, ah?<br><br>The problem with evaluating AFVs is that armor protection is usually classified, so people tend to ignore it. Most exercises don't model vehicle hits well either, even with MILES. People tend to look at interior size, speed, ground pressure, armament, etc, but forget why you have an armored vehicle to begin with.<br><br>Again, the Bionix is not better in all roles. The M113 definitely has its place. But if you're going to be shot at a lot, you definitely want more protection. Look at the kings of armored warfare, the Israelis. They favor HAPCs -- MBT hulls with upgraded armor but just a machinegun. Their experience indicates that the most important aspect of a personnel carrier is protection. They also use M113s, but in second-line duties. We can't do what they do, since the terrain here is too soft for HAPCs, but we should not discount their experience either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The main hash here, the Bionix is superior then an M113, and the additional cost is more then worth it. Sure you can uparmour the M113 and add all kinds of "modernization" packages onto it, but in the end is it any more survivable or capable then a bare bones Bionix? Additionally, losing one M113 to battlefield threats means losing ten infantrymen, kapish, out fo action just like that. Why? Because they decided to take the cheaper and inferior mount to do jobs a full fledged Bionix should.<br><br>Is it any surprise battle taxis are getting more expensive, cheap is one thing, working in battle is another. Why do you think the americans decided to come up with the Bradley if the M113 was so fantastic and cost effective as some would like to sing here? Why would Singapore bother?<br><br>What's next? FH2000 superior and more "cost effective" then Primus? Maybe some jokers are going to argue about the superiority of the M16 (in reality one of the most unreliable assualt rifles in history) to the SAR-21.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, in the end the real difference between the M113 or AMX13 and the Bionix is horsepower. The Bionix has a 475 hp engine, while the M113 and AMX13 have 275 hp engines. If you were to upgrade the M113 to the same level of protection as the Bionix it may not even be able to move. The real reason why a redesign was needed was to put in an engine that is more than twice as powerful, so that you can carry enough armor and weapons to be a viable frontline AFV. The M113 chassis is just not cut out to be a frontline APC anymore, unless it undergoes a massive redesign. Still great for lots of things, just that since nowadays section level AT weapons will destroy it from any direction, it shouldn't be on the frontline. Things change.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What the SAF really needs to work on, is also throwing in body armour for our troops. 70 percent of combat wounds come from injuries to the torso which can be protected by body armour.<br><br>Before anybody throws up the usual, and uninformed rethoric about how body around is heavy and hot and gets us hit, let it be known that only SEVEN percent of allied deaths during Iraqi Freedom came from torso injuries, which were caused by large caliber weapons or projectiles entering from an odd angle and bypassing the armour. Body armour undoubtedly saved many troopers and kept them in the fight, especially after they had been hit. Most of allied combat deaths came from neck and face hits, and of course, dangerous leg injuries. A reduction of 70 percent losses equates into cost savings far in excess of the actual cost of equipping our troops with protection.<br><br>It about time the SAF sent us out into the battlefield with more to protect our bodies from bullets and fragments from exploding stuff with nothing more then our number 4 camo.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know that the body armour bit is off track (pun intended) but I just wanted to say that I couldn't agree more.<br><br>As for SM1 - having done installation of signal sets to these things, I totally appreciate the limited space constraints that Tyrano mentioned. Anyway, I believe there must be future plans that we are not privy to and just let it rest on the simple faith that those up there knows what's going on etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>OK, SM-1 is dead.<br><br>But the years operating that thing must have counted for something?

            <div class='col-md body'>When the SM1 was introduced, anti-tank weapons were not as advanced or common as they are now. Our potential opponents' infantry only were able to defeat its frontal armor with company-level weapons or above. Nowadays, they can defeat its frontal armor with section-level weapons and above. Like that, might as well have no armor! Times have changed since the 1960s and the SM1's day in the sun is over.<br><br>It's like asking why the Germans in WWII were so stupid as to use the Panther tank when nowadays even our SM1 can kill it -- it's two different time periods, two different levels of technology, two different worlds. The Panther was truly mighty in its day, now it's pathetic. Same with our dear old SM1. It's not the 60's anymore.<br><br>The question now is whether there is any possible replacement. In order to be a viable tank nowadays, you need a certain amount of armor X, which means the tank will need to be at least a certain weight and size Y. I suspect that at present, Y is too big. A tank that has enough protection to survive will be too big and heavy to be useful in our terrain. That is the probable reason why there is such a delay in finding a replacement for the SM1 -- there may be no possible replacement at present.<br><br>The Bionix already uses special armor which is more than ten times more protective than normal steel on a weight basis. It is still not mobile enough, according to Fairyland. We might have to wait for some massive improvement in armor material technology before armor becomes light enough that a replacement for SM1 can be built.<br><br>Until then, the SM1 needs to change tactics to become an assault gun or tank destroyer, not a tank. It cannot expose itself to fire, even from infantry. It has to use range and terrain to protect itself, and refrain from assaulting. Not very different from a LSV with a RCL or ATGM <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Basically, maneuver warfare might be impossible in SEA currently, except by light forces.<br><br>I think the SAF might change to an MBT-based doctrine instead. Straight up the middle with thousands of tonnes of fire-breathing metal. Straight into landmines, obstacles, ambushes and enemy fortifications. American-style attrition warfare. Mini Fulda Gap in SEA. Ugh.</div>

But I should think clearings are also prime locations for enemies to setup anti-armor ambushes.<br>What you know, they will know also.<br><br>If the infantry needs to enter the thick woods to engage the enemy or secure an objective, they would need heavy fire support.
