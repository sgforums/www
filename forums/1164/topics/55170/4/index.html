But then this is different from our "Primus" , cos i believe that the fh88 gun was "wrapped" with armour . Any armour guys here got any idea whether our country have the capability to design or make a NEW MBT in standard with the polish tanks which the malaysian purchased ?</div>

It's too expensive for us, and no army in the world can get it and enjoy its maximum benefits, as it is designed as a networked force to be plugged into the rest of the US armed forces ISR network. In fact, that is one problem which gets their FCS designers worried - that it is too networked, and buying one part of the system just would not work. That would hurt its exportability a lot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you want to talk about the Merkava itself, that's fine. Talk until you feel shiok. That's what this forum is for. I have no problem with that at all. It's a wonderful armored vehicle, which does not have much export success due to political rather than technical factors.<br><br>But that's not all you're doing. You have said that you've seen that the SAF has another MBT in service. That is already a huge no-no, even if it were true. Then you go on to list some attributes it has, that will allow an alert foreign IO to immediately guess which one it is. That is simply completely unacceptable.<br><br>Of course, our hypothetical foreign IO does not know if what we discuss is real, fake or even deliberate disinformation. But it tells him where to concentrate future resources to determine the truth. Note that this might mean concentrating resources on YOU. The Internet is not that anonymous.<br><br>I do not know what kind of security training you got, but it is important not to reveal even small pieces of information that are  insignificant in and of themselves, or even if we ourselves are "small fry" with little credibility. Many of these things, put together, either will constitute a major breach, or will lead to a major breach by telling them where to look.<br><br>So be careful! This forum is already known to be watched. You have also suggested you have regular contact with COAY, access to privileged information and loose lips. You might draw the "personal attention" of a foreign IO already operating in Singapore, even if you're actually a faker. Blackmail is not fun, which is another reason why keeping a low profile and keeping your mouth shut are very important skills in the SAF.<br><br>So remember your security training. Some of the discussions here, particularly the Primus one, skirt too close to the edge. Even if what was revealed there was all fake, it encourages other people with real privileged information to blab, since "everyone else is doing it too". That is not a good trend for this forum at all.<br><br>So, general military subjects I have no problem with on this forum. Non-public domain information on the SAF that you saw in Taiwan on exercise, the COA mentioned at lunch, or that you read in the TS docket at your desk, I have a BIG problem with. It's starting to annoy me.<br><br>That's all I have to say.</div>
