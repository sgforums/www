            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It's like asking why the Germans in WWII were so stupid as to use the Panther tank when nowadays even our SM1 can kill it -- it's two different time periods, two different levels of technology, two different worlds. The Panther was truly mighty in its day, now it's pathetic. Same with our dear old SM1. It's not the 60's anymore.</strong><br><br>Here's a bit of trivia. Interestingly, the M50 75mm gun on the SM1s traces its ancestry to the Kwk 43 7.5cm high velocity gun used on German Panthers. In its day, the Kwk 43 had one of the highest muzzle velocities among 1940s era tank guns.<br><br>david<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Fairyland:</div><div class="quote_body">OK, SM-1 is dead.<br><br>But the years operating that thing must have counted for something? SM-1 must have demonstrated some attributes that made us use it in such large numbers? Ok, cheap cheap aside.<br><br>Autoloaders? 75mm maybe nothing today, but I'm told it's trajectory is so flat, FCS not really needed - just point and shoot. Oscillating turrets?</div></blockquote>Actually I believe the real reason why we still keep these hunk of junks around is because the SAF never really intended to commit to or get a credible armoured unit capacity, we are relying more on our Ultras and Bionixes to get in the shots. The SM1? It's just a mobile, virtually unprotected outmoded 75mm gun that is toast if its caught alone. A dude with an RPG-7 can probably dish out more firepower that that gun.<br><br>Autoloaders? That revoving thing on the SM1 is a liability. It's stored beside you, holds only a few rounds, and you have to get out of the tank to get additional shells to load that thing back up. Penetration to the virtually unarmoured turret means that the autoloader almost always goes kaboom and guess what happens to the tankies? No need fire suppression system, you can say your last rites before riding it out to battle liao.<br><br>That oscillating turret is certainly inferior to normal gun mounts. Probably the only reason why they implemented it is because the hunk of junk autoloader could not fit in the turret when mounted on a normal pivot and needed the whole turret to move with it. Probably the light armour of that 'tank' made it possible.<br><br>There are no real advantages to the SM1 really, when compared to other light "AGS" systems like the Scorpion or the XM8. That thing is junk.<br><br><blockquote><strong>At least we know what we want in a tropical FSV, (armour and horsepower to push it aside) right? Ok maybe what we want may not be what's really needed in 'war'.......<br><br>SM-1 vs Sherman -&gt; Mobility versus Protection<br><br>With TECHNOLOGY I guess it's no longer a tradeoff between the two, example LECLERC.<br><br>But at least the French see the value of keeping them nimble in small low profile packages!<br><br>If the replacement is going to be a Bionix variant, then I don't see it coming any smaller(taller) OR nimbler.</strong></blockquote>It's great to keep things small and nimble, but technology has it limits. Sure I would want a 15 ton tank that can fight and take damage like a 70 ton Abrams but that just does not work currently. It cannot be avoided, we need a system that will inherently be bigger and not as nimble. It is a fool's dream. The truth is, the SM1 is a ridiculusly LIGHT tank, and we should never pin our on getting units like it. We need heavier metal.<br><br>But then again, it would be far, far more useful, and I think that's the bottom line that matters. No point going 100kph when you can't outrun APFSDs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The SM1 was useful as a Tank/AFV destroyer since our nearest neighbour only operate light tanks. But this will change when modern MBTs is coming into the scene.<br><br>Two things are going against it,<br>1. the weak amour will not able to handle the proliferation of modern portable AT missiles. This was happening for the last 15 years for the region, but could be countered with appropiate infantry support.<br><br>2.The 75mm gun is simply to weak to go against any modern tanks especially those with ERA/applique armour.<br><br>Therefore we urgently need a new tank to be deployed in next 2-3 years that have:<br>1. Armour protection against at least up to RPG, a better crew survive system like fire suppresion system &amp; layout of ammo.<br><br>2. A gun to be at least 105mm, of course the best will be a low recoil120mm gun.With gun stabilisation to fire on the move. The best with a autoloader due to our manpower constraint.<br><br>3.Mobility: Speed to be as fast as the Bionix.<br><br>4.For our unique situation, it should be under 30 tons, with a width below 3m. The ground pressure should be around 1 kg/sq cm.This of course go against Pt 1-2.<br><br>5.With as many component commonality as possible with our Bionix so to have better logistics support.<br><br>6.Highly digitise for NCW concept.<br><br>My two cents worth.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br><br></div>

All in all, would prefer to see bionix leading the charge. Can survive better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I will like to draw the attention of all military nuts to the fact that AMX-13SM1 is NOT supposed to engage MBTs! We mainly act as direct fire support and provide defence to the AI vehicles in an ABG. I am very puzzled when i see people comparing the SM1 with MBTs like the M1A2 Abrams,they are of two totally different classes with totally different roles! I am very sure that other vehicles in our inventory can effectively take on enemy MBTs. As for the insufficiency of the SM1 armour,don't worry we do have ways to solve this problems. Gentlemen please understand that i CANNOT provide evidence/information to support my claims as these information are not supposed to be public knowledge. Those that have access to these infomation will be able to agree with me. Rest assure that our SM1 is not as vulnerable or as obsolete as it seems. Just remember that what appears on the surface may not be the whole package. We have special arrangements during war. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Applique armour? Even with that can it survive a direct hit from an RPG? What about it's intractable design flaws? Are they just going to go away?<br><br>If we want to use the SM1 as a light tank fine, but there are many other types of light tanks that can fufil the SM1 roles all the better.</div>
