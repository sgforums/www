            <div class='col-md body'>Here something for you guys to ponder:<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>WASHINGTON --- The technology behind space ship lasers and force fields is a lot closer to reality than many think.<br><br>Although those lasers and force fields wonÂ’t be fielded for a few more years, Gus Khalil, an engineer at the ArmyÂ’s Tank and Automotive Command in Dearborn, Mich., said the Army has identified what they want for the ArmyÂ’s Future Combat System.<br><br>Â“ThereÂ’s a lot more demands for the FCS vehicle than there are for the legacy force today,Â” he said. Â“Anything we do today that gives the soldiers less capability than he has is unacceptable.Â” That technology is being developed for the ArmyÂ’s Future Combat System, the family of 16 manned, unmanned, ground and aerial vehicles the Army wants fielded by 2010.<br><br>The manned ground vehicles have to weigh less than 20 tonnes. They also have to be as fast, as mobile and as lethal as an M-1A2 Abrams and M2 Bradley fighting vehicle. Doing all that will be like making a Toyota truck as durable as an 18-wheel semi-truck, one TARDECE engineer quipped at a recent FCS conference in Dearborn, Mich.<br><br>But it is doable, Khalil said. To demonstrate that, Khalil had a mock-up of the laser gun system at the Association of the U.S. Army annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Oct. 6-8.<br><br>The gun program falls under the Combat Hybrid Power System. Initiated by DARPA six years ago and handed over to TARDEC two years ago, the program is developing the FCSÂ’ Â“pulsed powerÂ” weapons. Since the system is just being developed, the weapons could be Electro-thermal Chemical guns or even a laser gun capable of firing artillery rounds or destroying tanks, he said.<br><br>The mock up showed how TARDEC wants the system to work. On one end was a pack of three lithium-ion battery modules. When it was Â“firedÂ” it went through a converter that increased the charge from 100 volts to 1,000 volts.<br><br>From there it goes to the pulse-forming network, a nest of capacitors and inductors, where the now 1,000 volts will be turned into a Â“pulse dischargeÂ” that will last less than one-millionth of a second, he said. Then the pulse of electricity goes through an out-put switch that will fire the pulse to its intended target, Khalil said.<br><br>The pulse was demonstrated through a bank of four strobe lights. If someone wasnÂ’t careful the lights could burn holes in their retinas, he said. Khalil said tests have shown that 600-volts to 10,000-volts weapons are possible. And thatÂ’s what theyÂ’re forecasting to be in the FCS, Khalil said.<br><br>The modulesÂ’ life span depends on how theyÂ’re used, he said. If theyÂ’re used just for mobility they can potentially last years, about 15, he said. If they use chemical or laser guns, they wonÂ’t last long, he said. Â“I donÂ’t know the exact number because we have not done that yet,Â” Khalil said of how many times the batteries will fire the weapons.<br><br>He wants the batteries to last 50 rounds or Â“firingsÂ” but the modules will last only 20 rounds right now, he said.<br><br>The FCS is projected to have anywhere from 20-50 of those battery modules and since battery technology is getting smaller, that requirement will be met, Khalil said. The pulse gun will also have the ability to fire something like todayÂ’s sabot anti-tank round. But the FCS pulse weapon will give it more penetration capability than it already has, Khalil said.<br><br>To the soldier on the battlefield, it will look similar to a sabot round -- a flash of light -- and the result might be the same -- a destroyed tank or armored vehicle, he said.<br><br>But KhalilÂ’s team isnÂ’t stopping there. His team is also developing electro-magnetic armor capable of stopping not only other pulsed weapons but conventional weapons. The electro-magnetic armor will also be run from the same power source that will power the weapons system and the engine.<br><br>If the power system that powers the pulse gun that Khalil is designing fires in milli-seconds, that same source will power the electric armor in micro-seconds, he said. In other words, itÂ’s much faster and uses a lot more juice, he explained.<br><br>The biggest challenge for his team is to run the gun and armor off the same batteries that will run the engine, Khalil said.<br><br>-ends-<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This is may be related why the Israeli are stopping any new development on the new variants of Merkava &amp; join the US on development for the new AFV.<br>The British are also looking at a new AFV that is suppose to be less than 20 tons that have the same fire power &amp; protection as today AFV. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Our "new tank" if any will be obsoleted when this is developed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>

The RPG and tank fired HEAT achievement follows the successful defeats of antitank guided missiles with both Â“hard killÂ” and Â“soft killÂ” countermeasures.<br><br>Â“The multiyear survivability program at TACOM has generated field data while moving at 20 mph against numerous threats that meets the criteria set by the FCS Defense Acquisition Board,Â” said Mark Middione, United DefenseÂ’s Active Protection Manager. Â“The integrated IAAPS slewed system can be tailored to meet FCS close-in defeat requirements, while providing the lightest weight active protection solution.Â”<br><br>United Defense, TACOM and teammates Northrop Grumman Space Technologies and BAE Systems tested the IAAPS hardware and software beyond program requirements to obtain additional data by defeating a variety of threats from dual active protection and electronic warfare defeats to defeating two types of RPGs while on the move. The prototype IAAPS hardware was rigorously tested over an 18-month period, demonstrating high reliability in adverse hot weather conditions exceeding 115 degrees.<br><br>According to the company, the continued success of the IAAPS hardware and software is demonstrating that a Future Combat Systems requirement for an integrated suite of sensors, processors and countermeasures is technologically achievable. The IAAPS program was established to demonstrate that by integrating a multitude of unique survivability technologies, a highly survivable system was ready to defend next-generation systems.<br><br>United Defense has integrated a suite of survivability equipment and computer programs from teammates BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman Space Technology that includes United DefenseÂ’s field-proven platform survivability processor as the foundation, with BAEÂ’s commanderÂ’s decision aid (CDA).

(NYSE: UDI), today unveiled Thunderbolt, an advanced armored gun system demonstrator with a 120mm main armament on a light chassis featuring a rugged hybrid electric drive package, an enhanced band track system, and a lightweight ballistic composite armor package at the Association of the U. S. ArmyÂ’s annual meeting.<br><br>The Thunderbolt demonstrator illustrates the ability to deliver devastating firepower in a light package, and features transformational technologies that can be quickly integrated into current platforms to enhance soldier capabilities.<br><br>Â“United Defense designed, integrated and built Thunderbolt in 7 months by applying unmatched capabilities in the rapid design and prototyping of new platforms and technologies,Â“ said Elmer Doty, vice president and general manager. Â“Thunderbolt demonstrates that we can deliver significantly enhanced capabilities to soldiers quickly through the modernization of existing platforms.Â”<br><br>The company, which is currently developing manned ground vehicles for the ArmyÂ’s Future Combat Systems, emphasized that Thunderbolt demonstrates near-term transformational technologies complementary to the current force.<br><br>Â“Thunderbolt combines United DefenseÂ’s unsurpassed expertise and focus on transformational technology development to increase the mobility, lethality and survivability of our forces,Â” Doty said. Â“ItÂ’s an exciting package that showcases our strengths and exemplifies our desire to support the ArmyÂ’s mission, now and in the future.Â”<br><br>Prior to AUSA, United Defense fired Thunderbolt repeatedly from stationary and on-the-move positions, the first time a 120mm main armament has been successfully fired off a 20-ton weight-class chassis. ThunderboltÂ’s XM291 main gun is backed by an autoloader that handles both HEAT and SABOT rounds. The autoloader handles 120mm rounds with combustible casings and rounds of varying weight distributions, and it can eject stubcases. Thunderbolt delivers firepower that can defeat heavy enemy armor and destroy enemy targets such as bunkers and buildings.<br><br>Â“We believe that a 120mm gun integrated on a light chassis would provide unprecedented firepower, able to effectively defeat heavy enemy armor,Â” Doty said.<br><br>Thunderbolt Features Transformational Technology<br><br>Thunderbolt integrates a durable hybrid electric propulsion system that provides improved performance and fuel economy, enhanced reliability and reduced emissions. The propulsion system utilizes generator, inverter and traction motor components that have performed well in testing on the United Defense Transformation Technology Demonstrator.<br><br>ThunderboltÂ’s drive power is transferred through an advanced band track system developed for 20-ton weight class vehicles. The advantages of band track include improved ride quality, longer life, and reduced noise and thermal signatures.<br><br>The mobility package integrated on Thunderbolt delivers a range of 600 miles on gravel roads, with four miles of silent mobility capability. Conversion of a standard chassis to hybrid electric drive generates significant additional interior space that can seat additional soldiers, increase the quantity of stowed ammunition, or be applied to other mission requirements.<br><br>Thunderbolt is the latest United Defense platform to feature hybrid-electric propulsion, following the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon platform, the Transformation Technology Demonstrator and two demonstrators that were unveiled at AUSA last year: the Future Combat Systems-Tracked and Future Combat Systems-Wheeled platforms.<br><br>ThunderboltÂ’s advanced ballistic composite armor design offers enhanced survivability while reducing overall vehicle weight. The composite turret armor package is designed to provide 14.5mm protection all around, with 30mm frontal arc protection.<br><br>Â“We set out to demonstrate what critics said canÂ’t be done Â– providing heavy firepower on a light platform, and quickly and effectively upgrading an existing platform with transformational technologies that can modernize the current force,Â” Doty said.<br><br>Â“United Defense developed Thunderbolt to demonstrate that we can quickly and effectively upgrade existing platforms with transformational technologies that can modernize the current force,Â” Doty said. Â“We believe we owe it to the soldier to demonstrate combat vehicle technologies that can support and enhance the ArmyÂ’s ability to complete its missions.Â”<br><br>Thunderbolt was designed and built at the companyÂ’s research facilities in Santa Clara, California.<br><br>-end-<br><br><img src="http://www.uniteddefense.com/i/prod/thunderbolt.jpg"><br><br>==============<br>Perhaps this could also be a potential AMX-13SM1 replacement for SAF?<br><br>Here comes M8 AGS with a 120mm gun !!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, that thunderbolt thing that joe black posted sounds like a great REPLACEMENT for the amx-13sm1, it packs a heavy punch and weighs only 20tons.  armour is kind of weak at 14.5mm in most places, but then again, if the purpose of that armour on that armoured gun system was to enable it to withstand hits from medium to large calibre weapons in the first place, its gonna be frigging heavy and won't count as a amx-13 replacement anyway.<br><br>perhaps the best way for singpaore to offset the advantage any potential enemies have interms of MBTs is to deploy more anti-tank missiles rather than using even heavier MBTs.  i think using large numbers of anti-tank missiles would be more cost effective than small numbers of MBTs, even if MBTs are about the best weapon for a 'show of force'.<br><br>a row of heavies lined up looks alot more impressive than a platoon of infantry with anti-tank missiles. . .<br><br>this topic is virtually exhausted already, perhaps is time for this forums as a whole to extend into strategic concerns and military strategy rather than just technical stuff and individual weapons.</div>
