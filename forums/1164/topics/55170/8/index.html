I did enjoy my time with SM1. for a start SM1 is a good training tank. anyone who can drive a SM1 would not have much difficultity driving other tanks and that would include mbts. maintainance wise SM1 is easier to maintain comparin to others but moden tanks is easier to maintain then SM1.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
