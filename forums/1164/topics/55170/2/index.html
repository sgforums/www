I think that sending men to Isarel to train is not impossible as SAF already send a lot to many different countries world-wide.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by GHoST_18:</div><div class="quote_body">true... i saw an article n a video on the BX tat was offered to the US... the appearance looked slightly different n the turret was totally diff from the ones SAF is using...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>The version offered to the US was lighter - it had most of its passive aplique armour removed. The turret was replaced by an overhead remote weapons station. That is why it looked different. I'm quite sure the armour guys have seen the BX "naked" without its add-on armour.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes the BX already looks very impressive "naked", additional armour plating(maybe reactive armour?) can be further added to the hull. Must be damm heavy! Because the combat weight of the normal BX is already heavier than that of the SM1! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After such a long time, i'm beginning to wonder the 105mm BX was a joke in the first place or not.  Perhaps ST is already designing a  new chassis for a new light tank... we can't always base every damn vehicle on the BX design rite?<br><br>Here's a suggestion for a Sg made tank-hunter.  IF one really wants to use a BX chassis heres n idea.<br><br>BX with a 40mm turret.  Coupled with 4 SPIKEs for tank killing. 40mm to support infantry, deal with light vehicles, bunkers etc.  If they can come up with an auto-spike-reloader system that can automatically reload the expended spikes, even better.  Redesign our spikes with a tandem warhead arrangement, and it ought to beat any reactive armored tank.  EVEN though spike attacks from the top.<br><br>throw in a data link, and our SPIKE-BX can even play tag-team with our Apaches.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Shotguns idea is not bad, but it will boil down to the tank round verus anti-tank missile debate. A normal tank's main gun will almost definitely enable it to fire a greater variety of ammunitions at a much lower cost.Missiles such as the Spike is very accurate but complicated,costly and numerically limited(Shotgun's idea is for 4 missiles,the US M2 Bradley only carries 2.) But i think this problem can be lessen when the ABG cooperate with the new Longbow Apaches. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
