            <div class='col-md body'>The F-16 Block 60<br><br><img src="http://www.f-16.net/PhotoGallery/album42/aao.sized.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.f-16.net/PhotoGallery/album42/aac.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.f-16.net/PhotoGallery/album42/aan.sized.jpg"><br><br>The F-16 Block 60, also known as the Desert Falcon (and F-16E/F in some circles), is the most advanced F-16 ever produced. An internal, forward-looking infrared navigation sensor mounted as a ball turret on the upper left nose distinguishes the Block 60 from previous F-16s. Other distinguishing external characteristics include a targeting pod with faceted windows, no pitot tube, strip lighting on the wings and vertical tail, an air scoop on the forward right tail root, a small exhaust on the forward left tail root, and two other exhaust portsÂ—one on either side of the lower rear portion of the engine inlet. Both single- and two-seat aircraft carry the conformal fuel tanks.<br><br>These external differences donÂ’t detract from the F-16Â’s renowned aerodynamic performance. The increased thrust GE-132 engine helps compensate for the increase in weight and payload over the basic F-16. Internal differences, on the other hand, add up to a huge improvement in capability over previous-generation F-16s and place the Block 60 at the leading edge of fourth-generation fighters.<br><br>These internal differences are most apparent in the cockpit, whTheich is dominated by three large five- by seven-inch color multifunction displays. Onboard computers collect and process information from the various sensors and off-aircraft sources and transmit the results to the pilot in straightforward color graphics. The all-glass cockpit features hands-on throttle and sidestick switch controls, a color moving map, picture-in-picture digital display technology, night vision goggle-compatible lighting, and a standard head-up display.<br><br>The Desert Falcon has many automated modes, including autopilot, auto-throttle, and an automatic ground collision avoidance system. The electronic warfare system, produced by Northrop Grumman, is the most sophisticated subsystem on the aircraft and provides threat warning, threat emitter locating capability, and increased situational awareness to the pilot. A new data transfer cartridge holds thirty gigabytes of information. A fiber-optic databus handles the throughput and speed needed for many of these systems. The maintenance system is laptop based.<br><br>The APG-80 agile beam radar underpins many of the new capabilities the Block 60 brings to the F-16. The radar, also produced by Northrop Grumman, is an advanced electronically scanned array. The array consists of numerous transmit/receive modules attached to a fixed array that generates the radar beam, which can be directed almost instantaneously. The electronic, instead of mechanical, approach allows various radar modes to be interleaved. For example, the radar can continuously search for and track multiple targets and simultaneously perform multiple functions, such as air-to-air search-and-track, air-to-ground targeting, and aircraft terrain following. The radar vastly improves the pilotÂ’s situational awareness. Additional advantages of the APG-80 include much greater detection ranges, high-resolution synthetic aperture radar images, and a twofold increase in reliability compared to more conventional mechanically scanning radars.<br><br>The Block 60 is powered by a General Electric F110-GE-132 turbofan engine that produces approximately 32,500 pounds of thrust in maximum afterburner. The engine is a derivative of the proven F110-GE-129, a 29,000-pound thrust class engine that powers the majority of F-16C fighters worldwide.<br><br>The Block 60 is cleared for the full range of weapons, tanks, and specialized pods used on other F-16s. The aircraft will also be capable of carrying the 500- and 1,000-pound HAKIM laser-guided bomb that the UAE has developed. The fully configurable backseat of the two-seat versions can be configured, with the flip of a switch, for training or special missions that require a weapon systems operator.<br><br>Â“The F-16 Block 60 was chosen after a stringent competition among the best fighters available,Â” Commander Khalid says. Â“Many factors were involved in the selection. We conducted thorough studies. We wanted to choose an aircraft that offered the greatest capability in terms of our operational requirements, technical requirements, environmental requirements, political support, and technology releasability. Technology transfer and offset requirements were additional factors in the selection.Â”<br><br>UAE pilots flew more than ninety evaluation flights in the F-16 as part of the selection process that spanned six years. Thirty-six of these were flown in the most severe environments of heat and humidity in UAE summers.<br><br>Â“The F-16 Block 60 will become the backbone for the air defense of our country,Â” says Commander Khalid. Â“The aircraft has been thoroughly studied. The Desert Falcon has enormous capability. It is a true multimission aircraft. Every fighter pilotÂ’s dream of an aircraft is addressed in the Block 60. We have worked with Lockheed Martin to create a fighter that satisfies every potential operational need and mission. We are very proud of the capability we are getting with the F-16. We believe that we made the right choice.Â”</div>
