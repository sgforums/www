            <div class='col-md body'>"Fire for effect" essentially means no (more) marker rounds needed to adjust fire. The shells are landing on top of the targets &amp; it's time to bomb their brains out!<br><br>FYI There's different types of arty fire missions: registration fire, adjustment fire, fire for effect ("FFE"), harassment &amp; interdiction ("H&amp;I"), time on target ("TOT"), illumination ("illum"), et al.<br><br>The arty officers who follow the infantry are either Forward Observers ("FO", Lieutenant rank) or Fire Support Officers ("FSO", Captain rank), assigned to COY &amp; BN levels respectively. Unlike the Americans, our local versions have Technical Assistants ("TA") who carry the signal sets &amp; may help plan/call the fire missions over the comms. I was both a FSO &amp; FO TA during my NSF.<br><br>A new bird is usually trained to adjust-fire - or with prior luxury time, registration-fire -  before executing a FFE, but I suppose immediate FFEs will be the norm come wartime.<br><br>"Fire at will"?

Meaning it will use different type of round combination, qty &amp; fuse setting as for above mentioned above.  FFE basically is used for target that is survey &amp; register (unless arty unit not enough time or tgt that is out of the registration bracket) in order to obtain high casualties rate.
