            <div class='col-md body'>Eh, double jeopardy is a principle of US law, not Singaporean law! Don't watch too many movies and get confused, hor.<br><br>Double jeopardy is needed in the US because there are multiple legal jurisdictions (New York has one court, California another, etc.) If there was no double jeopardy, you could potentially be tried 50 times in the 50 states and punished 50 times for one crime! Singapore has no such problem.<br><br>Anyway, the SAF is not the only people who do this. If you are an ex-con due to a civvie crime in Singapore, your life is ruined anyway. It is more a matter of the unforgiving culture here. The SAF is just a reflection of how people already are. I see that the Prison Service is lately trying to rehabilitate convicts, and tell Singaporeans to give them a chance, but that is an uphill task. I wish them well though. Punishment should always have a defined end, or else it is torture instead.</div>
