I'm not a war monger, but i believe that the roads to peace are paved with bricks of war.<br><br>If pacifism is not the path to peace, (as shown in WW2), then the line has to be drawn somewhere.  And when the line is cross, the willingness to go to war has to be demonstrated.<br><br>Ultimately, what is peace if the state of peace exists without justice and equality?  If war is needed to restore a peace with justice and equality, then I think its better that the blood of good men be spilt so that blood of innoncent will not have to flow for unjust reasons.</div>

In one delves into history it is repleted with wars and battles,in fact only until recently that the more advanced states ceased and limit itself to utilize wars and battles further one's interest or ideology.<br><br>Karl von Clausewitz's treatise which you derive your quotation from,"On War",gained its popularity when Prussian Marshal Helmuth von Moltke,who the Elder engineered the Prussian victory over France in Franco-Prussian War(thus resulting in the unification of modern nation-state of Germany under Prussia),attributed his victory to the book(though it is noteworthy that von Moltke studied in the military academy when von Clausewtiz was the principal,but never taught by him.).<br><br>"On War" is pretty much a complex book to comprehend,due to the fact that Karl von Clausewitz was a rather over-elaborative writer(to the point of being messy and confusing),mistranslation from German to other languages(esp. English) and that he experienced the changing nature of warfare from the Napoleanic era,one of unlimited warfare to propagate liberty,equality and fraternity(at least on the surface),and post-Napoleanic era,one of limited warfare in which states struggled to seize territories or to obtain concessions or favourable treatise from other states. The last factor compelled von Clausewitz to amend his treatise which he had wrotes two decades ago,but he died of cholera before he could complete it.<br><br>What it is miscomprehended(esp by "the Bear" and threadstarter) is that Karl von Clausewitz is not advocating war in the quotation,but delineating the nature of war itself,that "war is a continuation of policy by other means"(in fact,by your logic,if i were to say that flu virus causes influenza do you mean that i am encouraging you to catch a flu? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ). As I mentioned previously,"On War" is a humongous military treatise to comprehend,words easily taken out of context(thus military historian Micheal Howard commented that it is the most frequently quoted but the least read book,much less understood by the mass) overmore originally in German,thus a good translation with annotation is very much important to understand it. Where English translation is concerned the one Micheal Howard and Perot is unarguable the best,even international affair researchers and sociologist cite from it.</div>

Jack Welsh,the CEO of General Motors read the treatise and applied it to the business arena.<br>[quote]<br>i am not talking pacifism.. i'm talking about the people taking power into their own hands and making the lea-duhs accountable for their actions...<br><br>if they want to wage war, let them put their own children right in the front line in the line of enemy fire...<br><br>you WILL see them sue for peace within a heartbeat...<br><br>where is it written that we, the people, cannot make such a global law that forces those who want to wage war, be the first one in the line of enemy fire?</div></blockquote>I get your drift,though during WWII many of the American politicians sent their children to fight the war,if i recalled Mao Zedong's son died in Korea during the Korean War.</div>
