They may not be a good reference to base our strategic thinking on.  In all instances, Uncle Sam enjoyed absolute superiority in air dominance, fire-power, logistic, mobility and etc.  They have the means to secure permanent firebases to launch rapid strikes from.  Any counter-attack will be met by lightning fast counter strike.  They were baiting the insurgents to show themselves. In one instance, Somalia, they were bested by inferior forces.<br><br>In our case, we do not enjoy absolute superiority in all critical spectrums of battle play.  We will never be able to fight like Uncle Sam do now and in the past.  I suspect we have and will continue to evolve revolutionary war strategies that are unique to our circumstances like the Israelis did and now.<br><br>I think humping is still necessary and has to be stressed/mantained as part of combat fitness proficiency  Just keep the load down to the essential mission-related items so that the combat efficiency of foot soldier is not compromise prematurely.  Don't rely too much on IFV/AFV.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it strange that you all would find the loads mentioned above to be "extreme" by our standards ... or has everyone here been "kenging" when going outfield? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I regularly carried loads of more than 25kg as my fighting load (or in SAF term, Skeletal Battle Order).  Breakdown of the loadout ...<br>- Medics Load 12~13kg<br>- "Bra" + fanny pack ~10kg  (Consisting of 4L water, asstd. SAF Stuff, 24hr Rations, ET, book, snacks)<br>- Rifle 4.5kg<br><br>Instead of lightening my load, I tended to just pile on stuff as I worked on the principle of train hard.  So the typical figure tended to approach 30kg or half my body weight.  In FBO, my load approached 40~45kg for a 72hr ops.  On some occassions when we carried simulated war loads (the much hated blue magazines), you can add another 8kgs to the above.<br><br>In case you're thinking I'm walking behind the formation, taking my own sweet time ... I carried the same 30kg load as part of the Battalion Recce Team, a rather quaint invention of our CO.  The BtRT consists of 2 3SGs, 2 SAWs, 2 M203s, 2 LAWs and a medic (me).  Our task is to act as the  pathfinding point for the Battalion following the trail left by our Battalion Scouts.  This frees up more Scouts for actual recce instead of them having to backtrack to lead us into the FUP.  Because the BRT races ahead of the main formation and backtracks where necessary, I cover up to 10kms at a fast clip before rejoining my platoon for the assault and follow on ...<br><br>I can remember many instances in my active and reserve times where we've carried 30~40kg (70~90lbs) loads consistently over many days and long distances.<br><br>So ... NO, I don't think those guys are carrying a very big load, especially not when you consider that they are bigger than us Asians.

So the typical figure tended to approach 30kg or half my body weight.  In FBO, my load approached 40~45kg for a 72hr ops.  On some occassions when we carried simulated war loads (the much hated blue magazines), you can add another 8kgs to the above.<br><br>In case you're thinking I'm walking behind the formation, taking my own sweet time ... I carried the same 30kg load as part of the Battalion Recce Team, a rather quaint invention of our CO.  The BtRT consists of 2 3SGs, 2 SAWs, 2 M203s, 2 LAWs and a medic (me).  Our task is to act as the  pathfinding point for the Battalion following the trail left by our Battalion Scouts.  This frees up more Scouts for actual recce instead of them having to backtrack to lead us into the FUP.

Sure they may have been technically over-qualified for the unit but they do bring quite a lot of other stuff to the table.<br><br>For one, the rivalry between Gds &amp; Cdos means that we push harder when they are around.  They are always on the ball as they don't want to look bad in front of us ... that in turn drives us to do our best to try to show them up.  For the most part, they also do share their technical and operational experience.<br><br>It has often been said that the best should become teachers so as to share what they know ... viewed in that light, the attachment of these Cdos can't really be all that bad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think our armed forces should monitor and maintain the combat health of our servicemen more closely.  Professional sportmen/women do so with intimate care to prolong their compeitive sporting life.  For combat vocation that deal with life-threatening scenario, I don't see any reasons why we, as individuals and part of a combat unit, should exercise less care.  I am not saying we should invest the kind of $$$ that, say, elite soccer club spend to monitor and recuperate their players.  Targeted measures can be implemented to instill the right awareness in individual soldier.  I know of one exemplary regular who won awards from overseas training courses with practically all ligaments/tendons torn in his body.  Yeah, granted all the torn tissues were surgically mended but weakened tissues are prone to tear at most unsuspected and awkward moments.  Moreover, most tissue injuries are cummulative in nature and will only surface later in life.  Do you have confidence to send soldier in such state of combat health on real ops?    To quote an example, British SAS was deployed in Oman/Aden in post-WWII period.  A covert recon patrol was compromised and at least 2 death ensued.  What happened was that a signaller trooper failed to report sick before insertion.  When he eventually collapsed, the patrol had to hide in a lousy location to attend to him. The hide was discovered... A nail came off a horse shoe unnoticed; the horse collapse eventually; the general died from the horse fall; and the country fall.<br><br>I don't expect senior soldiers to charge up a ridge with me.  If they can charge with me, it's a bonus.  I expect direction and leadership from them at critical moments, wise command gleaned from years of soldiering experience.  So, I am fully supportive of "excess to requirement" elite soldiers being redeployed to less demanding vocation.  Their valuable experience should be shared, not lost forever when they leave the service or pass on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just in case you are wondering why I am harping on the weight of combat load carried by riflemen in general.  I am getting on in age.  My joints are creaking now.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I never say die when I was young and hearty; I thought I was invulnerable to physical challenges.<br><br>Met and chat with a guy in his 50's at the hawker centre a month back.  He looked in reasonable shape to me at his age.  He claimed he was very sporty in his prime days, participating in marathon, climbing, do high repeitition push-up, seat-up, chin-up and etc.  Now, he is aching and regretting all the abuses he subjected himself to in the past.  Some homosapiens are less susceptible to injuries than other but, I think, based on my observations, they are in the minority.<br><br>In fact, homosapiens do not have bio-mechanically sound structure to carry external load.  So, why should we carry unnecessary and unreasonable load in the first place unless we are forced by circumstances.  A documentary that I watched claims that homosapien should have evolved biologically to move on all four limbs, not on the legs.  (Can't remember why we evolved to walk on 2 legs now) That explained why arthritis are so prevalant in the knee and ankle joints.</div>
