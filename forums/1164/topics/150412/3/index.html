Because it had the same 152mm short-barreled missile firing gun as the M551 Sheridan. This gun is a failure and that's why both vehicles were obsolete almost as soon as they entered service.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the US just doesn't like to launch missile out of their gun tubes huh?<br><br>U guys heard of the STAFF "Special Top Attack Fire n Forget" round that the US Army uses?<br><br>From www.fas.org<br><br><blockquote>STAFF is a 120mm tank round thatsearches out and destroys enemy armor at distances beyond the reach of conventional munitions. As a top-attack smart munition, STAFF destroys enemy armor by flying over it and firing a highly lethal explosively formed penetrator down into its lightly armored top. No enemy armor is safe from STAFF -- whether it's moving, at long range, or in defilade. Although STAFF is primarily designed as an anti-armor round, it complements the M830A1 tank round by being highly lethal against helicopters. STAFF is unique among antiarmor munitions because of its large sensor footprint and the standoff capability of its explosively formed penetrator warhead.<br><br>STAFF requires no change to the tank turret and no unique actions by the tank crew other than setting a single range zone switch. From aiming and firing to the last stages of its operation, STAFF functions much like a conventional round. During ballistic flight, STAFF establishes a vertical reference and orients itself with the ground. In the final seconds of flight, a search and track mode is initiated. The forward-scanning millimeter wave sensor establishes a large footprint for target acquisition. The round flies over the target, rolls to align the warhead, fuzes, and then fires its lethal penetrator down into the most vulnerable area of the tank.<br><br>Alliant Techsystems developed the STAFF round. Proof of principle was demonstrated in 1990. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>M551 was considered but rejected by the SAF in the 90s.<br><br>The "Sho't"--"Tempest"--"Centurion" is a very capable beast, and should not be underestimated. Let's not forget that its not the size of the gun, its the ammunition, the optics, night vision, stabilization/fire control and the skill of the gunner which matter--not to mention the ability to reload and lay a new "G" on a 2nd target afer the first round.<br><br>There are 105mm rounds that perform far better than the M551's munitions for its 152mm Gun-launcher M81, M81 Modified, or M81E1, and the 105mm APFSDS penetrate a good deal of armor. It is quite clear that even an AMX-13 (SM1) with its 75mm APFSDS round can handle many MBTs. AMX13s are more akin to "Tank Destroyers" and infantry fire support platforms--and we have many of them. They are highly accurate firing platforms against armour when stationary, and are thus highly effective as defensive Antitank/AFV role.<br><br>Its the ammunition that counts, lets not forget that a M551 only had around 15-20 HEAT rounds--The big caliber rendered a heavy payload difficult.<br><br>Oh, and one more thing: the M551 is thinner skinned than you think: Its hull is Rolled 7039 aluminum alloy--That's the stuff your window sill is made off. You can put a hole in the M551 with a CIS 0.5" HMG firing APDS rounds any day.<br><br>Americans did not always build good tanks, and the Korean war proved that a Centurion can climb vicious terrain. (The UK forces used Centurion Mk 1s in Korea)  Whereas M48 and M60 Magach MBTs were not used in the Northern Sinai peninsular during the 1973 war precisely because they were not good for  climbing or rough terrain. The M60's profile is so high that its an obvious target--especially in comparison with a Centurion, or a more modern MBT.<br><br>Singapore needs to develop its own Tank/Tank Destroyer. It should be small, and have composite armor and a Front Engine configuration (as in the BX or Merkava) It needs to consider either a 105 or 120mm gun, but the key issue should be Survivability--The tanks we have now are good enough to kill theirs--the problem is whether our tankees are going to feel safe in the hulls of their AFVs. A BX VC feels safe, I doubt if any of the Tankees feel safe in their AMXs.<br><br>Keep the Faith--"Once Armour, Always Armour"</div>

I don't know for sure but the armour of the SM1 is enough to stop small arms fire up to 7.62mm. But you will have to consider the role of the SM1. The SM1 primary responsibility is to provide the firepower and range for the AI in their Ultras or BX. We are like riding shotgun for the AI. We are not supposed to do a frontal assault on the enemy's main force alone. That is the resposibility of our bigger brothers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Therefore the armoured protection of the SM1 will just sufffice. Furthermore, we have special plans for our tankees during war time so i won't be too worried about armoured protection.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
