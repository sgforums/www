Is it possible that among this there are MBT versions? The answer is no.<br><br>The existence of these 2 types of M60A3 variants are well-known facts, not rumours, speculations, etc.<br><br>When I first saw these 2 vehicles in SAF use I speculated that maybe we have the MBT variants as well. But armour friends confirm the answer is "no".<br><br>The Tempest, definitely yes.<br><br>In fact, one guy I knew whom was tankee in the late 70's. He was sent to Israel for training on the Tempest. Only he referred to it as the Centurion.<br><br>One training involve them sitting inside a tank while another tank fires a dud round at them. This was just to give them an experience of what a "hit" on their vehicle would feel like. Though it was only a dud round, they all came out reeling from the concussion and some threw up.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, if we do have new MBT, it will only come from Israel becos I believe she is the only country we could get MBT w/o anyone( Janes etc) knowing about it.<br><br>So what could Israel offer us?<br><br>Currently I think only the Sabra and the Merkava (we already have the Centurions, the rest are even older, so no point), so take your pick!!!!<br><br>The Merkava is way too heavy for our terrain, Sabra to me is good option, with 120mm gun, added composite armour or even ERA, world class Knight FCS with auto-tracking, LWR, and possible BMS and even LAHAT missile , it will better any tank in SEA.<br><br>The protection might not be as good as top MBTs like M1, Leo2 etc but if we add in Trophy APS , it will improve the protection level against ATGM and rockets.<br><br>Sabra is cheap and good, that is usually what Mindef look for.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the supposed replacement for the M551 Sheridan Light Tank is the M8 Thunderbolt. However, these are not bought which resulted in the US airborne units without any airborne capable armoured vehicles since the retirement of the Sheridan. Incidently, the M8 is considered to be suitable for the replacement of our SM1. Please take a look at the thread 'Progress on SM1 replacement'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

They include the M60 series, the M48 series, and some Chinese MBTs. I don't really buy this "SEA not suitable for MBT argument" but that discussion probably belongs on another thread.</div>
