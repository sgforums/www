A 30-round magazine is too tall, and forces me to raise the rifle higher off the rest.<br><br>In fact, for slow-fire, precision target work, I prefer to use a 5-round magazine as it hardly protrudes from the bottom of the magwell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My reservist 2PDF infantry unit were issued with 20rd mags ONLY for M16 users and 30rd for SAW gunners.<br><br>We were all very curious as none of us had ever used a 20rd mag before. Even the brand new webbing issued to us were made just for the 20rd mags. This webbing is the IDF-type and is still in current use (pending replacement by the vest). Although yours would hold 30rd mags.<br><br>I found this to be really puzzling cos if someone handed you a bunch of 30rd mags you would have no way to store them as the pouches are shallow.<br><br>When I asked a WO why we were issued 20rd mags and SBO, he gave an answer typical of people of his (low) calibre: "because SAF got many".<br><br>I don't know if this is because SAF felt we do defence only so 20rd is better in a sandbagged trench or something. But we only did one defence ex and all the other time we did FIBUA and FOFO eventually trial for V200 mounted.<br><br>Anyone has any opinions why we were given 20rd mags?<br><br>Don't say because we are cannon fodder....although that's probably true...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Brigade S2 branch (Int).<br><br>Then during first 3 reservist ICT I was in a Guards Bn S2 branch.<br><br>So from Recruit till the first 3 ICT, I was using 30rd mags.<br><br>And then when I got posted to company line of a 2PDF unit as a PL runner, that's when we started using 20rd mags. That's also when SAF started giving out personal equipment for permanent use, i.e. can take home one.<br><br>And the SBO was the new type, but with 20rd pouches! We were all very bewildered when we first got them.<br><br>However, the SAW gunners had to exchange their brand new 20rd SBO for second-hand 30rd SBO.<br><br>Bloody mess, if you ask me.<br><br>And if I remember correctly, magazine interchangeability with SAW gunner gone as 20rd mags don't have the extra 2 holes.<br><br>Are the 20rd mags all old and made by Colt? I don't remember. My impression was that some of them were relatively new.</div>
