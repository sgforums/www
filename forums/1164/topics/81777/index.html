            <div class='col-md body'>I do not have privilege information so the below is pure speculation on my part.<br><br>Intel and survelliance is important if the first indication of an attack is when the tanker is 2 minute away from Jurong island, nothing we can do...<br><br>We have advance warning. first e try to take over the tanker using NDU with their high speed craft or deployed from heilicopters. Casualties will be expected if the Hijackers are armed. if that fail, then RSN will try to disable the tanker with 76mm fire. Harpoon will be avoided as there is a risk of a collateral damage if the missile go astray.<br><br>I said disabled not sink as a sunken tanker will be a threat to both the enviornment as well as to sea navigation.<br><br>This is to be avoided since spore depend so much on our port. that is why we are keen on anti-terror measures.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If a large ship is hijacked and set to ram our port, there is basically nothing much you can do once it is set in its course because the sheer momentum of the ship means that it will continue travelling forward for some time even after the engines are stopped or for that matter, even if the engines go into full astern(reverse).<br><br>About the only thing you can do is to destroy the ship. Unfortunately, if it is a LPG carrier then the resultant explosion will also wipe anything within a klick or 2 of it.<br><br>Commandering the ship through use of special forces will only work if you have enough time to change the course of the ship.<br><br>Given the relative narrowness of our waters and the number of ships either at anchor or underway, any collision or destruction will cause major damage.<br><br>This is a current nightmare scenario for us as well as many other countries like US, Japan, China as the majority of the oil flows through here and a choke here will mean economic suffering or death for them.<br><br>There has been evidence that terror elements are training themselves to commandeer a ship and control it as well as training in diving. Couple that with previous witnessed tactics of 'swarming', I think that any navy would be hardpressed patrol the straights without cooperation from the other littoral neighbours in the Straits.<br></div>

But the other idea is also not to sink the tanker to stop it anyway, bearing in mind all the crude or LPG/LNG that would pose first and foremost an unfathomable ecological hazard, and then also pragmatic authorities always wanting to save all of that to avoid economic suicide.<br><br>Ok, let's say <span style="font-style: italic;">dispersed tangos with individual autonomy of setting off charges</span> aside, the quickest measure to buy time against a scenario of tangos with charges, is to isolate the tanker as early as possible.  The key to this is move it or keep it as far away from harming anything valuable as possible.  The straightforward method would be to forcibly secure the bridge and hold it, while simultaneously searching the entire tanker for tangos and charges to neutralise them.<br><br>Again, an advance party to be inserted stealthily to overpower the tangos in the bridge, and hopefully the engine room and open quarters of the upper main decks, against counter-sniper.  All this while continuous air support as silent rotored gunships circle to provide airborne sniper cover.  After securing all means of control over the ship's course, go all out to hunt the tangos and their charges.  The only unbecoming event is for the tangos to set them off before they are flushed out.<br><br></div>

Just a thought but I think at the present, the SAF's solution is to deploy the Naval SF team (Not sure how sensitive this is so I refrain from naming them).</div>

Overfly and target it with airborne dispersed agents like GB or VX gas, once it is ensured isolated as far from shore as possible.<br><br>After the incident, quickly suck/pump the lingering gas out of the tanker and exhaust into the sea.  For air-tight compartments, that's where the 'cleaners' come into place - to completely wipe them off the face of this world</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) SPECOPS to secure the vessel from terrorists first<br><br>2) Disable all explosives if any.<br><br>3) Upon securing vessel, attempt to alter course of vessel.<br><br>4) Assume control is damaged, (it can be done by destroying the hydralics leading to the rudder itself, not just the bridge controls, this would ensure permanent damage), activate tugs to push vessel away. Disable all fuel lines to diesels and cut engines so you only have to deal with the inertia.<br><br>5) Drop all anchors for crash stop. You can also selectively drop port or starboard anchors to change course. Then again, if the terrorists know better, they should have disabled the anchors.<br><br>Once again, time and distances are factors in 4). If there is sufficient time, tugs can push it out of the way from our key installations and shipping ways out to south china sea or simply let her run until she stops.<br><br>But time is a key concern. Tugs are slow. Very slow and operate mostly in MPA's port limits. Distance is a major problem. Unless advanced warning is given, there is nothing we could do.<br><br>If all explosives are disable or there are no explosive, we can let her run aground since there is little danger of explosive damage beyond oil spills. You are now playing the game of damage control, going for the least damage approach.<br><br>No missiles will be used. Look around u. Have you been to MPA Vista to see their VTIS display screen? There are thousands of vessels in Singapore waters and in the TSS. If the push comes to the shove, i would prefer SPECOPS use charges to scuttle her.</div>
