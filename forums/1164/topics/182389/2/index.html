            <div class='col-md body'>Repeating similar views of others:<br><br>Rafale is WAY harder to intergrate into our AF. Their weapons systems and payload are tuned to a "French" style. I.E. MICA, Stormshadow.  But the convienence is that we can just convert the F-16 training ground into a Rafale One (i suppose).<br><br>Typhoon would be more suitable because they use sidewinders and the AIM-120s not to mention cheaper and actually slightly better mechanical performance.  Not to mention that we continue to purchase US weaponry is a + point.<br><br>I believe that we put off the sale of both of these planes is that their system-upgrades are already announced to be released in the near future(3-5 yrs?)  This means that we have not only more time to reevaluate these two planes but also get the latest upgrades to come along...rather than to pay twice (once now and later upgrades)<br><br>Obviously, the JSF is a looooong way from our acquisition. And as mentioned earlier it is indeed a 2nd tier craft. It's will be like a work horse I.E. F16. Numerous and expendable...but not as cheap!  I would really prefer if we get the Typhoon fully upgraded as our Elite wing.  And yes 20 F-15s are .....so little! Too little to take into account downtime, rotation, training. More more! Make the F 16s like our F5s. Push them down the level.</div>

Their weapons systems and payload are tuned to a "French" style. I.E. MICA, Stormshadow.  But the convienence is that we can just convert the F-16 training ground into a Rafale One (i suppose).<br><br>Typhoon would be more suitable because they use sidewinders and the AIM-120s not to mention cheaper and actually slightly better mechanical performance.  Not to mention that we continue to purchase US weaponry is a + point.<br><br>I believe that we put off the sale of both of these planes is that their system-upgrades are already announced to be released in the near future(3-5 yrs?)  This means that we have not only more time to reevaluate these two planes but also get the latest upgrades to come along...rather than to pay twice (once now and later upgrades)<br><br>Obviously, the JSF is a looooong way from our acquisition. And as mentioned earlier it is indeed a 2nd tier craft. It's will be like a work horse I.E. F16. Numerous and expendable...but not as cheap!  I would really prefer if we get the Typhoon fully upgraded as our Elite wing.  And yes 20 F-15s are .....so little! Too little to take into account downtime, rotation, training. More more! Make the F 16s like our F5s. Push them down the level.</div></blockquote>What makes you think that the US is going to allow us to launch AMRAAMs on Typhoon or Rafale?  That integration is for NATO is only.<br><br>You are spot on though on JSF won't be in RSAF inventory for a really long time. So long make me wonder if it will ever turn up.</div>
