The problem with the fighter, Dr Jensen says, is that it can be relatively easily detected from the rear.<br><br>A Federal Government source conceded yesterday that the stealth capability definitions had been changed, but maintained that the "design requirements" for the fighter to "avoid detection" had not.<br><br>Signs that the stealth capability had been lowered first emerged last year, when key performance indicators on the US Defence Department Joint Strike Fighter<br><br>website changed. The manufacturer of the aircraft, Lockheed Martin, insisted repeatedly to the Herald that the reported shift was an error. Australia's Defence Department also maintained there had been no change.<br><br>But those assurances have proven false. When the Herald contacted the US Defence Department Joint Strike Fighter program office in Washington, a spokeswoman said the latest table on its website was correct. "There is no reason to pull it from there," she said.<br><br>A Lockheed Martin spokesman said yesterday: "We will have to defer to our clients, the US Government, if that is their decision."<br><br>The downgrading in the stealth capability is only one issue that concerns Dr Jensen, who has a doctorate in applied physics and used to work at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.<br><br>He said the Joint Strike Fighter could not match the Russian-built Sukhoi strike jets operated by air forces around the region in important respects.<br><br>It falls well short of the F-111 jet it is replacing in its long-range strike ability and would require air-to-air refuelling that would leave it and support aircraft vulnerable to enemy missiles and aircraft, he said.<br><br>He also said the fighter would almost certainly be more expensive than the Defence Department admits.<br><br>"[The Joint Strike] is essentially a second tier bomb truck. It lacks the necessary aerodynamics to defeat the [Sukhoi] Flankers, never mind future aircraft that may proliferate," he told the parliamentary inquiry into Australia's regional air superiority.<br><br>The Sukhoi family of Russian aircraft are, or will be, operated by most Asian air forces, including China, Indonesia, Malaysia and India.<br><br>It is understood Dr Jensen's concerns are shared by another Liberal MP, David Fawcett. Before he entered politics at the last election, Mr Fawcett was the commander of the Defence Force's flight test and evaluation centre.<br><br>Dr Jensen and Mr Fawcett raised their concerns with the Minister for Defence, Brendan Nelson, last month. Dr Jensen told the Herald yesterday he agonised before breaking with the discipline of the Howard Government to lodge his submission, but the issue was too important.<br><br>It falls well short of the F-111 jet it is replacing in its long-range strike ability and would require air-to-air refuelling that would leave it and support aircraft vulnerable to enemy missiles and aircraft, he said.<br><br>He also said the fighter would almost certainly be more expensive than the Defence Department admits.<br><br>"[The Joint Strike] is essentially a second tier bomb truck.

I can understand that they want to replace their Harriers, but I'm sure there's going to be compatibility problems between the JSF and their existing Eurofighter Typhoons.<br><br>And with their inability to access some of the Yanks' JSF technologies, it's bound to get worse. To add the final insult to injury, they can't even repair their own JSFs.<br><br>With all that crap being thrown at them, I think it would be better for them to just stick with the Typhoons. Even if the Typhoon is more expensive, at least they won't be stuck with all this nonsense.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
