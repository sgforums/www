            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Chewie !<br><br>Must disagree in a friendly way.  I was a platoon sgt in the infantry and the medic in my platoon used to follow the PS around during exercises.  The combat  medic has a different life to the camp medics (such as in BMTC and other big camps e.g. SAFTI).<br><br>The medic in the platoon or coy. had to do the same as the infantryman, plus his own vocation. For example, when the PS had to go for ops briefing during a defence exercise, or is tasked to lead a recce patrol around the defence perimeter,  the medic has to help prepare his overnight position, be it a trench , a shell scrape , or erecting his basha. This is on top of doing his own.  If there are no casualties, the platoon medic doubles up as a runner between the PS and PC and OC. He is a useful , highly intelligent runner, as he is usually a LCP or CPL and normally would have more than O levels in his background.<br><br>All the combat medics that have served with me in reservist and NS were damned good guys....  they were specialists (NCOs) of a good calibre. Most times, more hardworking than the privates or LCPs that we have in the sections.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>F***, you guys who have so negative thoughts about medics must be from schools or non-active unit or from other forces...<br><br>For those who are from foot soldier units must have seen combat medics in action. Always carrying the 5-6kg strecher + the 3kg MOP during exercise. Men walk how far, medics follow. Men climb hill (or mountain), medic follow. Men kana contacted,  medic follow 2 bound behind... Men got injured and simulate injury (a.k.a rest liao), medic run over to treat them. Re-org time, medic sent injured men to BCS (when everyone else is resting) and walk 3-4 km to get there...<br><br>One thing that ALL medics did in SAF: THEY GIVE BLOOD FOR SAF.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I fully sympathise with all combat medics, as I served with many medics in NS and reservist. All were good chaps and went beyond their duty during outfield exercises.<br><br>I wish I could have done more to help them but as I was only a PS , there was not much I could do for their welfare, except that they got a bit more time off when the platoon was back in camp.</div>
