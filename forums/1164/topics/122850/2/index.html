            <div class='col-md body'>Ok.... Ok.....  I do hear stories about the not -so-fit  medics at the big medical centres (e.g. in the major camps). Before my time, I heard stories... like medics fainting when they saw a real serious casualty. But even within the same story, I heard that the MO, a NS captain, also got nervous and was under stress with the serious casualty. The casualty was a OCT who got blown up by a detonation cord ( I guess you may heard this story from the early 80s). But I heard from my medic friends that training has improved. There is attachments to hospital A and E departments to get them used to serious injuries.<br><br>Yes, I was from the infantry in NS and a specialised unit in the air force in reservist. Have always had combat medics attached to me, in fact 2 medics when I was in the reserve unit. As I said, I trust them fully , not just their medical vocation but in their other tasks as well.  We expect them to fight in the infantry platoon, because the enemy is not going to differentiate who is the medic and who is the infantryman.<br><br>Sometimes the combat medic is "tail end charlie" in movement to contact.  He and the PS hang back behind the platoon to cover everyone's backside. Very often the medic is actually the last man covering the PS 's  backside.</div>

Our basic load is similar to infantry man, but during real ops they may have additional load such as NVG, claymore, LAW etc<br><br>Everyyear we still have extra vocational training than the men during reservist, like infusion - more holes and pain on my arm, at last count got 33 holes liao!! And  BCS training<br><br>For those CBT medic posted to medical ctr, its not easy also, i have a fren posted to SAFTI,  he went to brunei 4 times in his NS career to cover OCS, more than most NSmen in their whole life.</div>

Next not all MP son become medic. Lastly I think some people are jealous because medic have the previliege of an air con working environment btw I think u guys have to know that when HQMC air conditioned all the MC, it is actually for the men like you guys out there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Medics are really tough guys man.Carry more and do more then the average rifleman of the line infantry units.Imagine this,riflemen already complain about going to EX with FBO...now imagine our medic similarly equipped but has to lug around the stretcher,first aid kit and so many other life-saving equipment...how does that make him?And the fatigue that sets in after long distance route marches etc...realli salute them.And somemore,they are using full-scale M16s, not like the Americans or Israelis where their medics carry carbines so as to lighten their load.</div>
