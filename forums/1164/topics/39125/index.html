Iraqi state television broadcast images of one downed helicopter, which appeared largely intact, and jubilant men dancing around it.<br><br>All 32 helicopters sustained some damage, occasionally slight, Army officials said, in what was a significant setback for the allies.<br><br><strong>The attack surprised American Army leaders and may cause them to rethink their military strategy, which relied on the Apaches to destroy Iraq's armored divisions that ring Baghdad. </strong><br>The commander of the American-led invasion of Iraq confirmed the loss of one Apache helicopter.<br><br>``The fate of the crew is uncertain right now,'' Gen. Tommy R. Franks said at a news briefing at Central Command in Qatar. We characterize that crew, two men, as missing in action.''<br><br>General Franks denied that the helicopter had been shot down by farmers, as Iraq claimed, but did not say what had forced it out of the air.<br><br>A CNN correspondent accompanying the United States Army Fifth Corps 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment, said the unit had been on a night-time combat mission targeting units of the elite Republican Guard.<br><br>The correspondent cited one of the pilots as saying they had run into a ``hornet's nest, a barrage of antiaircraft fire,'' near the city of Kerbala, 70 miles southwest of Baghdad, the closest fighting to the Iraqi capital since the war began last Thursday.<br><br>The Iraqi Information Minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, said at a news conference: ``Farmers shot down two Apaches. We showed one today and might show the second and the pilots.''<br><br>``We are holding several other American and British prisoners and we may show some of them,'' the minister said.<br><br>The Apaches use a powerful radar, called the Longbow, that directs their Hellfire missiles.<br><br><strong>But the Apaches are suddenly coming under attack from relatively low-technology weaponry. </strong><br><br>Saddam Hussein ``is fighting an asymmetrical warfare,'' said Brig. Gen. Benjamin Freakly, assistant commander of the 101st Division. ``This is not tank on tank fighting.''<br><br>The attack took place near the village of Abu Mustafe, north of Al Hillah, and capped a punishing 24 hours for the allied offensive.<br><br>General Freakly said that in an attack like the one on the helicopters, ``you have 10 guys lying on top of a building firing R.P.G.'s and small arms. You can go in and bomb that building and reduce it to rubble,'' but at the potential cost of many civilian lives.<br><br>The Army now may consider new tactics, such as additional close aerial bombardment, to support the Apaches as they hunt for armored divisions.<br><br>The Apaches were from the 11th Aviation Regiment, based in Germany, and are attached to the V Corps.<br><br>Sandstorms are roiling the area, blowing at 25 knots, and are likely to rise to 40 knots on Tuesday and Wednesday. At 30 knots, a meteorologist said, visibility becomes practically nil.<br><br>General Franks also said today that the tenacity of some Iraqi units, including the fedayeen, was no surprise and that American-led forces had had some ``terrific firefights.''<br><br>The Republican Guard has been hit, he said, and ``they will continue to be hit, at points and places and times that make sense to us. The effect has been very positive for us.''<br><br><img src="http://www.newsday.com/media/photo/2003-03/7123074.jpg"></div>

Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf said Iraqi villagers shot down two Apaches.<br><br>U.S. Central Command confirmed that one Apache is missing in Iraq but had no details on the crew or the reported second missing helicopter.<br><br>CNN's Karl Penhaul who was with helicopter regiment involved in the attack said the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>helicopters encountered a "heavy, heavy barrage" of anti-aircraft fire in the battle. </strong></span><br><br>He could not immediately say whether all of the U.S. helicopters returned safely to their base at an airfield in northern Kuwait.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Most pilots said they were unable to achieve the objectives of the mission -- to hit the Republican Guard armored brigade, knock out its tanks and pierce its artillery. They spent a few hours in the air defending themselves and trying to get out of the area. </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The attack force did not expect such strong resistance from what they thought were mostly civilian areas, Penhaul reported.<br><br>He added that pilots were "somewhat dazed, somewhat stunned" by the level of Iraqi resistance they encountered. </strong></span><br><br>Some of the elements the Apaches tried to strike were Iraqi T-72 battle tanks, the most advanced tank used by the Iraqi forces. The Republican Guard was estimated to have at least 90 of those tanks, along with "multiple" pieces of field artillery and armored personnel carriers, Penhaul said.<br><br>The attack started after midnight (4 p.m. ET) and lasted about three hours, said Penhaul, who was aboard a Black Hawk helicopter that served as the command and control craft of a unit of Apache attack helicopters.<br><br>The helicopter in which Penhaul was riding was about 15-20 miles from the scene of the strike.<br><br>The Apache unit went up against the 2nd Armored Brigade of the Medina Division, which is part of the Republican Guard, the troops most loyal to Saddam Hussein, Penhaul said.<br><br>They also attacked positions between Karbala and Hillah, which straddle the Euphrates River south of Baghdad.<br><br>Narrow escape<br><br>Some of the U.S. aircraft flying in the mission reported taking fire.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One pilot described the situation as "a hornet's nest," as small arms fire and anti-aircraft fire came from "all sides."<br><br><span style="color: red;">Most pilots said they sustained 15 to 20 rounds</span>.<br><br>One pilot said his helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, which took out one of the engines, Penhaul reported. </strong></span><br><br>He managed to fly back to the air base in Northern Kuwait, with one engine intact. At one stage, the pilot said, his aircraft dropped down 15-20 feet above an urban area before he could regain control.<br><br>Penhaul is embedded with the U.S. Army's V Corps, 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment.<br><br>EDITOR'S NOTE: This report was written in accordance with Pentagon ground rules allowing so-called embedded reporting, in which journalists join deployed troops.
