Becos a lot of saddam's fighters, esp. the irregulars are largely independent of any formal military control and hence will do things more akin to indonesia anti-chinese rioters then soldiers following the conduct of war. They dun give two hoots about public relations, but just to show that they have their enemy beat. And that could be by exceutions or parading them.

Which is why they make us wear helmets long before body armour is popular.<br><br>Head is also the most exposed part. When under cover, that is the only part the enemy can hit with direct fire weapons. When standing or crouching in a fire trench, it is also the part (facing upwards) of the body most vulnerable to air-burst weapons or near misses from contact fuse shells and mortar bombs.<br><br>So one shouldn't give too much hoo haa about many of the KIAs having head wounds.<br><br>Oh yeah, I heard that that is the reason why they need dental surgeons in field hospitals.</div>

The visibility and the wind shear was causing flying and touch down very tricky. RSAF or any top rate pilots wouldn't far much better in that condition. RSAF chopper pilots have history of crashing in the mountainous area when the fog is thick. Same thing in Iraq, the Apache pilots would be able to see clearly where the ground is, plus the strong wind and wind shear would easily topple any helo trying to land vertically. Its just life, mate!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As funny as it may seem, all the current downed attack helos are Longbow Apaches. Maybe they do have stability issues with the mast on top. I haven't read any reports of a downed Super Cobra AH-1Z. Perhaps RSAF should also include a less expensive attack choppers (AH-1Z, Roovialk or A129 Mangusta) into the Orbat.<br><br>Furthermore, I think the differential between 2 land forces will be the attack choppers plus good C3I.<br></div>
