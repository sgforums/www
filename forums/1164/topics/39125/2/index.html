            <div class='col-md body'>I am surprised the US didn't send in a airstrike to destroy the copter. A F117 or F18 with a LGB should do the trick.<br><br>Once it is certain that the crew is not onboard the copter why didn't the US just blow it up. If I am Saddam and I want the copter intact, I will keep one crewman strapped on the Apache while I towed it to a hidden/hardened location. Human Shield!<br><br>That is one big coup for the Iraqs to capture a Apache Intact. Better yet if they got the pilots.<br><br>I think those farmers gonna be rich. 1 x Copter, 2 x pilots. I recalled Saddam have a reward for all these.<br><br>I still don't believe that the Apache is shot down. Must be some major system failure on board and the crew made a emergency landing. There is no visible damage at all, but of course maybe the tail was damaged (not visible from pics), but I don't think a copter can make a perfect three point landing with a damaged tail. Just look at the movie black hawk down.<br><br>Noticed the Hellfires have white painted warheads. "War Shots" Live rounds siah....<br><br></div>

With it riddled with bullet holes it will look more convincing.<br><br>As for the geneva convention, the US also shows prisioners also, although the US try to show how humane they are.

            <div class='col-md body'>Top U.S. General: Iraq Executed POWs<br><br>Wednesday, March 26, 2003<br><br>WASHINGTON Â— Iraq has executed prisoners of war, the Pentagon's No. 2 general said Wednesday night as he listed a series of what he called unprecedented Iraqi violations of the laws of war.<br><br>Marine Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, apparently was referring to some of the U.S. Army troops captured Sunday by Iraqi forces in the city of An Nasiriyah. Iraqi state television later showed video footage of five living POWs and the bodies of at least five U.S. soldiers.<br><br>Defense officials who have viewed the tape have said privately that several of the bodies had execution-style gunshot wounds to their heads.<br><br>Intelligence officials have received one uncorroborated report indicating that at least some of the dead soldiers had been captured alive and executed in public, a senior Pentagon official said Wednesday on condition of anonymity. The information -- which did not come from an intercepted communication, as the New York Times reported Wednesday -- is of undetermined reliablility, the official said.<br><br>Pace, in a televised interview, said Iraqis had engaged in many atrocities in the six days since the war began.<br><br>"They have executed prisoners of war. ... They have used women and children as human shields and they have pretended to surrender and then opened fire," Pace said. "I've never seen anything like this. It's disgusting."<br><br>Pentagon officials said Wednesday the International Committee of the Red Cross still had not been granted access to the five Army soldiers captured Sunday and the two Army helicopter pilots captured a day later. All seven were questioned in front of Iraqi video cameras and the tapes were later played on Iraqi television -- which U.S. officials say violated Geneva Convention prohibitions on subjecting POWs to public humiliation.<br><br>The first group of Army soldiers captured were part of a maintenance convoy which made a wrong turn in the south-central Iraqi town of An Nasiriyah on Sunday and was attacked by Iraqi forces. Of that unit, the Army says, two soldiers are confirmed dead, five are confirmed as prisoners of war and eight are missing.<br><br>Pentagon officials say the prisoners thought to have been executed are among the eight formally listed as missing. Final determinations that they are dead and how they were killed can only happen once the bodies are located, officials said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Longbow is effectively armored over most of its body but not all of it, throw enuff rounds at it and you'll hit something unprotected or critical. Given how much aa they attracted, the fact that only one AH-64D went down is a testemant to the survability of the chopper. Send Hueys in there and I think a lot of them confirm die one.<br><br>As for the Iraqi account of farmers shooting it down I doubt it highly, unless they tyco hit (like that bo pian lah, cannot be helped). More likely, I think the Longbow was already heavily damaged from the hornet's nest incident from REAL aa fire and forced to land, the farmers shooting at it assumed that they were the onces who brought it down. Simple and solved.<br><br>It's like tom hanks shooting at the tiger in Saving Private Ryan with his colt .45, when the tank exploded, was it him or the mustang that knocked it out?</div>

When your in a Section of 7 men, there is a way of gunning down planes provided you all are marksman.<br><br>when 7 men line up and point their rifles 45 degrees and sweep it to 90degrees in an arch, there is a chance the plane will get hit provided they are within the 460m - 1500m range.<br><br></div>
