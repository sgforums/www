            <div class='col-md body'>Ok I, I have a copy of that JDW report:<br><br><strong><span class="large">Turkey unveils towed howitzer with 40km range</span> </strong><br>LALE SARIIBRAHIMOGLU<br>JDW Correspondent<br>Ankara<br><br>Turkey's state-owned Machines and Chemical Industry Board (MKEK) has unveiled the prototype of a 155mm/52-cal towed howitzer that has a range of 40km. The Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) disclosed last year that it expected to field two locally-produced 155mm/52-cal systems, one towed and one self-propelled, later this decade (Jane's Defence Weekly 13 October). According to TLFC sources,<strong> MKEK received assistance from Singapore Technologies Kinetics (previously known as Ordnance Development and Engineering of Singapore) in the development of the new towed weapon. </strong><br><br><strong>The Turkish weapon is similar to the Singaporean 155mm/52-cal FH2000 that entered service with the Singapore Armed Forces in the mid-1990s and has since been offered for export. Serial production of the new howitzer will start soon, said MKEK officials.</strong> These will replace some of the TFLC's 500-plus 155mm M114 howitzers, which have a range of only 14.6km firing standard high-explosive projectiles. Late last year Turkey unveiled a prototype self-propelled howitzer (SPH), designated SP2000, equipped with a 155mm/39-cal barrel. This built on experience gained by MKEK in the modernisation of elderly US-supplied 105mm M52 and 155mm M44 SPHs. A second SP2000 equipped with a 155mm/52-cal barrel is due for completion this year.<br><br>Industry sources suggest that the SP2000 will not meet the army's specifications and that Turkey is seeking foreign assistance with the programme. The TLFC had hoped to acquire the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann 155mm/52-cal PzH 2000 self-propelled artillery system. However, the German government will not allow export of the weapon or subsystems to Turkey. Following preliminary talks between Turkish and Republic of Korean (RoK) officials earlier this year about the scope for defence industry co-operation between the two countries, the TLFC is likely to consider the new Samsung Aerospace Industries 155mm/52-cal K9 Thunder for its SPH requirement (JDW 29 March). The K9 is now in quantity production for the RoK Army.<br></div>

So far more than 600 have been ordered with production still underway.<br><br>Bronco has already undertaken extensive trials in Finland and more recently in France as both countries have a requirement for a vehicle of this type.<br><br>Also competing for both of these requirements is the BAE Systems HÃ¤gglunds BvS 10, which is in service with the Netherlands and UK Royal Marines and has also undergone extensive trials in France, including the Alps.<br><br>The French Army programme is called the VÃ©hicule Haute MobilitÃ© (VHM) with a total requirement, funding permitting, of up to 400 units. Both contractors have submitted their bids to France. A decision is expected early next year, with first order expected to be for about 50 to 60 units.<br><br>For the French market STK (Stand H10) would send the vehicles to French company CEFA, which would fit specialised mission equipment. The vehicles would then go to Thales, which would fit the electronic equipment.<br><br>At Eurosatory, a Bronco is being shown in French Army markings and fitted out as an Artillery Forward Observation Officer (FOO) vehicle. Mounted over the front unit is a remote controlled overhead weapon station supplied by Thales and armed with a 12.7mm machine gun.<br><br>Singapore has already deployed a number of versions of the Bronco, including ambulance, repair and recovery, load carrier, troop carrier and fuel resupply vehicle. Other versions are under development, including one carrying the STK 120mm SRAMS (Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System).................<br><br><a href="http://www.defenseworld.net/eurosatory2006/news/Singapore_Technologies_Bronco.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenseworld.net/eurosatory2006/news/Singapore_Technologies_Bronco.htm</a><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>BTW, Turkey is another interested party.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So the French confirm liao isit or ST they own sell said one? I wonder how how armoured lvl protection can the Bronco offer and wad variants the French wish to create out of it.
