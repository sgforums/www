Nations have time and again ignored its demands, most recently the unilateral moves by the US to invade Iraq. Look what happened to the US now. Bogged down in Iraq, with little or no Allies willing to support its operations and grounds that is conductive for fostering militancy instead of democracy. Such is the folly of not following the UN's advice.<br><br>Also, the Straits of Malacca is an important shipping route for many countries, and the life-line of China, Japan, South Korea, Phillipines, Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries that import and export goods. In an event of a confrontation or war, it would make sense for the major powers and developed nations to stabilize the area, and the best option would be to maintain the status quo. Thus they will send in military forces to keep the peace in the region.<br><br>Yes, if indonesia manages to mobilize all its males to fight they will have at least 100m, since their population has some 230million (afterall they are the World's largest muslim nation). However, look at its borders. Who are its immediate neighbours? Will they keep a blind eye if their own economy is going to be destroyed?<br><br>Secondly, even if there is no external support, do you think they can launch an invasion with 100m people. Think of all the logistics involved. Do you think they are landing on sampan boats? The logistics planning would be on a scale bigger than D-Day. Even the World's superpower (US) can only support an invasion scale the size of their marines.<br><br>Thirdly, Indonesia is not truely united. There are many tribesman and local customs that differs markly from Jakarta. Remember Aceh? It wasnt until the Tsunami that the 2 sides are willing to make peace for posperity. Within its 10000 islands, how many has their utmost allegance to Jakarta? Using propaganda in the right place will see Indonesia having internal strife.<br><br>Using an ICBM on Indonesia is an easy solution, no doubt. But once launched, have you thought of the consequences? We will lose all our legimicity and morality. Who will even support such a country in this case?<br><br>Furthermore, how damaging would it be to mother Earth? Those large lands in Indonesia houses large swarthes of Rainforest and Arable land. Do you think we have enough land to grow all our food? The prices of flour has rose precisely due to the drought in Australia and low yield in other Wheat producing countries. Land would make better use by either farming it to feed more people or retaining its rainforest to check the growth of carbon dioxide.<br><br>Launching a land invasion against Pulau Tekong?! That's pretty laughable. Can they reach the island first? They'd better make sure they can avoid being destroyed en-route by our navy from Changi base. And the Air Force will be either engaged with the Indonesia Air Force or Bombing Indonesia's Landing Ships. Unless you count Malaysia in.'<br><br>If that is the case, then the odds will be stacked against us in terms of land forces. The Malaysian Army can move down South against us while the Indonesian take its time to move up North.<br><br>In this case, HE cruise missiles will do the trick. Or precision bombs from the F-15SG. Strike all important military buildings on the surface. And jam radar communications. Implement Blackouts in Singapore. Stop all out going travel. As the strategem goes: "Then there is no path to retreat, people will hard to their hardest and therefore lives." We will likely hold out in the hope that foreign aid reaches Singapore soon. The Navy will change tack, switching to Anti-submarine warfare. By sinking supply ships of their navy, we can reduce the effectiveness of the Indonesian Navy. The Surface Navy can also embark on a trip to mine the Straits south of Singapore (aka Riau Islands) while our Air Force makes desperate defence of Singapore's Airspace.<br><br>Of course, what I've said are all theoretical and I am at best, "taking about military strategies on paper". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
