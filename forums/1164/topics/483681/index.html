              <p>Practise makes perfect and most important factor,now you have a picture in mind what being a pilot is (from what others told you,you saw in movies etc),which may not be the reality. But in any case prep yourself with air craft knowledge,flying etc.</p>

              <p>hey bro,<br><br>i just went through the same thing as you last year. i can help you with my experience...<br><br>your right eye left eye can make it. my route is i go try out for youth pilot program with syfc. they will have interview first, then they will send you for a medical at the paya lebar air base that side.<br><br>if everything goes well then you could be in the program.<br><br>but in my case i have a long standing eye condition (squint) so they say its risky for me to fly so pity i cannot. but if you got nothing wrong with urself you should be alright.<br><br>rsaf looks for people who already have experience as well as are adaptable to situations. if you think you have what it takes then all the best.<br><br>ideally try to also spend time on ur studies, rsaf also likes ppl with good exam certs. right now even tho i cannot be in the program i'm working on my a levels so if you get posted to rsaf you have a respectable role.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Hi all,can anyone help me with the following with regards to
              army/ airforce</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">1.<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">    1)   </span>I recently got a letter to go for an interview
              for commando but I am more interested in air force then commando, so should I tell
              the commandos that air force is my first choice while commando is my second? And
              if I were to get enlisted as commando, would I still be able to join the air
              force? To be honest, I would really like to join the commandos if I would not
              be able to join the airforce</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">2.<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       2) </span>How do I request to join the air force? Do I ask
              before I enlist or during BMT? I know even if I show interest in joining air
              force does not mean I will go there but will it help if I show my interest
              earlier?</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">3.<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       3) </span>As I am currently a J2 this year, I am planning
              to get the SAF scholarship which I am confuse of how the application process
              works. Do I apply before I enlist or during my enlistment or after my BMT cause
              I read from the airforce website that I must qualify for OCS to apply for it. And
              whether the scholarship would enable me to have a higher chance of being a
              fighter pilot or just joining the airforce.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">4.<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       4) </span>And lastly I would like to ask how eczema would
              affect me in the army. My eczema only acts up if I exercise regularly and
              during the medical checkup, my eczema wasn’t acting up so I was given PES B.
              But now I am worried about how badly my eczema will act up if I enter the army
              and will I be excused from physical activities if my eczema acts up.</p>
              <p> </p>
