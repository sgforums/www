            <div class='col-md body'>Seems probable that these mines are some of the ways an opponent can counter helicopter gunships, and even potential landing zones (LZs)...and there are a few producers of this types of mines: Bulgaria, Russia, U.S., U.K..

            <div class='col-md body'>Nah... it's something you have to manage... nobody said war was going to be a cakewalk, and sitting around on your bum saying "we're screwed" isn't exactly the solution either (which is oddly, what plenty of self-proclaimed Malaysian military "experts" think is our response to their do-all ASTROs system. THey underestimate the Singaporean art of self-criticism and kiasunism, whcih they oddly think to a disadvantage in battle).</div>

But most of the time this crude anti-helo mine didn't work well... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As for AH going to LZs, AHs may have to run suppressing fire if the LZ is hot...AHMs can prevent them from doing so, therefore putting them at risk from other types of AA fire...handheld SAMs, AA guns, etc...<br><br>AHMs, when activated, travel at high enough speeds, giving the pilot(s) little time to take evasive action...Imagine leh, the Russian AHM is pretty cheap at about $6000....compared to a multimillion chopper...even worse if its a UH, considering they are slower and carry troops...how to heli-repel like that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
