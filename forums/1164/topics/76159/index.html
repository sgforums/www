It was not like the war finished 3 days after China's intervention. The actual war went on for far longer than that. Besides, <strong>creating the element of surprise IS part of war strategy</strong>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> The element of surprise do not fall down from the sky.<br><br>2)Chinese soldiers did outnumber their enemies, but <strong>Chinese army had to use FAR inferior weapons</strong>. They even had NOT a single aircraft. Do you think many other armies could have achieved what they did under those circumstances? Plus they were practically up against the UN, being led by the victorious WW2 nation USA.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>3)"retain status quo"? Incorrect. When the Chinese started to intervene, North Korea (NK) was ALREADY overrun by US, with the UN soldiers almost reaching the China borders with NK. Then in the ensuing battles, China managed to push the US back to the 38 line which is the border between NK and South Korea now. <strong>So the net war result after China's intervention was that US retreated the whole length of NK, from near the China-NK border back to the NK-SK border. </strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br>4)"Though when they did need to fight foreign enemies i believe they lost <strong>most</strong> of their wars?" Obviously you have not read much about history, especially China's history. If what you said really happened, there wouldn't be a China today. It is the only civilization that survived &gt;5000 years. <strong>Throughout its 5000 years of history, China had eliminated numerous enemies that you don't hear of today because their nations were already wiped out by China</strong>. You don't hear about those Chinese heroic stories because much of the literature today is influenced by recent Western culture (at least in this part of the world). And I guess you also forgot about the Sino-Indian war and the Sino-Vietnam war.<br><br>5)Yes, China became weak, but only during this recent 200 years (out of 5000 years) of history. Even so, it still took an <strong>alliance of 8 most powerful industrialized countries </strong>at that time(USA, British, Germany, Russia, Japan, France, Spain, Portugal(?)) to subdue China in the "Â°Ã‹Â¹ÃºÃ�Â¬Â¾Ã¼" war.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>6)Other than that, China was only overrun 2 times  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> during its long history: first by the Mongols and later by the Manchus. But now, both inner Mongolia and Manchou are part of China (not vise versa).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
