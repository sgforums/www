Now you fire the chaff in front and then move midst the chaff cloud. Doesn't make sense!<br></div></blockquote>It does, actually. i think they are arranged this way to optimise coverage, which means attacks from the side as well. Especially when u consider anti-ship missiles typically hit the side of a ship where the area is larger. So, if a missile approaches from the side, u'd swing them around, and u'd have two launchers to cover each side, since it's unlikely to be attacked by two missiles from both sides at the same time. By the same logic, since the target area from the rear isn't so large, i guess u would need only one to cover. I could be mistaken, of course.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

The following pics show what is mounted on the rear of the deck of the PV. Not too sure if the other PVs are so armed though.
