Maybe they want to go with the Typhoon bolt-on like the Fearless class.<br><br>Once again, great pics! Thanks.</blockquote>Those 3 small units behind the VLS and on top of the hangar could be CIWS. Perhaps they are RAM or even Cortale systems doing the job of CIWS. If u notice , those 3 units are in a tri-position where any attack from left-right-centre-front-back can be deal with.<br><br>I doubt the claim that they may be chaff/flare dispenser , because i dun see a need for 3 unit of that. On the fact that this ship is stealth , i believe four units of decoy launchers ( two missile decoy , 2 TTs decoys ) hiden inside the ship is enough to lurk missiles and torpedoes away.</div>

Is it because ASW rockets can be fired some few hundred meters away whereas you practically have to run a course and lay the depth charges at an intervals?<br><br>BTW, ASW rockets and depth charges, I believe, are great at shallow waters but at deeper waters, Torpedoes are still the best ASW weapons.</div>
