            <div class='col-md body'>I am really enjoying this....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Looks like thesefrigate photos really spin off a lot of discussion.<br><br>First I would like to retract when I said that only eastern bloc uses ASW rockets. Yeah the Baltic countries also uses them for coastal ASW work. And the RMN also uses them. Hmm, maybe the RSN also wants ASW rockets seems the water around the region is suppose to be shallow. It would be strange if the first platform where we mount ASW rockets (suitable for shallow waters) is our "blue-water" frigates.<br><br>And maybe I am too sweeping by saying that ASW rockets are obsolete just because the USN is phasing them out/no longer use them.<br><br>I agree that ASW rockets are suppose to be more effective compared to depth charges, although some small ships still have depth charges racks fitted. As stated by another person earlier, the Anti-Sub Torpedo seems to be the most preferred weapon either launched from the ship or from its on-board heli.<br><br>The USN ASROC is suppos to be able to carry a Anti-sub torpedo as well, it is suppose to launch and drop right on top of the sub and seek out the Sub. It also can carry nuclear depth charges.<br><br>But then it doesn't seem to make sense to have a ASW rocket mounted on top of the hangar pointing at the stern! Unless it is suppose to be a last ditch defence against acoustic a anti-ship torpedo!<br><br></div>

Wow to think Singapore will go back to them after the ban? Hmm.<br><br>So maybe role for Gabriels, Decoys, ASW are allocated to these 3 launchers! Wow, first in the world - ST product?<br><br>Any comments on the posting regarding performance of the Herakles radar?<br><br>Seems the specs sounds too far reaching - for single rotating aperture.......something to do with too many pencil beams/sec to achieve effective volume search plus surface surveillance etc.<br><br>Lend credence to the need for fixed multi face 'APAR' type radar???<br><br>[/b][/quote]<blockquote></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there is one other possibility. It could be a brand new product, possibly, by STE and made in Singapore. A short range system in the class of MBDA Tetral for example, or RAM.<br><br>And yes, I do feel it is a missile system now. Most countermeasure systems have multiple tubes and more than often, more than what is seen on the photos. Those that have fewer, are typically long range chaff system where the rockets tend to be longer to achieve the range required.</div>
