It's a matter of how you spin it ...<br><br>It can be viewed as a deficiency in original design necessitating an adaptor.  It can also be viewed as a potential failure point.<br><br>OTOH, the magazine adaptor can also be viewed as a plus point.  Allowing the weapon to accept different magazines without a need to do an A2 version.
