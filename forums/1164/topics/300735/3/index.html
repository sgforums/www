            <div class='col-md body'>Does the 5.56 round penetrate the concrete slab as a an entire round?  I know it breaks it in a shot or 2.  But penetrating outright.... ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have fired rounds as parts of a BMT demo, against solid red brick wall, wood, sand bags.<br>The single 5.56mm round fired penetrates only wood (expected). A single 5.56mm round does not penetrate the brick wall, and sand bags absorb the rounds.<br>However, against multiple rounds, the red bricks will start to fall apart. Sand bags still absorb the rounds. Using a 7.62mm MG is the different story.<br></div>

Best of both worlds! Only obvious problem is the additional weight of carrying the bigger rounds and a larger weapon perhaps?</div>
