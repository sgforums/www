            <div class='col-md body'>Looking at the experience of France with the French Foreign Legion and Spain with the Spanish Foreign Legion,why doesn't Singapore embark on a similar venture to create a foreign professional soldiering branch dedicated to peacekeeping duties and operations that are politically sensitive in a domestic context?<br><br>For now,I would only look at the experiences of the French Foreign Legion as they are currently the most established example,having been around since 1831.Its commissioned officers are drawn from the regulars of the French Army,while NCOs and enlistees are drawn from among its recruit pool which comes from overseas.<br><br>This could serve as a good posting for our regulars to rotate through and receive a fair amount of overseas and possibly combat experience,and make it a thoroughly regular arm of the SAF.<br><br>It also offers the option of increasing visibility and power projection capabilities in the world stage,being seen as able to protect our own interests overseas and the mutual interests of those countries we have ties with.<br><br>It would also help provide an avenue for gaining citizens,since the 'big picture' demands that Singapores population grow in volume,so this opens up another avenue to do so.<br><br>It also offers an option to test our weapons and doctrines in combat situations if they do arise and to help rotate combat experience back into the ranks,perhaps rotating personnel from this branch into TRADOC and the Guards/Infantry and Commando formations training branches.<br><br>The contract could be of similar length as the FFL contract,though maybe 6 years is a more reasonable amount,with application for citizenship possible after 3 years.<br><br>Comments?<br><br>References:<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion<br><br>http://www.foreignlegionlife.com/</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think he is refering more to the point of why Singapore don't have a professional mercenary branch lead by Singaporean regular officiers like the French Foreign Legion. Benefits stated include gaining combat experience such as in peace-keeping missions,testing of new concepts and increasing Singapore's population as these soldiers will be allowed to have citizenship after they leave that branch. I think this is a good idea but we already have a division which is made entirely of regulars and mainly tasked to do peace-keeping missions such as in Timor Leste.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gentlemen, a few points to share.<br><br>Firstly. If you want to join other Armed Forces (US Marines, French FL, etc), you can. But you've to renounce your Singapore citizenship. For more info, check with MINDEF or MHA.<br><br>Secondly. Only Singapore citizens and PRs are recruited into the SAF. This is laid out in the constitution.<br><br>Thirdly. Gurkhas serve in the Singapore Police Force, never in the SAF. However if the Gurkha is given PR, he can apply to the SAF.<br><br>As to why Singapore do not have "a foreign professional soldiering branch", the short answer is NO POINT. NO MONEY. And allow me to share my views with you on the following;<br><br><blockquote> Peacekeeping duties and ops that are politically sensitive in a domestic context?</blockquote>If you can't send in the SAF, sending in a force comprising foreigners armed and backed by Singapore will only make matters worst.<br><blockquote>This could serve as a good posting for our regulars to rotate through and receive a fair amount of overseas and possibly combat experience,and make it a thoroughly regular arm of the SAF.</blockquote>SAF has regular training, coorporation and exercises with other armed forces. This is common knowledge.<br><blockquote>It also offers the option of increasing visibility and power projection capabilities in the world stage,being seen as able to protect our own interests overseas and the mutual interests of those countries we have ties with.</blockquote>Singapore address this concern through diplomatic ties and economic coorporation. Eg, ASEAN and FTAs with various countries. Increased Army size might be interpretted as aggression.<br><blockquote>It would also help provide an avenue for gaining citizens,since the 'big picture' demands that Singapores population grow in volume,so this opens up another avenue to do so.</blockquote>True but with people who can fortify our economic front, not our battle front. It's about MONEY!<br><blockquote>It also offers an option to test our weapons and doctrines in combat situations if they do arise and to help rotate combat experience back into the ranks,perhaps rotating personnel from this branch into TRADOC and the Guards/Infantry and Commando formations training branches.</blockquote>Hopefully we'll never have to test our weapons and doctrines in war. But IF the time comes, do we send in the foreigners to die first and the survivals to come back and tell us how to fight? What do you think? What will THEY think?<br><br>Thank you for the opportunity to share. I do not work for the government.
