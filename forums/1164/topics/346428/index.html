              Singapore gets more F-15 fighter jets, Leopard 2A4 Main Battle Tanks and new Navy Frigates.
              
              Indonesia gets Su-30MK2 Russian jets. Moscow also extended to Indonesia a US$1 billion (S$1.44 billion) credit scheme to finance them and other military purchases, including 22 helicopters, 20 amphibious tanks and two submarines.
              
              Malaysia gets first Scorpene submarine, which is equipped with torpedoes, sub-surface to surface missiles and sea mines, signifying another leap in the nationâ€™s pursuit of new technology.
              
              While countries are facing financial difficulties, Military budget remains High. How ironic is it when we tried so hard to be friendly through ASEAN, Military exchanges but behind our backs continue to build a force to cancel out each other's potential aggression.

              <p>Mere purchasing of the latest or most modern weaponry  does not automatically translate to a significant increase in capabilities.  </p>
              <p>Indonesia's  purchase of a very small number of SU30s  is probably  motivated by other factors.  Also, with such a vast  land area and coast line to police ,  the 22 helis , 20 amphi tanks and  2 subs  do not constitute a major threat  to anyone.  Anyway , they are no external threats to Indonesia.  Any threats are probably internal anyway. </p>
              <p>Malaysia is also has large area &amp; coastline to police. Seriously, their military capabilities are also considered quite modest.</p>
              <p>However, when one considers Singapore's range, quality  &amp; quantity of weaponry it  raises concerns externally  about why we need such immense capabilties squeezed into small a small country.  But being a S'porean &amp; having served NS,  I  rather be overarmed &amp; overprepared than underarmed and ill prepared. As history shows repeatly, anything &amp; everything can change overnight.  Better be armed to the teeth &amp; more importantly be ready to defend ourselves at any moment rather than hope that someone chooses not to pick a fight .  We can be certain that it will be suicidal to mess around with  the tiny red dot.</p>

              <p>depends on how you look at it. if possession of a nuke can buy me peace, prosperity and security by offering a nuclear deterrent, it will be considered. no nuclear power has ever fought with a nuclear power.</p>
              <p>but on the other hand, unless someone get nuclear warheads and the capability to send them to someone else's place, it is useless. and it will take quite a bit to build up or buy and get ready such a capability without others knowing.</p>
              <p>and there is the possibility that if one country gets, everyone else will get (like look at Iran), if Iran successfuly gets a nuke, the rest of the sunni countries are likely to go nuclear as well. they will get together to counterbalance Iran.</p>
              <p>but that isnt an ideal situation since that now everybody has nukes, its far more unstable because if someone uses one, the likelihood of someone else to use a nuke is higher. its increasingly destabilizing. and the margin for miscalculating and making a wrong move is higher. its like a high stakes card game. the higher u go, the more everyone looses. and nobody benefits from an increased escalation. in essence, nuclear power politics is brinkmanship at its highest level.</p>
              <p>so, depending on how you see it, whether will the deterrence effect outweigh the higher risks involved to everyone ? in Iran's case, its clear why it has chosen nukes. In SEA. who needs that much deterrence who is attacking who ? and lest we all forget, members of ASEAN have to sign a non-amity clause. (i.e illegal to fight wars amongst each other)</p>

              <p><span>The TAC, which was signed in February of
                          1976 in Bali, Indonesia, was amended by the First and Second Protocols
                          in 1987 and 1988, respectively.<br> <br> It specifically and legally binds all its ASEAN signatories to peaceful
                          co-existence and respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial
                          integrity, non-interference in internal affairs and non-use of force.<br> <br> The Treaty's Amity clause emphasizes increased contact and interaction
                          among ASEAN's peoples to ensure closer understanding. Its Cooperation
                          clauses oblige active efforts at consultation on international and
                          regional matters with a view to policy and action coordination.<br> <br> They also restrict individual signatory states from participating in
                          activities that constitute a threat to the political and economic
                          stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity of another signatory
                          state.<br> <br> The operationalization of the TAC, therefore, is facilitated by finding
                          equilibrium between the definitive principles of sovereignty and
                          non-interference, and the regulatory provisions for necessary
                          transnational action and coordination.</span></p>

              <p>people are rational and not foolish. why introduce nukes in a setting when conventional arms power is a sufficient threat. a nuke is an exponential increase in threat. and without any clear cause / reason to have a nuke. why risk destabilizing effects ?</p>
              <p>and this thread is rather pointless. it dosent even make clear the distinction between arms procurement and capability. and/or inherently, the balance of power.</p>
              <p>i can buy a gun. you can buy 10 guns. but if i hold that one gun to your head and put my finger to the trigger,  who is more deadly ? i have more capability to shoot you than you have capability to shoot me despite you having more guns . and most importantly, where is the intent to pull the trigger ? am i going to pull the trigger ? or am i simply pulling your leg because we are good neighbours ? play-play soldier only with no intention to shoot. or is it that the gun is bought to scare away creeps like lionnoisy who disturb us from time to time, with no real intention of using it on you or me.</p>

              <p>Look at it this way.  The Armed Forces in the region are in need of modernization programs.  Besides the RSAF, TNI-AU and the RMAF are operating some very old aircraft that has gone through very little upgrades and reconditioning. Introduction of more 4G fighters can be said to be a natural thing.</p>
              <p>Similarly, on land, the M113s operated by most of the countries here are also getting outdated.  The introduction of Main Battle Tanks has been a process that has been long over-due much due to the popular myth of quicksand like soil in our region.  Urbanization has also gone a long way to render some of the old fighting doctrines a little less valid.  With introduction of newer and more urbanized landscape, new fighting capabilities are also needed. </p>
              <p>And we take all that and put in perspective with the rest of the world.  Compared to Russian, European, Western and Middle Eastern armed forces capabilities, we are just catching up.  And by "we", I mean the leaders of the pack in this region, Singapore. </p>
              <p>I may be getting carried away a little.  But "catching" up with the rest of the world in terms of military capabilities in my opinion, allows SEA as a region on its own, to be more independent of "domination" by greater foreign powers. 2-3 centuries ago, South East Asian militaries were unable to stand against foreign colonization due to the gap in power and wealth between the Europeans and the existing South East Asian kingdoms.  South East Asia was thus a region dominated by Europeans.</p>
              <p>Why military budgets are high in times of financial crises.  Consider this:  the last two world wars began amidst periods of financial turmoil.  State to state relations seem to get a lot edgier when the economy isn't doing well. States and governments are less secure, people are less happy, and sometimes end up voting strange people into power.  Strange people or parties sometimes make very aggressive foreign policy adjustments in order to distract the locals to an enemy on the outside. </p>
              <p>Naturally, in such situations, its wiser to set aside some capability to arm and prepare for any potential security challenges... Just in case.</p>

              I am all for the modernisation of our Armed Forces - by that I am not shy to say i want Singapore to have the best armed forces in the region with the most sophisticated weapons - the reason is very simple, its the only way realistically to stop your neighbours from treading all over you.
              
              We adopted the Israel doctrine who relies heavily on modern technologies and weaponeries to maintain their land and soverignity -and I think Singapore is thinking the same. 
              
              Already we are in a way "nuclear" due to the pressence of US warships at our CNB.  So, this acts a strong deterrant to the countries who might want to act funny with us.

              <p>i dont think there's a permanant naval vessel there. i believe PACCOM has an office there and at sembawang wharves.</p>
              <p>the British built a huge naval base at singapore and completed it in 1940. the idea was for the RN to sail towards that base and help defend singapore from a potential japanese threat.</p>
              <p>but that failed because there were no royal navy fleet avaliable as they were predominantly tied up in the atlantic and the mediterrenean.</p>
              <p>CNB builds friends and offers an american security presence, but does not, by default, guaruntee a american security interest. America is not bound by anything to come to our aid.</p>
