            <div class='col-md body'>The Star Online &gt;<br><br>Wednesday, March 26, 2003<br>Singapore and ManilaÂ’s right to back US<br>FOREIGN Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar has disclosed that Singapore and the Philippines had supported the unilateral action by the United States and its allies against Iraq.<br><br>Eight other Asean member countries including Malaysia, he said, opposed the unilateral strikes.<br><br>The two countries, he said, had expressed their stance supporting the US-led military action against the Middle East nation during an informal meeting of foreign ministers on the sidelines of the Asean meet in Karambunai, Sabah, last week.<br><br>Â“Although Asean makes decisions based on consensus, both countries are independent nations.<br><br>Â“That is their right. We cannot question their stance,Â” he told Datuk Mohd Ali Hassan (BN Â– Tebrau) when winding up the motion of thanks on the Royal Address.<br><br>Mohd Ali had asked him if the Government should Â“teach Singapore a lessonÂ” as it expressed its willingness to extend help to the US military force.<br><br>Syed Hamid said the MPs should dispel talk of war between Malaysia and Singapore, noting: Â“The Government has never thought about it.Â”<br><br>It should not be made a joke, he said.<br><br>He also said that Malaysia had proposed the price of raw water at RM6.25 per 1,000 gallons to Singapore for the year 2002.<br><br>The proposal was made during the second ministerial and senior officials meeting from Oct 16 to Oct 17 last year.<br><br>Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Datuk Paduka Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir, in replying to points raised on his ministry, said it was normal for a minister or deputy minister to hold several posts before the appointment.<br><br>Â“When a minister or deputy minister is appointed, he or she will have to give up his or her other posts and the process will take some time.Â”<br><br>Similarly, when his deputy Datuk Dr Ng Yen Yen was made a senator in 1993, she had to give up her PR status, he said in reply to queries from Kerk Kim Hock (DAP Â–Kota Melaka) on the matter.<br><br>Â“I would like to stress that she is one of the best deputy ministers. In three years, she has successfully increased the number of tourists from China from 190,000 to 500,000 this year. I don't think you would be capable of doing that if you were my deputy,Â” he said.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Â© 1995-2002 Star Publications (Malaysia) Bhd (Co No 10894-D)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some old news. See how ST had to appologize to PAS for their articles. This is the best example of not believing just one side of the story.<br><br>Singapore's Straits Times, Jane's Intelligence, apologise to Pas<br>SINGAPORE Jan 13 - Singapore's Straits Times newspaper and Jane's Intelligence Review have apologised to Malaysia's opposition party, Parti Islam SeMalaysia (Pas), over an article by the defence magazine which reported Pas has political ties with the Al-Qaeda terrorist network.<br><br>"Jane's Intelligence Review now understands that these allegations are incorrect and are happy to fully retract them at the first opportunity," its editor, Chris Aaron, said in a statement yesterday to the Sunday Times, a a sister publication of Straits Times.<br><br>The magazine had also stated that the Pas headquarters "displays a poster of Osama bin Laden reflecting Pas thinking on Al-Qaeda."<br><br>The Sunday Times said Jane's Inteligence Review and the Straits Times, which reproduced the article on Jan 4, would also like to apologise to Pas for publishing the incorrect allegations.<br><br>Pas had denied the links and demanded an apology from the Straits Times.<br><br>The same article had also drawn the ire of the Malaysian government for reporting that the Sept 11 attacks in the United States could have been averted had Malaysia intercepted and arrested two suspects involved in the attack when they were in Malaysia in January last year.<br><br>Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the country should not be made to share the blame as the two suspects had entered Malaysia as tourists.<br><br>He said American authorities itself could have nabbed the suspects who had been residing in the United States for almost a year prior to the attacks.<br><br>Surveillance tapes of the suspects in Malaysia were also passed to the Central Intelligence Agency.<br></div>
