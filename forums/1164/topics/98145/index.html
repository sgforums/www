            <div class='col-md body'>Okay,basically in SG,SAF and SPF uses the paper type of targets for firing practices.Wondering if the shooters feel anything.Cuz for me,there was no feelings or anything and the moment the target cums up,I just fire away,no 2nd thoughts or anything.<br><br>However,I'm wonderin if the STAR and SOF uses 3D targets like Mannequins or crash bummy type of dolls for live fire exercises during training?Basically,I feel that these type of targets will bring more realism into training by allowing the shooter to shoot at sumthing which resembles a human.CQB and combat as a whole requires swift and decisive split second decisions where by a blink of an eye may even cost death.When in HK,I played Airsoft quite a bit,and have no problems shooting at the male players,however,when it is the female players i have in my sights,i hesitate and end up getting shot.Many other guys in the airsoft community also have such experiences.So i'm wondering what are the merits of using such 3D targets if the SOF or STAR team uses them.As it will let them get used to the kill on sight of a weapon kinda thing.<br><br>Please feel free to replay/answer/debate.</div>

And also the SAR21 range with moving figure 11s at <strong>200m</strong>. Bloody hell to shoot these after a rundown. Furthermore you have to run down again to shoot moving figure 11s at 100m.

            <div class='col-md body'>You may not want to die but would you want to kill another human being?<br><br>During WWII, there was a study set up to investigate human nature during a firefight. Up to 65% of respondents replied that they would not return fire when fired upon. They would cower instead. Only when encouraged to fire by a Sect Comm or Platoon Leader, do they blaze away. Again, they do not take careful aim and shoot off instead, to alleviate frustration.<br><br>When the Sect Comm or Platoon Leader moves away, the men will just go back to a cowering position.<br><br>Due to the findings of that study, range targets were changed to Figure targets. Prior to WWII, it was common practice to shoot at bull's eye kind of targets. Figure targets are believed to de-sensitise the shooter's brain.<br><br>Again, note the reluctance of a typical human in a firefight. Group leaders and small-unit commanders make a big difference.</div>
