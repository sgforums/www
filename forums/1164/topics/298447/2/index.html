Its the inherent potential capability.  A single Seawolf can have 8 Torpedoes in the water at one time, while retaining the capability to guide them.<br><br>The Akula 2 has 10.<br><br>A single volley has the potential to cripple a surface task force.<br><br>Most attack submarines have an average of 4 torpedo tubes.</div>

During the Cold War with the USSR, such provocation or stunts can ignite an explosive WW3 with losers on both sides...<br><br>During these peacetime environment, and with PLAN expanding, it would'nt hurt to let PLAN think they can penetrate USN net.....bear in mind ....overconfidence in your military's ability can backfire dearly.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Also, it may benefit USN much to be able to clearly ID the acoustic sounds of PLAN quietest subs. Once that is done, do you seriously believe PLAN's subs can do the same stunt in the event of a hostile environment.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> This I will bet my fannies that it will not happen......hehehehe<br><br>And, there is so much propaganda on both sides.....even more on the US side....it sure will be a plus for the USN to claim that their ability has been compromised..........so I say.....if your current abilities su..cks .....do you want to let your future adversery know you s..u..c..k??
