            <div class='col-md body'>Visiting French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie has urged Singapore to pick the Rafale fighter over US and other European rivals as the city-state prepared to order a new generation of combat aircraft.<br><br>Alliot-Marie, who flew in from Yemen for a hectic five-hour visit, met with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Defense Minister Teo Chee Hean and Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan, the coordinating minister for security and defence.<br><br>The French minister said she extended an invitation from President Jacques Chirac for Lee, who took over as prime minister last August, to visit France.<br><br>The French-made Rafale has been shortlisted along with the US-made Boeing F-15 Eagle and the consortium-backed Eurofighter Typhoon to replace Singapore's squadron of ageing Skyhawks. A decision is expected within months.<br><br>Chirac himself had pushed for the Rafale in a visit to Singapore last October. The deal, estimated to be worth one billion US dollars, is being closely watched in the arms market because affluent Singapore is regarded as a picky buyer whose choices could influence other countries' decisions.<br><br>Alliot-Marie told a news conference that she discussed the fighter issue with Singapore officials, and said buying the Rafale would bring several benefits to Singapore, which trains pilots at an air base in Cazaux, France.<br><br>"I did mention the new generation aircraft," she said when asked if she tried to convince the Singapore officials to go for the Rafale.<br><br>"Of course we would be very happy if the Singaporean government chose this aircraft because it would represent a new aspect in an already very close cooperation between our two countries," Alliot-Marie said.<br><br>France is procuring the aircraft and if Singapore makes the same choice it means that "we would be able to have the same training, the same instruction and possibly common exercises as well following the model already implemented in Cazaux."<br><br>Alliot-Marie said she flew a twin-seater Rafale recently "and I can tell you that it meets all sorts of requirements, and it represents savings in fact because if you have a general purpose aircraft, you don't need an aircraft for reconnaissance, another one for air-to-air combat or air-to-ground or air-to-sea combat."<br><br>"You have an aircraft that gives you all the capabilities," added the minister, who immediately left for Paris.<br><br>France's Direction des Constructions Navales (DCN) won a contract in 2000 to supply the Singaporean navy with six ultra-modern Lafayette-class frigates in a deal that includes co-production of the warships in Singapore - AFP</div>

The Rafale is competing with the US-made Boeing F-15 and the Eurofighter Typhoon, manufactured by the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS).<br><br>EADS, partly owned by the French government, last week said it had no association with a man who was charged with trying to bribe a Singaporean official for information about an earlier naval helicopter deal.<br><br>The helicopter deal was eventually won by a US contractor.<br><br>Eng Heng Chiaw, 46, was charged last week with offering a defence ministry official SGD 500,000 Singapore dollars (EUR 233,100) to secure tender details about an EADS competitor.<br><br>Alliot-Marie reiterated Tuesday that "EADS management expressed a wish to have an inquiry very quickly on these rumours and these leaks."<br><br>"The EADS really wants an investigation to be conducted because they do not know who has an interest in setting up these accusations against them," the French minister said.<br><br>The contract in question was for six naval helicopters and was awarded to Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. from the United States.<br><br>A copy of the charge sheet said Eng wanted information "about the price offered by the competitor in a naval helicopter project so that a company, European Aeronatics Defence and Space (EADS) SEA P/L, could price its offer to secure the said project." - AFP[/b]</blockquote>hmmm.. this may changes everything, if really bribery then mindef may need to uphold the image of being squeaky clean procurement system no?<br><br>This smacks of james bond intrigue, the whole thing looks as though it has the finger prints of the CIA all over it.<br><br>maybe the rafale is really unbeatable and the yanks try to torpedo the deal and get their spooks to dress up as wine guzzling french arms dealers and try to bribe our ppl.<br><br>don't worry folks I was ask nathan to look into the matter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well it's true that the russians SU are better fighters than the US or Europeans ones. However, when it comes to maintenance, it would be a nitemare for the RSAF. Imagine we have to translate all the russian manuals, personnel have to learn russian and go russia for training. If anything needs repairs still have to send to russia....  What I'm tryng to say is, singapore is not just looking for a GREAT FIGHTER, but one that's easy to maintain. No use if it's a SUPER FIGHTER if most of the time it has to sit at the runway waiting for spares..... Dunno come from which city of russia.... it's all about speed of the recovery of aircraft... I think Singapore will choose the Euro Aircrafts coz they help in reducing the time of maintaining the aircraft. And cheaper too..</div>
