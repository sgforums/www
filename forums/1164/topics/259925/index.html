            <div class='col-md body'>IMO, one of the only possible way to change the situation is to tell others of your thoughts, and drive yourself to be an officer or an in-charge. Then, treat your soldiers with respect and hopefully, they will aspire to be the same, when they are posted to any command school.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So what's the solution? How else do we get the best and the brightest to join SAF?<br><br>Is there another way to attract intelligent and highly-educated people to join and stay in the military other than to give them more money, more titles and more responsibilities?<br><br>The cadre of "farmer" officers aren't perfect either.<br><br>MANY of the old generation "farmer" officers I have met did not fit anyone's ideal of a true soldier/officer/gentleman image either.<br><br>Some of these "farmer" class officers were lazy individuals who are in the military because they can't compete outside. Many of them are not even interested in military stuff like us. It's just a job.<br><br>The lack of practical experience is endemic in SAF. But what to do? Perhaps we should participate in more overseas missions, or better still, let our officers be seconded to UK or US Army for combat operations.<br><br>We are not in the best possible way with officer corps but WHO IS? Even the major professional armies will have many duds and only a few gems.<br><br>Compared to our neighbours, our officers aren't that bad at all. They may have more capable and experienced combat officers but when it comes to big scale ops, we're up there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By realism,I mean investing in common-sense regulation,rather than going over the top.Give more flexibility to company-level commanders and platoon commanders when running their training excercises.Have a broad set of guidelines and a few core rules that must be followed rather than overly thick TSR.Take a no-nonsense professional approach to it.All it takes is a few minor changes at the ground level and the top,a change in perspective.<br><br>And in BMT,why not investing in Simunitions (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simunition) or Airsoft tehnologies (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airsoft), as well getting Mindef to tell the parents that while their sons are valuable,this is the military and accidents can happen,given the vocation and sort of roles you are training for.You can reduce this by investing in professional <strong>NCO's with the proper motivation.</strong><br><br>Given that we can afford to give our overpaid ministers a 60% pay rise over the next few years,I don't see why we can't afford to invest in some proper training facilities and technologies for our military.Perhaps an Airsoft or Simunitions training ground can be made in some of the larger camps,like Seletar,Jurong and the like.<br><br>We can also perhaps reference the Japanese military's experience when it comes to recruiting.<br><br>Quote: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDF)<br>***<br>In the face of some continued post-World War II <strong>public apathy or antipathy toward the armed services</strong>, the SDF has <strong>difficulties in recruiting personnel</strong>. The SDF has to compete for qualified personnel with well-paying industries, and most enlistees are "persuaded" volunteers who sign up after solicitation from recruiters.<br><br>Predominantly rural prefectures supply military enlistees far beyond the proportions of their populations. In areas such as southern Kyūshū and Hokkaidō, where employment opportunities are limited, recruiters are welcomed and supported by the citizens. In contrast, little success or cooperation is encountered in urban centers such as Tokyo and Osaka.<br><br>Because the forces are all volunteer and legally civilian, members can resign at any time, and retention is a problem. <strong>Many enlistees are lured away by the prospects of highly paying civilian jobs</strong>, and Defense Agency officials complain of private industries looting their personnel. The agency attempts to stop these practices by threats of sanctions for offending firms that hold defense contracts and by private agreements with major industrial firms. Given the nation's labor shortage, however, the problem is likely to continue.<br><br><strong>Some older officers consider the members of the modern forces unequal to personnel of the former</strong> Imperial Army and Imperial Navy, but the <strong>SDF are generally regarded as professional and able</strong>. <strong>Compared with their counterparts in other nations, members of the SDF are remarkably well educated and in good physical condition</strong>. Literacy is universal, and school training is extensive.<br><br>Personnel are trained in the martial arts, such as judo and kendo, and physical standards are strict. The SDF probably does not attract the same high level of personnel as other institutions in Japan. <strong>Graduates of the top universities rarely enter the armed forces</strong>, and applicants to the National Defense Academy are generally <strong>considered to be on the level of those who apply to second-rank local universities.</strong><br><br>***<br>While they are in a different context,there are similarties,and strategies can be devised from studying their structure with regards to recruitment,as well as increasing the prestige of the military profession.<br><br>The 1st and 2nd bolded points are valid and should be considered.Many of the older crop of officers consider the current batches unequal in motivation,discipline and combat fitness to former batches and this is true enough from all the anecdotal evidence.<br><br>Also,they have similar problems in attracting motivated individuals joining them,with many of the applicants they accept being seen as subpar.[/b]</div>
