            <div class='col-md body'>Being part of this project since the idea was mooted late last year, I am happy to tell you that training with the M-16 paintball guns have increased the training effectiveness full circle in some ways.<br><br>Note that now when you are "shot" you will feel a sharp sting on you, a brusing will happen. This will make the operator more aware of the body parts that will be very likely be targeted during FIBUA or CQB. When they notice and feel the hit, they learn never to make that mistake again.<br><br>Also, the main stumbling block noticed when this excercise was conducted, the team leader and operators were overcome with fear and so fixtated with the target that the whole ops went out of the window. From intel planning, to execution, to leadership when under fire had to be rethinked when the rounds start flying. Imagine a simple 20mins ops window, extended into a 45mins gun fight, thats failure.  And because of this, doctrines have to be reconsidered as the variables have changed. Doctrines of yore, were outdated and based loosely on 2nd hand experience.<br><br>All that I am say it this, the programme is still new. Leadership and operators are using this to hone their skills, technical and tactical. And they are really pushing the envelope for perfection. Even simple drills like reloading, and clearing your weapon while taking fire needs to be addressed, why? Because fear takes control.  At this time, I have noticed at all students have placed their firm priority in their training and not just going thru the motions as before.  I have faith in this new system, it may not be the best out there, but give the moot team credit as they pushed hard for this sytem to be in place. As some day, when you fight in apartment blocks and clear staircases, you have this paintball system to thank and save your live. You are what you train, and you train as you are willing to fight, and the more you sweat and bleed when you train, the less you suffer in a gun fight.<br><br>No gung ho bullshit here, just guts and a cool head.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Right now, as we speak... a small development team will work on expanding the current Paintball gun system to have more NATO small arms replicated. So till then, will keep pushing for perfection in all quarters.<br><br>As some of the posts have suggested, MILES and other "established" training aids do provide some form of training purpose, as well as paintball. This system mainly focus on the skills and reactions that are required to see the mission gets done right, and safe handling of arms in confined spaces and around blind corners. As some of you who have done BUA fighting, know damn well, that friendly fire is the main problem for attacking troops, and failure to command and control your fire movements and troops to secure the objectives.<br><br>Frankly, when the ops order for BUA has been delivered to the attacking troops, the intel situation will change and the foilage surrounding the objective becomes "hot" too. Thus it is important for the mission leader or commander to see beyond the main target and expand his mission scope to ensure all is taken care of. Commands and clear signals form the basis for success.<br><br>Any one who has done ambush raids, intel ops, snatch ops, or any specialized small patrol ops will surely understand the greater need to get the fire movement and C&amp;C right. In this aspect, paintball comes into play, telling the aggressor, and operators where you have made mistakes, and by looking at the shots on the buildings and bodies, you will know whats expected, and need to be worked upon.<br><br>A far greater need for the operators to work on is the need to shoot instinctively, aim faster, engage the aggressor and make the shot. Far too many times, the students are shot, because they are just reluctant to fire until they see a sure shot, which makes their movents very slow and expose their positions. Sharpening shooting skills, weapon handling, "Shoot and scoot" drills are just some of the technical skills the students did take note during their BUA ops.<br><br></div>
