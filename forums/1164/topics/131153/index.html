            <div class='col-md body'>From ST today. I don't have ST online access. OCS cadets using M16 replicas that fire paintballs in training. OCS commander Col Ong said that if current paintbal trials were successful, it would be implemented wider in the SAF. There is more realism to the training and painful bruises from paintball impacts make the soldiers learn and react  faster. On Sat, OCS arranged a shootout between Foxtrot Wing and 5 NS men. Sounds like fun!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The trial shooters are NSman volunteers from the other forum, militarynuts.com. We've organised a few excursions amongst ourselves already. Several others couldn't make it for the shootout as they had to work on Sat and one was Attend B (Home).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>May 9, 2005<br>Officer cadets take aim with paintball guns </strong><br>SAF trainees use M16 assault rifle lookalikes in training, as a result of suggestion by NSman, and all who use them say guns inject greater realism<br><br>By David Boey<br>Defence Correspondent<br>TRAINEES at the SAF's Officer Cadet School (OCS) these days should be prepared to get messy in the line of duty.<br><br>Since January, the school has been using paintball guns to train future Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) officers to dodge enemy gunfire on the urban battlefield.<br><br>Last December, the school received 100 of these rifles as part of a training experiment suggested to the Defence Ministry by a national serviceman.<br><br>The rifles look and feel just like M16 assault rifles that were once the standard SAF infantry rifle. The China-made replicas even faithfully reproduce all the features found on real M16s.<br><br>The pea-size paintballs may be small and leave the barrel at a mere 100m per second - eight times slower than a real bullet - but they still pack a wallop.<br><br>And make a mess.<br><br>Each paintball is a gelatin sphere containing orange, yellow or green liquid dye. When the guns are set to full automatic, they can spit out three balls per second.<br><br>And just like real weapons, soldiers have to change the rifle's magazine once 20 'bullets' have been fired.<br><br>In an interview on Saturday at the Safti Military Institute, OCS commander Colonel Ong Yu Lin said that if the trials are successful, paintball training could complement existing SAF exercises.<br><br>Current SAF exercises have blank ammunition and a small laser emitter attached to soldiers' weapons to simulate gunfire.<br><br>Small disc-like sensors attached to their helmets and uniforms register when they have been 'shot'.<br><br>But soldiers 'hit' by the laser do not experience the impact and stinging pain that accompanies a paintball strike.<br><br>Col Ong said paintball guns add a new dimension to combat training.<br><br>Not only do soldiers get splattered with paint if they are hit, but they are also forced to apply their battle drills properly or risk the painful prospect of being peppered with paintballs - each of which leaves a bruise the size of a 20-cent coin.<br><br>He credited Mindef's Innovation Office, which helps fund ideas suggested by SAF servicemen, for helping to introduce the scheme.<br><br>The suggestion came from Lieutenant (NS) Shawn Fernando.<br><br>Now an engineer at Singapore Technologies Aerospace, he raised the idea with his superiors during his full-time national service when he was an OCS cadet.<br><br>The Mindef committee was bowled over by the suggestion and approved funding for 100 rifles, paintball ammunition and spares.<br><br>Officer Cadet Chen Jianping, from Foxtrot Wing OCS, said: 'Paintballs simulate gunfire much better than blanks because the projectiles coming your way force you to take cover.'<br><br>His fellow cadet Dennis Chia added that the pain of being hit helps drive home the battle skills they learn in the classroom.<br><br>He said: 'It reminds you of what to do and what not to do in battle.'<br><br>To demonstrate the benefits of paintball training, OCS arranged a shootout on Saturday between cadets from Foxtrot Wing and five operationally ready NSmen - including this reporter - who had not tried paintball before.<br><br>The NSmen who tested the new rifles for the first time all agreed paintball would inject greater realism into training.<br><br>Corporal (NS) Yip Chee Keen, an NSman from an armour battalion, said: 'It's an excellent training tool. Your mindset totally changes. When training with blanks, soldiers tend to just go through the motions.'<br><br>Corporal (NS) Sean Chua, who was hit several times during the shootout, added: 'When using blanks for training, we tended to walk here and there. The situation totally changes in a paintball shootout. You run instead of walk. You actually look for cover to protect you from incoming projectiles.'<br><br>- ENDS -</div>

Do you know how a building is imploded in all those videos done by professionals?? It takes weeks of preparatory work, planning, removing cladding, soft materials, weakening the interior walls (to prevent pockets) etc. Only in your dreams do you suggest blowing a building to remove the threat.

In fibua, that make it idea for enemy troops to use sniper tactics &amp; close quarter tactic together.

Also at 300m, a head size target is still clear enough to take aim.<br><br>Of course in most range, everyone will not go for the head, as they will go for the chest, so that it can cater for small mistakes. You will know who the good shooter is and who can get head shots, by the consistent grouping of rounds in the center of the chest. Those are the ones, that can get head shot if they want to.<br><br>At 300m, with my zeroed m16, I can easily get head shots. Frankly a lot of others also can do it.  We alway on the first day of range to new recruits, we alway put balloons at 300m and shoot them to demo that if you zeroed your M16 properly and learn to shoot correctly you can get a balloon which is a head size target even at 300m.  Alway others and me alway is one shot one balloon.<br></div>

Possible with that type of incorrect drilling, some soldiers will be even having a conference out in open thinking that at 200m or 300m people cannot shoot at them ( still thinking they are up against paintball).<br><br></div>
