Use another method - no one ever dare to do that again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">Night range ? because of headache then KNN right ?<br><br>Sometime this type of words does get fly out .... not that they really mean it. Just learn to let it go... just tell him in front of the everyone, if he have headache or problem - need help come to you, KNN is not going to cure the headache or problem . If he still think it does, then you give him your blessing and let him shout KNN 50 times infront of everyone  !!!  Problem resolve.<br><br>If he want to see MO ok,  good after the night range all go back camp - all ready to sleep. I make sure the poor guy get all the medical attention he need at the medical center - haha ... While other sleep, he is sitting there KNN himself for saying KNN and for having so good and caring commanders -  all the way waiting to see MO.  For the next few days .. he not much strength to KNN !!!</div>
