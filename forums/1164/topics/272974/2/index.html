            <div class='col-md body'>My reservist platoon was a very highly-motivated one.<br><br>And our PC was the reason.<br><br>And I am certain our platoon was not the isolated case. All throughout my service I have met many great officers and at the same time some really bad ones in SAF.<br><br>I'm sure we are no differrent from other armies. If anything, I would rate our officers WAY above those of armies in our neighbourhood.<br><br>Our only difference/problem is our lack of combat experience, which is also very important in making a good soldier/officer. And real substance will only reveal itself in battle.<br><br>Ultimately, how an officer is depends on his in-born character. Training cannot bring out what isn't already there in the first place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my NS time my men would follow me anytime and anywhere. I would also give my best for them but I dont think I would have dived on a grenade for them besides they all know how to throw grenades <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  but what I did was after every exercise and debiefing I would go back to my bunk and dive on my bed instead<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once at night range I asked the platoon to fall in for a head count.<br><br>I was only attached to that infantry unit for one ICT so we didn't know each other well.<br><br>One Hokkien Peng remained squatting down and when I (Cpl) asked him to stand up he told me to KNN and said he had a headache.<br><br>More or less the whole platoon heard him using bad language on me - a Sect Cmdr.<br><br>I was mad but let him be at that time.<br><br>...<br><br>Afterwards when everyone disperse I went up and jabbed him (not too hard) in the chest with my rifle butt and told him not to refer to parents when speaking. He was furious and surprised but did nothing.<br><br>He and a couple of his tattooed buddies look at me not shiok for the next few days afterwards but also did nothing.<br><br>I got on very well with the rest of the people especially the section under me and if this guy from another section doesn't like me, too bad.<br><br>I admit it was a bad move leadership-wise but I was furious at that time also. And to have done nothing would probably be even worse.<br><br>What would you have done?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well in most army that dude will be beaten and ordered to do a 5 mile run with combat gear....while it is arguable wether that is right or wrong... to let it slip is a mistake. Especially infront of other troops.</div>
