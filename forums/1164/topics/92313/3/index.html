            <div class='col-md body'>Just to clarify some of the misconception<br><br>ORD in 1995.........Armour Infantry........<br><br>During my time, 84 RR tube and GPMG team are part of the platoon orbat. They belong to the Platoon HQ.<br><br>Converted to Ultra vehicle in 1997 serving ICT till now.<br><br>This time, 84 are organic to the company HQ orbat liao. Sitting in the 2IC/CSM vehicle. Depending on the mission, the 84 team(commander, loader and gunner) can act independently (as a block force) or they can be attached to individual platoon.<br><br>My 2 cents worth.....</div>

Pzfaust 3-T come to mind, German replacement for their 84mm RR.<br><br></div>

There are ups and downs. You try doing fire movement with matador on your back lor.<br><br>84 is siong for the walking part, but they don't expect you to do fire movement with the 84. Most likely you'll move to the firebase and do some block mission while the section riflemen charge knolls and clear trenches.</div>

The damaged ship quickly moved away out of range.<br>ANTI-SHIP!!<br><br>Also, a Pucara turbo prop attack aircraft began to attack the guardsman, they fired an 84 airburst, it did not hit but scared the hell out of the pilot which withdrew immediatly.<br>ANTI-Aircraft!!!<br><br>This weapon is useful that the current US Rangers are using the fibreglass version which only weighs 7kg. But heard it will crack after a feww hundred rounds. Guess SAF always wants to make sure their investemnt last 30 years.<br><br>A one shot was also used now by the US army called the AT-4.

The tube itself is too heavy as is the ammo. And after firing it you have to quickly run as enemy will zero in on you. So the disposable option is actually an advantage. After shooting, throw it away and run.<br><br>The last time I served (8 years ago), these were the weapons available to the Battalion's Support Company:<br><br>Â• 84mm Recoiless Rifle<br>Â• 81mm mortar<br>Â• 7.62mm GPMG<br><br>I see your point about the 84mm being available as emergency arty.<br><br>But the Support Company more or less moves on foot during combat. Unless in static defence. So everything including the ammo is man-packed. The rounds for the 84mm are fairly large (and looks heavy) so I think maybe each 84mm team can carry 3 to 6 rounds per gun?<br><br>So you would carry maybe 3 rounds HE and 3 rounds HEAT? I don't know... But that's a little too few rounds to use the 84 as arty.<br><br>Besides, I think that's what the 81mm mortars are for.

In such a case, would you prefer more anti-tank or anti-personnel ammo?<br><br>I tend to think I would leave the anti-personnnel role to the 81mm mortars, if those are available.<br><br>For example, if one 84mm team can only carry 6 rounds of ammo, I would have 4 anti-tank rounds and 2 anti-personnel rounds. I won't go 50/50. Even if intel indicate there are no enemy armour present, you don't want to be suddenly counter-attacked by enemy tanks. If this should happen, the 84mm is the only effective weapon against enemy armour. The mortars and the LAW might not be as good. So if you didn't bring enough anti-tank ammo for your 84mm, all is lost.<br><br>Static defence means you have already established a strong point or beach head meaning you can sit in your trench with a ready supply of ammo for the 84mm. Then you can have a good mix of anti-tank and anti-personnel ammo.<br><br>But still, the main role for the 84mm should be anti-tank, not personnel.<br><br>I'm sorry but I do not understand your last para.
