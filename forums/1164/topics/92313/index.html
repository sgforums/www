            <div class='col-md body'>Developed jointly by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency (DSTA), in collaboration with Dynamit Nobel Defence (DND), the <strong>MATADOR (Man-portable Anti-Tank, Anti-DOoR)</strong> is a 90mm calibre man-portable <strong>disposable </strong>anti-armour weapon system which meets the needs of the modern battlefield, especially in an increasingly urbanised environment. The development of this weapon began in 2000 and the MATADOR will eventually <strong>replace the ARMBRUST Light Anti-tank Weapon </strong>which has been in service since the 1980s.<br><br>The MATADOR, which is <strong>among the lightest in its class</strong>, has both anti-armour and anti-brickwall capabilities that is suitable for operations in confined spaces. With its enhanced penetration capabilities, it is capable of defeating most known Armoured Personnel Carrier and Light Tanks in the world. The dual-capability warhead, when acting in the <strong>delay mode</strong>, creates an opening larger than 450mm diameter in a double brickwall and offers a non-conventional entry point for the soldier when fighting in built-up areas. The <strong>increased range </strong>of the MATADOR over the current ARMBRUST allows the soldier to engage targets beyond small arms effective range and therefore increasing the survivability of our soldiers.<br><br>The MATADOR's  innovative propulsion system results in a highly accurate weapon system whose projectile is insensitive to wind. Combined with ergonomic features and a high precision optical sight, the MATADOR can be <strong>fired from a small confined space </strong>to enhance our operational capabilities in both conventional and urban operations.<br><br>In the development of the weapon, our soldiersÂ’ feedback during ergonomics trials and many other useful features found in the ARMBRUST were incorporated in the design of the MATADOR.<br><br>The longer front grip handle prevents the soldier from misplacing his finger in front of the muzzle during firing, thereby eliminating the risk of injury. It also allows the soldier to rest the weapon on the ground, thus improving accuracy when maintaining a firing position. The foldable pistol grips allow the soldiers to lock the weapon, preventing accidental firing.<br><br>Field trials were conducted to tailor the position of the optical sight to the SAF soldiers. The chosen sight magnification provides the soldiers with good field of view to allow for more precise strike on target. The MATADOR is equipped with Picatinny rail for mounting night vision device for night operations. Improvements have also been made to the sighting system to enhance target acquisition.<br><br>The countermass counteracts the recoil of the weapon upon firing. In addition, the positioning of the countermass takes into consideration the centre of gravity of the weapon to ensure good balance for greater accuracy. A wider soft rubber sling replaced the conventional hard, slim canvas sling to reduce the stress on the soldierÂ’s shoulder due to prolonged slinging. The new sling also comes with a quick-release buckle to allow rapid switch from sling to firing position.<br><br>Furthermore, the carriage of the weapon has been made more comfortable with better padding, a feature useful for long route marches. As a whole, these easy-to-use features will help our soldiers achieve proficiency in using the weapon within the shortest possible time.<br><br>The MATADOR is a crucial step forward in the ArmyÂ’s journey to transform itself into a 3rd generation fighting force and will greatly enhance the <strong>firepower of the Infantry Formation</strong>. The Army will gain the added capability to fight in built-up areas. With the improvements to make the weapon user-friendly, our soldiers will find the weapon easy to operate and will spend less training time to achieve proficiency.<br><br>Technical Specifications<br><br>Calibre 90 mm<br>Weight of weapon 8.9 kg<br>Weight of projectile 2.6 kg<br>Length of weapon 1m<br>Muzzle velocity: 250 m/s<br>Flight time to 300m: 1.2 s<br>Temperature range: -40Â°C to +63Â°C<br><strong>Effective range: 500 m</strong><br>Firing from confined space &gt;15m3<br>Warhead Capability: HEAT or HESH mode<br><br>--iMINDEF</div>

There were numerous human factors trials involving our National Servicemen (NSmen) with the aim to improve the ergonomics of the weapon. In addition, many of the useful features found in the ARMBRUST were incorporated in MATADOR. Improvements have also been made to the sighting system to enhance target acquisition. Furthermore, the carriage of the weapon has been made more comfortable with better padding, a feature useful for long matches.
