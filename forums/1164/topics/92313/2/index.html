            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by arburthen?:</div><div class="quote_body">it may be old fashion but it reloadable unlike the LAW or matador, true it cannot penetrate MBT armor but light armor vehicles it still can handle.<br><br>It is also useful as a short range arty in situations when your arty cannot reach or the fighting is too close and intense for calling in arty without hitting your own troops then 84 comes in.<br><br>But as long as they have 2 per coy we will definately need to be carrying it. </div></blockquote>That it is reloadable is not an advantage. The tube itself is too heavy as is the ammo. And after firing it you have to quickly run as enemy will zero in on you. So the disposable option is actually an advantage. After shooting, throw it away and run.<br><br>The last time I served (8 years ago), these were the weapons available to the Battalion's Support Company:<br><br>Â• 84mm Recoiless Rifle<br>Â• 81mm mortar<br>Â• 7.62mm GPMG<br><br>I see your point about the 84mm being available as emergency arty.<br><br>But the Support Company more or less moves on foot during combat. Unless in static defence. So everything including the ammo is man-packed. The rounds for the 84mm are fairly large (and looks heavy) so I think maybe each 84mm team can carry 3 to 6 rounds per gun?<br><br>So you would carry maybe 3 rounds HE and 3 rounds HEAT? I don't know... But that's a little too few rounds to use the 84 as arty.<br><br>Besides, I think that's what the 81mm mortars are for. It can also reach people hiding in trenches, the 84 cannot.<br><br>If you are talking about busting strong points like bunkers then the rifle section's 66mm LAW is good enough.<br><br>So I think that with the 90mm disposable LAW available at 2 per section,<br>the 84mm is redundant. They should replace the 84mm with more effective portable ATGWs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think none of what I'm about to say is classified, so here goes...<br><br>Mine is a PDF unit. So in my battalion we have 4 companies: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta. Delta is the Support Company where A, B &amp; C companies consists of ordinary sections and platoons of riflemen.<br><br>In A, B &amp; C companies we have 3 sections of 7 -9 men in each platoon armed only with M-16, M-203, SAW, LAW and grenades. Nothing else.<br><br>In D company they are armed with GPMG, 84mm and 81mm mortar. Often, Support company personnel are attached to the various platoons but they are not administered as part of our platoon strength.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think we will replace the 84mm RR with the AGL.

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a lot of confusion....<br><br>In the past,  the GPMGs and 84s are part of the support platoon in a infantry section. But they "pushed" the GPMGs to the platoon-level.<br><br>The 84mm Section is still company level support, not a Bn level support.<br><br>I think a breakdown can be seen below:<br>GPMG - Platoon<br>84mm RR- Company<br>81mm Mortar- Bn<br>ATGW - Bn<br>155mm HW/105mm LG/120mm Mortar - Brigade<br><br>In the UK (1982-Falklands), They have a support company in each Bn and they are armed with 81mm Mortars and Milan ATGW.<br><br>In a US (light-infantry), it is probably TOW and 81mm Mortars.<br><br>This is probably quite similar to a setup to the SAF.<br><br>i am not surprised that there are a wide variation in the SAF based on feedback. there are rapid changes in doctrine and setup. I guess some units just evolved slower then others. Also because of roles, I gues PDF units will probably have different setup then the rest.<br><br>As for the AGL, I thinkthey will probably fit into a Bn-level support weapon in the support company.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just want to add my view here:<br><br>Matador LAW :<br>1) Against thin skinned &amp; light armoured veh(IFV , light tank).<br><br>2) No tandem warhead, thus ineffective against ERA armoured veh.<br><br>3) Penetration is at least 450mm RHA as reported, Pzfaust 3 has a cone penetration ratio  of 6.36, so Matador could have penetration up to 572mm RHA, since both rocket technology are from the same company.( my guessitimate)<br><br>4) Secondary anti bunker role and able to fire from confined space.<br><br>5) Effective range 400m<br><br>Additional info is where I have posted in the new forum.<br><br>84mmRR:<br>84 has many kind of ammunitions , thus it is quite muliti purpose, below are the interesting one.<br><br>1)FFV-751 Tandem-HEAT could penetrates 500mm behind ERA, thus effective against ERA armoured AFV.<br><br>2) FFV441 is a HE Sharpnel round, useful in a "lobbed" trajectory to 1,000m, which can be fused to fire on impact or airburst.<br><br>3) FFV502 is a dual-use HEDP round for anti bunker role.<br><br>In conclusion , the 84mm is more multi purpose and have  much longer range than the Matador, especially the Tandem warhead which is effective against ERA thus much more effective AT weapon as compare to Matador. New warhead are still being developed for this weapon.<br><br>Currently, the Spike/Milan(depending on unit) are our dedicated ATGM system against MBT, the missile are much more costly,therefore for multi purpose role, our 84 will be much more cost-effective.<br><br>ST has developed the 14 kg SLWAGL is light enough for infantry personnel to operate. It could be deployed as another coy level support weapon as a two men portable weapon system.<br>With AMBS it could air bursting capability.<br><br><img src="http://www.stengg.com/upload/77VBWRXbB8ag01B3oe.gif"><br><br></div>
