Because you need precision intelligence to drop precision munitions. And a lot of our precision intelligence assets are currently being used in the Gulf region," he said.<br><br>Precision weapons also are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> which means that commanders in a second theater might have to rely more on unguided "dumb bombs," he said.</span><br><br>"So you end up with more collateral damage. You end up more like a World War II, Korean War campaign," he said.<br><br>"That's not predictive," he added. "I'm just saying that, on a scale, you're going to have to use more brute force to get the job done."</strong><br><br>Tensions with<br>North Korea have sharpened since it tested a nuclear weapon for the first time October 7. It also tested a long-range ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States on July 4-5, but the test failed.<br><br>The United States has relied on diplomacy in dealing with North Korea, marshalling international support for sanctions to pressure Pyongyang into giving up its nuclear ambitions.<br><br>Pace said the North Koreans "have not raised or lowered any particular parts of their (military) readiness to cause any kind of alarm."<br><br>"What is not knowable is the intent of the leadership in North Korea to use or not use that power at any given time," he said. "And applying western logic to the leadership in Korea is not something that I would personally want to bet my future on."</blockquote><img src="http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20061025/capt.sge.fhc08.251006135612.photo00.photo.default-512x377.jpg?x=180&amp;y=132&amp;sig=o5GSfuLc85u9iuVssm3YUg--"><br>Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff US Marine Corps Gen.

If that's the fact, at face value, why are there hundreds Thousands of dead Civilians ? and How many were injured ??<br><br>The reason is that there were more, much more, dumb bombs, arty, mortar and chemical based weapons used than 'Precision Bombs'.. how many did they used ? 3 thousand.. 5 Thousands ?? Compare to the amount of dumb munitions used, the precision bomb's the qty is very small.

Rather, it is a bolt-on wing adapter kit (with flip-out swept wings) that extends the range and provides autonomous guidance for existing air-to-surface munitions such as cluster, general-purpose and laser-guided bombs, sea mines or tactical munitions dispensers. Using internationally standard 14-inch wing ejector racks, it needs no hardware or software modifications to the launch aircraft (air-launched tests have been conducted on an F-16). It can be deployed at altitudes up to 12,200m and can provide a stand off of up to 110km, so reducing the host aircrafts exposure to point defence systems. Upon launch it guides the munition to its target using Global Positioning System (GPS) inertial navigation.</blockquote>2.<strong> Lockheed Martin Corporation LONGSHOT</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/images/longshot-pic1.jpg"><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/longshot.htm" rel="nofollow">LongShot<br><br>Leigh Aerosystems of Carlsbad, CA has developed the LongShot guidance and range-extension package for a variety of "dumb" munitions.......</a></strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/findPage.do?dsp=fec&amp;ci=13776&amp;rsbci=13001&amp;fti=0&amp;ti=0&amp;sc=400" rel="nofollow">LongShot is a registered trademark of Lockheed Martin Corporation.</a></strong><br><img src="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/data/assets/1285.jpg"><br><br>3.pl post images of AA 2002 here and quick.<br><br>4.so now can confirm ST is really making but may be under license.<br><blockquote><a href="http://www.stengg.com/pressroom/press_releases_read.aspx?paid=230" rel="nofollow"><br><br>Unmanned Systems<br>Others<br><br>* Micro Aerial Vehicles<br><strong> * LongShotTM</strong><br>* Spike - anti-tank guided missile </a></blockquote>--- ST Engg Showcases Latest Products and Capabilities at AA2002<br>http://www.stengg.com/pressroom/press_releases_read.aspx?paid=230<br>Date Published : 25/02/2002<br><br>i assume TM stands for Trade Mark,most likely belong to Lockeed Martin.<br>Pl read above info.</div>
