Malaysia and Singapore water talks (50% of Singapore's water needs is supplied by Malaysia) bog down and there is this ill feeling meanwhile there is this young gungho Commander of a Singapore warship the the RSS Battleaxe guarding the territorial waters off Pedro Branca, also on his mind is his impending divorce where he is going to lose his HDB flat to his wife all because he had a one night stand. This is nagging him constantly, meaning he is not in the correct frame of mind.Along comes KD Hang Lekir, a corvette on orders by the Defence Minister to permanently station it in the waters off Pedro Branca,<br>due to the failure of the water talks. Guns and radar are on 'active stations'. The Singapore Commander gets a report that there is a signature on the radar of a fast moving large vessel, orders 'action stations'. The commander of Hang Lekir, gets a report that guns are locked onto his vessel, he orders counter measures and simultaneously ranges on the Singapore vessel.<br><br>RSS Battleaxe's Commander misinterprets this as hostile<br>action and elevates status to 'battle stations'. Commander of RMN Hang Lekir is on the hotline to fleet operations, which in turn turns to MINDEF, Chief of Defence Forces, responds placing all forces on a high alert.<br><br>What does this mean ? It means jets are scrambled to have an air defence capability, with jets on tarmacs waiting to take off. These events are monitored by Singapore's E2C-Hawkeye aircraft, they alert Singapore's MINDEF. Meanwhile the drama on the high seas is unfolding, commander of KD Hang Lekir is told not to engage unless fired upon, the RSS Battleaxe is a FAC(Fast Attack Craft) with<br>20mm Bofors opens fire on KD Hang Lekir, this corvette, one of the most modern is South East Asia can simultaneously engage targets under the sea, on the surface and air. The commander, to defend a strategic asset from being destroyed and who also who wants to become rear-admiral before the age of 38, orders launch of<br>a ship to ship missile. The RSS Battleaxe is no more. The wife of the Commander of RSS Battleaxe will definitely get the HDB flat. All these is observed by the E2C and reported.<br><br>MINDEF gets radio stations to announce codes for mobilization.<br>The Malaysian electronic counter counter measures unit gets to pick up this information and passes it along.\Goh, gets on the hotline and calls Dr.M, accusing him of sinking a Singapore warship, Dr. M retorts that it was the Singapore ship that fired first. They continue arguing. Meanwhile, the strategic division is ordered to move to Johore, which it has rehearsed countless times times and played the game against a Southern enemy. Malaysian airdefence radars (Marconi- Martello Systems) picks up fast moving<br>aircraft intruding into Malaysian airspace. All jets at Butterworth, Kuantan and Subang are scrambled, whilst the jets in East Malaysia are placed on alert, with Malaysian AWACs monitoring airspace in Taiwan and areas south of the Borneo island, for Singapore's reserve jet fighters coming in to join the fight. Simultaneously looking for Singapore's airtankers to be destroyed, before they refuel the RSAF jets coming in from Australia, Taiwan and<br>the US. Many aircraft go down, Singapore's and Malaysia's, there is air parity. Malaysian fighters manage to penetrate into<br>Singapore airspace and destroy 2 KC-130 tankers and 2 Stratotankers<br>diminishing Singapore's air to air refuelling capability.<br><br>Malaysian naval ships and submarines scatter to sink and destroy Singapore's navy and merchant navy, concentrating near the straits of Tebrau, as there is air parity. The airborne brigade is ordered to conduct a linkup operation along the Mersing, Layang-Layang, JB line. The Army units in JB are ordered to defend JB, the Tebrau straits is flooded with napalm, benzine, and crude at likely<br>footholds for the Singaporeans. Singapore's Guards regiments which are heliborne will have to reckon with the Malaysian airborne at all strategic routes which it has to secure for it's armoured formations along three axis led by T-90 tanks. Kota Tinggi-Jemaluang-Mersing, Layang-Layang-Rengam-Keluang and JB-Air Hitam-Yong Peng.<br>The defence of these axis has been done numerous times by Malaysian troops on exercises. Meanwhile special forces snipers armed with 12.7 mm rifles will go into hides to take out Singaporean armour at a range of 1.5 km with armour piercing rounds.<br><br>Air defence batteries are deployed, with shoulder held anti-aircraft missiles (Starburst systems, Iglas and Jernas). The Malaysian armoured and mechanized formations will race to link up with the airborne. Singapore needs to cross the straits to get its troops across, heavy casualties are inflicted, Malaysians fall back to conduct a delaying and mobile defence, all these are covered by air<br>and artillery. Malaysians have trained year in year out to march in full combat gear over 40 kms in under 10 hours and construct fire trenches with overhead protection within 8 hours. Laying of obstacles comes next, it is actually a breeze considering the terrain one is familiar with. Independent and co-ordinated tank hunting parties will be sent out. The Singapore advance bogs down at Muar. The US cannot come running, as it is bogged down<br>in Afghanistan and Iraq. Guerilla war by Malaysian units are conducted at the rear echelons of the already very stretched Singapore supply lines, who also face a very hostile populace.<br><br>Its probably at this stage that the diplomats, and the UN<br>will come into play....... This is the otherside of a war scenario, to be more detailed will make this long and probably boring. There is always another side to a coin. End result, there will be two LOSERS, for generations to come. Let us all live in peace, no doubt there will be friction, brothers and sisters have misunderstandings, that does not mean we have to come to blows.<br><br>Anyway Singapore is no Israel.<br><br></blockquote></div>

I think Sg is one most dense in term AD per sq km in the world.<br><br>And another thing , what AWACs from MAF? they talk abt it but hasn't ordered them yet. Until they ordered them then I would believe they will get it. The Malaysians tend talk a lots but no action.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup... this is some sick fantasy...<br><br>but for the sake of making it interesting:<br>1.  does anyone here really think we will go to war?<br>2.  fight over what? water, pedra branca, railway land, economics?<br>3.  who is likely to come out of the fight stronger? (assuming both r 'losers').<br>4.  will u fight for singapore?<br><br>personally, i rather focus on the economy and making money.  but if we have to fight then my guess is probably be over water and territorial issues.  assuming we only have to deal with malaysia, i think SAF will come out stronger, but anything can happen rite? who knows? scarly lose, how?<br><br>fight? rite now, behind my keyboard and monitor, i can say will fight. but if button kenna press.... who knows?  anything can happen rite?</div>

If this is their battleplan, we can just wait out and let them kill themselves off with their brilliant ideas.<br><br><blockquote>Malaysians have trained year in year out to march in full combat gear over 40 kms in under 10 hours and construct fire trenches with overhead protection within 8 hours.</blockquote>Great, I assume Malaysians have ubersodats as well? Apparently they have lost out on an idea called mechnizied warfare. Apparently this assumptions also factor in the idea that Singapore arty will nicely hold off them while they prepare their positions.<br><br><blockquote>Laying of obstacles comes next, it is actually a breeze considering the terrain one is familiar with. </blockquote>Wow, familiar terrain equals breeze of laying obstacles... Maybe they should ask the Ruskies at stalingrad if familiarity of terrain makes foxeholes easier to dig? Maybe those obstacles will prepare themselves? Oh yah, Singapore will nicely allow them to prepare without harrasing them as well.<br><br><blockquote>Many aircraft go down, Singapore's and Malaysia's, there is air parity. </blockquote>A neat assumption, and one the author makes with crossed fingers which is the only weak assumption allowing this entire story to hold up. I supposed if he was slightly partial and did his homework, he would realize that the air battle would favour Singapore... by a rather large margin. And of course, with air superiority, we can easily see how the weight of the "story" is gonna change.<br><br><blockquote> Malaysian fighters manage to penetrate into<br>Singapore airspace and destroy 2 KC-130 tankers and 2 Stratotankers</blockquote>Another nice, prescripted trigger event to allow his story to move along easier. Let me try my hand at one:<br><br>"Iraqi assasins manage to penetrate into the White House and kill George W. Bush. Without his tyrannical infidel leadership, the Americans are crushed in iraq"<br><br><blockquote><br>Malaysian naval ships and submarines scatter to sink and destroy Singapore's navy and merchant navy, concentrating near the straits of Tebrau, as there is air parity. </blockquote>Working on the previous assumption of air parity, Malaysian navy achieve automatic sucess and dish out tons of punishment on Singapore navy, which willingly submits to their patrotic firepower.<br><br><blockquote> Independent and co-ordinated tank hunting parties will be sent out. The Singapore advance bogs down at Muar. </blockquote>Once again, automatic sucess is assumed. Maybe if he was polish, he would write this:<br><br>"Independent and co-ordinated horse calvary tank hunters are sent out. Nazi advance bogs down at Warsaw...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> "<br><br>Pls, and what does independent and co-ordinated imply anyway? Does it have any bearing on his point? More like a use of glossy language to sound professional.<br><br><blockquote>The US cannot come running, as it is bogged down<br>in Afghanistan and Iraq. </blockquote>It can't come running, but it can sure santion your pants off... something Dr. M would probably think about before ordering this macho patrotic war.<br><br><blockquote>This is the otherside of a war scenario, to be more detailed will make this long and probably boring. There is always another side to a coin. </blockquote>Heh, to be more detailed would be to expose the obvious logical flaws in this seneriao... As I have pointed out.<br><br>Nuff said, I think I am flogging a dead horse. Few free to point out your own logical errors in this little story.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Here here! Let me try my hand at creating an improbabble Malaysian Boleh (tm.) war scenario...<br><br>Allow me to emulate a war scenario. Malaysia (Of course malaysia must come first) and Israel conspiracy talks to end the jweish conspiracy (80% of the world is controlled by the jewish conspiracy) bog down and there is this ill feeling (SARS?) meanwhile there's this commander of IDF Fictious guarding the territotial waters off Palestine (there's no such thing called Israel!), also on his mind, his impending shabat night with his buddies where he might have to forgo because of his military duty. This is nagging him constantly, meaning he is not in the correct frame of mind (convient way of making them fire the first shot against us peace loving malaysians).<br><br>Along comes KD Malyeu Boleh, a new Malaysian Iowa-class like battleship capable of 50 knots with 20 inch guns by native genius malaysian design on orders by the Defence Minister to permantly station it off the waters of palestine. Due to the failure of conspiracy talks, guns and radar are on 'active stations' (in defiance of internationally reconized marinetime conventions to make war more likely to break out via human error to allow Malaysian patrotic military might to shine). The Jewish Commander gets a report that there is a signature of a very fast vessle, orders 'action stations'. The commander of Malyeu Bagus, gets a report that guns are locked onto his vessel (from the writer apparently), he orders unspecified counter measures that have unspecified effects but just thought it would look professional and cool and simultaneously rangest on the Jewish vessel, which for some reason is not doing any counter measures and coming in dumb and blind, but then again, they are not Patrotic Malaysians...<br><br>IDF Fictious' Commander (conviently) misinterprets this as hostile action and elevates status to 'battle stations'. Everybody is alerted.<br><br>What does this mean? Common sense and logic are overwritten by nationistic patrotic malaysian writer to make commanders of both sides get ready for war. IAF scrambles jets from palestine (remember Israel does not exist) and the IDF Fictious accelerates to attack speed, opening with .50cal machine guns on the 23inch sidebelt armour of the Malyeu Boleh. The commander, to defend a stragetic asset of Malaysian national pride and world winning dominance from being destroyed, orders the battleship to ram the puny Israeli ship at 50+ knots and the Fictious is no more. Looks like the Jewish commander's buddies will have to hold shabbat night without him. The Malyeu Boleh's deadily special 12.7mm AA shoots down all the 20 IAF aircraft from 1.5 km. All this is observed by the Jews and reported, where they plan their conspiracy for revenge against the righteous patrotic malaysians.<br><br>But their conspiracy has been picked up by the electronic counter counter counter counter counter (the more counters makes it seem cooler) warfare unit, and passes it along. The Malaysian PM, which has no idea what is the gibberish on the report being present to him by his ECCCCCW unit but though it would be cool to pretend he did anyway orders a pre-emptive operation called Palestine Freedom to raid the place of the Jews.<br><br>First in is the brave Malaysian airforce, while not as well equipped or good in quality as the IAF, are equipped with the almighty Plot Device (tm.), Trigger Events (tm.) Nationistic Patrotic Fevor (tm.) Malaysian Boleh Spirit (tm.) Writer Bias (tm.) and against all odds and logical storytelling, manage to force air parity over palestine. Several MAF jets even manage to penetrate Jewish airspace and destroy many of their tankers, AWACS and targets that would make Malaysia look cool. Diminshing Jewish military capability.<br><br>Malaysian naval ships and submarines scatter to sink and destroy Jewish navy and merchant shipping (they are part of the Jewish conspiracy), and along with their marines from LSTs and airborne units, start the liberation of palestine. Jewish army responds but have to reckon with Malaysia units at all stragetic routes, which it has to secure it's armoured formations. Meanwhile, independent and co-ordinated tank hunting units go out to kill Jewish armour and special forces snipers armed with 12.7mm rifles which we wrote into existence, will go into hides to take out Jewish Merkavas at a range of 1.5km with Malaysian AP rounds which the rest of the world does not have but only we do because we thought of it.<br><br>Meanwhile, Malaysians which have trained year in and year out to in their pilgrimages to palestine, will have no problem marching hundreds of miles in full combat gear supported by the almighty writer enabled plot device which ensures that the enemy cannot hurt them during their long, linear march and will generally turn a blind eye to this development. Due to familarity with the terrain, obsticales and combat engineering gets +80 percent effectiveness and Jewish tricks and traps are easily overcome.<br><br>Jewish occupiers take heavy losses and withdraw with a mobile defence but MAF patrotic power will not let them go so easily. US cannot run to help as for some reason it must be tied up in Afganistan and Iraq and will pay no heeds to the developments. Nuclear weapons of Israel are disabled and captured by Malaysian Special forces who manage to penetrate their lines.<br><br>Before long, palestine is rid of the Jewish people and the world is freeded of their conspiracy. Lacking them, America collaspes and dissolves, followed by the western world. The world is now ruled by Arabs and Malaysia is held in world wide fear and reverence and admitted into the Arab league. The next era has begun as Dr. M, back from retirement now rules most of the world from the White House. The Jewish people are kept where they are safe, scattered along the nations of the earth.</div>
