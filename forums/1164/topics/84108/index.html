            <div class='col-md body'>KNN.... i think a summary execution is in order for whichever idiot who started us on this gas power thingy.....<br><br>Blackout hits many areas after gas supply failure<br>By Woon Wui Tek<br><br>FROM about 10pm last night, a quickly spreading blackout plunged many parts of Singapore into darkness.<br><br>Darkness falls over Jurong East and even traffic slowed down, as street lamps and traffic lights also went out. -- WONG KWAI CHOW<br>Not just home lights, but street lamps and traffic signals winked out, causing traffic in Hougang and Sengkang to slow to a crawl as half-blinded motorists switched on their high beams.<br><br>Other anxious Singaporeans, thumbing their mobile phones as they wondered if there had been a terrorist-related disruption, only jammed the networks.<br><br>As it turned out, the blackout, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) said, was caused by a disruption of the supply of natural gas from neighbouring Indonesia.<br><br>It did not elaborate.<br><br>Restoration of power got under way almost at once, with generators switching to diesel: By 10.30pm, the darkness was beginning to be pushed back in places like Bishan.<br><br>Clementi and Sengkang went bright again at about 10.45pm and Eunos at around 11pm. By 12.15am, according to Singapore Power, power had been restored in all areas.<br><br>Though one taxi crashed in Queensway, police officers took to the streets to regulate traffic, while land lines in homes and train services were never affected.<br><br>Recalled Singapore MRT spokesman Chin Yen Yen: 'The first thing I did when my house in Bukit Batok had a blackout was look out to see if our trains were still running, and they were! We have back-up power for our trains.'<br><br>However, the Singapore Civil Defence Force responded to 20 calls of people trapped in lifts.<br><br>Some of those marooned in darkness at home, like Singapore Netball Association president Ivy Singh-Lim, 55, feared the worst.<br><br>She told The Straits Times from her Neo Tiew Road home: 'I tried calling the Neighbourhood Police Post on a 1800 number as well as 999, but all the lines were engaged.<br><br>'Actually, the police should have some kind of a backup to handle such emergencies.<br><br>'I can't believe this!'<br><br>So widespread was the blackout - it also hit Ang Mo Kio, Clementi, Woodlands, Toa Payoh, Serangoon and Ghim Moh, as well as the Holland Village and Mohamed Sultan Road leisure spots - that only a few areas, including Yishun and parts of the south, escaped.<br><br>Last night's was the third such significant incident this year, with the most recent one, lasting about 20 minutes, having been triggered on April 20, after the Nicoll Highway collapse. A week earlier, 80,000 households had to go without power for an hour.<br><br>In August 2002, a gas-supply disruption from Indonesia was also blamed for a 90-minute blackout after seven of Singapore's nine gas-fired generating plants shut down.<br><br>The Energy Market Authority may fine a company up to $1 million, or 10 per cent of its revenue, for negligence.<br><br>Its licence can even be revoked.<br><br>A cracking of the whip would suit the likes of an irate Madam Daisy Sum, who had to take a cold shower in candlelight in her Siglap home.<br><br>She said: 'Singapore is not a Third World country. We have every right to expect better.'<br><br>But others made the best of the blackout: Student Annabelle Danker, 22, and her friends at Holland Village lit up the night with sparklers and glow sticks.<br><br>'We can't go home anyway, so we might as well have some fun,' she said.<br><br></div>
