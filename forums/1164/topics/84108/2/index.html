By 12.15am, according to Singapore Power, power had been restored in all areas.<br><br>Though one taxi crashed in Queensway, police officers took to the streets to regulate traffic, while land lines in homes and train services were never affected.<br><br>Recalled Singapore MRT spokesman Chin Yen Yen: 'The first thing I did when my house in Bukit Batok had a blackout was look out to see if our trains were still running, and they were! We have back-up power for our trains.'<br><br>However, the Singapore Civil Defence Force responded to 20 calls of people trapped in lifts.<br><br>Some of those marooned in darkness at home, like Singapore Netball Association president Ivy Singh-Lim, 55, feared the worst.<br><br>She told The Straits Times from her Neo Tiew Road home: 'I tried calling the Neighbourhood Police Post on a 1800 number as well as 999, but all the lines were engaged.<br><br>'Actually, the police should have some kind of a backup to handle such emergencies.<br><br>'I can't believe this!'<br><br>So widespread was the blackout - it also hit Ang Mo Kio, Clementi, Woodlands, Toa Payoh, Serangoon and Ghim Moh, as well as the Holland Village and Mohamed Sultan Road leisure spots - that only a few areas, including Yishun and parts of the south, escaped.<br><br>Last night's was the third such significant incident this year, with the most recent one, lasting about 20 minutes, having been triggered on April 20, after the Nicoll Highway collapse. A week earlier, 80,000 households had to go without power for an hour.<br><br>In August 2002, a gas-supply disruption from Indonesia was also blamed for a 90-minute blackout after seven of Singapore's nine gas-fired generating plants shut down.<br><br>The Energy Market Authority may fine a company up to $1 million, or 10 per cent of its revenue, for negligence.<br><br>Its licence can even be revoked.<br><br>A cracking of the whip would suit the likes of an irate Madam Daisy Sum, who had to take a cold shower in candlelight in her Siglap home.<br><br>She said: 'Singapore is not a Third World country. We have every right to expect better.'<br><br>But others made the best of the blackout: Student Annabelle Danker, 22, and her friends at Holland Village lit up the night with sparklers and glow sticks.<br><br>'We can't go home anyway, so we might as well have some fun,' she said.<br><br></div></blockquote>Sometimes I think the press talk too much, I'm not against free press but they shud just tone it down bcus we're not the only ones looking at the news, the terrorist too are looking at it and it might suddenly give them some new idea of what to do with their free time.<br><br>I particularly didn't like one of the recent stories published recently abt how to make 'dirty' bombs using commercially available equipment like components from smoke detectors, I think that was too much.</div>
