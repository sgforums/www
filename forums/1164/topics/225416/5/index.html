I believe it was to another poster who was saying that the weapon was unreasonably heavy when after all the data has been gathered... turned out to be mostly an illusion.

Given that was answered to that poster (not you) said that probably had no use at all except in very 'special circumstances'. And of course, the pictures demostrate quite clearly that being exposed by "fooling around" with the LAD (which is your point) apparently isn't a serious problem in the armies that are using it.<br><br>Going by the same thread, but I could certainly grab more pictures of our troops using the old SBO then the new LBV, and use that to booster the suggestion that the LBV is for 'special circumstances' while the SBO is for the normal grunt. Of course trends are not leaning that way at all.<br><br>One much know how to distinguish between the synthetic logical points in the issue (the arguments behind debunking the LAD criticisms) and the supportive evidence (pictures to support the point). I could probably pull up more pictures of troops without body armour but if I try to use it as an argument that this means going without body armour is inherently better I would be somewhat mistaken.<br><br>At the end of the day, all arguments considered can we conclude that the LAD is a USEFUL and EFFECTIVE piece of equipment for the soldier? Does it give him MORE tatical options then one who is without?<br><br>I believe so, Yes. In that case then it's kinda hard to dismiss it's addition in the SAR-21.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by moca:</div><div class="quote_body">Wow, you mean this weapon is gonna win wars for us? Or just another one of your fantastic speculations?</div></blockquote>LOL, it would actually serve this discussion a lot better if you actually answered by points instead of answering with <span style="font-style: italic;">ad hominem </span> one liner.<br><br>As to answer if this is speculation? I think it's pure logic.<br><br>Winning wars? That's your assumption not mine, not to mention deviating from the ACTUAL point of the issue:<br><br>Simply put, all things in skill, tatics and training considered being equal... is not the SAR-equipped unit presented with more options and capabilities then one that is equipped with the M-16S1? Would they not have distinct advantages that would allow them to exploit the battlespace then if they were equipped with the old system?<br><br>Perhaps I need to put it in terms that would be less inflammatory to you: if two similar units go into a battle, one equipped with a bolt-action civilian 5.56mm rifles and the other with the M-16Â… which unit has the tactical advantage? Which unit has more options open to them? Which unit has more freedom to employ different tatics and ways of fighting in their battlespace? Is that not an option any grunt, commander, general or army would reconize as more then "fantastic speculations" and want to take?<br><br>Back to the questionÂ… who has the empirical tactical advantage? The SAR-21 equipped soldier or the M-16S1? While some "old timers" may decry the features of the LAD and scope and all that other "modern" stuff... when you get down on the ground you realize you still aren't going to magically do all the things you could do with the SAR but not with the M-16.<br><br>How does that translate into battle?<br><br>Winning wars? That's another question for another thread... but to ask a relevant question... is the SAF better off equipping it's grunts with SAR-21s or keeping with the M-16S1? In war is not a SAR-21 unit far more effective then an M-16S1 unit? In the end would it not translate to more of our guys surviving and completing the mission and getting in more effective fire at the enemy?<br><br>Win wars for us? You seem to have misread me. I am merely arguing the rather obvious point that a more effective weapon quite obviously improves the effectiveness of it's soldiers, which in the end is important in a war.<br><br>Did the M1 Garand win the war for the US Army? Debatable. But were they better off then if they went into it with the M1903 Springfield which it replaced? All things considered I think that's much clearer.</div>

To balance it out I came across one fogged M-16 sharpshooter scope as well. I donÂ’t think soÂ… unless you are really saying that thereÂ’s an inherent ability for all scopes to fog.<br><br><blockquote> has a small sight picture</blockquote>What exactly do you mean by a Â“small sight picture?Â” Are you making this from the rather obvious fact that if you have a scope with magnification you will get a smaller field of view? Is this really a disadvantage considering the scope can be used with both eyes open and the fact that the magnification is also an aid to aiming?<br><br><blockquote> slower target acquisition</blockquote>Erm where you get your info from? Slower target acquisition happens only when the scope exceeds the threshold for the human brain to reconcile the differing magnifications (3X and above). 1.5X became a popular magnification because it augmented the natural vision of the shooter while leaving it possible for his to use the sight with both eyes open. In this case target acquisition with such a battle scope is actually faster then your traditional iron sights. The ultimate in target acquisition speed would be in the realm of unmagnified red dot sights and LADs, but thatÂ’s another discussion.<br><br>This is proven empirically on the range esp. on challenging fig 15 targets where the shooter rests with both eyes open, one viewing through the scope.<br><br><blockquote> (which makes the LAD indispensable),</blockquote>See above. Apparently the makers of the Styer Aug who use a similar 1.5x, fogging, slower target acquisition scope system are making a big mistake by not adding the LAD. Sorry, IÂ’m afraid you are quite wrong.<br><br><blockquote> tunnel vision.</blockquote>Hint, as my Warrant Officer would say to us while teaching us the weapon: Â“Open both your eyes genius!Â” Some shooters are unable to align a proper sight picture with both eyes open on iron sights, the scope has no such issue.<br><br><blockquote> I said that I would prefer iron sights to the SAR-21 scope.</blockquote>Not knocking your preference, but given the Â“knowledgeÂ” you demonstrated on the scope I can see why you would prefer iron sights.<br><br><blockquote><br>Add to that the bad location of certain functional switches...<br><br>And yet, you are defending it like it is already perfect.</blockquote>Would you like to elaborate on the empirical combat implications of this functional switch? Or is it more smoke then fire? I did not deny the switch could be improved, but pointed out that itÂ’s hardly a fatal flaw to the weapon to another user who thought that it was a massive issue. In fact I explicitly stated my preference for the switch to be improved if I had my way.<br><br>Am I defending it like itÂ’s already perfect? I merely stated out what are the things you can do with this rifle and separated the chaff from the wheat in many of the issues pertaining to it. It is my opinion that in many areas the weapon has an undeservedly bad reputation stemming more likely from the pessimistic and negatively skewed opinions of certain posters rather then it being actual fact.<br><br>And in fact have drawn up certain examples why this is so through the rather legitimate means of logic, evidence, and personal experience with the thing. I am not even trying to dominate this debate given that when you post something that I obviously have a reply to; it would be incumbent to reply. If it appears that I am dominating this debate (if it ever even was one to begin with), it is more probably because some people actually bother taking the effort to adopt a proper position based on facts then shoot from the hip with a hastily assembled list of Â“argumentsÂ” drawn from thin air and ridden to the death.<br><br>Given in another thread a certain poster can pop in a post in the midst of some rather level headed discussion that the M1s the Aussies are getting are "oversized, over-weight and over-stated" and leave it at thatÂ… I am not exactly surprised to see the same act context-bending here.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hence for the sake of keeping the peace and topic on productive track here, and the likelihood that we are possibly arguing over many things that we might actually be in agreement with. Can we the parties involved cut out the more grandiose and irrelevant details (such as 200SGD per ICT hence scopes are redundant for me and M1 Garands being an advantage over the Springfield and picture grabbing) and state the core trusts of their respective opinions here?<br><br>I would state my own as such (and note they are not all directed for moca):<br><br>1)Much of the poor reputation of the SAR-21 that crops up in discussion is often undeserved, once the facts have been considered.<br><br>2)The weight of the weapon cannot be considered to be excessive, all things about the rifle factored in. The utility of these features are another thing.<br><br>3)The 1.5X scope of the SAR-21 offers improved target acquisition and engagement capabilities to the soldier over the previous iron sight system, allowing otherwise poor shooters to engage their targets and good shooters to perform at higher efficiency.<br><br>4)The utility of the LAD in the battle rifle has been proven conclusively in combat experience. ItÂ’s inclusion on the SAR-21 is not certainly not frivolous and gimmickry and in competent hands is a valuable tactical tool.<br><br>5)The weapon offers several key advantages over the M-16S1 in terms of marksmanship and tactical opinions. It also represents a significant improvements for the user in FIBUA operations, reliability. All these, factored in obviously add to the lethality and survivability of the user in the battlespace.<br><br>6)Priority key improvements that could be made to the system include the provision for the P-Rail variant as the standard variant of the SAR, hence unfortunately/fortunately rendering most of the bickering here moot to begin with <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> In the LAD, additional options should be added to give IR capabilities as standard issue. Additionally, more complex backup iron sights should be provided to extend the utility of these sights to become a fully functional iron sight, as opposed to the current backup sights which can be reliably used up to 100 meters. The scope should be optimised for use in the tropics (dust cover, mud guard).<br><br>Provision for a hand-situated, ergonomic fire selector is also preferable. And as an afterthought the ability to accept C-mags and standard NATO metal magazines.<br><br>There you have it.<br><br>My personal preferences for my variant of the SAR-21 is:<br><br>Â’20 inch barrel (the little edge in ballistic performance might save your butt).<br>P-Rail<br>LAD with IR capacity<br>Red Dot sight, C-Mag capacity (urban setup) 1.5X scope (other operations)<br>Maybe a cool tactical flashlight with IR filter would be as well, but itÂ’s really more in the realm of personal drool-some weaponry by now.<br><br>And yeah, keep the Kevlar plate for me, as IÂ’m paranoid when it comes to chamber explosions in bullpups.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Notes:<br>Changing the barrel length to reduce/increase weight or lethality is probably not even an issue to begin with given STK does indeed manufacture the SAR-21 with various different barrel lengths. There is even a carbine version and what have you not if you visit their webpage.<br><br>But it turns out that in the end it is the SAF that decides what it wants to get. Personally as I said I would go for '20, but it's no skin off my back if someone here wants some other length. </span></div>

Which are indeed useful pieces of equipment to the vanilla Sar-21.

Perhaps they should run it down to the pistol grip, so that when the user squeezes the grip, the LAD would come up when the LAD is in the ON mode.

If it's really with the SAF where and who should your beef be with? The design and abilities of the rifle or the way the user organization implements it?<br><br>And I think you're forgetting that even with the P-Rail, the individual soldier will probably not be able to pick and choose what he wants with impunity... that would be tied down via the different units.<br><br>So you still might be stuck with your 1.5x battlescope to fit on your rail if your unit so sees it fit. You seem to have this impression that we can just walk into E-Mart/Beach Road and get anything we want for the P-Rail. Some of the yanks actually buying their own scopes to use when they were not issued, but is this something the Singaporean NSF can easily do given our current context? Admittedly it would be pretty cool to ask the Beach Road auntie for an AimPoint.<br><br>So yeah, while the P-Rail in theory means you can mount anything on the SAR if so needed, pratically I wonder if this will be actually praticed. It'll depend in the end what is actually implemented on the ground. In theory the LBV allows maximum customization of the tatical vest loadout, but the units still enforce standarization.<br><br>And why should anyone be surprised that the SAR LAD is as capable as the AN/PECQ2? Having used both I find no difference between the two, except of course, for the naturally more egronomic and balanced arrangment of the SAR 21 LAD.<br><br>Other then that in terms of operation you get the same hi and low constant/momentary settings, the only difference being that the non IR SAR21 LAD does not come with the ilum laser (that can only be seen by NVGs) option that comes with the AN/PEQ2... which is (for now at least). With the IR-capable SAR21 that are issued to the shooters in the section that use NVGs, the LAD is pratically indistinguishable.<br><br>So in terms of targeting capabilities... how are they different? You said the SAR-21 LAD does not come anywhere near what the AN/PEQ2 can do. Is there any reason to believe that in the first place? Is there going to be cause to believe next that the bullets fired from the SAR21 is mysteriously less effective then those fired from other barrels?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap, there is indeed an MMS carbine version of the SAR-21.  And its a HELL LOT LIGHTER too.<br><br>Why? Cos there is not more scope, LAD, and kevlar.  Just Sar-21, and its picatinny rail.<br><br>Had an opportunity to mess around with it... The moment I picked it up, looked down the reflex sight.... i thought to myself, "THIS is what the SAR-21 should be!"<br><br>Why?  Firstly, light.  2ndly, Modular.  Can attach wide variety of sighting or equipment.  3rdly, becos its modular, it also helps protect expensive sights from damage.  When running SOC, don't put on the sights lor! Run with just the bare weapon.  Of course, without the kevlar, some parents are gonna kpkb when one of their sons gets a total makeover from chamber explosion.</div>

[/b]</blockquote>Not to nitpick, but why do you say the MMS has no kevlar protective plate and pressure vent hole? I didn't actively go and look for it when I had my try with the MMS, but from what I see it uses the same butt assembly as the normal SAR variant, which <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span> include the kevlar plate.<br><br>Also, STK seems to markets this safety feature across all the variants, given we don't see any fine print about the MMS lacking the kevlar plate. Unless you have actually seen it absent, all reasons indicate that it should be there.<br><br>On another note the MMS is my ideal variant of the SAR21, though I would go for a full 20' barrel on it. That makes me undecided between the full sized '20 SAR P-Rail and the MMS, given the SAR P-Rail does pack its LAD into a more egronomic package with a nice handgrip to boot. But the MMS does give you a ton more options.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Everybody is in agreement that the SAR 21 variants are better ( light weight, P rails , option to use other sights, forward hand grips ...........wow ) . See.........we are moving away from the standard issue SAR 21.<br><br>Once I get my standard issue P rail variant of SAR21 , I am getting a Trijicon variable power sight - or gosh, get the SAF to buy one.  If you can spend      S$ 60 million on one F 15 SG, why not equip all our guys with Trijicons or heck Aimpoints.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've fired simunitions from an MP5 with a forward grip, it worked for me.<br><br>It's a matter of personal opinion, I don't mind a forward grip at all, though it has the key disadvantage of not being able to easily shift one's supporting hand up and down like you could a normal handgrip, which is more limiting in egronomics. Some people find the vertical gripping action more natural apparently, so once again it's pretty personal. A fully P-Railed weapon would have to use a forward grip though.</div>
