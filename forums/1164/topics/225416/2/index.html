            <div class='col-md body'>Actually the AK 47s were last built in the late 50s or 60s - for the Russian ones anyway.  They were replaced by AKMs and eventually AK 74s in 5.45 mm caliber. New versions in NATO calibres are AK 101 &amp; AK 102.<br><br>AKs are accurate to 200 m , M16s to 400 m. M16 s are good but I prefer the G36 s.  Our SAR 21s are too heavy and really need to be improved. Its ergonomics especially for Safe/Fire    Single Shot/Auto sucks.  Weight shud be reduced to 3.5 kg ( with scope ) range &amp; the Standard SAR 21 for the normal infantry shud have Picatinny rails so that sights &amp; other accessories can be attached. We also do not need a full length 20 inch barrel. Most new rifles make do with 16 to 18 inches - it will save weight, make overal length even shorter and does not have a major impact on accuracy ( for the normal combat ranges up to 300 to 400 m ) for the normal soldier especially when you have better optical sights.  Lets hope that ST Eng comes up with a A1 version soon.</div>

Why? Because frankly, we are a conscript army, and most if not all the troopers will not spend money on optics, fore-grips, tactical lights etc. for their service weapon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You need a 20' barrel to get the most magic out of the 5.56. Using that barrel and your typical ball ammo, the 5.56 is actually more lethal then the AK 7.62 bullet within 100 meters due to its fragmentation effects. Start messing around with the length and you'll see issues like not being able to stop your targets start to appear.<br><br>Reduce the barrel length and you will start to erode the very qualities of the 5.56 that give it certain neat advantages over the 7.62. In theory, you can carry more 5.56 ammo for 7.62 and in the short ranges typical of FIBUA your weapon is actually more effective at killing the enemy. Though 5.56 sucks at shooting through barriers... which would be typical in FIBUA.<br><br>I always wondered what's up with the SAR-21 fire selector, but I never had any issue with the weight. The justification for it, or so I heard was that if you mounted the same amount of accesories of the SAR (scope, LAD) on the M16 and you will get a system that is heavier. So the weight issue is pretty moot in the end. The SAR was supposed to be some kind of standard weapon to give a basic form of these capabilities to the conscript army I suppose.</div>

Most people settle for around 18-inches.<br><br>Even SG made 2 AR with 18-inch barrels before coming up with the bullpup SAR-21.<br><br>Also interesting to note that a shorter barrel does not necessarily mean a lighter weapon. The SAR-80 and SR-88 with 18-inch barrels are both HEAVIER than the M-16 with a 20-inch barrel.<br><br>The Russians had been, and continue to be, very satisfied with 16.3-inch barrels and feel that accurate aimed shots out to 200m more than sufficient.<br><br>In fact, I get the feeling that they feel that accurate aimed shots are in practice not the most important thing. They also continue to use the open v-notch rear sight which is much better at quick acquisition of targets (but less precise aiming) than our M16 ring-type rear sight.<br><br>On the other hand, China abandoned the AK-47 in favour of their own Type-81 (also in 7.62 x 39mm) with a slightly longer barrel cos it is apparently much more accurate. They continue to seek accuracy and longer barrels with the new Type 95 in bullpup with a full length 20.5 inch barrel.<br><br>Just when everyone is adopting bullpups with full length barrels, the Israelis did the complete opposite by adopting a bullpup that has an 18-inch barrel as standard, shorter than either their current M-16 or Galil.<br><br></div>

I think a compromise must always be struck between reliability and actual usability. The AK is reasonably precise in a good hand, but it's not something you want to tot to a long range engagement, given it fires an underpowered round (by 7.62 standards) with a rainbow bullet path. Ugh, bad.</div>

Thus you need more bang for the buck, something that can disaproportional increase the fighting capability of the regular grunt. Much like our force multipliers. Thus the high precision weapon like the M-16. The Warsaw Pact on the other hand, has enormous numbers with a beat-up economy. Theres absolutely no way you can spend so much time and money in training troops to handle something like the M-16. So you need an effectively idiot-proof weapon, so there you have it, the AK-47.</div>

But the AK tapered cartridge and the rifle itself is designed with loose tolerance for reliability over accuracy.<br><br>Secondly, their experience in WW2 with generous issue of SMG "burp guns" showed that high volume of automatic fire actually worked as well as - if not better than - aimed single shots.<br><br>And besides, a Russian infantry platoon has several sharpshooters armed with scoped Dragunov sniper rifles to deal with the accuracy and longer range issues.<br><br>Also, they have many SAWs in the platoon in the form of RPK which has a longer barrel and more accuracy if fired single shot. So long range engagement for a Russian rifle platoon is no problemo.<br><br>And once the infantry get to close quarters urban or jungle, an AK firing bursts is a lot more devastating than those coming from M16-armed infantry.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.  All the newer rifles invariable have 16 to 18 inch plus barrels eg TAR21,<br>F2000, G36 in standard variant.  All have built in scopes &amp; all are much<br>lighter than SAR21. A 20 in barrel is more lethal but a 16 to 18 in one is<br>sufficient for a normal conscript infantryman up to 300 m ranges. With<br>modular designs, give the more skilled conscript a 20 to 24 in barrel and 4<br>X scope &amp; he will take out enemy at 400 to 600 m.<br><br>2.  The aunties / teenagers / kids can hit man sized targets at 100 m with<br>SAR21 without training. They can also do the same with the other rifles<br>above.  They can also do so with a scoped M16.<br><br>3.  SCAR, G36 and F2000 have Safe/Fire &amp; Auto/Single shot controls which are<br>similar or better than the ones in M16s which are hard to fault.<br><br>4.  P rails give flexibility to the normal infantryman. They are not only for  Spec<br>Ops. When u need a light in urban combat or when u need to configure<br>rifle for a night battle and need a night sight , the P rail  will be needed.<br><br>5.  The sight reticule in the standard optical sight in the SAR21 is hard to see<br>&amp; is useless in poor light &amp; darkness. It shud not be black but illuminated<br>to amber or red. There are also no graduations to estimate range - one<br>only needs to see    a G36 standard optical sight to see how simple and<br>effective a good sight is.<br><br>6.  The SAR 21 can be a great rifle if the above improvements are made.<br>As a Sporean, I hope we get a A1 version with all the features above<br>soon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I left the army long time ago and had no chance  to use the Sar *whatchamacallit?? But on of my visit to Singapore I asked my brother in law who is an OC in one of the the reservist Infantry unit and he said he is not being trained to use the Sar.Why is that so? I think all soldiers ahould know how to use the various small arms in the SAF and also including the wapons of potential enemies..this is pure common sense.</div>

The tendency for such 5.56 to fragment at high velocities after entering the body causes larger wounds then the size and velocity of the round would account for. The AK 7.62 on the other hand, only starts to cause significant injury when it starts to yaw and tumble after having penetrated sufficent tissue... otherwise the AK round produces the typical "ice pick" effect.<br><br>Hence at FIBUA distances a 5.56 round is actually <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span> dangerous. Unless of course for some reason you are using the current standard issue Yank greentip ammo which removes this fragmentation effect and rendering the round very much less lethal.<br><br>Above 100 meters however, the AK round is more dangerous... but this is offset by it being less precise. The real gem of the AK is in its reliability, given an IA in close quarters is death... something that is more likely with an M16.</div>

SAF will teach you that in 1 day as well, and you'll have many many many experiences of stripping and maintaining it as well.  Blindfolded etc. BMT not so nice to give u 1 week to teach u how to handle the M-16.<br><br>And of course, one can teach a fresh recruit how to do something, but whether he really learn anything is dependent a lot on the quality of instruction as well.</div>
