            <div class='col-md body'>The most common misconception here is probably due to the fact that the Ultimax and the Minimi, while both SAWs, are used in different applications. Our SAW operator doctrine emphasises mobility and close contact with the section itself, to provide immediate, localised fire support while advancing.<br><br>The Minimi as used by the Americans, is used 50-50 between static fire-support roles and playing catch-up with the section. Sometimes, when they break up into fireteams, the SAW may be isolated with the rest of the section, and sent to do mop-up or softening duties before entry into a moderately large area with little foilage or environmental cover for the enemy. The Minimi's accuracy is only at it's best while fired with it's bipod legs deployed, and not on the move. Practically speaking, this would allow for it to be belt-fed and save on magazine change while in prone position.<br><br>Our Ultimax is built for low-recoil and handheld application. That's where the different lies. The C-MAG has a problem with the springs in the magazine when they do not channel the bullets smoothly towards the chamber under battle conditions where heat is common and may warp the springs slightly under extreme movement. One solution could be to standardise the magazines with the AR systems.<br><br>Until we realise that the Ultimax and the Minimi were developed for different applications in two different armies, the arguments will continue.</div>

While it worked well as a tripod or bipod-mounted MEDIUM machine gun, it was incapable as a HMG as it had no armour-piercing capability and hopeless as a SAW.<br><br>In the end, the Germans used captured Czech mag-fed zb-26 (father of the Bren).<br><br>On the other hand, the Allies had the excellent SAWs in the form of mag-fed Bren, and the mag-fed BAR. The Russians had the Degtyarev, also mag-fed.<br><br>However, everyone went ape-shxt for the GPMG concept after WW2 even though it was clumsy in the SAW role.<br><br>Britain was the only one with any sense and they hung on to the Bren until the 7.62 round was phased out.<br><br>US soldiered on with the M-60 GPMG in the SAW role after attempts to auto the M-14 were discontinued.<br><br>After the switch to the 5.56 everyone had different ideas as to what a SAW should be.<br><br>US soldiered on with the M-60 GPMG after attempts to turn the M-16 into a SAW was discontinued.<br><br>Later on, the US and everybody else went for the belt-fed SAW, which I feel is the old GPMG firing a smaller bullet.<br><br>The US actually used the Minimi in a SAW assault role but maybe because they have guys big enough to run full speed with a heavy bulky weapon.<br><br>Sullivan went back to the Bren, BAR and Degtyarev (Lewis even) mag-fed concept and came up with the Ultimax 100.<br><br>But US must've been disinterested and Singapore ended with a tidy little LMG/SAW.<br><br>Any one knows the true story of why/how Sullivan sold the design to us?</div>
