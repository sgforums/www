The Range Safety Officer <span style="font-style: italic;">will</span> get in your face if you forget (inadvertently or otherwise) to do so, but the upside is that we have a very clean range, as can be seen in this image of the firing line at the 200-yard range:<br><br><img src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g236/screwthepap2/Fourth_2006_Shoot.jpg"><br><br>(That's one of my 24" target ARs in the foreground.)<br><br></div>

I did look at the bottom of the casing a few times, but can't recall the what it says by now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Sucky answer I know, but I'll take a note of it next time I go for ICT... if I can remember that is.<br><br>And no, can't change out the barrel easily like the Ultimax Mk.3. You have to take the forward reciever group apart in order to do a barrel change, which is possible with the C-tool but it's probably something we would let the armourer handle. The weapon was intended to be used on one barrel for operations... unless you are talking about the LMG variant, which I suspect would be wise to have a barrel change option... but closed bolt LMGs still aren't as optimal for the SAW role as open bolt systems... probably why it's one variant STK hasn't really put up for sale.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aye if my memory serves me from the undamaged projectiles I've observed at the butt of the firing areas, as well as unfired ammo it seems to fit the SS109/M855 description more.<br><br>They are pretty pointy as I remember them... and yeah, greentip (for some batches that is) as well. It could be possible that we are mixing our ammo types... prehaps trying to run through old batches?<br><br>And yeah the quite barrel change would be a nice feature (though I can't think of a heat-of-combat application... I mean it's not as if you're firing that weapon like an LMG rite?) , though you might get differences that require you to rezero... is this an issue?<br><br>Come to think of it when you have to change barrel on the SAW or MG, does the aiming go off slightly or it's not really an issue given the sheer volume of fire you're putting out and you can just adjust accordingly. Never used a SAW enough to do or require a barrel change (in fact where got even carry spare barrels?), and never got to operate the GPMG in which barrel change is obviously part of the operations.<br><br>These things can get mighty hot, my officer friend had to do 1206 because while doing a change for the GPMG, he rested the barrel on top of some polymer SAR mags and they melted right before his eyes! Yeah, kinda like that story of an OCS cadet who cooked his SAR when he let it slip into his campfire while he was sleeping, the butt melted. Ugh, that can't be too good for him.<br><br></div>

I was tied up at work today and didn't get a chance to post here.<br><br>The club to which I belong, the Dakota County Gun Club, is located in Rosemount, Minnesota. It's about a 20-minute drive from my house, and has outdoor pistol, rifle, shotgun and archery ranges. The pistol ranges go out to 25 yards, and the rifles ranges extend from 25 yards all the way out to 300 yards. We also have a couple of bowling pin ranges for pistols.<br><br>The 24" AR is indeed a tack driver. Here's a better shot of it:<br><br><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/DCGC_070405_08_Small.jpg"><br><br>I built it about three years ago. The upper assembly was built around a DSC 24" stainless bull barrel with a 1-in-8 twist to handle the heavier projectiles. The lower comprises an Eagle Arms receiver with RRA internals and a two-stage match trigger set to break at around 2.5 lbs. The scope is a fairly ordinary Simmons 'Whitetail Classic' 6.5-20X 50mm unit.<br><br>With my 75 gr. handloads, this AR is usually able to achieve 200 yard groups like this:<br><br><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/dlwh/Tgt_200yards_AR24.jpg"><br><br>If you do decide to build an AR, the Bushmaster and DPMS lowers will serve you well. With a few exceptions, almost all lower receivers on the market today hold very tight tolerances and conform well to milspec dimensions. If I were building a new AR, my choice of lower would be RRA as they seem to be finished a smidge better.<br><br>You're right about ammo prices going through the roof. Even though I handload for all my guns, I'm still feeling the pinch from the rapidly increasing component prices (particularly projectiles). The guys who buy commercial ammo, though, must really be feeling the pain! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What do you all feel about the SAF SAR-21's inability to take M16 magazines?<br><br>STK could've made a plastic magazine that will fit both M16 and SAR-21 if they had wanted to. But instead, they decided on a propretary plastic mag JUST for the SAR-21.<br><br>Is there a reason for this? Is there an advantage in this?<br><br>Could this mean that the days of the Ultimax as we know it in SAF service is numbered?<br><br>One of the great advantage of the Ultimax is its ability to take M16 magazines - meaning if it ran out of drum ammo, it could be borrow or be supplied simply with M16 mags like the rest of the troops.<br><br>But this advantage is null and void since the SAR-21 plastic magazine is proprietary to the SAR-21.<br><br>Does it mean that they will either make the Ultimax able to take SAR-21 magazines, or come up with a new SAW?<br><br>And also does anyone know why the SAR-21 is not issued with M203? I saw pictures of SAR-21 units with M16/M203. Is it a weight issue as someone suggested? Will mounting a M203 on the SAR-21 make it unacceptably heavy?<br><br>This would mean the SAR-21 units would need both types of magazines: plastic ones for SAR-21 and metal ones for M16/M203 and SAW.<br><br>Is this a problem logistically? Does this means all units continue to need to be trained in both weapons?<br><br>Is this a situation that will persist?<br><br>I am not an outright critique of the SAR-21 but it seems to take one step back for every 2 steps forward.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think of it as an SAF-level decision.<br><br>The SAR-21 in its original form (and indeed itÂ’s export version) can accept both types of mags. I am fuzzy on if the actual thing can take in two different mags or that some modification was needed, but if you look at the pics some posts up youÂ’ll see this is the case.<br><br>For some reason the proprietary plastic mag was chosen for SAF use, so one can only speculate on the reasons why.<br><br>But I donÂ’t think itÂ’s a big issueÂ… not if you want to move forward anyway. The whole NATO standard metal magazine was a less then idea system to begin with anyway. The lips can be dented, rendering your magazine mostly useless but you wonÂ’t know until you try to chamber a round. Also they canÂ’t really load their supposed 30 rounds reliably and what other issues like busting in the bottom or denting and breaking the body.<br><br>The proprietary mag is a step forward for our gruntsÂ… the polymer mag is tough, reliable and allows you to do a full 30 round clip. I would use it anytime over the metal mag.<br><br>As for the Ultimax, the whole running the Ultimax on 30-round mags thing was a flawed idea to begin with. The problem is that they still havenÂ’t gotten down to fixing this rather glaring deficiency in our weapons. I know the drum mag could not be fully hand-loaded, but the whole carry 19X 30 round mags isnÂ’t exactly a solution- itÂ’s a stopgap. On if the UltimaxÂ’s days are numbered, thatÂ’s another thing up for speculationÂ… but I donÂ’t really see it as that likely unless they want to introduce the SAR LMGÂ… of which they did have some intentions.<br><br>Also, the Ultimax does NOT take M16 mags unless they have been so modified by drilling two holes on the side... it did happen that we did go outfield and realized that not all our mags could be taken by the Ultimax. Which defeats the entire purpose of the whole thing. The thing was meant to be run on a drum.<br><br>Maybe they should make a whole new LMG to begin with.<br><br>The M16/M203 thing is just for the time being... it's rather obvious they are going to push the SAR-21/M203 to the troops in a matter of time. Maybe they want to complete replacing our entire front line M-16 arsenal first? But yeah, holding two different mags in a section is problematic.<br><br>In any case, I donÂ’t think having different mags is an issue. The SAWs werenÂ’t meant to be run on 30 round box mags to begin withÂ… so their mags will always be a logistical issue. Unless a big part of your tactics involve capturing enemy mags and using themÂ… I donÂ’t see how itÂ’s a big issue.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although the Ultimax is a good LMG , they shud have done a lot more to make it much better.<br><br>The mag is a real setback. Why cud'nt they have a design similar to the Minimi with the 200 round box mag.<br><br>Also, the Ultimax is not rugged enough. It shud have been beefed up a bit more to enable it to withstand the knocks and abuse from soldiers at the expense of some weight increase.<br><br>What is great about the Ultimax is its " constant " recoil system and accuracy.<br>A resonably trained and competent NS man cannot miss at 300 to 400 m.<br><br>Adding a 4 X scope wud have helped increase range effectiveness up to 600 m.</div>
