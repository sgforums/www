            <div class='col-md body'>To foxtrout8,<br><br><strong>LoL , we need the JSF to replace our F-16........it is a threat?? Then wat is with the Superhornet and the SU-30MKM when they have their MiGs and Hornets.....??? If both party goes tactical , it fine. But if one of them goes stratigical ........that unbalance... </strong><br><br>A weapon can be both strategic and tactical. The F16s are still very mission capable, and in the right hands are able to win over Migs29s, F18s and Su30s. The JSF is a stealthy aircraft which is able to launch (without detection) all sorts of WMD against the enemy. And it has a range far beyond 90km. That in my opinion, also can cause everyone to worry about.<br><br>Imagine if say the twin towers go crashing down. Noting was detected on radar. The terrorists can be blamed, but it could have been an attack by us. And there is no way they can prove that it was us. So that is a very destablilizing weapon.<br><br><strong>Singapore and Malaysia have been always balance even though we have more weapons because they have larger stratigical depth, more resources and of course, more unstable. But since they goes stratigical , they give us a chance to openly purchase '' things that we cant get in the past ''. ( i dun think i need to be in depth on that ) </strong><br><br>Its up to our government to decide if that is the case or not. As I said, those weapons are for their deterrence. If they truly want to provoke us, they will have bought 30 scuds from North Korea. After all, the USA did not stop N Korea from sending the scuds to Yemen.<br><br><strong>Nv did i say that we onli have to worry abt the military , but since the thread is abt long range offensive weapon , i follow up suit with the discussion....u cant compare the two issues... </strong><br><br>I just want to tell you that no matter what they Malaysian's buy, it is controlled by their budget. They are not going to waste too much money on their toys when they need every cent to stay alive when China and India is coming. That why they buy the weapons with palm oil. They spend money and make money as well.<br><br><strong>Not to be offensive, but are u from earth?? Weakness to get peace....?? The reason y we invest so much onto the SAF is because we want peace u understand that right?? </strong><br><br>Thats the current mindset. Peace through might. We made the SAF very strong and no one wants to mess with it.<br><br>But lets put another scenario. The Warsaw Pact was much stronger than Nato back in 1985. They could not invade for they know that that war may go 50-50. Until you are sure that you can win the war, you won't invade. So that is deterrence through parity. That you can deter the enemy even if your forces are roughly the same size.<br><br>The best way is deterrence through weakness, that is a concept that you can win a war against us anytime, but you won't be around to enjoy the victory as I will make it so painful for you to do so. The Swiss has that concept. The Nazis had huge numerical and weaponary superiority over the Swiss in WW2, yet they did not attack. Because they know the swiss will defend to the death and that it was not worth it. So I am saying that we have that kind of deterrence.<br><br><strong>We defend through offence , we cant possibility sit down and fight ....i think u know abt it.... How expensive it could be ,if it is within budget and regulations, we will get wat we want to ''have a chance for peace''</strong><br><br>You are right. But the Malaysians also are defending through offense. They can't sit down and let us march right into JB and KL. They will purchase whatever weapon system they think will make us think 10x before doing the pre-emptive strilke.<br><br>Our weapons purchases are not the same as the Malaysians. We buy the best, and pay cash. They NEVER bought the best equipment (although they claim to do so)  and just make do with whatever they have. So if we overreact to their purchases, we will end up paying lots more cash while they sell more palm oil Its a scenario that benefits them.<br><br>Do I think that the Malaysians will invade with their current mix of weapons? Nope. Their NS is in its infancy. It may be 10-20 years before they get up to fighting shape. By then, all the weapons both sides have bought are obsolete. So, if they want to really invade, it won't be NOW. So why overreact NOW?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To tripwire,<br><br><strong> if as you said "We spend based on what the immediate perceived threats are" then how could we then be considered excessive in our defence spendings if our spendings on defence is based on immediate threat perceptions rather then the size of our land or the size of our GDP? </strong><br><br>Because based on our GDP and % per GDP on military budget, we are spending more money than our supposed adversary. How can we take an aggressor seriously when they spend less than us. If they really want combat, they will have to spend more than us. So as I said, we spend excessive amounts on our military.<br><br>To put it bluntly, their budget say is $1000, and ours is $2000 .. and has been that way for 30 years. Do I consider them a credible threat? NO. And expecially when our size is 500x smaller than theirs.<br><br><strong> wat value is there towards national defence or deterrence value of SAF if by toeing the spending pattern of our neighbour, we end up with a force that could neither deter nor defend the country? </strong><br><br>The opinion is that we have more than enough to defend the country, but am now trying for a force capable beyond defence, but also aggressive operations. That is the part that I disagree with.<br><br><strong> i must point out that... standing forces + reserves included... we are only bigger then brunei and marginally bigger then malaysian as can be seen from the estimates below.... </strong><br><br>6... singapore est... 350,000<br>7... malaysia est ... 160,000<br><br>2x is not marginally .. 2x is definately overkill, especially if the 160k troops up north has to defend an area 500x larger than Singapore.<br><br><strong>in fact... for a time, SAF has been the poisoned shrimp, as LSL said in the past.... even now... we may still be using this strategy against larger adversaries....<br><br>but... a war where we are sure to loose is not appealing to many soldiers... many would prefer a chance for a win... even if the chance is low... and thus i personnaly like the new position where SAF would attack, win the day and be around to pick up the pieces...<br><br>in fact... such a change in ideology also helps to reinforce our deterence value.. afterall... an ability to kill the enemy would definitely make the enemy to think twice before provoking us... compared to a poisoned shrimp... which some nations might believe(true or not) it can withstand the poison... because they are big enough... or the poison shrimp... aint poison enough to destroy their nation....</strong><br><br>So you are now saying that we are not poisonous enough to kill the enemy, and hence justify the deterrence through strength position. To me, that can not last indefinately, as we can never be sure that Singapore will forever remain economically better off than Malaysia. In fact, already HK has fallen with China's ascendancy. If we are not flexible in our military doctrine, we are as doomed as the USSR, who tried to keep up with the west. They looked good in the 80s, but their economy floundered and all that hardware was wasted.<br></div>

The poison shrimp theory still holds. There is still no point in hitting an enemy if it will kill you ... especially if you already won.<br><br>The purpose of the SAF is to deter a military action against our land. NOT in the realm of economics and politics. That is they job of the EDB and foreign ministry. If we are isolated economically and politically, its because that we did not spend enough money on those parts to compete globally (possible due to diversion of funds to other budget areas ..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ).<br><br>So if Malaysia becomes the  permanent UN security council member, what can our military do? Suppose Malaysia manages to be a developed country by 2020 and we suffer like HK, what can our military do? We invade them? Hah! If we are economically and politically isolated in the future, having a strong SAF will not change matters.<br><br>So your statement that the Swiss were economically isolated is very apt .. but in the 1930s and 1940s, the world relied on land transport. In the 21st century, money and goods are sent by air and electrons. As long as the SAF can keep the waterways open, the rest is up to the economic wizards and political spin doctors to manage.</div>

My answer is yes , dun tell mi that ur ans is no... </strong><br><br>My answer is the ASTROS are NOT a threat. As I said earlier, the USA did not stop the shipment of Scuds from N Korea to Yemen.<br><br><strong>Wat does this got to do with the thread???? </strong><br><br>Money my dear, allows both sides to purchase the weapons. No money, no weapons. So money is more important than the weapons.<br><br><strong>U can try changing the two prong policy of Mindef....... </strong><br><br>I don't have to .. I leave it to the Malaysians to do that for us.<br><br><strong>KaoZ , deterrence is deterrencce but still warsaw is a threat to NATO!!!] Im toking abt threat , u understand. They bought the toys for detterence in order for us to feel the threat........ All deterrence contain levels of threat...and it is the threat that the other party must neutralize.  </strong><br><br>Yes, but did you see how either side responded to the threats? The Warsaw Pact spent more militarily, while the west spent more on their economy. My way of neutralizing the threats is the same way as NATOs, spend more on economy.<br><br>In the end, the threat went away when the enemy went bankrupt. Thats they way you solve your threats .. not by a arms war, but by letting your enemy spend his way bankrupt.<br><br><strong>U contridict urself!!!! Weakness can cost pain in an enemy??? U think the swiss is weak because they can fight to their death??? </strong><br><br>Read my post carefully, Switzerland was weaker than Nazi Germany. Yet they managed to stay uninvaded.<br><br><strong>Lets take that the Astros isnt the best...... One rocket from the Astros can damage Singapore significantly ok?? Astros2 in this discussion isnt as worthless as u think..... 72 rockets flying into Singapore with cluster munition can destroy our surface asset in one concentration area....thus we must find ways to prevent the rockets from leaving the ground..... </strong><br><br>Why bother? The moment they use it, it will be a full fledge war. Hence deterrence failed. We will hit them with EVERYTHING we got. So why just counter one weapon platform? Its all out war.<br><br><strong>No one is overing reacting . They move a level , we counter a level . Y tok abt the NS when it is not the topic here...u cant compare or link two issues together.... U cant wait for their NS to mature than we take actions also. </strong><br><br>If we follow the chess move thingie, we will banrupt ourselves. They are not paying for their purchases in cash. We are. They are selling palm oil .. We are not.  They more they buy, the more palm oil they sell. The more we buy, the more cash is sent out of the Singapore economy.<br><br><strong>Ur thinking is as good as the one in Kuwait before the invasion of the Iraqis. Showing weakness , lots of diplomacy , dun over react on some issues &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A fallen kingdom.</strong><br><br>Iraq has 10x more military than Kuwait, while Singapore is 2x more military than Malaysia .. do your math before comparing it apples to apples.</div>

While we are not doing that, I believe that money has to be better spent on economic actions as our military has sufficient funds for deterrence and defence.<br><br><strong>So wat are u susgesting???

Wat do u think the Mersing line are for.....wat do u think pre emptive strikes are for....wat do u think HUMINT are for.....? </strong><br><br>Even without the ASTROS, the moment there is war, there will be huge numbers of loss of life. The mersing line and preemptive strikes are the psychological warfare that the military tell the civilians on how they will achieve their targets. In reality, if a shooting match happens, it wont stop until we reach Perlis and they wont stop until they reach sentosa.<br><br><strong>LoLX , even ur replies are following the chess move .....wat make u think civilisation do move in the chess way???

I think we have enough pieces on the board without spending more money putting another piece in the board. They can put a few more pieces, but our current armada is sufficient to counteract anything that they have.<br><br><strong>Hello , my point is not abt the strenght .....its abt the attitude of the leaders , it is because of the ''weakness'' and diplomacy theory that Kuwait didnt prepare itself for the 10x army.....

Long range weapon for us will be a deterence as good as the Astros2 from their side.....u understand??</strong><br><br>Ah now its about the leaders, not the weapons. Well, in my opinion then, in 2004, they have a new leader (Badawi) and we have a new on in 2007 (LHL) .. so everything is unknown.<br><br>As for deterrence, how long a weapon you want? 500km?1000km? They have a short range weapon 90km. How much you want to pay to have weapons to hit KL? And why KL? Do you think by reducing KL to rubble that they will stop the invasion? They can rebuild any building. Its the economy and subsequent capital flight that will doom the country. If we destroy JB, and cripple their economy enough that there is starvation on the streets, then we win. Its the same for them. They don't have to reduce Orchard Road to rubble. They just need to sap our will to fight.<br><br>By having weapons that have operational range of 90km, they can be taken out easier than if they have scuds.<br></div>

All I said was that previously they have no shoes. They just bought the shoes. Our current shoes is good enough for me, but some of Our people in the forum now panic because now Malaysia has shoes, and want Singapore to drop our current shoes for a better pair. And want to pay more for it.<br><br>I don't think that just because Malaysia has their new shoes now, we should get rid of our workable shoes. Indeed, the economy is too bad for us to look at new shoes.<br><br>So what if the Malaysians have some new shoes now and can win some races? Must we win every race we have at all cost?<br><br>There is no finishing line. This race is about the journey, not the destination.</div>
