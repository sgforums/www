            <div class='col-md body'>Now now, it truly smacks of childishness and jealosy to make fun of their truly asia tourism campaign. They have a better message than ours for their tourism campaign.<br><br>As for their military purchases, I must remind everyone that they are using their purchases to seel palm oil. If any military conflict happens, it will be up to them to start it, so they know when is the timetable. We are the defenders, not the aggressors.<br><br>So if they buy the stuff, and pay it with palm oil, it benefits them. It does not matter if the stuff is second rate. It is enough for them to be happy, and make money on the side.<br><br>They have purchased Migs from Russia, Subs from France, Radar System from Switzerland, Art from SA, the ASTROS from Brazil, ACV from South Korea, Tanks from Poland, Fighters from USA, Guns from Pakistan.<br><br>I see no possible reason for such a wide spread arms purchase if they really intend an invasion. However, I see at least 1 billion worth of palm oil sold that way.<br><br>So as an invading army, that is not a threat. But as a detterence force and a credible defensive army, it is sufficient to deter potential invader. And with the invader deterred, they can continue to focus on economic matters, such as the ascension of China and India ...<br><br>The rest of ASEAN is in worst shape compared to Malaysia when it comes to economic ability to challenge China and India. Even Malaysia can't go head on against the 2 gaints. So they use their military purchase to sell palm oil, restructure their economy to move up the value chain and also new direction such as services, tourism, finance, biotech and education.<br><br>So I don't think the average Malaysian (except for that innocent fella) gives a hoot about their military. They have other worries.</div>

I didnt state anything abt the missile on HDBs. All i said is that we will be in shit if the missile strike any on the bases in mainland singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>To lasergod<br><br><strong>why malaysian always dreaming and boasting one huh?<br>they cant match SAF lah</strong><br><br>What makes you think that they are boasting to us?<br><br>They are just justfiying to their own population that they bought the equipment. Unlike Singapore, which 70% of the electorate can not vote, Malaysian government can lose seats to their opposition. Hence they need to tell their people why they are spending the money and what they are using to pay for it. Spend too much, and their people can protest (unlike Singapore, with 4.5% unemployment, no one complain about the FT)<br><br>They can not match SAF unless their % GDP they spend on their military match ours. And even then, we have decades, where the budget of the military exceed the rest of our ASEAN neighbours. So do you think they are boasting? Nope. I don't</div>
