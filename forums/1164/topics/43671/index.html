            <div class='col-md body'>500km or more? not unless u believe in that rumour posted some months ago about Sg showing "interest" in some Russian hardware years ago which happened to be picked up by Aussie intelligence...<br><br>still, if u develop Lalee and Firefly properly (proper inertia or GPS guidance systems), i don't think u need Longshot... a bit extra lah... unless u're concerned that SAF won't get access to GPS satellites to use for its guidance systems... if GPS access is not an issue, Longshot will just be excess baggage. i'll rather carry more payload.<br><br>besides, not exactly a necessity if u consider that command of the skies will allow u to do almost everything imaginable to them on the ground...<br><br>btw, SG FH2000's official range is about 30 km... rocket assisted rounds will give it about 10 km more i think...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i wont be surprised if they do have the 90 km range rockets... afterall.. they already have the other stuffs... why stop short??<br><br>however... its a fact that eversince malaysia purchased the FH77 VSEL... with 30km range... the entire singapore is already expose to arty fire...<br><br>it begs the question... why purchase a 90 km rocket system that fires very expensive rockets (compare to arty shells) to achieve the same effect....<br><br>i know that some might claim that the push for the longer range is out of fear of the counter battery power of FH2000 which have a range of 40km... that would... probably nullified MAF's FH77 arty over time... but i wonder... how many more arty could MAF purchase if those money meant for ASTRO2 are all used to purchase th G-5....which have a range better then FH2000...<br><br>furthermore... the purchase of A2... would only lead to SAF looking out for weapons that could either counter A2 or surpase A2 in terms of range and firepower...<br><br>Since SAF got the money... they wont be short of offers... in fact.. i wont be surprise if the maker of A2 might be one of those lineing outside Bt. Gombak.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>ultimately... given time... weapons on both side would advance to a stage where (i believe) it will nullify the benefit of geographical size or strategic depth... as weapons would reach further and further....<br><br>weapons would also becomes more and more destructive.. and thus nullifies the advantage of a larger population...<br><br>as technology advances...even further... they ultimately narrows the gap between big nations and small nations in millitary capability....<br><br>now back to topic.....<br><br>IF SAF general tomolo wants to hit KL without sending ships, planes or troops... wat options are available to them??<br><br>a LALEE carrying a warhead.... or wat?<br><br>Oh... the above are for mere academic disccussion...<br><br>forget the stupid notion that A2 will mess SAF up... it aint that simple...like i always say... one weapon dont decide the outcome of a war... if malaysia A2 singapore... we will simply FAE all their major city... see who more mad.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
