            <div class='col-md body'>My of my platoon mates in BMT had a Masters in BioChem (back in 80's was 'tau tie chee'), father was some big-shot (not sure what/where). He was told during PC interview, as long as can do 3 chin up they will push him through OCS. Good for him, was quite fit etc. eventually was made OCS mentor.<br><br>Myself I taught BMT for scholar batch, half of which destined for OCS (almost 1/3 did so). Some totally hopeless. Had a son of high court judge who misfire twice during range, nearly shot someone both occssions. went through OCS anyway because of White Horse status ("WH", it was recently confirmed as official SAF policy). Made arty officer (God help those this chap will lay support fire for!!)<br><br>BTW - ECA counts as additional 'nice to have', nothing guanteed, being NCC rank holder not exactly a helpful boost many think is, I have seen many with such aspirations but never was close to the cut-off. Its a numbers game, fill the blanks from the top till enuff, chop the rest to SISPEC etc.<br><br>All to do with Education (20%), Background (WH or not, 25%), appitude (not f**k up, peer review 5%), prop test (15%), PC recommendation (what can he tell in 15 mins, 15%) and test resuls (pre-enlistment NAPFA, BMT IPPT 20% etc.) or somthing like that.<br><br>Unless you seriously "F#@k UP", if you are WH (based on father's background, your educational potential (SAF scholars)) you will be an officer. Everyone else see if there is enough space, if no try again during SISPEC (only best trainee need apply). Forget it is you have police record, tatoo or other social problems.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are a WH and have a good educational background but you do not fit the fitness criteria, i.e PES C and so on.You would find yourself being a specialist in the service side.At least this is what I gather through talking to people I know personally.</div>
