They are looking for a leader, someone who standout of the crowd, not a armstroke man who can strips and assemble rifles fast.<br><br>If you are ready to serve your 2.5yrs and get the hell out of there, why are you sore about not being in OCS ? Why listen to all the hear say !!! People also hear say some so and so son, "did nothing and just another recuit" thus did not go to OCS..... so is that hearsay true ? that why they are call hearsay....<br><br>Maybe it is a bessing for you not to have suffer the hardship.</div>
