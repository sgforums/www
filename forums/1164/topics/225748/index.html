            <div class='col-md body'>1.<strong>Why so diffcult to upgrade M113?</strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20776975-5002142,00.html" rel="nofollow">M133 upgrade hits a brake,Daniel Cotterill,November 25, 2006</a></strong><br><br>http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20776975-5002142,00.html<br><blockquote>DEFENCE'S troubled project to upgrade 350 armoured personnel carriers has encountered further difficulties. A fault in a new braking system that can see discs and callipers grind has further delayed their introduction into service -- now November next year at the earliest.<br><br>The $500 million project has for the past 10 years been variously dogged by mismanagement, political and bureaucratic vacillation, and technical complications - all on what started out to be a simple upgrade to extend the life of the Vietnam-era fleet by several years.<br><br>The Defence Materiel Organisation is supervising the upgrade's prime contractor Tenix Defence and brake supplier FFG to ensure the brake problems are fixed, and that rectification does not create a maintenance burden for the M113 fleet.<br><br>There have been calls for the project to be cancelled.<br><br>While advocating the upgrade go on if difficulties can be resolved, Neil James, executive director of the Australia Defence Association, says "the upgrade stemmed from flawed strategic thinking and we should have procured a real infantry fighting vehicle instead."<br><br>Defence is adamant that the mix of mobility, firepower and protection offered by the upgraded M113s will see the fleet offer a useful capability until their planned withdrawal in 2020, but not everyone agrees. According to James, "it is ludicrous that the ADF will be one of the few Western military forces that cannot field a single infantry fighting vehicle, especially to integrate with our new tanks and armed helicopters".<br><br>An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) is a more lethal, better-protected class of vehicle than an armoured personnel carrier such as the M113. Infantry can also fight with and from an IFV and, given the close-quarter battles our soldiers are increasingly being called upon to face, a move to a more capable and heavily armed vehicle is ultimately inevitable.<br><br>Better capability and protection come at a cost, however, and a typical IFV weighs in around 25-30 tonnes compared to the 18 tonnes of an upgraded M113.<br><br>By 2012 two of the expanded army's eight infantry battalions will be mechanised. Unless the M113 upgrade is sorted out quickly they may feature IFVs sooner rather than later -- a number were on prominent display at the land warfare conference last month. </blockquote>2.<strong>spore upgraded long time ago</strong><br><br><strong><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=149071" rel="nofollow">Know ur Singapore  M113 taxi</a></strong><br><br><blockquote>2.

            <div class='col-md body'>The IDF had very bad experiences with the original M113.<br><br>This quote from<br><a href="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/armored_personnel_carriers/m-113/M-113_.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/armored_personnel_carriers/m-113/M-113_.html</a><br><br>"Because the hull was made from aluminium, once hit by an RPG (rocket propelled grenade) fires raged furiously and there was almost no escaping the vehicle. The M113 earned its unofficial name Zippo and crew preferred to ride on the vehicleÂ’s roof, taking the risk of exposing themselves to enemy fire rather than staying put in the flammable confines of the Bardehlas. "<br><br>So the IDF set about upgrading the armour protection of its fleet of M113 based on its very up -to-date battle experience.<br><br>And here are some examples.<br><img src="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/armored_personnel_carriers/m-113/zelda__3.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/armored_personnel_carriers/m-113/zelda2.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/armored_personnel_carriers/m-113/l-vas_2.jpg"><br><br>Our upgraded M113 Ultras are also supposed to have more armour protection.<br><br>But compare our upgraded M113 to the Israeli ones. Somehow, our Ultra doesn't look anywhere nearly as serious in improving armour protection compared to the Israeli ones.<br><br><img src="http://storm.webvis.net/scrap423.jpg"><br><br></div>
