            <div class='col-md body'>to replace AV-8s<br>meanwhile, aircraft carrier is to be upgraded to bring up its orignal specification.<br><br>The Thai navy is considering acquiring ex-UK Royal Navy BAE Systems Sea Harrier FA2s, which is being reitred, to replaced Mcdonnell Douglas AV-8S Harriers.  The Thai navy also expects to upgrade its aircraft carrier, HTMS Chakri Natrubet.<br><br>"In longer term we are looking for aircraft to replace these Harriers," says Rear Admiral Yuttana Phagpolingam, director general of naval operator.<br><br>Following initial talks with the UK Ministry of Defence, the Thai navy is awaiting details on the aircraft's condition and availability, prior to any negotiations.<br><br>Thailand oerates nine ex-Spanish navy AV-8S.  Their replacement will partly be driven by the cost of a major-life overhaul needed later this decade to keep the aircraft operational, says Yuttana.<br><br>A tight defence budget for the forseeable future and the capabilitit of the replacement aircraft will determine how many Thailand buys.  It would like at least nine Sea Harriers, but it could take fewer if that provides the same capability as the AV-8S fleet, says yuttana.<br><br>BAE's economic offset programme for thailand, essentialy a barter trade deal, could help the Thai navy strengthen its Harrier squadron.  The Thai military is in negotiations with BAE, which could lead to a long-term programme if a pilot project is successfull.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Thai navy is preparing to bring Chakri Narubet up to oringinal desogn specification subject to funding being granted in the fiscal year beginning in October.  It is looking for a meduim range radar to gap the short and long-range systems already fitted.  Other improvements include additional landing aids.  Asia's economic crisis in the late 1990s forced Thailand to scale back the carrier requirements.<br><br>Two Sikorsky S-76 helicopters are also planned for deployment on two offshore  patrol vessels under construction in Shanghai.  The navy is also devloping a requirement for an additional maritime patrol aircraft to supplement its three Fokker F27 MK200s and six Dornier 228s<br><br>Flight International 15-21 April 2003</div>
