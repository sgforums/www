            <div class='col-md body'>Like some others in the web forums, I believe that there are different categories of WH. I believe there are 3 categories:<br><br>1.  Sons of those who are slightly rich (earning $9.5K to say $15 K). Maybe the sons of Majors and LT Col are also within this cat. Under this cat, the CO and his kakia will only "take note" of the WH. There will be minimum special previleges given to the WH - same tough training and equal amount of canteen breaks, but maybe less tekan<br><br>2. Sons of Col and people who are relatively rich. The WH will get some previleges and some TLC - easier training and more canteen breaks.<br><br>3. Sons of ministers, generals and extremely rich parents. In this category, the CO become the WH-runner, reporting to his parents on how "excellent" a soldier the prince is -  eg, having superb leadership skills , blah blah.<br><br>Some forum writers had mentioned that they don't see any difference in treatment between a platoon with WH and one without. I suspect that they are writing about those in Cat 1. "Less tekaning" might be hard to measure and quantify. This lead to false assumption that WH are treated equally.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many commoner-guys are annoyed at the special previleges that WH received from the bootlickers. Let me tell you that there are "Robin Hoods" amoung us who ensured that WH received their fair amount of tekan. I have known of NSF medics who purposely asigned new medics to draw blood from some haughtly WH. Most new medics are bo-bo in drawing blood and this result in quite an experience for the WH.<br><br>Do think and recall if there are any Robin Hoods that you know and share with us. This will at least pacify and quench some anger and annoyance in us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another way to quench your anger:<br><br>Look at this whole WH saga in a different perspective....<br><br>Those WH that are given easy treatment in SAF will most prob get easy treatment in other aspects in life, e.g. no need to do temp job during sch holidays, getting all the material needs fulfilled with a single snap of the finger, pririoty treatment at eating places etc etc. All these a WH will enjoy now while his dad and mum are alive. What happened when his parents pass away? His wealth and previleges will slowly get eroded away by his slackness and "unstreetwiseness" due to years of pampering. Imagine his ferrari being taken away, his VIP cards expiring... Imagine you yourself in his shoe, isn't it painful? To me, this pain is more than the tekan I endured in SAF.<br><br>Extraordinary people (heros) will only appear in tough times. Each of us, the commoners' sons are <strong>little heros </strong>who had toughed it out in SAF and life as a whole. We had persisted in SAF and came out alive and kicking. If we persist in our other efforts in life (say earning money), our sons may one day be WH! What about the sons of WH you may ask. <strong>"Everything that has a begining will have an end". Their sons will be our son's chauffers, cooks and toilet cleaners!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By a writer to the Straits Times Forum: "Saw how a recruit and his dad jumped the entire queue on my POP day when we were going back to the main land. All the officers and the sergeants had to make way for them to jump the queue."<br><br>My two cents worth:<br>For those of us who have those 3G handphones, please PLEASE video those scenes down! Best if you can snap the pics of faces of the CO, officers, CSM who are bootlicking at that time. Don't just use only one handphone to do the video taking, use as many as possible as you have access to. Tape the bootlicking incident from different views and tape as from far and tape with zoom if possible ( pai seh I don't own a 3G handphone or digi cam so I am not too sure of the video capabilities of these devices). Next, load the videos into your PC and share in Kazaa. After a week or two, some journalist in Straits Times will get to know of the videos and.. Voala! You will have nice juicy stories and some poor CO who will be heng ta kaki-ing.</div>
