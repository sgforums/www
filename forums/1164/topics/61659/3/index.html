            <div class='col-md body'>This was a posting from another forum, the contributor claimed to be a WH &amp; in WH coy during his BMT:<br><blockquote>Coming from a white horse company in 1987 during my BMT , same company with son of Tony Tan and few others MP sons. I can tell you the following treatments that happened in my company:<br>i) My company was always the last to fall in.<br>ii) When the son of Tony Tan fainted in a SOC run, the MO rushed down to the field with a helicopter flying in less than 1/2 hour time. Even though ,he was later found to be alright. My friend from another company who fainted was given 3 extra duties during CNY.<br>iii)Everyone in my company who reported sick will get at least a Attn B. When I "keng" diarrhea, I was given attn C with no further examination but my ex-college mate from another company was poked in the ass. Strangely, even after I was posted out of my BMT, I never failed to get an MC from the unit MO. I was on 1 day MC per month on average even most of times I just reported minor ailments.<br>iv) I noticed our company were always the last to goto the cookhouse and the dishes served were always much better than those served earlier on. Sometimes ,we even have sweet &amp; sour prawn and deserts during days when the VIPs decided to drop in and visit their sons.<br>v)Early bookout and last to book in.<br>vi) A new PC who gave our company defaulter parade was given 21 extra duties.<br>vii) There were better treatments we enjoyed that I got no time to list. One funny incident when I could not march in step, I was pulled out of the marching contingent by my RSM. After that , I will just sit under the shade and watched the rest marched under the hot sun. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My 5cent take on WH.<br><br>During my time in a combat unit, a WH (son of a prominant Minister) officer fresh from OCS got posted to my unit as a PC of a rifle platoon.<br><br>While on a major exercise where our Bn played the enemy, my section was placed under his charge with his platoon to ambush the opFor amphibious landings. After 6hrs or so of waiting, the opFor changed plans and landed elsewhere. They fought through land to our emplacements and 2Lt WH was no where to be seen commanding the men! In the end, after the fighting dies down, he reappears, and ask my section and some of his platoon to surrender to the enemy!<br><br>Soon after, my unit was to go to Ex Lancer for training and 2Lt WH wasn't going with his platoon! After we came back from Lancer, he was reassigned to S1.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>judge for yourself people.<br><br>That aside, if anyone can name a WH who is in a combat role in 1th Cdo or NDU, I will concede that WH doesn't have preferential treatment.</div>

'You see something as favouritism which may not be the case, and the white horse system was to address such possible misperception.'<br><br>To those who 'nitpick about how many canteen breaks one platoon gets', he said the platoon could have earned the rewards because of the hard work of its men.<br><br>Instructors could also be at fault, he said. <strong><span style="color: blue;">'Like anywhere in society, there will be some people who are more prone to bootlicking, but let me say categorically that it is not the policy in the SAF.'</span></strong><br><br>He stood by his statement that there was no special treatment, and no one had claimed that white horses had used their influence to get exempted from NS or to downgrade their medical classification.<br><br><strong>'If you hear of a case like that, please let me know,' he said.</strong><br><br>Straits Times, 19 November 2003<br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,220805,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,220805,00.html?</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The statements made by the minister should sound right - if posted on www.talkingcock.com website un-edited. That's my impression when I first read it. Why the classification?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by cavsg:</div><div class="quote_body">SINGAPORE : Minister of State for Defence Cedric Foo said the Singapore Armed Forces had a 'white horse' classification for NSmen prior to year 2000.<br><br>He said the term was used to identify sons of influential persons to ensure such enlistees were not given preferential treatment.<br><br>Mr Foo was replying to a question in Parliament on Tuesday by Nominated MP Steve Chia.<br><br>Mr Chia asked if there was such a classification and, if so, who qualifies to be classified as a 'white horse' and what privileges are accorded to them.<br><br>Mr Foo said: "All NSmen are treated equally and are deployed in vocations and units based on SAF operational requirements, their medical classification, and their academic and military performance. No NSmen has been accorded special privileges.<br><br>"Prior to year 2000, the term 'white horse' was used to identify sons of influential persons to ensure such enlistees were not given preferential treatment.<br><br>"And their medical classification and vocation assignments are scrupulously fair...since 2000, the SAF does not have a 'white horse' classification for NSmen." - CNA<br><br><a href="http://%20http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/56686/1/.html" rel="nofollow"> http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/56686/1/.html</a></div></blockquote></div>

'You see something as favouritism which may not be the case, and the white horse system was to address such possible misperception.'<br><br>To those who 'nitpick about how many canteen breaks one platoon gets', he said the platoon could have earned the rewards because of the hard work of its men.<br><br><strong>Instructors could also be at fault, he said. 'Like anywhere in society, there will be some people who are more prone to bootlicking, but let me say categorically that it is not the policy in the SAF.'</strong><br><br>He stood by his statement that there was no special treatment, and no one had claimed that white horses had used their influence to get exempted from NS or to downgrade their medical classification.<br><br>'If you hear of a case like that, please let me know,' he said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Letters in the Straits Times Forum page on Tues, Nov 18 2003 on the WH issue.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Do 'white horses' get special privileges?</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">YES</span><br><br>I READ with interest the article, 'No 'white horse' label in NS since 2000' (ST, Nov 12). The revelation of the 'white horse' classification comes as no surprise to Singaporeans who had served or worked in the armed forces, as it was an open secret, whether official or not.<br><br>What is disturbing is the reply from Minister of State for Defence Cedric Foo, who claimed that the classification was to 'ensure that they (the white horses) were not given special privileges'.<br><br>This is an absurd and contradictory statement. The mere existence of this classification would have sounded warning bells to the camp commanders and officers to take extra care of the particular 'white horse' soldier.<br><br>I was enlisted for NS in 1994. My platoon mates and I were at first unaware that there was a 'white horse' among us.<br><br>Therefore, we were surprised at the special privileges accorded us, ranging from more frequent canteen breaks to later wake-up hours and, sometimes, better food servings. It was only at the passing-out parade that the truth dawned on us.<br><br>This issue is of particular concern because some of the ministers and influential Singaporeans' sons are about the age to be called up for national service. It is interesting to know how this group will be treated, even without the official 'white horse' classification.<br><br>YAN DAH WEA<br><br>I SAW for myself the different treatment extended to 'white horses'. During my Basic Military Training, my platoon was just below the Jaguar platoon, which had two 'white horses' - one the son of a minister; the other, the son of a lieutenant-colonel.<br><br>During the four months, I noted at least three very significant differences:<br><br>Once, while doing physical training in the field, we were the first to arrive. An hour later, Jaguar platoon arrived but, after less than an hour, the trainees went back. When we got back, they were already having their canteen break.<br><br>My platoon was given only about three canteen breaks in all. However, Jaguar platoon was seen in the canteen more than 15 times.<br><br>On Saturdays, we would march out to the jetty. In the case of Jaguar platoon, the trainees were taken to the jetty in a three-tonner.<br><br>After completing my BMT, I was sent for further training where I met another 'white horse', the son of a Member of Parliament.<br><br>The training was supposed to be very tough. However, as a 'white horse' was among us, the training turned out to be one of the slackest.<br><br>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang GRC), who is a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Defence, said he could attest to the fact that 'white horses' didn't get an easier time in the army.<br><br>Dr Lee was probably one of the lucky ones who were grouped with the 'white horses' and the privileges were extended to him. One for all, all for one. You can't have the 'white horse' sitting on the bench while the rest of the platoon are doing exercises, right?<br><br>KENNY LIM CHIN LIANG<br><br>I ATTENDED my friend's passing-out parade not long ago. After the parade, everyone queued up to take the ferry from Pulau Tekong to the mainland.<br><br>We queued for 45 minutes to an hour but were still not anywhere near to boarding the ferry.<br><br>However, I saw the base commander usher a recruit and his father to a ferry without their having to queue. Sergeants supervising the boarding kept asking the crowd to make way for them to pass.<br><br>JEFFREY LIM WEI SENG<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">NO</span><br><br>HAVING served national service in the army for the past 15 years, I am pleased to learn that Mindef has removed the 'white horse' classification to correct a misconception and ensure an egalitarian army.<br><br>I can attest to the fact that no 'white horse' (there was one in my platoon) was accorded preferential treatment.<br><br>As Mindef's act of singling out somebody to ensure that he was not given preferential treatment appears self-contradictory, the removal of the classification is a step in the right direction.<br><br>FRANKIE WONG CHEE KIN<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow...<br>Looks like Steve Chia's question has made a few pple red-faced! But it is exactly why we need people to ask questions.... Way to go Steve Chia!!! Hopefully,this will lead to some people being aware that they can't run riot with the system, and this will mean positive changes....<br><br>I have never agreed with the WH rule, and i seriously think it jeopardizes the quality of our forces and how people view the SAF, which is just as vital as our fighting ability. As far as i am concerned, Mr Foo should just come out and admit what it was really for and explain why it was not taken out earlier (if indeed it has been) and provide solid proof that it does not happen today. What Mindef should not do is to sweep everything under the carpet and pretend it will all go away, and take the well-worn route of "It's true because i said so" routine.<br><br>I would think even if they apologise, the public might forgive them..... but, the Singapore government apologise? Yeah, right....<br></div>
