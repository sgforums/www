            <div class='col-md body'>I think that this is one of those "wink wink nudge nudge" things in the SAF. Officially, WH are identified to their unit commanders so that they will not receive special treatment. That is probably written in some Top Secret memo buried in a filing cabinet on Bukit Gombak, so he is speaking the "truth". Unofficially, every unit commander knows that the reason why he is told who the WHs are is to give them special treatment, in violation of the official policy, but in accordance with the unofficial policy. In theory, if a unit commander is caught giving special treatment to the WHs identified to him, he should be punished. Of course, no one is enforcing this at all, quite the opposite.<br><br>COL Koh: CPT Tan! There is a white horse in your company, LCP Lee. You know that according to MINDEF directives you are not to give him special treatment. *wink wink* You know what to do. Don't cause trouble for the regiment, OK? *nudge nudge*<br><br>CPT Tan: Yes, sir! I will assign him to clean the toilets everyday. Why is your eye twitching so much, sir? Sir, I don't like you that much, please don't touch me.<br><br>COL Koh: CPT Tan! Are you purposely being stupid?<br><br>CPT Tan: No, sir! I'm sorry -- he will get extra at least once every two weeks in addition to toilet cleaning duty. We must avoid all appearance of impropriety.<br><br>COL Koh: &amp;^#%! Go get your CSM to see me -- he will understand what to do better than you! Get out!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Does that means a very large percentage of officers are WHs? Are WHs very capable because of their genes? Does that means in times of war WHs don't have to go to the front line because their life is very precious? How does one qualified to b a WHs?[/b]</blockquote>No, not all WH will get into OCS, as long as he exhibit good attitude, at least average results, his probability of getting to OCS is higher than others.<br>The SAF based on my instructor perception, will give better preference to WH and scholars(those who have outstanding results in the A level etc).<br>I was talking abt the 80s, so the current practice might be different, but I doubt it, especially on scholars. One qn, Have anyone even seen a male President's scholars not a OCS cadet?</div>

May be he can used his family wealth and political connection to go to OCS and be an officer. May be he can pay the SAF a <strong> really huge</strong> amount of money to be an officers or may be try to pull strings with the most powerful man in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WH treatment need not necessary take the form of guaranteed postings to 'senang' vocations or OCS (with average capability).<br><br>Take the example of the son of singapore's longest reigning CDF. When he enlisted in the late 80s, his father was SAF's big boss. During his BMT, he was made 'best recruit'. The BMT POP parade was of course attended by his dad, can just imagine the tension and anxiety among the camp staff then. Subsequently he underwent training to be a signal officer (just like his father), and later winning the sword of honor. During his time as a cadet at stagmont camp, he and his cohort of cadets ate at the cookhouse in the officer and senior specialists section. They did not have to queue up for food. Instead these cadets (who would've been treated as lower than low-life scum in other military academies elsewhere) were served by cooks at their tables...However, after his passing out, he was posted to 3 signal, the formation's most 'on' unit. Don't think it would've reflected well on the warrior image of the CDF if his son was posted to 1 signal (most switchoff sig unit).<br><br>Nothing personal against that chap, for he couldn't help who he was, nor his father. It was just something that couldn't be helped. I'm sure the CO of that bmt camp and school of signals were under not-too-subtle pressure from their higher ups to 'take note' of that super WH in their midst. It would have taken a great man of integrity and courage to treat that CDF's son as a normal recruit</div>
