            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Minister of State for Defence Cedric Foo said the Singapore Armed Forces had a 'white horse' classification for NSmen prior to year 2000.<br><br>He said the term was used to identify sons of influential persons to ensure such enlistees were not given preferential treatment.<br><br>Mr Foo was replying to a question in Parliament on Tuesday by Nominated MP Steve Chia.<br><br>Mr Chia asked if there was such a classification and, if so, who qualifies to be classified as a 'white horse' and what privileges are accorded to them.<br><br>Mr Foo said: "All NSmen are treated equally and are deployed in vocations and units based on SAF operational requirements, their medical classification, and their academic and military performance. No NSmen has been accorded special privileges.<br><br>"Prior to year 2000, the term 'white horse' was used to identify sons of influential persons to ensure such enlistees were not given preferential treatment.<br><br>"And their medical classification and vocation assignments are scrupulously fair...since 2000, the SAF does not have a 'white horse' classification for NSmen." - CNA<br><br><a href="http://%20http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/56686/1/.html" rel="nofollow"> http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/56686/1/.html</a></div>

(or he may actually think its being practiced - ivory tower as Bear mentioned. )<br><br>but we all noe how things become different from wat it is supposed to be when it gets practiced. one example is the recent trg incident. regulations disallowed certain actions. ppl on the ground did it anyway.<br><br>so in tt sense, he MAY be telling the truth, u noe. MAYBE the saf really does not recognise white horses in writing.<br><br>but well, the saf is stil an organisation run by humans, some of whom r afraid of offending the wrong persons and in so doing jeopardising their careers. so they may start to treat the white horses as white horses even tho they shudnt. and its not hard to noe who r the white horses even if they arent labelled as such.<br><br>jus my proposition. as a person "on the grd", i thought wat he said ludicrous. but well, i tot we shud try to see the other side of things too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm quiet neutral in this debate. I take the position that like a person being trial for a crime, the accused(in this case the govt) should be treated as innocent until the prosecution can prove otherwise that the accused is guilty. So unless there is concrete prove that the govt is lying. I would have to accept their explaination as throughout my military life, I've never encounter a white horse or happen to know one.</div>
