              <p>They risk their carrer for the lifes of British soldiers.</p>
              <p>For them,the political correct decision is BvS 10 and its upgraded version.</p>
              <p>No body can blame them if further failures of enhanced BvS 10 happen.</p>
              <p>The reasons are brand name---BV 206 and BvS 10.</p>
              <p>But in the first place,why the top brass need to call for a tender if</p>
              <p>they are happy with Viking?The answer is very simple.</p>
              <p>I think The troops and the top brass are not happy with Viking!!</p>
              <p>u guys go to get some tender doc then u will know their reasons!!</p>
              <p>There is a link in the old thread--UK to buy Bronco.</p>
              <p>But for the protections of the lifes of British soldiers,</p>
              <p>the decision maker choose Bronco.The key is over all</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Well, I think he is just about to compartmentalize very well...
                                      which is not surprising given he has long shown an keen ability to
                                      be selective about what he percieves and believes... or maybe he
                                      simply reconstructs reality to whatever he wants to believes and
                                      part of that is needing to shout that out to other people to allow
                                      his unreality to have an "effect" in the real world.</p>
              <p>If you have been here for a while <strong>you would be aware
                                      that he was caught for using clones once. He created a thread under
                                      a false account and then started talking to himself, trying to give
                                      people the impression that at least there were people
                                      supporting.</strong></p>
              <p>When <strong>caught for he, he panicked and made up several
                                      bizzare excuses, accusing me of hacking his account to make him
                                      post under the false account</strong> (which by the way does not
                                      explain how he talks to himself), and then going away for a
                                      while.</p>
              <p>Till this day if you ask him about the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clone inciden</span>t, he will not
                                      dare to talk about it... in fact he treats it like it didn't exist
                                      at all... which is basically what he has been doing all the while.
                                      <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">When something crops up or a
                                      rebuttal comes up that he cannot answer (which is very often), he
                                      simply treats it like he never asked the question in the first
                                      place and moves on, and then later when enough time has passed
                                      he'll raise the same issue in the same way, as if letting a dead
                                      point lie low long enough will allow it to have any effect at
                                      all.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Not suprisingly, we've seen so many of his methods in here that
                                      nobody is really impressed by them anymore, but I suspect he keeps
                                      doing what he does is to snare th<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>e newcomers to this forum who do not know
                                      his history so he can lure them into some pro-Singapore,
                                      anti-rest-of-world monologue...</strong></span></p>
              <p>But of course if we note recently his posts have been becoming
                                      more and more ineffective, I've requested the mods personally to
                                      take action against him if he decides to troll in this forum, so
                                      they're watching him careful.</p>
              <p>I wonder if he'll learn any lesson from the latest incident of
                                      his threads getting pwned.</p>
              <p>But in any case this remains the same- he's all noise and no
                                      bite... i mean has he ever won anybody to his side after 3
                                      disasterous years in here?</p>
              <p>Nope, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>he's just wasting
                                      his energy venting and trying to create a picture of Singapore that
                                      isn't.</strong></span>.. in the meantime he's just providing us
                                      with entertainment and target practice.</p>

              <p>sources on other forums have speculated that STK will not be

              <p>if the bronco screws up in afghanistan. that would be the end of
              it's export prospects. this is really nothing but a beginning.
              would be nice to cap this by describing it as the Bronco's Trial by
              Fire.</p>
              <p>if it suceeds in stan, it will probably raise STK's profile and
              the platform's profile. how many combat proven products that STK

              <p><em>.....<br></em></p>
              <p><em>Despite their versatility, the Afghan arena proved too tough for the
              Vikings. While the vehicles effectively negotiated the terrain and
              provided limited protection against light threats, additional armor
              protection required to protect from the heavier threats typical to the
              Afghan conditions severely limited their operational capability and
              necessitated rapid replacement. Consequently, MoD was seeking a
              heavier, better protected vehicle to maintain the high level of
              mobility and operational flexibility without compromising protection. </em></p>
              <p><em> Bronco
              with 18 ton GVW was selected for this role, not only for the added
              payload capability (which translates to capability to carry heavier
              armor) but also since its the curb already includes <span style="color: #ff0000;">integral armor....</span></em></p>
              <p><em>The Bronco's articulated design delivers exceptional mobility across a
              wide range of terrain and climate. The basic vehicle is delivered with
              an armor protection which could be augmented to meet MoD requirements,
              primarily to increase protection against roadside bombs. Bronco will
              also deliver considerable increases in range, payload and internal
              capacity over incumbent vehicles currently being used in Afghanistan.</em> EOQ</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>2. The last 2 paragraphs in the (Jane's.Pl read the above
                                          link)article reads like Jane's lobbying on behalf BAE Systems,
                                          especially since:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>(i) it is clear that the Viking has reached the limit of its
                                          capabilities (to add on armour) and that only ST Kinetics' Bronco
                                          ATTC fit the bill of the UK's Warthog requirements;<br> <br> (ii) Jane's obscures the fact (in it's reporting) that what BAE
                                          Systems is offering to MoD is not what UK wants (even after the
                                          proposed upgrade). What BAE Systems is lobbying for is a change in
                                          the requirements on the Warthog contract;<br> <br> (iii) Jane's focuses instead on the fact that the Viking is
                                          battle-proven and is easier on the current logistic support system
                                          - in fact, Jane's managed to subtly weave in the ideas that this is
                                          the Bronco's first export sale - neglecting to mention that the
                                          Bronco has been in service for 8 years;<br> <br> (iv) Jane's also fails to mention the Bronco's <span style="color: #ff0000;">advanced patented coupling</span> that links the

              </blockquote> 3. I say, shame on your quality of reporting - Mr Tim Ripley.<br> <br> 4. I also say, shame on you - Mr ' luv2surf' - for flame bating and
                                          trying to say that a readily available military off-the-shelf
                                          (MOTS) solution is just a cheap imitation.<br> <br> 5. As I have pointed out in my earlier post, there are 600 Bronco
                                          ATTCs in service and ST Kinetics developed a number of versions of
                                          the Bronco. ST Kinetics is even working on a r<span style="color: #ff0000;">obotic version of the
                                          Bronco ATT</span>C. In the interest of fairness, I've set out the article
                                          in the 3 Dec 2008 issue of Jane's below:</blockquote>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Jane's focuses instead on the fact that the Viking is

              <p>If it is battle proven,then UK MOD no need to get a replacement lah,</p>
              <p>stupid!!Viking is tested but failed,not proven!!</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NATIONAL PRIDE</span></strong></p>
              <p>Anyway,UK MOD put down national pride to ask SG to make</p>
              <p>a vehicle to save more lifes of British service wo/men!!</p>
              <p>I salute their courage.UK decision maker know the priority well.</p>
              <p>The life of service wo/men is No.1.</p>
              <p>So far,other western countries cant do this.</p>
              <p>Besides,they(u know wat i mean) insist most of the military jobs</p>
              <p>MUST be done on own soil.But they do not look at their track</p>
              <p>records .So,u can read from recent history this kind of mind set</p>
              <p>leads to big joke.If fact,the story is developing and u can read</p>
              <p>from news.For example,....i dunt say lah...Too boring.</p>
              <p>They insist,say 70% of  JOBS TO BE DONE LOCALLY.</p>
              <p>@@@@@@@@</p>

              <p><em>Viking has provided an excellent capability in Afghanistan, giving us
                  unparalleled access to areas around the Helmand river. But, although we
                  are providing <br><a name="column_29WS"></a><strong>29 Oct 2008 : Column 29WS</strong><br> some further enhancements to its protection, we have reached the limit
                  of its ability to carry extra weight and protection. This is why we
                  intend to replace Viking in Afghanistan with an alternative, better
                  protected, high mobility vehicle, to be known as Warthog; work is
                  underway to identify the right vehicle to fulfil this role. We will
                  procure over 100 new vehicles with deliveries starting at the end of
