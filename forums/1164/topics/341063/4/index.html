              <p>the problem with the viking and its replacement by the ATTC is
                                      not because its a incompetent vehicle platform or that is so flawed
                                      that it cant be rectified. the problem with the viking / BvS10, is
                                      that it has <strong>reached the limits of its capability
                                      growth</strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">i.e, you can only add on so much
                                      armour to a proven platform. additional armour costs greater wear
                                      and tear on the engine and transmission. use under combat
                                      conditions implies increased wear and tear and
                                      mileage.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>the viking as a platform is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">combat exhausted</span>.</strong> it has reached
                                      the <strong>end of its capability upgrade curve</strong>. any
                                      further upgrades would probably NOT be cost effective and wasting
                                      money on a worn-out / overused platform.</p>
              <p>2 years of combat wear and tear under operational conditions
                                      have probably subjected the viking to the equivalent of about 10
                                      years worth of peacetime operations. <strong>is it worth spending
                                      on a SLEP / refurb program on something that has no future
                                      potential for growth without incurring a performance penalty

                                      information without thinking them through ?</p>
              <p>what is right armour ? does right armour mean heavy armour ?
                                      what kinds of armour platforms are you talking about ? what
                                      qualities of that kinda armour ? what kind of terrain that armour
                                      is operating on ? how reliable is that armour under certain terrain
                                      conditions ? does that armor platform have capability upgrade
                                      options ? does it have future growth potential ?</p>
              <p>you obviously have failed to think this through. dont waste my

              <p>do u mean the Viking protection is too heavy for its engine?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>absolute bullshit.</p>
              <p>reduce the weight of protection, upsize engine and so ? whats
                                      your point ?</p>
              <p>why ? dont realize that your objectives completly dont make
                                      sense ?</p>
              <p>1) uparmour for more protection = less speed and strain on
                                      engine/transmission, ceterius paribus</p>
              <p>2) lesser armour for lesser protection = more speed, less wear
                                      and tear on engine/transmission, ceterius paribus</p>
              <p>3) wartime opeartions means heavier use of vehicle in
                                      comparatively more punishing conditions as compared to peacetime
                                      operations (like DUH!)</p>
              <p>4) 1 and 2 are mutually exclusive. not possible to acheive both
                                      without substantial upgrades and downtime. coupled with fact 3,
                                      which makes the expense needed to refurbish and reequip the viking
                                      for such a purpose, not cost efficient.</p>
              <p>5) the viking has no future potential growth capacity unless it
                                      were given 1. it can be. but at great cost, downtime (and reduction
                                      in number of vikings avaliable for service in afghanistan) and
                                      little benefit for Long term plans (poor future LR prospects)</p>
              <p>consider these 5 simple points. and you will arrive at the same
                                      conclusion i did. they are irreconcillable objectives. thats
                                      probably why the UK MOD chose the ATTC over the BvS10. your mind is
                                      as thick as mud</p>
              <p>might as well send UK MOD soldiers on roller blade skates and
                                      equip em with kangaroo jump boots. can jump away from mines and
                                      IEDs if we follow you</p>

                                      that it cant be rectified. the problem with the viking / BvS10, is
                                      that it has <strong>reached the limits of its capability
                                      growth</strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">i.e, you can only add on so much
                                      armour to a proven platform. additional armour costs greater wear
                                      and tear on the engine and transmission. use under combat
                                      conditions implies increased wear and tear and
                                      mileage.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>the viking as a platform is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">combat exhausted</span>.</strong> it has reached
                                      the <strong>end of its capability upgrade curve</strong>. any
                                      further upgrades would probably NOT be cost effective and wasting
                                      money on a worn-out / overused platform.</p>
              <p>2 years of combat wear and tear under operational conditions
                                      have probably subjected the viking to the equivalent of about 10
                                      years worth of peacetime operations. <strong>is it worth spending
                                      on a SLEP / refurb program on something that has no future
                                      potential for growth without incurring a performance penalty
                                      ?</strong></p>
              <p>oh waitaminit, isnt that your poor little lion's problem ?
                                      cannot think for himself ? only copy and paste articles and
                                      information without thinking them through ?</p>
              <p>what is right armour ? does right armour mean heavy armour ?
                                      what kinds of armour platforms are you talking about ? what
                                      qualities of that kinda armour ? what kind of terrain that armour
                                      is operating on ? how reliable is that armour under certain terrain
                                      conditions ? does that armor platform have capability upgrade
                                      options ? does it have future growth potential ?</p>
              <p>you obviously have failed to think this through. dont waste my
                                      time with your spam. come back to get your ass pwned when you have
                                      a more thoroughly thought through nonsense idea.</p>

              <p>The vehicles will be used by the UK armed forces in Afghanistan beginning in July 2008.</p>
              <p>"The BvS10 Viking has proven its worth while being used by
              British troops in Afghanistan," said Tommy Gustafsson-Rask, Marketing
              and Sales Director for BAE Systems. "The Afghan terrain can be quite
              varied and our armoured all-terrain, quick-to-deploy vehicles provide
              troops with protection and the ability to move wherever and whenever
              they are required.</p>
              <p>The BvS10 Viking consists of two tracked vehicle units linked
              by a steering mechanism. The vehicle can operate in temperatures from
              -46C to +49C, providing it with multi-role, worldwide, rapid deployment
              operational capabilities in jungle, desert and Arctic conditions. The
              vehicles are available in four variants-the repair recovery vehicle,
              the command vehicle, the troop carrier and the ambulance.</p>
              <p>The UK's Royal Marines received the first delivery of the
              vehicles in July 2003. This delivery brings the total number of
              vehicles produced for UK MoD to 143. The total number of produced
              vehicles is well over 200.</p>
              <p>The contract was awarded to the company's Swedish subsidiary,<strong> BAE Systems AB through their Hagglunds unit. The vehicles will be
              built, assembled and completed in Ãrnskldsvik, Sweden.</strong></p>

The <span style="font-weight: bold;">harsh climate and rugged terrain quickly wore out vehicles and equipment</span>. Vehicle fuel systems, cooling systems, and road wheels were particularly susceptible to the harsh conditions. As a result, Soviet maintenance personnel were forced to <span style="font-weight: bold;">accelerate scheduled maintenance and services on a variety of weapon systems and vehicles.</span> Although the 40th Army had a Material support Brigade and separate tank, motor vehicle, and artillery repair battalions, it still "lacked sufficient maintenance personnel and facilities during the entire war."[38] The inadequate support resulted in poor readiness, poor maintenance procedures, unsafe repairs, cannibalization of repair parts and a tendency not to conserve the use of vehicles</span></p>

              <p>dont talk to me about testing and field experience. two complete different matters altogether. another factor which distinguishes armchair generals from the field commander, or the pimply, acned 16 year old kid from a trained soldier.</p>
              <p>field testing and trials are only meant to simulate the conditions that a vehicle is supposed to encounter. they are not meant to replicate or test the abuse a vehicle gets from a 6 or 9 months tour of duty. think about that for a second and you ought to come to the conclusion of how idiotic that sounds. u wont buy a car without giving it a test drive or putting it through some spins to test and try to find out the weaknesses of the car would you ? but maybe you would, given your intellect, cant say for sure. classic self-pwn from you.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">this is not a clear cut issue. its complicated and involves many layers. bad case study if you asked me.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">for instance, observe the Bv206 and BvS10 procurement process</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">1) royal marines are one of the largest Bv206 and BvS10 operators. note the procurement of the ATTC is breaking away from this tradition. anyone asked them what they felt about this ? anyone come out openly to say if the ATTC is more competent than the BvS10 under combat situations ? till the day they do, my belief is still in the BvS10. this is a understory/careful layer that has yet to be played out or explored in detail by anyone yet.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">2) according to deagel, BvS10 are expected to have a service life of 20 years. but even with its planned procurement of the ATTC, 14 BvS10 were procured just this january (just before the announcement). previously, the RM ordered a command and control, ambulance and special use variants just the year before in june.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">tell me what does this mean ? is the BvS10 going to be phased out completely ? why risk capital investment in old stock/supersceded stuff or weak underarmoured things ? thats a pretty strong hint of service rivalry and disagreement over procurement if you ask me. im not privy to any information more that what you have access to. but the sheer fact that i use my brain to think allows me much more information about this than you do.</p>

              <p><em>''To fully appreciate the strengths and versatility of the Bronco, one needs to look at its ability to be configured for a wide range of deployment duties. Leveraging on its cross-terrain capability,<br>the Bronco can be converted into a mobile-ambulance, in which stretchers and other medical equipment are installed into the rear unit. Another important usage is in the general recovery of other vehicles or equipment. In this instance, the rear unit can be converted into a general recovery unit. The Bronco can also be converted into a mortar carrier, where the weapon is mounted onto the rear unit.</em></p>
              <p><em><br>When deployed to Afghanistan, the British Armyâs Broncos (which will be renamed âWarthogsâ) will provide enhanced protection<br>from mines and improvised explosives. This protection is critical given that the British Armyâs current ATTCs operating in Afghanistan have suffered heavy losses from such explosives used by the Taliban forces. The first shipment of Broncos will arrive on British shores in the middle of this year. They will be further modified and reconfigured to meet the operational demands<br>of the Afghan battlefield.</em>''</p>
