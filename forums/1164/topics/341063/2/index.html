              <p>he's just being a jackass, there are other serious mil nut forums in singapore. this one isnt serious whatsoever. its more like pubz, and lionnoisy is the king jackass that frequently starts the pub brawls</p>

              <p>eh abang !</p>
              <p>dont like that lah, please examine the facts and truths from offcial sources first (to quote lionnoisy)</p>
              <p>like it or not, Lionnoisy has being dumping his crap all over SGforums. not just the milnuts forums, but the political forums (where he blatantly claims to be Pro-PAP and  flamebaiting and attracting brickbats all the time)</p>
              <p>Lionnoisy is a monster out of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> definition and Monster is a value judgement that really depends on your perspective. I personally wouldnt call him a monster even though i think he's a first class idiot.</p>
              <p>In case you havent realize, the line is drawn in the manner of which we respond to lionnoisy. its always a rearguard action, a defensive manuever. no one attacks or calls lionnoisy a monster out of choice, but responds to him. ITs not a offensive gesture, its not aggressive in nature. its always passive.</p>
              <p>That degree of response, depending on the individual usually ranges from</p>
              <p>A) offering a logical rebuttal (which never works)</p>
              <p>B) making fun of him (which usually does)</p>
              <p>and which of either response that you disagree with ? response A is not appropriate since he just ignores it and floods with a wall of text. Response B is morally and Ethically wrong ?</p>
              <p>lets not apply value judgements here. Lionnoisy is making a fool of himself and is to be treated like a fool. its measure for measure. Dont try to claim the moral high ground by saying we are all bullying lionnoisy. He's behaving like a clown. ought to be treated like one.</p>
              <p>remember too,  we never labelled lionnoisy as a monster. Its you who are labelling him as a monster.</p>

              <p>which part of MOD says they not happy with the viking ?
                                          everything ive posted here seems to suggest otherwise.</p>
              <p>dont be a clown and persist on your one-track logic. you want
                                          relevance ? its staring right in your face. relavance which you
                                          cant deny or run away from lionnoisy.</p>
              <p>fact : BvS10 combat proven, combat tested, well regarded<br> unknown : Bronco, not combat proven, not combat tested. operational
                                          use yes. but operational use under extreme conditions, NO.</p>
              <p>fact : Lionnoisy cannot differentiate between BvS10 and BvS10
                                          mark II and tries to cover up for it by editing post later</p>
              <p>3) why cannot answer my  point about  not being combat
                                          proven / climate conditions ? too stupid to think ? post other
                                          people's post without thinking ?</p>
              <p>why cant u read and differentiate the difference between viking
                                          mk I and mk 2 ? after pwnage then change the original post ?</p>
              <p>(self-pwn)(self-pwn) = self-pwn²</p>
              <p>why are you asking me about the specs of ST eng brochure ? if ST
                                          eng PDF say bronco can fly to the moon and come back you'd believe
                                          ? if ST eng say it produce AMAP-ADS would you believe ? if ST eng
                                          brochure tells me that Lionnoisy is a dumbass would i believe ?
                                          sure certainly ! i can believe that.</p>
              <p>how about this :</p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://i37.tinypic.com/2vvntvn.jpg"><img src="http://i37.tinypic.com/2vvntvn.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="410"></a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>any proof of the bronco doing this in real life ?</p>
              <p>quoting a ST eng brochure isnt evidence. it isnt facts. its just
                                          shows your level of desperation when u cant find stuff to post.</p>
              <p>flogging a dead horse again my dear lion ? or should i quote you
                                          on this ?</p>
              <p>explaination : <strong>Yes, its OBVIOUS you DONT K(NO)W
                                          ANYTHING</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) so now you resort to 3rd hand postings , not even
                                          acknowledging the user who posted the content and the poster who
                                          posted the link ?</p>
              <p>lol... whatever happened to your OFFICIAL SOURCE and OFFICIAL
                                          SITE and OFFICIAL evidence ?</p>
              <p>you realized that this is about credible as wiping your soiled
                                          bottom with a tissue paper and trying to pass it off as currency
                                          ?</p>
              <p>the poster's point (i) is rendered moot, the mk2 viking has an
                                          added capacity to carry and have more heavy armour</p>
              <p>(ii) i cant contest since i havent read the Jane's article</p>
              <p>(iii) the poster entirely discounts the fact that operational
                                          conditions under combat fire affect a vehicle's SOP and management
                                          quite differently from normal situation.</p>
              <p>i.e , if you have a viking, you more or less know where the
                                          quirks/flaws/weaknesses are, rather than a untested/ unfamiliar
                                          platform whose reliability under combat strain and conditions are
                                          not known.</p>
              <p>i.e u cant compare operating lim chu kang Area D with
                                          Afghanistan Helmland province. you have so many other variables
                                          like</p>
              <p>-threat level</p>
              <p>-environmental</p>
              <p>-humidity</p>
              <p>and many others i cant be bothered to mention for the sheer
                                          straightfowardness of it.</p>
              <p>would they rather have a platform when the realize the 2nd
                                          vehicle/coupled module may roll over in battle conditions ? would
                                          they have a platform when they realise that the hydraulics may fail
                                          under certain temperature conditions ?</p>
              <p>combat proven and tested is a invaluable factor that shows that
                                          the platform is stable and tested and can be relied upon to
                                          function when called to duty. Why you make so much noise about
                                          Wedgetail and orphan platforms in the australia thread when you
                                          dont acknowledge the Bronco being in the same position ?</p>
              <p>why the bigotry lionnoisy ? why ? double- standards ? answer the
                                          fucking qn here.</p>
              <p>point (iv) no contest. its one of te selling points of the
                                          Bronco, modularity = versatality</p>
              <p>point (V) : i m sure that knowledgeable poster would be aware of
                                          that AMAP-ADS dosent come standard on all broncos.</p>
              <p>I m equally sure that the german IBD passive armour package is
                                          neither standard issue and is avaliable as a modular add on.</p>
              <p>suffice to say, its like saying, WOW, this car has all these
                                          accessories, but in reality, you have no interest in acquiring all
                                          of them. big deal really.</p>
              <p>ive rebutted your points and supposedly non "OFFICIAL
                                          CONFIRMATION AND PROOF" nonsense.</p>
              <p>now, tell me, whats a queene ? i m still eagerly awaiting that
                                          one. tell me the performance of the BvS 10 ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yes you idiot, the Viking Mk2 can do all that and more. even
                                          the current viking can haul a SR mortar. simply proves my point you
                                          never ever read the links you post or what others post ?</p>
              <p>can the bronco haul an ATGM team behind ? is the Bronco Air
                                          conditioned ?</p>

              <p> even  the BV206 can function as a mortar carrier.</p>
              <p>your talk about the viking lacking these capabilities is a
                                          NON-issue. their class of vehicles offer a degree of modularity and
                                          flexibility in operations.</p>

              <p>The defense of SG is top priority,not the $$$.2 nd,ST is a

              <p>No singaporean want to associate with US army who carry a SAR 21,</p>
              <p>and a 40 mm GL with ABSM!!This will create troubles for SG when</p>
              <p>people watching news and see  Yankee carring a SAR 21!!</p>
              <p>Then they remember Oh Singapore."  &gt;&gt; LionNoisy</p>
              <p>I am just curious .. whats the big deal about bidding for M4 replacement ?? Its all about $$$$ especially in this bad economy .. If ST K can win the bid to replace the M4s .. we are talking about alot of $$$ , not to mention our pride of the SAR 21 being M-I-S ( Made in Singapore )</p>
              <p>To have the US soldiers carry SAR 21s is just like having the terrorists carrying China or Russian Made AK kalashinovs .. Do we associate the terrorists with China or Russia ? No rite ? Those were your own views .. sadly . that i view as biased and self-opininated ..</p>
              <p>For the Record , I wouldnt mind the US army carrying SAR21s with GL .. and I am Singaporean. I would say Yay to any friendly country interested in our defence products.. why not ? So to say NO Singaporean would want to associate  .. would be a unfair statement rite ? This would be probably why other forumers are quick to rebutt you.</p>
