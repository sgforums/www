            <div class='col-md body'>Basically the story goes like this.<br><br>Air France conducts flights to Algeria from Paris.The crew and pilots are volunteers as i have read, reason being is Algeria was in a state of civil war during that time.An Islamic political party wanted to take control over Algeria and transform it into an Islamic state, by hook or by crook.<br><br>The 4 hijackers disguised as presidential police and they entered the plane. They began inspecting the passengers' passports and demanded that the passengers close all of the window shutters and empty their personal belongings into black plastic bags. After "inspecting", they refused to leave the plane and immediately revealed themselves as not real policemen, but hijackers. Twenty five year old Abdul Abdullah Yahia and the other three members of the Armed Islamic Group (Groupe Islamique ArmÃ©, or GIA) brandished their AK-47 and Uzi automatic weapons and demanded cooperation from the 220 passengers and 12 flight crew.<br><br>At 14:00, one of the hijackers discovered that there was an Algerian policeman onboard the flight and quickly brought him to the attention of Yahia. The hijackers dragged the passenger up to the front of the passenger compartment and shot him in the back of the head. A few minutes later the hijackers made contact with the control tower and demanded that the plane be allowed to take off. After their initial request was not met, they dumped the body of the Algerian police officer onto the runway and stated that if their demands were not immediately met, they would execute another hostage.<br><br>Philippe Legorjus, the Chief Security consultant for Air France and former team leader of the GIGN, was on the phone with the commander of the Algerian Army's commando force, which had the Airbus A300 surrounded. The hijackers wanted the Algerian Army to remove the mobile stairway and tire chocks to allow them to take off, but the Algerians were not going to give in very easily. A crisis management team assembled in Paris at the corporate headquarters of Air France decided that the best choice was to let the plane take off toward France, to allow the GIGN to intervene.<br><br>French Prime Minister Ã‰douard Balladur asked that the women and children be released in return for allowing the aircraft to fly to Paris. The GIA agreed to these terms and released 63 passengers. However when the order was given to the Algerian colonel to have his men remove the staircase and chocks, he refused. The enraged hijackers executed a Vietnamese diplomat and threw his body onto the runway. An Air France flight attendant on duty at the time later recounted that the hijackers had mistaken him as a "Buddhist with diplomas" instead of a diplomat who happened to be a Buddhist, and he had also made the further mistake of taking several bottles of wine with him when the terrorists summoned him.<br><br>The negotiations lasted throughout Christmas Day, but remained at a stalemate between the Algerian elite commandos surrounding the aircraft, and the Algerian and French governments, who wanted a GIGN unit to assist the Algerian Elite Commandos. At 21:30 Christmas night, a young employee of the French embassy came on the radio and said that the hijackers were going to kill him if they didn't let the plane take off in thirty minutes. Still at a standstill with the Algerian colonel, the hijackers kept their word and at 22:00 they shot the employee in the head and dumped him out. The GIA stated that they were going to kill one person every half hour until the plane was allowed to fly to Paris.<br><br>During the intense standoff, authorities learned that the aircraft was laden with more than twenty sticks of dynamite. Captain Denis Favier of the French GIGN put together a plan to storm the plane and kill the hijackers with minimum loss of life to the passengers. The team trained on an identical French Airbus until they were confident that they could implement their attempts on Flight 8969. After leaving, the Airbus containing the hostage rescue teams flew to Algiers but was not given clearance to land. After circling for more than two hours, the aircraft was diverted to land in Spain to await further instructions.<br><br>After nearly forty hours of intense negotiations and the loss of three lives, the Algerian Colonel gave in and removed the mobile staircase and wheel chocks at 02:00 the morning of December 26th. The negotiation team chose to divert the flight to Marseille International Airport, some five hundred miles south of Paris. Air traffic controllers in the tower secretly communicated to the crew of Flight 8969 to tell the hijackers that they didn't have enough fuel to make it all the way to Paris; the plane had also used up too much fuel by running its generators during the standoff in Algiers.<br><br>The French special forces left Spain and landed just twenty minutes before 8969 touched down at Marseille-Marignane Airport, on the coast of France, just after 03:30. Tired from the two day stand off, the hijackers maintained radio silence until late morning when the hijackers demand they receive nearly 27 tons of fuel; considerably more than the 9 needed to make the five hundred mile flight to Paris. It was suspected that the hijackers wanted as much fuel as possible in order to make the Airbus into a flying bomb; the concern was that GIA planned to either fly the plane into the Eiffel Tower in Paris, or simply blow it up over the city.<br><br>Wikipedia.org</div>
