            <div class='col-md body'>How will our F-16C fare against a single seater J-10? This is taking into consideration that J-10 is deemed more comparable with the Typhoon and the Rafale.(look below for quote)<br><br><blockquote>...DOD seemed to offer a re-assessment of the capabilities of ChinaÂ’s F-10 ( J-10 in Chinese) fighter, which it previously had compared to the F-16 Block 30. (See Â“Washington Watch: Chinese Military Is Catching UpÂ—Fast,Â” September 2005, p. 12.) In this latest version of the annual China report, the Pentagon said the F-10 is probably more comparable to the Eurofighter Typhoon and French Rafale, considered among the top three fighters in the world today, after the US F-22A.</blockquote><a href="http://www.afa.org/magazine/July2006/0706watch.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.afa.org/magazine/July2006/0706watch.asp </a><br><br></div>

RSAF bought the F-15SG Strike eagle, not the F-15D eagle.  The SG is actually a variant of the F-15E Strike Eagle.  Differences between the Eagles and Strike eagles is that the Strike Eagles are optimized in strike and deep strike roles.<br><br>The J10 has not been combat proven and still very little is known about this aircraft's capability.

So, usually, the instant Turn rate is the major factor linked to measure the fighterÂ’s nose pointing ability thus maneuverability. Remember, how a far inferior Greek Mirage 2000 in terms of sustained turn rate usually won over Turkish F-16 C/D? because, the delta winged Mirage 2000 got a better instant turn rate that allow the Mirage2000 always pointed its nose to F-16C/D 1st and shooting the all-aspect IR AAM.   DonÂ’t like Mirage 2000, J-10 actually got a very similar T/W to F-16 C/D. so both F16 &amp; J10 wonÂ’t have too much difference in terms of  Sustained Turn rate, even the F16 got a slight better sustained turn rate, the dog fight just wonÂ’t stretch too long because todayÂ’s high-G, all aspect/high offbore sight AAM just so advanced, you only need roughly point your fighterÂ’s nose towards the enemy within a fair distance, you could shoot and usually the missile will finish the job for you.<br></div>

Any encounter will be suicidal for both.<br><br>The J-10 nose look a bit like the F-4 Phantom nose in shape and size.</div>
