            <div class='col-md body'>The Anza MK-II is a portable shoulder-fired, IR homing air defence weapon system similar to the US Stinger missiles. It has a maximum slant range of 5 kilometers, though in the future the maximum range will be increased to almost double. The Anza MK-II is an improved version of Anza MK-I(which is actually a copy of SA-7 ), which was handed over to Pakistan Armed Forces in January 1990.<br><br>The Anza MK-II was inducted in Pakistan Army in September 1994, and has been locally produced in Pakistan since October 1994. The improved version is a lightweight portable system incorporating a contact-fuse warhead. The main differences from the earlier version are in its high speed (600 M/Sec), accuracy and sustained velocity, high maneuverability and all aspect engagement capability.<br><br>But if the seeker is based on the SA-7 , it was known to be easily affected by the sun.<br><br>Since MAF have SA-18 Igla which is the more advance of the Russian man portable missiles ,why they still go for the Anza which is the improved version of a older SA-7???<br><br>BTW, how could I attached a image file from my HDD to this forum??[/img]</div>
