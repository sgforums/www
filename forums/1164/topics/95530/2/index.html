Anything with NCC on their shoulders are not worth saluting by any [b]SAF</strong> people.[/b]</blockquote>I think you are wrong.<br><br>NCC as a whole itself , it is actually run by SAF, not a civilian organisation . It is more like a quasi-military establishment. Let me explain from what I know abt NCC in the 70s.<br><br>All NCC training camps are all manned by SAF's NSF(SISPEC trained) as instructors , echik &amp; staff officers are also from SAF and they are all full time regulars, otherwise how could those NCC camps have an armskote full of M-16s!!!!!<br><br>The running of those camps is like any SAF schools albeit less "on" , instead of training NSF, they are training NCC cadets.<br><br>I remember someone here did say he was posted a NCC training camps as a instructor after he has passed out from SAFINCOS.<br><br>The LTC that someone mentioned is most probably a abt to retire staff officer in SAF seconded to NCC to be commandant or some staff officers of NCC , so they should be given the due respect.<br><br>Now the question is , are the NCC/school teacher officer also a NS officers? I am sure some of the young males graduates teachers are NS officers, if I am to chose which teachers to become NCC officer, I will choose those that are NS officers right?<br><br>Afterall, I believe there are many of them nowadays.<br><br>And also a few years back, there was a  report , that SAF was sponsoring training for abt to retire career officers to become teacher , &amp; some of them actually went for nite classes to get their degree, I know one of them.<br><br>So some of the NCC officers could be super laojiao former SAF officers!!!!</div>

And all training are conducted by SAF instructors.<br><br>So they are trained in some military skills that is useful during their SG's NS military training.<br><br>MY's NS training so far do not really contain any military training, more on physical training &amp; confidance building mainly for national integration and racial harmony , so far I think there is no weapon training at all, so more like outward bound school.<br><br>There are also many cases of crime and indiscipline in MY NS too.

Afterall it's the bars and crabs that we are saluting not the person per se. Yes, these ranks are not Singapura ranks but since NCC is affiliated to SAF, IMHO, just give these officers some basic recognition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Looks good on us too, as in being polite and respectful soldiers.

But my point stems from the fact that, how many of times have we have to salute people whom we don't respect?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> What Major Winters said is very true. I for one would love to only salute people that I really respect.<br><br>No offence, and I truly agree with what you say.

And being in uniform and of a lower rank, it's natural that we salute? At least that's what I feel lah.
