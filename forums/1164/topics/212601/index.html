Both our countries face threats such as terrorism, religious extremism, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."<br><br>On his part, Minister Teo noted that trade and cultural relations between Russia and Singapore are becoming increasingly strong.<br><br>He added that the two sides agreed to start discussions on defence policy areas.<br><br>In response to a query on possible arms purchases, Mr Teo said: "We did discuss this issue. I spoke with the Minister as well as the head of Mil-tech agency in Russia and invited them to send their experts to Singapore so that we can understand better the full capability that the Russian defence industry has, and also, the possible export, and the defence industry can better understand the equipment priorities of Singapore."<br><br>Currently, Russia does not have a well-established military relationship with Singapore.<br><br>Even though no official agreements were signed, experts say Mr Teo's visit is significant as it lays a very important groundwork for developing future cooperation between the two countries.<br><br>Mr Teo said: "Russia is a major country in the world. It will be useful for us to understand Russia's world view, how Russia sees Asia, how Russia sees Southeast Asia and also, it will be useful for us to put our views across to Russia. In this way, there are more opportunities for us to work together to contribute to a safe and secure world which we can pursue for the development and progress of the people."<br><br>The Defence Minister's first official visit to Russia will not only be limited to Moscow.<br><br>Before returning to Singapore, Mr Teo will also get to enjoy the beauty of St Petersburg, also known as the Russian cultural capital. - CNA/ir/ls </blockquote>exactly what weapon is singapore looking at from russia?

Examples of countries using this family of SAMs includes Malaysia, China,<br>Pakistan just to name a few. Some have even made derivatives of it on their own.

I am hoping they will be interested in other Russian military products and technology to produce the S-300/S-400, Club missiles and supersonic cruise missiles such as the Brahmos.<br><br>Its a common misconception that Russian weapons are inferior to their Western counterparts such as higher cost of upkeep in the long term.<br><br>This may not be true for all aspects. One advantage is that the Russians may have more to offer us as compared to the West. They are more willing to sell high technology systems which the West are reluctant to sell or will slap many restrictions on their usage (remember the AIM-120C missiles?). Secondly Russian arms are known for their lower cost and ruggedness in adverse conditions. So if the pros outweigh the cons and it suits our needs then we shouldn't restrict ourselves from considering Russian military systems.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No need chim MLRS this is good enough. TOS-1. 200mm Thermobaric, short range rockets. No need to let the foor soldiers chiong up the hill and clear the fortifications. This weapon has seen action in Chechen battles by the Russians, quite effective.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Iglas are reputed to be good. They are credited with downings of many Western aircraft in the recent Gulf wars. They may not be as good as Stingers. but they cost hell of a lot less. They may be  crude - but they work - just  like AK47s or 74s. Just fire two Iglas instead of one Stinger - you still get a downed enemy plane or heli  at a lower cost - also makes the bean counters happy.</div>

The M113 cant get up on to building rooftops as yet. In built up areas, u need to get ur AA high so that u have maximum line of sight/fire.<br><br>Imagine orchard road... the M113 Igla is not going to be very helpful there.
