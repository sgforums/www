On April 1, 1944 nearly 100 citizens<br>of the town of Schaffhausen were accidentally killed by Allied bombers<br>who mistook the area as a German target. Less than one year later, on<br>February 22, 1945, 16 people in Schaffhausen and nine in Stein-am-Rein<br>were also killed in a similar bombing expedition. Some historians have<br>theorized that the bombings were not mistakes, and were in response to<br>Schaffhausen munitions factories supplying arms to the nearby Nazis.<br>This theory, however, has yet to be proven, and records are still sealed regarding these events.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very informative LoudMonkey.<br><br>My grandfather was on the German border in WWII defending Switzerland from the Nazi's and was an observer to the bombs that were dropped by Allied forces in Swiss territory. The Swiss could have scrambled squadrons to shoot down the Allied planes in retaliation but choose to suffer the loss of citizens instead; they did not view the Allies with hostile intent.<br><br>Having a choice to serve in either the Swiss Army or the SAF, I chose the latter, but I admire their system and the dedication of most of the militia.<br></div>
