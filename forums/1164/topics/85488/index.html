            <div class='col-md body'>Hope this will give some answers:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>THE SWISS MILITARY TRADITION</strong><br><br>Compulsory military service in militia army<br><br>Switzerland has an old tradition of neutrality and self-defence which has prevented the country being drawn in to the major European conflicts of the last two centuries.<br><br>The Swiss army has always been based on a militia system. This should not be confused with a reservist army. Under the militia system, every able-bodied male citizen goes through regular military training during a minimum period of 22 years, i.e. from the age of20 to 42 (officer:52).<br><br>Annual shooting training for all soldiers<br><br>Military education starts with a 15 weeks basic training. After that, the soldiers will be called to further training for a period of 3 weeks every two years (NCOs and officers having additional time to serve). Furthermore, annual target practice which is done at a local target range is compulsory.<br><br>Privates and lower ranking NCO's are issued a 5.56mm assault rifle, whereas higher NCO's and officers are armed with semi-automatic handguns. In order to be able to mobilize within the shortest possible time, all military personel keep their complete personel equipment at home, including gas mask, weapons and 20 rounds of ammunition for pistols as well as the new automatic rifles (24 rounds for the older 7.5mm rifle).<br><br>Weapons and ammunition (kept in a sealed container) have to be stored under lock and key. They must be presented for regular inspections, where it is also controlled whether the ammunition is still properly sealed. Misuse of military weapons, as well as failure to store them securely, is severley punished by military justice (3 days to 3 years detention, considerably more in case of mobilization).<br><br>Importance of personal responsibility<br><br>Due to the prolonged and strict drilling in manipulating weapons under the special circumstances of military exercises, the Swiss citizen-soldier develops a high sense of personal responsibility in the use of weapons. Althought here are no official statistics available it is well known fact there are very few incidents where misuse of military weapons is involved.<br><br>It goes without saying that people who do not live up to the required responsibility standards lose their right to carry their personal military weapon.<br><br></span><br><br>On a personal note, I have seen for myself how the swiss military servicemen carry their guns - on trains, on the streets, and they don't keep it in their haversack. The guns are hanged from their haversack, where everyone can see them. But they must be in uniform.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Found new info here from a book review:<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>Target Switzerland</strong><br>Review by: Dave Kopel<br><br>Book review of "Target Switzerland: Swiss Armed Neutrality in World War II" by Dr. Stephen P. Halbrook, Published by Sarpedon Publishers, 25.00 cloth 319 pages. Buy this book from Amazon.com<br><br>If all you know is what you read in the papers, then you must think that Switzerland is one of the most despicable countries in the world.  Switzerland, rather than joining the Allied cause, stayed neutral World War II. After the war, Swiss banks helped themselves to the deposits of holocaust victims, rather than giving the deposits to the victimsÂ’ heirs. Case closed?<br><br>Not at all, historian Stephen Halbrook shows in his new book Target Switzerland: Swiss Armed Neutrality In World War II. Wrongful as was the bankersÂ’ post-war behavior, the behavior of the Swiss people during the war was morally exemplaryÂ—superior, indeed to the conduct  of most of the rest of Europe. As Winston Churchill recalled, "of all the neutrals Switzerland has the greatest right distinction...  She has been a Democratic State, standing for freedom in self-defense among her mountains, and in thought, in spite of race, largely on our side."<br><br>Except for Britain, France, and Canada, virtually all of the Allied nations during World War II joined the war only because the Axis declared war on them, Halbrook reminds us. Even after Pearl Harbor, the United States remained neutral in the European war, until Hitler declared war on United States a few days later.<br><br>Nazi maps showed that the Third Reich would eventually include Switzerland, just as it would include all portions of Europe with German-speaking people. While the majority of SwitzerlandÂ’s population is German-speaking (the rest being French, Italian, or Romansh) the nation was virtually unanimous in hoping and praying for the defeat of Germany. Infuriated by the lack of ethnic solidarity, and by the strongly anti-Nazi stance of SwitzerlandÂ’s free press, Hitler predicted that Switzerland would be Â“liquidatedÂ” and that he would be known as Â“the butcher of the Swiss.Â”<br><br>As Halbrook details, in every stage of the war, the Axis had powerful military reasons to invade Switzerland.  Before the fall of France, the non-alpine part of Switzerland offered at inviting path to sweep into France and avoid the Maginot Line. After France fell and Italy entered the war, Switzerland offered the only convenient transport of military men and supplies between Italy and Germany. After the Allied landing in Italy, Germany's need to swiftly deploy troops into Italy became even more urgent. As the war came to conclusion in 1944-45, the Nazi leadership laid plans to make a stand in the Alps, but  Switzerland stood right in the middle.<br><br>By the summer of 1940, there was only one country on Germany's borders whose free press and rights of assembly allowed the Third Reich to be publicly and lawfully denounced as the evil empire that he was.  In every country on Germany's borders--except Switzerland--Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals and other targets of HitlerÂ’s hate were sent to extermination camps.  But there was no Holocaust on Swiss soil.  Switzerland protected her own Jews, and sheltered many more refugees of all religious backgrounds.  Had America  sheltered refugees at the same per capita rate as Switzerland, the United States would have taken in over three million refugees. Instead America accepted hardly any.<br><br>In all the countries that Hitler conquered, the economy was plundered for use in the Nazi war machine. As a neutral, Switzerland did trade with Germany and Italy, and with the Allies.  (For the Allied trade, the Swiss smuggled out precision ball bearings and other military equipment disguised in consumer products like watches.) But unlike in the countries which Hitler conquered, the only products that Hitler could get from Switzerland were what he could buy at full price.<br><br>Target Switzerland includes the maps of the evolving Germans invasion plans for "Case Switzerland." Yet although the Germans several times massed troops on the Swiss border for an invasion, the invasion never went forward. With so many reasons to invade Switzerland, why did the Nazis desist?<br><br>The Nazis could have eventually have conquered Switzerland, but at a fearful price. The Wehrmacht expected 200,000 German casualties; it would have taken a very long time to remove the Swiss military from the Alpine Â“ReduitÂ” to which they planned to make a stand. And by the time the Swiss were defeated, every bridge and train track and everything else of value to the conquerors would have been destroyed.<br><br>The reason that Switzerland was too difficult to invadeÂ—in contrast to all the other nations which Hitler conquered in a matter of weeksÂ—was the Swiss militia system. Unlike all the other nations of Europe, which relied on a standing army, Switzerland was (and still is) defended by a universal militia. Every man was trained in war, had his rifle at home, was encouraged to practice frequently, and could be mobilized almost instantly. The Swiss militiaman was under orders to fight to the last bullet, and after that, with his bayonet, and after that, with his bare hands. Rather than having to defeat an army, Hitler would have had to defeat a whole people.<br><br>Conversely, the Swiss citizen militia, with its extensive network of fortifications, had no offensive capability. The Swiss militia was not going to sweep into Berlin; modern Swiss-bashers who condemn the nation for not declaring war fail to understand that by keeping the Axis out of Switzerland, the Swiss were already doing everything they could for the Allied cause.<br><br>From the Anschluss of Austria to the Fall of France, Hitler swallowed nation after nation where cowardly ruling elites surrendered the country to the NazisÂ—either before the shooting began, or a few weeks afterward. But such a surrender would have been impossible in Switzerland, explains Halbrook. The Swiss governmental system was decentralized, with the separate 26 cantons, not the federal government, having the authority. The federal government did notify the Swiss people that in case of a German invasion, any claim that there had been a Swiss surrender should be disregarded as Nazi propaganda. And because the military power was in the hands of every Swiss man, the federal government would have been unable to surrender had it ever wanted to. Nothing could stop the Swiss militiamen from fighting to the very end.<br><br>AmericaÂ’s Founders admired Switzerland as a Â“Sister RepublicÂ” amidst the despotisms  of Europe. The American FoundersÂ—like the SwissÂ—understood the moral implications of a universal militia system: a people who are trained to self-reliance and responsibility will defend their freedom to the utmost. But a people who rely on a professional standing army may not have the nerve to resist tyranny.<br><br>When, as William Shirer wrote from Berlin, the lamps of freedom were going out all over Europe, they burned brighter than ever in Switzerland, as the Swiss people maintained their democracy, their right to assemble, and their freedom of religion. And the Swiss people saved thousands and thousands of refugees from the gas chambers.  A well-regulated militia really was necessary to the security of a free state.<br><br>Winston Churchill and Adolph Hitler both understood how much Switzerland damaged the Axis causeÂ—on both a military and a moral plane. Stephen HalbrookÂ’s excellent bookÂ—the first in English to tell SwitzerlandÂ’s history during the warÂ—is the story of how a small, isolated nation, faced with mighty enemies and gigantic dangers, can demonstrate true greatness.<br><br></span><br><br>But I guess the real reason why Germany refrained from invading Switzerland is this:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The rÃ©duit national (Â“Fortress SwitzerlandÂ”) took shape: at almost any point after 1940, Hitler could have crossed the frontier and taken the entire populated lowlands Â– Basel, ZÃ¼rich, Bern, Geneva and the countryside Â– without a fight, and reduced independent Switzerland to a scattering of snowbound bunkers in the high Alps. But such an invasion would have impoverished the Reich and, in reality, Switzerland was safe: the military kudos to be gained by HitlerÂ’s having a subdued, occupied Switzerland subject to Allied bombing was vastly outweighed by the material benefit of his nurturing a nominally neutral, independent Switzerland that remained enthusiastically open for business.</span><br><br></div>
