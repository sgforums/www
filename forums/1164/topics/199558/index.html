            <div class='col-md body'>This is not strictly a military subject but nuclear technology is usually assiociated with WMD.<br><br>Firstly, as we all know fuel prices is at its all time high. It is just US$70 per barrel not too long ago and it is predicted that it may even reach US$100 a barrel in the near future. We as a tiny nation with no natural resources have to depend on foreign imports for 100% of our energy needs. Should the prices increase to US$100 per barrel which is very possible, our economy will be in deep trouble.<br><br>One may argue that we can make use of other forms of energy such as solar power,wind etc. This will be a way to minimise use of fossil fuels but due to our land constraints it will be hard to see large wind farms anytime soon.<br><br>Therefore i propose nuclear energy as a long term source of cheap and clean energy. We don't really need a massive reactor, we can start with a small one like what Israel have. At least by then we don't need to be totally dependant on foreign imported fossil fuels for our energy needs. Regional countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia already have research reactors<br><br>We can have the reactor in one of the offshore reclaimed islands. It can be deep underground and surrounded by thick concrete for better protection against terrorists and minimise fallout during accidents. This island is to be heavily guarded by the KINS, CISCO,PCG maybe even the Gurkhas during peacetime.<br><br>Accidents do happen from time to time around the world but nuclear technology is generally considered safe. Statistics have prove that nuclear accidents are relatively few compared to fossil fuel power stations. The only big problem with nuclear power reactors is waste management. But i am sure we can find a way to work things out in the future.

Their pebble-bed plants are indeed much more safer and smaller, and efficent.. it seems.<br><br>Pebble-bed plants have smaller chance of a melt-down.. because they power down easily.. unlike any in the world.

It was an image-polishing effort to persuade unemployed citizens to accept cleaning work at a time when the unskilled had a hard time making a living.<br><br>(Singapore relies on thousands of foreign cleaners, while many unskilled locals are jobless after years of economic restructuring.)<br><br>The Singaporean Â“restroom specialistÂ” was no laughing matter.<br><br>The talk around town is that if the government actually took such pain to promote toilet cleaning, the employment situation must indeed be bleak.<br><br>It wasnÂ’t that bad; the thing was also a skills upgrading exercise.<br><br>But the public discussions Â– and general pessimism Â– about SingaporeÂ’s prospects have been very active.<br><br>Some online threads (including a public poll) were more specific, posing direct questions on whether this nation can survive the new global competition, like: Â“What will Singapore be like in 5-10 yearsÂ’ time?Â” or Â“How bright is our future?Â”<br><br>For the 4.3 million Singaporeans, having a good job is the most important thing in life. It sustains their middle-class living, allows them to own a home, send their kids to university and retire comfortably.<br><br>Without it, nothing is possible. The authorities do not provide any dole or safety net for the jobless. In Malaysia or Thailand, they can leave the cities and live in the countryside Â– but not in Singapore.<br><br>This is the reason why the Singaporean view of his future is shaped largely by the sort of job he has (or has not).<br><br>It is Prime Minister Lee Hsien LoongÂ’s greatest challenge.<br><br>So how do Singaporeans evaluate their own country and its future?<br><br>The republic still has one of AsiaÂ’s strongest economies, and Singaporeans generally consider theirs a relatively stable, promising life but they see the future as less rosy.<br><br>o Seah Chiang Nee is a veteran journalist and editor of the information website littlespeck.com<br><br><a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw06/060820ST.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.singapore-window.org/sw06/060820ST.HTM</a></div>
