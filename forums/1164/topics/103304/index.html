            <div class='col-md body'>If it's really true then there's definitely a trade off somewhere. Contrary to what the Thai Public Relations ppl have to say, it could be related to the new training facilities.<br><br>Also, considering that some of the earlier A/B jets are already well into their useful life spans, it could be that the RSAF is selling/trading them off to make way for the Next Generation Fighter? Eventually, the RSAF would still have to scrap them so maybe this is just another more attractive method of giving them away...<br><br>Besides, the Thais have been good allies for a long time...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it would be best that we wait for an official statement from Sg`s mindef before coming to a firm conclusion.  If there is none, it`s probably nothing.<br><br>It may well be local thai politics and the jets are granted for use by the thai air-force but are in fact leased; just as we have been granted use of the thai air-bases. And the leased jets are used by both singapore and thai pilots for advanced training,etc. They might not even be leased and are stationed there for use by both sides. But the thai authorities have to make it sound more palatable to the thai locals.<br><br>I don`t think the local thais would take too kindly to a foreign presence there. The better that they say the F-16s are used by thier own people. Of course, the thai government would have to explain the situation to the local thais in a way they would discern and accept. best we wait and hear it from our mindef, if any.</div>

Thai authorities would exercise tight control over use of the air base and Thai airspace.<br><br>The defence minister admitted the Singaporeans may conduct unilateral, bilateral or multi-lateral military exercises from Wing 23 air base.<br><br>The Thai air force held annual exercises with the US, Australia and neighbouring states, including Singapore, with which Thailand shared repair and maintenance programmes for common weapon systems, he said.<br><br>The Democrat argued the seven F-16A and F-16B fighters Singapore had offered in exchange for the use of Wing 23 air base were old and due to be decommissioned. The government should have bargained for more modern aircraft, especially the F-16C or F-16D fighters currently in use by the Singapore air force.<br><br>One of the old Singaporean F-16s had been damaged in an exercise over the South China Sea, Mr Pirapan said.<br><br>``Who will fly a fighter with one-third of the wing area seriously damaged?'' he said ``If you, Mr Defence Minister, were a combat pilot, would you have the nerve to fly it?''<br><br>Gen Sumpun, who claims to have been a pilot himself, said the damaged parts would be repaired and the aircraft's safety guaranteed before it ever takes off in Thailand.<br><br>Air force chief ACM Kongsak Wantana maintained Singapore had offered the seven fighters to Thailand because the two countries had good military relations.<br><br>The offer had nothing to do with Singapore's request for the use of Wing 23 air base in Udon Thani for air force training.<br><br>The seven F-16s had only 4,000 flying hours on the clock, were good for another 4,000 hours and could be in use for the next 15 years, said ACM Kongsak. The same model plane was already in service with the Thai air force.<br><br>Singapore had also offered 3,200 accessories and parts with the planes.<br><br>ACM Kongsak said the Singapore air force has been allowed to use air bases in Udon Thani and Khon Kaen provinces since April 30, 1981 under a cabinet resolution.<br><br>In Udon Thani, Charoon Thavornchak, an administrator of Rajabhat University Udon Thani, said the local people should be informed and public hearings held before Singapore was allowed use of the air base, which was now being used by both air force and commercial aircraft.<br></div>
