Most culprits were either counselled or told to apologise for their behaviour. No one was dismissed for such harassment, he said.<br><br>Senator Bishop called for Defence to adopt a zero-tolerance attitude towards sexual harassment and to make sure serious breaches resulted in dismissal.<br><br>Â“We cannot hope to retain, let alone attract new recruits, with such a comparatively high number of sexual harassment complaints,Â” he said.<br><br>Senator Bishop said 107 cases of sexual harassment were reported in the 2004-05 year, up from the previous 12-month's figure of 100. Of the 107 reported cases, 88 were substantiated.<br><br>Penalties ranged from culprits being made to apologise to their victim, counselling, through to formal warnings and severe reprimands. </blockquote>2.How is the rate in SAF?Any preventive measures?</div>
