            <div class='col-md body'>If anybody has read the book Dune before,people will remember the name of the dread warriors of the Padishah Emperor,the murdering Sardaukar(obviously the inspiration for my name).<br><br>In the book,the Sardaukar are drawn from a pool of candidates on a single prison planet,filled with slaves and criminals convicted of smuggling,rape,manslaughter,sex crimes,etc,where the mortality rate is greater than 60% for 1st year prisoners and where they have to survive in an environemnt that kills 6 out of 13 people before they reach the age of 11.The Sardaukar help in culling excess prisoner population,using them as training aids.They recruit from among the survivors and then train them into Sardaukar by granting them a warrior mystique based on the fact that they survived to become elite Sardaukar,that their survival is a sign of their superiority to other humans,a testament to their ferocity and resilience.They are then given whatever they desire(women,wealth,etc.) while being indoctrinated.The price;serve their Emperor unquestioningly and maintain their fighting skills and improve them.<br><br>Now,the concept of the Sardaukar and Fremen from the book 'Dune' is an interesting concept,but could derived ideas from it be put into actual use in training troops?<br><br>Say from among the conscripts or professionals that composed our army,we perhaps raised a platoon or company size detachment to form a small unit of elite soldiers with a higher level of 'eliteness' than either the SOF,NDU or Cdo's with the intention of serving in the role similar to the Israeli Sayeret Matkal which is the IDF(Israeli Defence Force) primary intelligence gathering and SF unit.They are an SF force involved in foreign operations,often of a covert nature.<br><br>http://www.fact-index.com/s/sa/sayeret.html<br>http://www.specwarnet.com/world/matkal.htm<br><br>Perhaps we should invest in such a unit,only with the aim of making the soldiers within casual killers.They could be deploye for high risk operations in areas where terrorist activity occured or as a safeguard against normal army units mutinying.We could select from among the best and most intelligent of the conscripts or recruits,train them up to a point where they would undergo CBT,the Ranger(Singapore and US) courses,USN SEAL training  as well as elements of the NDU training,with added leeway for their trainers to brutalise them and make them used to harsh treatment.<br><br>During this time,they would face continual indoctrination and education in languages such as Malay or Thai or other appropriate languages of areas where Singapore has active interests and taught to blend in.After such harsh training,they could then be deployed with promises of scholarships and job security for their families and other such attractors.<br><br>Their duty;follow the orders of senior commanders in whatever designated tasks.This would alllow for covert operations to be carried out effectively and as well in black or covert operations to avoid diplomatic upsets,such as operations where assassination or silencing of certain individuals,such as perhaps a foreign ambassador,are required,as well as counter terrorist activity.<br><br>of course,all the above is hypothetical.We have a very small pool to draw from,and it could becom a political 'hot potato' due to possible human rights violations.That and most individuals would not make it through the training.</div>
