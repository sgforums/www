            <div class='col-md body'>so it was said and still the strongest fire power that most say that we have. what do guys in here think of that?<br>how will you organize you section or platoon to get the max fire power it can give you.<br>again, there is not right or wrong answer but just which is the best.<br><br>lets have a look what are the "things" in a section.<br><br>5 X M16(old) 2 X M16 and 3 XSAR21 ~ 5.56mm, range 460m+/-. no problem for 600m<br>2 X SAW ~ 5,56mm, range 460m+/-. no problem for 600m<br>2 X M203 ~ HE and HEDP, range 31m to 150m point target, 350m, area target. White Star. rate of fire? arming distance 14m to 28m.<br>2 X LAW ~ HEAT(old) HEDP(new, not sure) 150m to 300m for armoured target and 500m for soft skin. arming distance 12m.<br>2 x SFG 82 each man ~ Fragmentation grenade.<br>2 X Bangalore Torpedo Charge ~<br>2 X Claymore Mine M18A1 ~ 700 ball bearing. back blast 16m.<br>2 X Pen Gun ~ LOL some say no more... i not sure.<br>2 X Parang ~<br>1 X P226?? ~ by right.<br><br>1 X GPMG under Platoon HQ.<br><br>so how will you organize you section for an assault. (note; assault will have a slight diff of an attack.)<br>for attack.<br>for defence.<br>for delay.<br><br>this was to know how sect comd, PC maximize the fire power within. again there is no right or wrong but just which is best that all.</div>
