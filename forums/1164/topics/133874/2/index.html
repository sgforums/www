            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ,<br><br>Your OPFOR mission sounded like one I participated in Taiwan, where I was part of an OPFOR section. But this goes back to 1984 or so.<br><br>COY strength enemy moving along a road, was to be harrassed with small arms fire by OPFOR section plus concealed on a ridge, about 100 m (but straight line distance to road was possibly 200 m or so ) above this narrow road.  COY had no fire support but had to mount an immediate flanking assault in order to drive us away from the ridge.   The easiest and most accesible assault route was up a very narrow track on one side of the hill,  which in real life would either be partly mined or have an OP with MG sited down it , to harrass the approaching flanking troops.<br><br>Anyway, this was a training mission to test the basic coordination elements and command of the OC leading the COY.   To make it a textbook simple immediate assault....<br><br>The umpires did not want to complicate matters for the trainees by introducing fire support or whatever complicated scenario (such as the OP  I mentioned) .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the end of the day, as a small unit commander (Section, PL, COY level), we have to learn to make do with only the normal PL and COY level weapons (or less) .  Remember "Band of Brothers"....  The 82nd and 101st Airborne were scattered all over Normandy. But they still had to form ad-hoc groups (with less men and missing equipment/ weapons) to mount their assault missions.  One famous incident, which became a textbook case study by West Point cadets, was the deliberate assault on the German gun position at Brecourt Manor.  Section plus assault group attacking a 50+ man entrenched position with 3  105mm howitzers.<br><br>No fire support... just small arms harassing fire, while the 8 or 9 guys made the dash towards the prepared position of the Germans.<br><br></div>
