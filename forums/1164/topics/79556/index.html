            <div class='col-md body'>yah, actually the Humvee isn't as good as the manufacturers advertised it to be....AK rds can actually penetrate when its actually advertised as armoured up to 7.62. I guess its false advertising then... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I think one of the reason why the LSV was used in E. Timor was that the SAF wanted to test the vehicle under real conditions. I mean, the land rover cannot mount gpmg...even if they use benz jeep, its also quite limited...I think the LSV has better suspension and gears, but of cos' the crew will have to put on bullet-proof vests lor...<br><br>I think in the real deployment of LSV in a conflict would mean that thye operate like a 'roaming' wolfpack, and they would depend alot on stealth, concealment and speed to engage the enemy... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The only possible purpose built solution to this would be an overhead remote weapon system which would be too heavy for LSV because its chassis is of space frame design for lightweight and rigidity and not so much for strength (but is high strength enough for normal crew served weapons)<br><br>Remote weapon system to be more cost effective will be cannon-based type rather than MG-based - because might as well use human gunner to operate the .50 MG immediately rather than via remote TV - eye-hand co-ordination is worse, quicker to bring weapon to bear if aiming directly through iron sights.<br><br>But cannon-based is different because the typical target type (soft-skinned vehicles/shelters), engagement envelope (detect,recognise,identify,engage in same general sector over 3-4 secs) and weapon effects (AP/HE) justify the use of electronic targeting methods to improve accuracy round for round rather than pepper the enemy senselessly</div>

If there are indeed enemy snipers to worry about for this, then always bear in mind that since LSVs roles are mainly strike missions deep behind enemy lines, meaning maybe in supply depots, airfields, artillery positions etc during or before wartime in enemy rear, regular enemy army will not consider having to deploy sniper elements just to cover their valued assets against commando raids.  Anyhow, before the LSVs roll in, brief immediate recce of the terrain by LRRP/ sniper teams would have filtered out enemy counter sniper teams</div>

I cannot see the relationship between LSV/Humvee and protection.   Neither LSV nor Humvee was designed on the basis of protection to their occupants.   The fact that the Humvee was used for the wrong purpose (or in the wrong context) in Somalia does not reflect on the vehicle itself.

Like the SAS have shown, with their open landrover, they can conduct lighting strike on air-field or other targets by driving through shooting up everything, with machine guns, rifles, genardes. With a covered vehicle, that is not achieved, therefore you will see all over the world LSV is all open, due to long proven<br>experience.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragonstar:</div><div class="quote_body">I find this entire thread rather strange.   I cannot see the relationship between LSV/Humvee and protection.   Neither LSV nor Humvee was designed on the basis of protection to their occupants.   The fact that the Humvee was used for the wrong purpose (or in the wrong context) in Somalia does not reflect on the vehicle itself.   Imagine using an axe to cut tofu - do you blame the axe for not giving a clean cut or do you blame the person using it?<br><br>If protection is needed, then used a properly designed armoured vehicle.   Even then, they will be vulnerable to some forms of attack.</div></blockquote>Actually,Humvee is a multi-purpose vehicle which can use as a attack(Tow II ,25mm bushhammer or 0.5 fit on top),military armour patrol(US MP use it as patrol car)and other purpose.It is meant to  withstand small arm firing and protect the personnel inside but in recent conflict like the iraqi show its inadequate. Armour vehicle is definitely able to handle small arm and even 0.5 MG but for patrolling, the long and wide body to move in narrow urban street will reduce its effective use!  The US just need to produce a humvee II with better armour and suspension and it will perfect it.I had mention some new humvee type multi-purpose vehicle  in my previous article which may have handle better than present humvee in all areas.<br><br>As for the comparing part,actually we all know their own uses and purpose.Is just that SAF misuse the LSV as a patrol vehicle in East timor peace-keeping and jeopardise the safety of our peace-keeper! Some mention SAF don't have a proper one to undertake the task shall make them to arquire one.That's why I brought up this article to suggest SAF buy some humvee type vehicle as we all know SAF is more and more involved in UN mission and the humvee type vehicle will be handy in future peace-keeping mission.Even not for peace-keeping mission,I believe this all-round protected vehicle will definitely be useful in SAF for all kinds of combat type mssions. The humvee type vehicle will stand in between armour vehicle and LSV and I strongly believe we shall fill up this vacum!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>zenden9,<br><br>I think agree with you on the fact, perhaps a more protected vehicle is needed for that type of patrol.<br><br>But I am totally again the hummer. I have the chance using a hummer in Australia. And think is will be a wrong choice. 1st, that thing is to wide, too noisy, too heavy and too thristy ! drink fuel like there is no tomorrow. Actually the british army do make use of armoured covered landrovers. That may be a better choice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe that the SAF introduced LSV into saf arsenal due to serious size consideration  it plays relative significant role when traveling in bumpy jungle route..For the singapore army the dsta procurement dept always consider the size of the vehicle as a critical factor.As for the weight, SAF has been emphasising on the mobility and agility of a unit to get to touble spot fast naturally airborne / heliborne will be an excellent alternative.Bear in mind we carry 2 LSV.<br><br>if anyone out there have some VCD on the airborne operation / heliborne operation of the united state army  will probably get a clearer view.The airborne dropping a single vehicle requires massive cushioning which is uneconomical.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
