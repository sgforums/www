They don't realise that patrolling in rainforest, shrubland country, rolling or urban terrain pose different challenges to vehicle design.<br><br>LSV and Pink Panthers are in fact already DPVs in essence and mission.  So dun differentiate too much, they are all the same if only different because of user requirements and preference for industry</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure SAF has considered the armour protection issue. But I think once you have enough armour to stop an AK-47 bullet it wouldn't be light anymore. And as its name LSV suggests, it is not used for patrolling or something.<br><br>(The Humvee tried to fulfill the role of being an armoured LSV but it seems the armour is quite weak. So not much point.)<br><br>My guess is it's main role is probably recce or as the name suggest, to conduct a small lightning strike on enemy positions or installations. More shoot and scoot than a sustained fight.<br><br>A vehicle like this cannot hope to withstand any kind of enemy attack. It's nothing more than a faster, more agile and armed land rover.</div>
