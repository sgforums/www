              <p>The 1st gen Gore-tex tears much more easily... mine lasted barely a year. could the water have seeped in your boots cause of the tear on the sides?</p>
              <p>Anyway seems that the newer full leather boots also have this tearing problem, I've come to the conclusion that its due to the way the boot sole is shaped. Any ideas anyone?</p>

              <p>You know thats hardly gonna happen! It's not like we are going to do much desert ops (those who do deploy to deserts can surely afford to buy boots from any nearby US base PX). I still don't see any problem with black boots. The black rifle is a much bigger and much more noticeable target!</p>
              <p>The good thing about having only ONE colour of boots is like the good thing about having ONE colour of uniform-- life gets so much simpler. We are running an army here, not a fashion show. Unless we anticipate having our Infantry do ambush ops in urban areas, there really is no need for a digi-grey no. 4 or other coloured boots-- a moving human target in an urban area will stand out no matter what.</p>
              <p>Heh I enlisted in 2006 and I don't consider it the old days :P. In fact the BMT batch before me got two pairs of goretex instead of one of each. But the goretex boots don't really offer much advantage over the leather boots in terms of drying faster or anything-- the only difference is that if you leave your wet leather boots to dry by themselves they become rock hard and can cut your ankles.</p>
              <p>I believe they looked into issuing jungle boots, but for some reason it went nowhere. Anybody interested is still stuck with either ordering from the US or getting it from Sheares at almost 200 bucks a pop :P Or maybe boot exchanges with the Bruneians.</p>

              <p>AFAIK, tan boots work not just for desert, but in general environments as well....</p>
              <p>In any case tan boots are better camo then black boots even if you are in jungle, or urban.</p>

              <p>Not sure what you mean by waste, since the Army is the one that gave you the credits in the first place!</p>
              <p>Anyway, the credits for the uniform will be taken out of your allotment over the next two years.</p>
