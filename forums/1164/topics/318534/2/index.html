              <p>The ALICE may be dated but at least it gives good ventilation
                  for the back-- at least when wearing SBO webbing. It probably
                  doesn't matter given the new LBV. The newer internal frame packs
                  like those that the USMC is using will definitely be hotter.
                  Anyway, we shouldn't just blindly copy other countries like the US
                  because they have to deal with cold weather situations and we
                  don't. I think at most a 50-60 L pack (like we have now) is more
                  than enough.</p>
              <p>Ehh. The spartan pack is the trial pack that was manufactured by
                  Force21 and issued to 6SIR for trial-- after that they simplified
                  it to become our new field pack. Some former 6SIR guys like my
                  cousin still have them. Our new field packs are actually pretty
                  functional I guess, given the fact that they cost only 35 emart
                  credits each. I'd definitely buy my own bag if I could get away
                  with it though :D</p>
              <p>Agreed about Blackhawk-- their stuff may be the cutting edge in
                  Singapore, but over in the US/UK there are so many much better
                  backpack and military kit manufacturers. However blackhawk is
                  probably the biggest, and most international, which is why in small
                  countries like ours thats about all we get.</p>
              <p>Bro, you know that ACU digital is that grey and white crap that
                  the US Army is using now right? It definitely will stick out in
                  camp, especially since everything else we use is mostly green. If
                  it were me, I'd either get OD or Woodland. A pity that camelbak
                  doesnt make HAWGs in OD anymore-- if there were I'd definitely buy
                  one. If you desperately want a digital pattern though, I'd
                  recommend the USMC Woodland MARPAT. I think it most closely matches
                  our uniform colours.</p>
              <p>Hmm.. the guy is not a neutral party-- his company actually
                  produces the digital pattern design for the Jordanian army, so I'd
                  take anything he says with a bit of salt. Still, regardless of who
                  invented it, digital camou is probably a slight improvement over
                  normal camou patterns-- However I don't think that the cost and
                  confusion of changing over is worth it.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Ed, you are right that Alice has certain ventilation....but the funny part is that it's wasn't intended. It's not some funky Deuter design by default; it was just so that the frame and actual pack is kept away from the body as there are no backing for this vintage design...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In terms of ergonomics, Alice failed with our SBO, due to the back pouch htting into the lambar support, unless you are using the US or Israeli webbing. I actually modified my SAF std issue SBO backpouch by removing it and reattaching it to the front so that I can wear Alice comfortably.</p>
              <p>But that means I have an enormous 'breast' in front that is lopsided. Convenience for maps and other accessories though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Check out the Camelbak BFM. It's 45 li and much better than Maxpedition or Blackhawk. And if you are a water bag person, you'll know that Camelbak makes a damn good bag around the water pack while others merely build a space for water pack into the bag. Also check out the antenna/radio slots in BFM. Everything is top notch!</p>

              <p>Hmm.. I noticed that the digital No.4 in the picture still has epaulets though-- and the colour distribution seems to be very light-- maybe thats just because of the greyscale photo. Also, the poor guy in the photo has his LBV tightened too high!! The ammo pouches look more like in the position of a chest rig or something-- maybe he had to do it so that he could fit onto the cover :P</p>
              <p>Nehpyh: I'm not too sure about your assertion-- as far as I can research the ALICE system was developed from the Vietnam era field pack which was designed to leave a space for ventilation-- in fact for the medium ALICE pack you can wear it with or without the frame. But it is certainly true that the frame serves other purposes like ease of lashing water containers, mortar base plates etc.</p>
              <p>For me the one time I got to use the ALICE (or actually, our Sg made version), I was given the pack literally 30 minutes before we moved out, so all I did was hike up my SBO webbing until it was like a chest rig-- the back pouch fit easily into the space between the frame and my back, but all I had in there was a goretex.</p>
              <p>Yep I think in our local context, Camelbak is probably one of the best choices for an "Assault" or 3 Day pack! Again, I'd really like to get my hands on one of the older Olive Drab Camelbak Hawgs-- I don't understand why they make their BFM and Motherlode in OD but not the Hawgs :(</p>

              <p>Why so strange that only officers and WOs have the ranks on the
              chest?  I tot SAF was big on standardisation?  If its on
              the chest then all shld be on the chest, no reason to have the
              specs and men still wear on the sleeves.</p>
              <p>Out of the several designs if I've seen, I think the Canadian's
              look the nicest.  Anyway, since our arms badge is on the right
              collar, that leaves the left collar empty and very wierd looking
              i.e. lob-sided.  Maybe they'll follow US style and dump the
              rank there.</p>
              <p>I'm guessing they'll have to design new name tag, S'pore tag and
              formations/arms badges too 'cos the existing colour scheme will
              probably not match.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, it was wierd looking enough when some
              soldiers went for ICT with S'pore tag and formation badges and some
              without.  I can imagine if some go back with digital camo and
              some with woodlands camo.  Lagi wierd looking!</p>

              <p>Well, that makes sense (colour scheme). Any idea about the epaulets thingy? Is the picture on a booklet cover just an old version?</p>
              <p>Also, anything else you can reveal about the No.4 design? For eg, zipper or button fasteners, any shoulder pockets, mandarin collar or normal collar etc.</p>

              <p>This is... hilarious. i did not even notice there was a soldier in the picture until i zoomed it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this sofa is perfect for SISPEC WOs who in outfield can set up a field lounge and have storemen set up VIP style dining area.</p>

              <p>Very cool if they do come up with our own version.</p>
              <p>Marpat has a bit too much brown for our terrain, while Cadpat's green is rather too 'bright' for us. A mix of both would be great.</p>

              <p>That's basically meant we are basing our design on the US style.</p>
