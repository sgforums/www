Oh yea thats why the new field pack is bigger. Anyway coming out from the jungle wearing the woodland MARPAT into urban environment will also tell everyone, "Hey I'm here shoot me!!!"<br><br>If we indeed have the 2 versions, I can imagine new ways to tekan recruits. Ask u to change to woodland then to urban. Ask u to go up to ur bunk to take ur newly ziplocked urban uniform to pack into field pack. And u will receive another set of urban LBV and field pack?

Think I saw the same thing--- all I can say is-- neon green sia... it is like woodland marpat but I think the light green is wayyy too light-- to the point of being AA. The darker green and the light brown seems to exactly match the woodland marpat colour though. I think they should tone down the light green and the uniform wouldn't look so much like a clowns costume.</p></div>

              <p>From far, it looks like CADPAT, with all the bright green portions really attracting the eye--like I said, it's literally neon green-- basically all you see is a neon green blob that in my opinion looks like it belongs more in a circus than out in the field-- but I have only seen it in camp and not in the field.</p>
              <p>Up close i.e. 1-2 m away, you can see the darker green and light brown portions, then the pattern resembles MARPAT more.</p>
              <p>Maybe the point is to confuse our enemies into wondering whether they are fighting canadians, us marines, or just clowns :P One of my warrants always used to call us clowns, never thought that we would dress the part!</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;">SAF uniform to take on pixellated look</span></strong> <br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">By Teh Joo Lin (1 Aug 2008)<br><br>THE
              Singapore Armed Forces is planning to replace its uniform with
              something which will make its soldiers harder to spot in the jungle. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Instead
              of the black, green and brown fatigues which soldiers here have been
              wearing for more than two decades, the new uniform is said to resemble
              what the United States Marine Corps uses now. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The uniform will adopt new technology which uses smaller pixels of colours to create a complex pattern. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This is in contrast to the present uniform which has larger splotches of colours. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Defence Ministry issued a tender for the new uniforms in the middle of last month. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
              latest design change will be the largest revision of its kind in 25
              years for the SAF. The current military combat uniform - known among
              soldiers as the No. 4 uniform - was introduced in 1983. It features
              splotches of black, brown and green printed in an interlocking pattern,
              which helps the soldier blend into the foliage. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It replaced the earlier single-coloured Temasek Green uniform. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">No
              official details about the new uniforms are available, but The Straits
              Times understands an announcement is expected next month. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However,
              the impending change has already fuelled discussion in online forums
              among servicemen. Some national servicemen (NSmen) had also been
              briefed on the new combat greens on their recent returns to camp. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Much
              of the talk has been speculation about how the new uniform looks, which
              other militaries have adopted the camouflage and where the ranks will
              appear on the new fatigues. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">There are about 300,000 active and full-time national servicemen. All are expected to be issued the new uniforms. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The new look is also intended to be more functional than cosmetic. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The
              camouflage pattern is supposed to be harder to pick out in the jungle,
              based on how the human eye interacts with pixellated images. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Like the US Marine Corps, the Canadian military has a pixel pattern on its uniform. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When
              contacted, defence analyst Bernard Loo said he had seen the US Marine
              Corps in training with their pixellated uniform on the beach, 'and it
              works very well for them'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dr Loo said the new Singapore uniform was likely to have been put through its paces by the SAF. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I
              assume they would have tested it against the likely area of operations
              and found the new camouflage pattern works better than the present
              one.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Another change - the rank insignia on the new uniforms will be worn on the chest instead of on the shoulder epaulettes.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The new fatigues are likely to be introduced in phases, with soldiers in active units donning them first.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Wondering, after the SAF officially adopt the new No. 4, are we allow to wear the old uniform as we like? As of now, we are not allow to wear the present No. 4 if not going to camp or on official duty. But once the SAF adopts the new No.4, is there still control on the usage of the old uniform? Find that especially the present SAF pants very good for bashing into forested areas. I won't mind wearing it when going treking in Pulau Ubin or Bukit Timah if it is allowed. Not trying anything funny here, just trying to find out if allow, then can wear, if not allowed, then dun wear lor. Thanks</p></div>

              <p>dun think so, the LBV and fieldpack( or bergen, more like it) only been introduced in late 2006. definitely leceh and costly to replace everyone with a camo one. i still love my webbing though, i hope they allow us to use it once the uniform transition is in place.</p>

              <p>That's the nature of the spiral development system-- there are very few stocks that are maintained in the system, so it is possible to quickly change designs/ incorporate improvements and disseminate them quickly-- sharp-eyed military observers would have noticed that in the past year or two the issued LBV has gone through multiple changes/ improvements. I wouldn't be surprised if the new LBV or field pack would be issued soon after the switch to the new uniform-- there simply aren't any existing stocks to exhaust before issuing of the new equipment.</p>
              <p>Cairocks:As they issue the new No.4, they are collecting the old No.4 for subsequent processing i.e. destruction. I'm sure no one would really catch you if you wear the old No.4 for personal purposes, but officially that would be something that would not be tolerated I guess.</p>

              <p>Oh, sure, they show off a pattern that's supposed to be hard to see. That's real smart of them.</p>
              <p>No, it's more likely that they'll probably mention the new patterns or something, but there won't be much focus on it.</p>
