              <p>No, I don't mean that 'fabric softener' should be used, but special attention should be given as to which chemical or laundry process will wash out the dyes that have been "placed" into the new digitised fabric to enhance the cover against near-infra-red detection in the dark.</p>
              <p>If the new digitised camo has a high polyester content, it will be 'murderous' - wearing it in the humid equatorial heat.</p>
              <p>Some of our skin may react negatively to the polyester material, and what will the special chemical do to the skin with long period of wear under strong UV conditions ?</p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>'nike' drift is polyester fyi'</em></span><span style="color: #000000;"><em> - </em>surely you are not suggesting to have the entire uniform made of the same material as a pair of "Nike shoes" ?</span></p>
              <p>If you must find out the feel, you should try wearing a full wedding suit - with its pair of long pants and the suit made from the lightest 100% polyester material - and posed for outdoor photo shoots for one to two hours on the sunniest day.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Police Uniform is made entirely of 100% polyester woven with "thinner gauge" of polyester that made the uniform lighter - which will make it comfortable when worn <em>out of the searing sun.</em> This explains for the Traffic Cops retaining their 100% white cotton shirt and 100% blue cotton pants that dates back to the 1950s.</p>
              <p>In any case, the same light weight 100% polyester fabric used by the Singapore Police will be unable to tolerate the rough SAF "Life Style".</p>
              <p>No matter how the "twill and feel" is manufactured - the man-made "polyester" cannot beat the natural feel of pure 100% cotton.</p>
              <p>Even the slightest mix of "polyester" into "cotton" will affect the comfort level - even as the "polyester" is supposed to give strength to the cotton fibre - as can be felt wearing the 80-20 or 60-40 mix of cotton-polyester socks.</p>
              <p>Perhaps small patches at the critical wear areas on a uniform can be 100% polyester - such as the elbows, rear humps, crotch, and knees.</p>

              <p>While the photo shows the results of softeners on digital uniforms that are fabricated with embedded chemical based dyes, it is unlikely that the SAF uniforms will be standing under the kind of UV light that are commonly seen at nighclub entrances.</p>
              <p>The UV light that the SAF uniforms will be subject to are the invisible UV-A and UV-B rays from the sun rays that may affect the dye pigment embedded into the fabrics.</p>
              <p>The main concern will have to be the effectiveness of the dye that is supposed to block detection from Infra-Red observation equipment that pick-ups our body heat.</p>
              <p>The softeners may wash away such dyes that is supposed to conceal us in the dark.</p>
              <p>Different grades of softeners must surely affect the dye pigments - as both are chemical based, and unless compatible, the laundry chemicals are designed to act on most other chemical based substance that "stain" garments.</p>

                  you are not suggesting to have the entire uniform made of the
                  same material as a pair of "Nike shoes" ?</span></p>
              <p>If you must find out the feel, you should try wearing
                  a full wedding suit - with its pair of long pants and the
                  suit made from the lightest 100% polyester
                  material - and posed for outdoor photo shoots for one to two
                  hours on the sunniest day.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Police Uniform is made entirely of
                  100% polyester woven with "thinner gauge" of polyester that
                  made the uniform lighter - which will make it comfortable when worn
                  <em>out of the searing sun.</em> This explains for the Traffic Cops
                  retaining their 100% white cotton shirt and 100% blue cotton pants
                  that dates back to the 1950s.</p>
              <p>In any case, the same light weight 100%
                  polyester fabric used by the Singapore Police will
                  be unable to tolerate the rough SAF "Life Style".</p>
              <p>No matter how the "twill and feel" is manufactured - the
                  man-made "polyester" cannot beat the natural feel of pure 100%
                  cotton.</p>
              <p>Even the slightest mix of "polyester" into "cotton" will affect
                  the comfort level - even as the "polyester" is supposed to give
                  strength to the cotton fibre - as can be felt wearing the 80-20 or
                  60-40 mix of cotton-polyester socks.</p>
              <p>Perhaps small patches at the critical wear areas on a
                  uniform can be 100% polyester - such as the elbows, rear humps,
                  crotch, and knees.</p>

              <p>sweat wicking polyester and non sweat wicking polyester is very different .</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>its a t-shirt fabric, its NOT a shoe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> anyway, if the polyester is of the hollow fibre variety , its gonna wick sweat up in a jiffy and help the wearer stay dry next to the skin  as the sweat is carried away from the skin layer to the outside layer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SAF jogging uppers is made of such material.</p>
              <p>50/50 "polyco" (polyester/cotton mix for the cloth) has been the US norm for their GI BDU's,  its just that SAF still is behind them  during the old no.4 era, but has since improved with said new batch of pixilated no.4.</p>
              <p>100% polyester will be a nightmare if exposed to fire risk , hence the polyco mix to make polyester burn away without adhereing to the soldier's skin in a nasty  hot liquid goop that cause nasty 3rd degree burns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The UVa UVb dye, thats a joke at best if washed with normal "suds" detergent, i only use ATSKO SPORT WASH for all my polester clothes and uniforms , no UVa/b reactive residues, no problem.</p>
              <p>Softener isnt the problem to the UVa/b problem  , its the problem to the polyester hollow fibres  that provide the critical sweat wicking properties of the cloth. Basically, it collapses the hollow fibre , rendering it into a normal "wedding suit" as you said with NORMAL polyester wedding/police suits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>machine washed the new no.4's , dried up within 4 hours indoors, ambient temp 24 degrees. Very fast drying compared to the old 100% cotton wich takes ages to dry if not for sun.</p>

              <p>If you insist - you could try making an army combat uniform out
              of your "drifit / climacool / coolmax" material - and let us know
              how long it lasted in the field.</p>
              <p>Can you even dye your fabric in the various dyes with
              the enhanced digital camo against heat detection besides direct
              visual detection ?</p>
              <p>All the same, it will be nice to see you find some "UV-A and
              UV-B enhanced" detergent in the market that can affect any
              fabric.</p>

              <p>the US has been using it for years on their uniforms FYI. doesnt need to be 100% polyester. its usually a blend of either 60/40 or 50/50 for durability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>heat detection? uv-a /b have little to do with thermal sghts fyi, different spectrum.</p>
