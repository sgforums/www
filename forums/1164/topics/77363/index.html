            <div class='col-md body'>From Strait Times Webby:-<br><br>Najib pledges to keep NS despite problems<br><br>KUALA LUMPUR - The national service scheme is here to stay despite the flak from the public over several weaknesses in the programme, Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak says in an interview with the New Sunday Times.<br>An exercise in boating for national service trainees. -- AP<br><br>He said NS is important for national integration and, despite the shortcomings, those running the three-month programme would just have to cope.<br><br>'We are trying to mould people, to get those from different races to be comfortable doing things with one another. This is the only way they will appreciate each other's aspirations and sensitivities,' he said.<br><br>Datuk Seri Najib, who is Defence Minister, said the school system is a product of political compromise and does not allow for such interaction.<br><br>Ninety per cent of Chinese are in Chinese schools and 70 per cent of Indians are in Tamil schools.<br><br>He also said the programme will help build the character of younger generations, making youths more disciplined and resilient.<br><br>'The trainees come from all backgrounds - some of them are role models in schools, prefects, some come from middle class and well-to-do families,' he said.<br><br>'You also have those who are poorer, some even from difficult socio-economic backgrounds - broken homes and neighbourhoods with social problems.<br><br>'Some may be juvenile delinquents involved in unhealthy activities. It is a mixed bag.'<br><br>Over the past few weeks, there have been fights, an alleged rape of a trainee by a trainer and other instances of indiscipline affecting the pioneer group of 85,000 teenagers in 41 camps nationwide.<br><br>Several people have called for the programme to be scrapped while others have suggested separate camps for boys and girls.<br><br>Responding to the criticisms, the Deputy Premier said many of the problems 'originated from innocent pranks'.<br><br>'We were 18 once. Obviously, quite often they tease one another. Sometimes it becomes excessive and it leads to fights. We have to take this seriously,' he said.<br><br>He said the government viewed the NS programme seriously because parents, after releasing their children to attend it, expect the government to take care of them.<br><br>'There is a moral obligation to take care of them. That's why when there was the report of the alleged rape, I was very, very disturbed,' he said.<br><br><strong> Comparing the experiences of other countries, he said that Singapore also found the implemention of its programme, which covers a two-year period, difficult during the early phase.<br><br>'It wasn't a walk in the park for them but they persevered. They discovered that their National Service is a significant factor in moulding the future generation of Singaporeans.<br><br>'They think their strength - discipline and competitiveness - would not have been achieved without it,' he said.<br><br>The Deputy Premier then wondered whether the government had pampered Malaysians.<br><br>'The Singaporeans have to stomach being in uniform and living in barracks under more arduous and risky training.<br><br>'They've lost people, accidents have happened, people have died and so forth. But they never gave up,' he said.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sgp didn't "give up" because the alternative, Singapore without National Service is a country without a credible defence. Racial harmony, integration etc etc are secondary goals.<br><br>For Malaysian, they do not depend on national service for their national security, better harmony and understanding can be accomplished by other means and not necessary using NS.<br></div>
