            <div class='col-md body'>i believe that for jungle warfare in these parts, a small light and mobile force is essential to victory. hence i think the best units to have are small "sticks" of highly well trained soldiers capable of operating in isolation for up to 2 weeks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what ive thought out so far, a hostile armored force shouldnt pose too much of a threat due to the terrain. and I believe the airforce and our tank force can easily handle that threat. I always considered the tanks we have to be better suited to city fighting or point defence... never for large scale manouvering. But what if the hostile army has superior numbers in regular foot soldiers and are more highly trained?<br><br>In WW2 along the eastern front... Germany found that the russians were the masters of the terrain,  often digging in so well... it nullified the heavy bombardment of the germans.  Only through superior manouvering could the germans gain victory over the russians. And tanks played a very crucial part( the terrian was more open there).<br><br>Fast forward to vietnam, the americans bombarded the vietcong like siao, yet they survived and beat the americans through superior use of terrain. So back to the question.... can we face up to a larger force of soldiers more well-trained in jungle warfare?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well let me put it this way. the victors of WW2 were numerically superior.

            <div class='col-md body'>To spencer. Of course it cannot be applied totally because of the terrain difference. But most of the tactics used then are what modern tactics have derived from. i'm interested in how these old tactics have adapted to suit warfare in this modern age and in our local terrain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HENG@, you are obviously not familiar with the numbers. We heavily outnumber any potential opponent in every category except warships. We have more men, light tanks, MBTs, IFVs, artillery, anti-aircraft systems, fighters, helicopters, logistics support, etc than either our northern or our southern neighbor, sometimes more than both combined. Our systems are also arguably superior. Go and do more research.<br><br>Tank tactics are heavily terrain dependant. The problem is that the terrain of the Malay peninsula from an operational POV is not in the public domain. I am sure that MINDEF spends great effort keeping up to date, but we don't know what they know. We don't know how much is jungle, plantation, paddies, swamps, etc. We don't know what kind of roads are where or how strong the bridges are. We don't know where the "go" and "no go" terrain is for different types of vehicles.<br><br>But we can guess based on the actions of MINDEF. All recent SAF armored vehicles have had a width limit of 3m and weight limit of 30 tonnes. That leads me to think that, based on MINDEF terrain studies, vehicles of those parameters will be able to maneuver effectively on the peninsula. Maybe the peninsula is crisscrossed with 3m wide dirt tracks or the plantations have trees 3m apart? Maybe most of the bridges can take 30 tonnes?<br><br>Also, our tankers train in a certain type of armored warfare. This allows us to guess the doctrine of the SAF. It is not wise to reveal too much about this, but they certainly do not intend to dig in and fight in point defense. Again, it is clear that the SAF has a plan, hopefully based on accurate technical intelligence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in reply to your qns....<br><br>i've been through training that involves battalion size of armored forces....this involves maneuvering in jungles (almost similar to ours but much more spaced out....something like m'sia's). one particular exercise involves an ambush where we formed up in line formation before the final assault.<br><br>but then this exercise is against a company sized of enemy with no tank or little tanks support. there are, however, some m113 with flame thrower etc on patrol in their defended vicinity....<br><br>exercise being "unreal", i really doubt the effectiveness of the amoured force as only blanks are used. but overall, the size that came out from ambush is impressive and i wouldn't want to be on the other side....if it were the real thing.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm very interesting. So once again, tanks are back in the picture but used in a different form of armored warfare. this discussion isnt only based on the strength of our northern or southern neighbours( i was thinking maybe further up north? ). Jungle I believe sort of neutralizes our technological advantage, i'm thinking vietnam again. So basic troop training i feel is the MOST important aspect in winning a war here like the japs in WW2.<br><br>I am thinking our artillery will play a very very large part in any offensive. We need sustained bombardments to keep invaders out coupled with air strikes. that way we can clear out large areas of jungle and make our tech. advantage more effective. Maybe thats y SAF interested in MRLS last time becuz they could devastate a whole map grid.</div>

So once again, tanks are back in the picture but used in a different form of armored warfare. this discussion isnt only based on the strength of our northern or southern neighbours( i was thinking maybe further up north? ). Jungle I believe sort of neutralizes our technological advantage, i'm thinking vietnam again. So basic troop training i feel is the MOST important aspect in winning a war here like the japs in WW2.<br><br>I am thinking our artillery will play a very very large part in any offensive. We need sustained bombardments to keep invaders out coupled with air strikes. that way we can clear out large areas of jungle and make our tech. advantage more effective. Maybe thats y SAF interested in MRLS last time becuz they could devastate a whole map grid. </div></blockquote>Dont think we are allowed to buy MLRS lah...it's sort of an offensive weapon and our nation too small to get such weapon. If we really buy ah....think the neighbours will complain like siao.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
