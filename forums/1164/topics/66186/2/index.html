So once again, tanks are back in the picture but used in a different form of armored warfare. this discussion isnt only based on the strength of our northern or southern neighbours( i was thinking maybe further up north? ). Jungle I believe sort of neutralizes our technological advantage, i'm thinking vietnam again. So basic troop training i feel is the MOST important aspect in winning a war here like the japs in WW2.<br><br>I am thinking our artillery will play a very very large part in any offensive. We need sustained bombardments to keep invaders out coupled with air strikes. that way we can clear out large areas of jungle and make our tech. advantage more effective. Maybe thats y SAF interested in MRLS last time becuz they could devastate a whole map grid. </div></blockquote>in ww2, japs are more superior b'cos they've been constant in waging war on other countries. this contributed to their troops being seasoned for war and thus snowballed their victories. japs also introduced tanks into the dense jungles of malaya peninsular during that time when the british thought it is not feasible and a waste of resources as they're also having their own fight in the european theatre and else where...thus japs are able to advance swiftly and are more mobile. (saw pics of jap soldiers riding bicycles &gt; mobility)<br><br>thus, in modern tank warfare, i believe tanks need the most basic form of fighting support = the infantry/armored infantry. other elements like the air force (umbrella cover) as well as artillery (shock and stay put) etc to complement it for a successful campaign.<br><br>this combination is common even in ww2 era....just the execution and men/machines involved that is the critical factor in winning the campaign.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dkhoo:</div><div class="quote_body">HENG@, you are obviously not familiar with the numbers. We heavily outnumber any potential opponent in every category except warships. We have more men, light tanks, MBTs, IFVs, artillery, anti-aircraft systems, fighters, helicopters, logistics support, etc than either our northern or our southern neighbor, sometimes more than both combined. Our systems are also arguably superior. Go and do more research.<br><br>Tank tactics are heavily terrain dependant. The problem is that the terrain of the Malay peninsula from an operational POV is not in the public domain. I am sure that MINDEF spends great effort keeping up to date, but we don't know what they know. We don't know how much is jungle, plantation, paddies, swamps, etc. We don't know what kind of roads are where or how strong the bridges are. We don't know where the "go" and "no go" terrain is for different types of vehicles.<br><br>But we can guess based on the actions of MINDEF. All recent SAF armored vehicles have had a width limit of 3m and weight limit of 30 tonnes. That leads me to think that, based on MINDEF terrain studies, vehicles of those parameters will be able to maneuver effectively on the peninsula. Maybe the peninsula is crisscrossed with 3m wide dirt tracks or the plantations have trees 3m apart? Maybe most of the bridges can take 30 tonnes?<br><br>Also, our tankers train in a certain type of armored warfare. This allows us to guess the doctrine of the SAF. It is not wise to reveal too much about this, but they certainly do not intend to dig in and fight in point defense. Again, it is clear that the SAF has a plan, hopefully based on accurate technical intelligence.</div></blockquote>do u really want a war to happen to prove you wrong?<br>our force is a deterent, its not meant for winning the war. u may win the battle but it doesn't mean u'll win the war. We have no resources to speak of, our forces may have more of any equipment among any armed force, we do not have the luxury of being able to win any dragged out war. While we can have the best intelligence, having intelligence alone with an inadequate force is at best, to fight a delaying battle. The water problem alone will kill us outright. An army, no matter how advanced, still has basic needs to be fufilled.<br>I hope we are not so complacent as to overestimate our abilities, but to be realistic about the harsh realities of war. We may be able to delay long enough for international aid to arrive or we may not, its up to anyones guess. To have a sense of "sure-win" mindset and to overestimate oneself almost led to the downfall of the Israelis in the Yom Kippur War.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okok.... my stance on this fantasy weapon "firestorm" is that it remains as a defensive weapon. Limited range , and based in sg. If no one attacks us.... no reason to fire it right? I did think abt agent orange, that was chemical, i was thinking more of a mad tsunami of fire... raging across the land... burning all vegetation to dust in a matter of a few days or hours.

            <div class='col-md body'>HENG@, I never said anything about being aggressive to our neighbors. Of course peace is preferable under any circumstances. A war in the region would benefit no one. That is precisely why the SAF has to be so strong. Because we suffer from many strategic disadvantages, we must make up for them with technological, tactical and material advantages if the SAF is to be a credible deterrent. Any potential foe must realize that invasion of Singapore is futile, and that we have the armed strength to secure our interests in the region. If the SAF ever becomes too weak to be a credible deterrent, it will encourage diplomatic and ultimately military assault upon Singapore and lead to war. Hence, the stronger the SAF is, the more peaceful ASEAN will be. The conscript nature of the SAF helps ensure that she will not be used for illegitimate or aggressive purposes.<br><br>VINSANITY, I don't think completely destroying the jungles of the peninsula is possible or necessary. You don't seem to realize how big even a small country like Malaysia is -- a side effect of living in Singapore too much, maybe? Burning everything down would require catastrophic levels of force. Anyway, I don't think it is necessary, since our armored vehicles have probably been designed to pass through a good portion of the terrain they will encounter. Either that, or their doctrine has been written to be suitable for their capabilities.<br><br>After all, you don't have to slavishly follow the doctrine of Blitzkrieg or armored divisions, and burn down a whole jungle to do it. You create your doctrine according to your environment, then acquire equipment and train in accordance with your doctrine, revising the doctrine as circumstances change. If Blitzkrieg is impossible on the peninsula, then we will fight another way. Just because Guderian used it does not mean it is the word of God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okok the firestorm thingy was a stupid idea... but i thought it would be funny to bring up. I totally agree with you on the fact that blitzkrieg tactics cannot be fully followed here becuz.... its been 60+yrs.... and the terrain is different. what im interested in is how our armour is used.... when ppl bring up suggestions... i try to relate it to a similar wartime battle ( vietnam ww2 etcetc).  Im not looking for a complete final answer, I just like to discuss abt this topic as i feel its very interesting..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think we're all going off topic now. The point of this thread was just to discuss tactics that can be employed in any armed conflicts around this region. I was interested in "Blitzkrieg" tactics and was wondering whether it is possible to implement such strategies in our regional context ( we have a lot of jungle terrain ).. with an emphasis on armored warfare. A lot of ppl have come forward and offered lots of thoughtful suggestions.  This thread is not about the defense of singapore... how long we will last...blah blah..<br><br>Ok back to discussion... i dont think island hopping is feasible.... unless you take over enemy airfields or are talking abt helicopters. The americans were successful in doing this becuz they had a chain of pacific islands to hop from. And the aircraft then were a lot more rugged..... i cant think of any combat aircraft with roughfield capability in this region... cept maybe thailand with harriers. And... aircraft had to island hop last time becuz of the lack of range.. now no problem.</div>
