            <div class='col-md body'>My take on this... i'm no tank expert too anyway. hehehe<br><br>use heavy tanks to punch through and try and secure a primary forward defensive position in the very early stages of war due to lack of strategic depth.<br><br>Rapid deployment of manoverable force like Infantry to go up and dig in with the heavy tanks to further protect them from infantry insurgents and guerilla activities. Guards forces deployed to raid key installation in close proximity of forward positions supported by light tanks.<br><br>Meanwhile, LSTs land more light tanks and infantry forces from coastal hook and make enemies fight 2 fronts. Heavy tanks will then punch through progressively with Infantry support up the MSR.<br><br>The above is what i'll do if I'm the general loh. hehehe... IMHO, tanks cannot survive on its own in dense jungle terrain. And if you take away the vegetation, infantry forces no cover liao leh. That's why SAF is based on combined arms divisions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think artillery is important in jungle warfare... because the denseness of the jungle limits a tank's or soldier's firing range. I remember the germans fielding multiple rocket systems at the infantry level. Like a small bundle of tubes of  9 or something. They were accurate but had limited range. Think it would be useful now?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm interesting strat. I want to make some adjustments...  I think heavy tanks arent going to be very effective at the front line. I would send hordes or RPVs for intelligence first. Helo insert commandos ... scouts behind enemy lines. The light tanks and ifvs will be spearheading the attack mainly moving up the peninsula at a rapid pace due to their mobility. Heavy tanks in second line preventing flanking manouvers by enemy.  Of course try to control airspace asap and intro attack helo support all the way. Insert Guards and LSV's just behind enemy lines to wreck havoc on supply lines and artillery. If possible LSTs land rapid reaction force on east or west coast ( west better becuz further from east malaysia ). Sending the fast and light tanks will give a great amount of flexibility. In the event where a light armored column is met with stiff resistance.. they can immediately withdraw to second line of heavy tanks and nearby forces can help in a "pincer" manouver.<br><br>Im basically adapting blitzkrieg tactics here.... so juz start with artillery and air bombardment.... up until the very last minute where the light armored vehicles and infantry attack. Momentum is of the upmost importance... the enemy cannot have the chance to regroup.

MBT are mainly used for open space combats like those used in desert war and such. They  need large area to turn and move around so it's hard for them to fight in the jungle here too due to the thick vegetation.<br><br>With your theory of landing in the west rather than the east. If the time really comes and we'll definitely strike first against the northern enemies, do you think the surrounding neighbours will just look at you striking at a religious brother of theirs? And where is your so call mass number of refugees gonna come from? You gonna catch all those people from johor and suddenly release them to create that mass evacuation of yours?<br><br>We can see  the blitzkrieg tactics in almost every war. Even in LOTR. They attack first with their catapults and wyvern, throwing in  those heads of knights to lower the defender's morales then move in with the battering rams and landing towers. When the door comes down the first enemy you see are the huge size trolls and finally the infantry. It's the standard procedure of every war, so no point you coming here and say how to fight the war.

But if like you say, push up very fast right and then gain alot of ground, the MSR will be very vulnerable, in the end, will become like Iraq where US combat trains are always ambushed. And that is in an open desert terrain leh... If its in a jungle, i think the forward light tank forces will face a possibility of being cut off by guerilla forces and run out of ammo and fuel.<br><br>You are very interested in WWII Germans hoh?.. hehehe...</div>

How you gonna hit them hard when they fire 2 rounds at you and you got to chase them for the whole day? It's not on how they use guerilla tactic to attack you. It's how they defend while you only got a limited number of supply that's gonna kill you.<br><br>How far back are you gonna place the heavy tanks? If the offensive group fights deep into the forest, your heavy tanks will have problems going in. Cannot heli insert too cause too heavy..in the end it'll be another exhibit at the museum when the war end.</div>

That's why our best defence is still offence..if our army is dug in. there is abs no room to manuveur..all they need to do call in MLRS + arty bombarement.....i beleive there have enuf to flatten at least hald of singapore?</div>

I think heavy tanks arent going to be very effective at the front line. I would send hordes or RPVs for intelligence first. Helo insert commandos ... scouts behind enemy lines.<br><br>The light tanks and ifvs will be spearheading the attack mainly moving up the peninsula at a rapid pace due to their mobility. Heavy tanks in second line preventing flanking manouvers by enemy.  Of course try to control airspace asap and intro attack helo support all the way.<br><br>Insert Guards and LSV's just behind enemy lines to wreck havoc on supply lines and artillery. If possible LSTs land rapid reaction force on east or west coast ( west better becuz further from east malaysia ). Sending the fast and light tanks will give a great amount of flexibility. In the event where a light armored column is met with stiff resistance.. they can immediately withdraw to second line of heavy tanks and nearby forces can help in a "pincer" manouver.<br><br>Im basically adapting blitzkrieg tactics here.... so juz start with artillery and air bombardment.... up until the very last minute where the light armored vehicles and infantry attack. Momentum is of the upmost importance... the enemy cannot have the chance to regroup. Induce a mass evacuation of civilians so they may confuse enemy forces up north( they have to contend with the sudden influx of refugees). Rinse and repeat. Introduce mass propaganda campaign to lower enemy moral or to defect to our side. This strat I believe can gain a lot of ground and leave the enemy in ruins. what do you all think??</div></blockquote>You older than me.....I think or that WW2 book has really sunk in! Intelligence is always there (everyday) in many forms. RPVs, HUMINT, ELINT, etc Actually strategically, you can buy satellite SPOT images or the Russian equivalent. Of course you buddy with US big brother you get for free.<br><br>Problem is in the interpretation, forming one coherent picture and digesting!

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not very old in the first place... juz turned 18 last month... ive delayed my ns for another 3 yrs to finish studies...<br><br>I think any force moving up north must avoid the highways during the offensive as they are most likely going to be watched. Ambushes anyone?<br>Only when the frontline force has gone through a particular area then maybe the trucks can use the highways to bring supplies to the front quickly. So I think  during the offensive, troops have to avoid high areas... use dead ground... get plenty of cover and camo.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway the highways will be clogged full of fleeing ppl. You dont have to tell them anything, juz fire a few shots ( not at them of course )and the some of the local pupulation will start driving their protons up north. wouldnt you flee asap and avoid areas of conflict?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AMX-13SM1 is definitely old and almost close to being obsolete. However, one must not underestimated the fire power of them. Each tank is armed with 2 MG and a 75mm Main Gun. The main gun can fire a range of munitions(WP,CAN.FS &amp; HE). The tanks operate in platoons of 4 vehicles. That will be a total of 8 MG and 4 main guns. Imagine they form up in a line and charge at an entrenched position.Even if you minus the main guns, the 8 MGs spraying 7.62mm rds is indeed frightening! Although it cannot operate in dense tropical jungle very effectively,due to it relatively small size it is able to operate in in the plantations up north. Remember gentlemen, lots of land have already been converted to oil palm and rubber plantations. The trees are planted in a fashion where the space between the trees are standardised. Due to this advantage, i dun feel that the SM1 is totally obsolete yet at least not in another 5 years before its replacement is unveiled. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
