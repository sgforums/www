WP I believe is "Phosphorus (spelling)". right?<br><br>Actually 8 MGs are no big deal compared with 4 x 25mm and 4 x MGs for 4 Bionix if you minus out the main gun. At this kind of short-range encounter, I feel that the 25mm will be more lethal compared with the 75mm main gun.  The 75mm Main gun is already next to useless as it is being overtaken by the 25mm gun in short range fire support and is completely useless when faced with our "friend's" T72s.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Guderian proposed that tanks should be used in a concentrated mass instead of being spread all across the frontline. ï¿½Using a tanks mobility, an armored force can easily puncture the frontline defence while a second or third force can flank the enemy position thus allowing a pincer like manouver. This action should be done quickly and swiftly to achieve surprise and to prevent the enemy from regrouping. This strategy is part of what we call the "Blitzkrieg</blockquote>Yes the father of armoured warfare proposed and infact trained the intial batch of tankers for the Wehrmacht.He wanted the tanks to be used as an armoured fist banging the enemy at 1point and running through.After which the tanks will flank the enemy and trap the enemy between the tanks and advancing infantry.Note at this point the only infantry units the Panzer regiments will have would be the Panzer Grenadier troops that followed in the half-tracks.That is armoured warfare as directed by Guderian.However Blitzkrieg is a total warfare that is presently still practised.Namely by the USA.Ofcause 60 years of experience and technology has made the Blitzkrieg of today far more effective.The chief purpose of the blitz was to take out the enemy in as fast a way as possible before he has a chance to use his full potential.For example the low countries and poland were caught out still mobilzing troops when the attack came and never got to their max amount of soldiers depolyed before their positions were overran.The blitz and the armoured warfare needed the soldiers to be indepented and not be held back  when a chance was seen.The officers needed to know what to do and how not to wait for orders.At present the US army with all it's high tech grear is extremely independent on the battlefield.Like the German's of ww2 they are also very moblie.Ofcause technology has made the US even better as they can see the picture more clearly.<br><br><blockquote>Airpower alone cannot win a conflict in this part of the world ( think vietnam ).<br>Fast forward to vietnam, the americans bombarded the vietcong like siao, yet they survived and beat the americans through superior use of terrain. So back to the question.... can we face up to a larger force of soldiers more well-trained in jungle warfare</blockquote>It is commonly known that airpower alone cannot win wars though Kosovo is more of an example then vietnam.Infact the US did not lose vietnam on a purely military standpoint.They only lost the political war.Heck they barely even touched the North in their bombing campaign.The vietcong had little supplies when the US started bombing the trails that they used to bring supplies in.When the US pulled out the front was pretty intact i believe not to sure though.<br><blockquote>Btw... any experts on WW2 in the pacific theatre? I'm interested at how the americans drove the japanese out, especially from the phillipines and the pacific islands. Could be more related, as the terrain is roughly the same</blockquote>Sure grit and heavy use of airpower.Tanks were rarely used(flamethrower tanks aside)<br><br><blockquote>japs also introduced tanks into the dense jungles of malaya peninsular during that time when the british thought it is not feasible and a waste of resources as they're also having their own fight in the european theatre and else where</blockquote>Japanese tanks were crap.....comparable to the charB or PZ 3's<br><br><blockquote>In a book by another german commander called "Panzer Battles". the author pointed out the failure of british armor in WW2. Because the british grouped the tanks with the infantry... the tanks were more for infantry support. this reduced the mobility of the tanks during an armed confrontation. Germany thought differently, they massed their tanks and each panzer force included its own logistics and supply division. So their tanks basically out manouvered the british becasue they were not hindered by their infantry</blockquote>The tanks were classified as support and thus grouped with the artiliary.<br><blockquote>yes, you were right in the tanks part but note that they are where when the battle took place? and during then, the bazookas aren't carried around or as mobile as nowadays....also, they don;t kill tanks remotely like what we do now....definitely these need to be discounted if you only want to talk abt past campaigns.<br><br>if you've watched Band of Brothers....remember the scene whereby the British tankers refused to fire at a cluster of buildings just b'cos there's an order to protect them?? but the panzers are hiding in between these said buildings waiting to ambush and kill their enemies. and who noticed the panzers??? the infantry elites....my guess is that if they've lots of bazookas with them at that time, they would have taken out these panzers, laughing.<br></blockquote>Every platoon of german and i think even US troops were given at least 1 or 2 anti-armour weapon.(Bazooka or PanzerFuast,/Panzercheck)<br>And since the tank was a tiger i doubt those wld do anything other then throw a track.<br><blockquote>I was interested in "Blitzkrieg" tactics and was wondering whether it is possible to implement such strategies in our regional context ( we have a lot of jungle terrain ).. with an emphasis on armored warfare.</blockquote>Blitzkrieg has to be implemented otherwised we are screwed.....we cannot afford attrition.However i think we should be more infantry based but with heavy supporting fire(both direct and indirect) and some armour.</div>

However, one must not underestimated the fire power of them. Each tank is armed with 2 MG and a 75mm Main Gun. The main gun can fire a range of munitions(WP,CAN.FS &amp; HE). The tanks operate in platoons of 4 vehicles. That will be a total of 8 MG and 4 main guns. Imagine they form up in a line and charge at an entrenched position.Even if you minus the main guns, the 8 MGs spraying 7.62mm rds is indeed frightening! Although it cannot operate in dense tropical jungle very effectively,due to it relatively small size it is able to operate in in the plantations up north. Remember gentlemen, lots of land have already been converted to oil palm and rubber plantations. The trees are planted in a fashion where the space between the trees are standardised. Due to this advantage, i dun feel that the SM1 is totally obsolete yet at least not in another 5 years before its replacement is unveiled. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>That is assuming that all 4 tanks are functional and working..That is not likely to happen.

            <div class='col-md body'>guys, rather than looking at one sided (singapore side), why not look across the straits and talk abt how the scorpion &amp;/or more likely russian FVs that can pose a hindrance on the way up north (should we go....or should they come down)<br><br>i'd like to see how their armour superiority in terms of ours...also how would they likely come down/ maneuvour given their own mass and having heavy armour as well.<br></div>

They seem to possess a lot of 90mm though..a bit disadvantage for us rite. since, we only have less than 10 90mm calibre tanks.</div>

Any thoughts anyone?<br></div></blockquote>Actually the main the amoured force for MAF few years ago are mainly the Sibmas(164) &amp; the Condor(459). They are pretty old and rather soft skin(up to 7.62). They have poor tactical mobility especially all the 4x4 wheeled AFVs.<br><br>The tracked veh they have then are the 26 Scorpion 90s and 25 Stormer MICVs mainly use for armoured recon.<br><br>SAF realised in the 70s that the wheeled AFV are very not mobile in our tropical rain forest terrain and migrated all to tracked(V-200 to M113), it take another 2 decades for the MAF to realise that! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Well, they are going toward all tracked AFV armour force with their purchase of 110 KIFVs( modified M113 similar to AIFV standard), initially mainly bought for UN operation in Bosnia, lately ordered 211 Turkish ACV300 Nurol(another modified M113, AIFV standard) and lastly 48 PT-91s Polish upgrade T-72s with another 14 support vehs.<br><br>As more tracked AFVs come on line,rumour has it that most of the 4x4 wheeled Condors will most probably be retired and the rest of the 4x4 have most probably already retired. Otherwise their AFVs are like rojak just like their airforce. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The new MAF armoured forces will be much better armoured up to14.5mm, and have better tactical mobility than the Sibmas &amp; Condor, that certainly as good as our Ultra , maybe lose out to Bionix. But we still have numerical superiority.<br><br>Their pathetic number for their MBTs against our soon to be replaced SM1 and Tempests , I think we are still pretty comfortable.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: darkred;">CHARGE!!!</span></strong></span><br><img src="http://www.amatorce.de/Mehmet.gif"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Judging from the current trend in sg's buying of armored vehicles, a new MBT would probably be locally designed but have borrowed components from other MBTs. Maybe a lighter version of the merkava, Leopard 2, challenger 2 or leclerc tanks. After operating the tempests for so long, i'm sure they have all the experience needed to tailor a MBT suited to local conditions. Can sell to Thailand also if interested. Maybe its one of those sg "black" programs that the gahmen will never reveal... silver bullets!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry about the MBT replacement for our Tempest. We already got itand have been training in them for quite some time already! But its highly classified! AI stands for armour infantry and its plural so its not just one man out of each vehicle! The number of men in each vehicle should not be discussed here. We have been trained to identified Russian AFVs until recently,so my question is that does any of our neighbouring countries operate T-72 MBT? And I am not referring to the PT-91. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
