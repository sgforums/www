              <p>The closest parallel to the issue is the Korean peninsula. It's like saying that North Korea's invasion was justified, or that American intereference in a future invasion is unjustified.</p>
              <p>The PRC and Taiwan were born of civil war over 50 years ago. There has been no internationally recognized claim by one over the other, or recognition of the right of use of force. Grievances and causes of division are not recognised, especially where hostilities have ceased for so many years. Only the principle of self determination has been upheld, whether it is for unification, independence or the status quo.</p>
              <p>Hosting American bases are a following and secondary issue for Europeans, Koreans, Japanese or Turks to decide on their own.</p>

              <p>The US recognized ROC before 1971, after that it recognizes PRC. UN seat for China was represented by ROC before 1971, after that it was PRC. That is international recognication. The fact remains, PRC and ROC, mainland China and Taiwan are ONE country. So outsiders, such as the US should stay out of the dispute within the same country.</p>
              <p>The european and the US still believe that selling opium to China was justified. What benefits them if mainland China were unified with Taiwan?</p>
              <p>If the principle of sell determination is to be upheld, then the independence of China should be respected, the Chinese, and the Chinese alone should decide how China should unify. Don't think the chinese, on either side, want to go to war with one another.</p>

              <p>It is never free to enter a war, you need to buy weapons first. It is the weapons suppliers who decide, will they provide the weapon free? The US don't have to take sides, they can supply weapons to both sides. How about selling F35 to the PLA?</p>

              <p>All of which reduces Taiwan from recognized government of mainland China to the status of a disputed territory.

              <p>An independent Taiwan needs USA to guarantee its security, only as far as China does not recognise its independence.</p>

              <p>How Chinese is Taiwan? Taiwan was Ainu and Ryukyu before annexation by the Qing, before the KMT retreated there. Exactly how "Chinese" is Taiwan?</p>
              <p>I raised the Falklands and Koreas to show that it is for the inhabitants to decide by referendum who to belong to, not for any colonial or pre-colonial power to decide. Which is why UN Command fought in Korea, and Britain is bound to return the Falklands when they so vote.</p>
              <p>UN de jure recognition of authority over the sum of mainland and island landmass simply passed from Taipei to Beijing in 1971. Taiwan previously claimed the entire landmass on the basis of having governed it after 1911 and 1945. Beijing claims the entire landmass as heir to the Qing government, including Taiwan as an ex-Qing province, despite never having established Communist jurisdiction on Taiwan. Independence advocates have a stronger case than Beijing, if Taiwan's inhabitants so choose.</p>
              <p>Independence is not ruled out just because the UN, US or anyone lumps two lands together and recognise "One China" or "Two Koreas", is it?</p>
              <p>"One China" is a mere principle based on common colour and 
                                  cuture, lacking any bearing on the wishes of Taiwan's, Xinjiang's or 
                                  Tibet's inhabitants. As you showed, this basis is questionable. It is conveniently espoused by most nations wishing not to antagonise Beijing, and a handful of smaller nations who rather recognise Taipei. Your Yunnanese or other "Chinese" peoples are free to seek their path 
                                  whether independence or autonomy or union. Are you saying it is

              <p>china wants to reclaim taiwan because taiwan is part of china.  we are talking about territory here.</p>
              <p>the reason why china wont allow taiwan independence is because other areas will want it too.  china always use the word ä¸»æ�ƒ coz they have the right over taiwan.</p>
              <p>and china is COMMUNIST not democractic.  so the people are NOT FREE to seek their path as you put it.</p>
              <p>of course having said all this taiwan is free to resist.  thats why china may resort to force.  of course other countries may interfere.  but then there is always a price to pay.  are the americans or UN willing to pay the price?</p>

              <p>US army will be a strong force for many years to come, but they can't afford to have too many fronts, they have never won a prolonged war in the far east, except for the use of atomic bomb, they will have to revalue how they want to commit their forces to areas that are close to their benefit, hope they should realize they better have more friends than potential enemies.</p>

              <p>This emotional construct in the minds of China's population,

              <p>I'm not sure what's the percentage but you often hear about PRC's leaving china because they want more freedom and democracy. younger ones go about saying they feel oppressed in their own country.</p>
              <p>but what if democracy turns around and bitch slap them in the face.</p>
              <p>if parts of china like tibet and xinjiang voted for independence instead, they were not, were never part of the whole chinese culture thing beyond getting invaded every now and then by the chinese.</p>
              <p>but when in comes to democracy the "han chinese" majority would very likely use democracy to vote to crush the democracy of the minority.</p>

              <p>there are 14 countries with borders with China. Mongolia, Russia, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afganistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, not including Japan. Over the last 200 years, which do you see have dispute with China and were given the big stick by China?</p>
              <p>Actually, China were stuck by many small sticks from the countries from the west thousand of miles away. They robbed the imperial palace, made settlements in many provinces (that is why all the european architecture in shangdong, shanghai...), and sold opinium to the chinese. They lost wars and gave away Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.</p>
              <p>Map of China were never drawn until the Qing Dynasty, when emperor kangxi (the fourth emperor of the qing dynastry) wanted to know how far he needed to stretch his army to protect his people. that was around  1700, around the same time as the beginning of the UK and when the whites are killing the red indian and fighting among themselves in the american continent (for territories, I suppose). Since then had China expanded?</p>
              <p>china had a long history, with written records, it began from Xia Dynastry at about 2100 BC. Wars were fought when dynasty changed, but within the same dynasty, qing dynasty stretched from 1644 to 1911 (267 years), Ming dynasty from 1368 io 1644 (276 years), song dynasty from 618 to 907 (289 years), just to name a few....these are known as the golden age, peace and prosperity, å¤ªå¹³ç››ä¸–.  And outside of China, within these period of time, how many of the neighboring territories were annexed to China? even the Cheng Ho expedition, have they colonized any one single island they visited?</p>
              <p>the Kingdom of great britain started in 1707, 304 years to date, when did the irish stopped bombing in Belfast, how many military conquests went under the william jack, here and far, making colonies and "taking" resources? </p>
              <p>the USA were independent in 1776, 235 years to date. They never fought among themselves since, but before that, they slaughtered the native indians, chased the red coat back to the other side of the atlantic, and then fought a civil war themselves. Since then, can you count how many wars they fought on others territories? and, when did they free the negro from slavery?</p>

              <p>china is not an aggressive country.  just because they are communist people tend to think they are no good.</p>
              <p>how many countries have US fought with or attacked already?  libya, afghanistan, vietnam, korea, iraq, sudan.... and the list goes on.  how many of these wars are justifiable?  either they kaypoh or they attacked out of their own interest.</p>
              <p>yet they complain when china upgrade their military.</p>
