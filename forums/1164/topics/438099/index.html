              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>WASHINGTON : The 
              United States has decided not to sell Taiwan new F-16 fighter jets and 
              will instead provide upgrades to its existing planes, a US congressional
               source said Friday.<br><br>The US State Department was to brief key 
              lawmakers Friday on the decision, which was sure to anger China critics 
              in the US Congress and upset Taiwan, but "no official announcement will 
              be made for weeks," the official said.<br><br>"We are hearing from State that it will be an upgrade and no sale," the source, who requested anonymity, told AFP.<br><br>Taiwan
               applied in 2007 to buy 66 F-16 C/D fighters, which have better radars 
              and more powerful weapon systems than the 146 F-16 A/Bs it currently 
              has, in response to China's growing military muscle.<br><br>US magazine 
              Defense News reported recently that Washington had told Taiwan it will 
              not sell the jets, but both US and Taiwan officials have insisted no 
              final decision has been made, amid strong Chinese resistance to the 
              sales.<br><br>And the Washington Times reported Thursday that the 
              upgrades would be part of a $4.2 billion arms package for Taiwan from US
               President Barack Obama's administration.<br><br>The White House in 
              January 2010 had announced a $6.4 billion arms deal with Taiwan which 
              included Patriot missiles, Black Hawk helicopters and equipment for 
              Taiwan's existing F-16 fleet, but no submarines or new fighter jets.<br><br>Beijing considers Taiwan part of its territory awaiting reunification with the mainland, by force if necessary.<br><br>Washington recognizes Beijing rather than Taipei but remains a leading arms supplier to the island.<br><br>In
               response to the reports, Republican Senator John Cornyn condemned the 
              decision as "capitulation to Communist China" and "a sad day in American
               foreign policy" as well as "a slap in the face to a strong ally and 
              long-time friend."<br><br>"This sale would have been a win-win, 
              bolstering the national security of two democratic nations and 
              supporting jobs for an American workforce that desperately needs them," 
              he said in a statement.<br><br>And Tseng Yung-chuan, the deputy speaker 
              of Taiwan's parliament and member of the ruling Kuomintang party, 
              renewed calls for the fighter jets during talks with senior US lawmakers
               in Washington earlier this week.<br><br>If the administration decides 
              against selling F-16 jets, "the people of Taiwan will feel regret," 
              Tseng told AFP in an interview on Tuesday.<br><br> - AFP /ls</span></span></p>

              <p>And do you know what is ballistic missile and how to intercept them?? They descend from space...</p>
              <p>And HF III cruise missile probably can be easily intercept by CWIS. Super sonic missiles are easily spotted by their high heat signature despite its fast speed</p>
              <p>Finally , the final nail. ROC HFIII are crap..</p>

              <p>Tell me how can ROC defend against PRC?? Please update yrself of th lastest technology of both side. If a war broke out now. ROC will be captured by PRC in less than 24 hrs.</p>

              <p>Why U.S wants to block China-Taiwan unification:</p>

              <h1 id="page-title" class="title" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 2.5em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: italic; text-transform: none; line-height: 1em; letter-spacing: 0.5px; ">Why We Need Taiwan</h1>
              <p> <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px;">A spate of articles, op-eds and comment pieces have appeared in the U.S. press and academic journals in recent months arguing that Taiwan is not important to America and/or isn’t worth fighting China over, that the United States cannot afford to spend more on its military (which it has to in order to protect Taiwan), and that Taiwan should be abandoned.</span></p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">Some, a lot fewer, have come to Taiwan’s defense and argue otherwise.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">There are numerous arguments to be made that Taiwan is an ally that should be kept. It is a democracy. It is sovereign. It is faithful to the United States, etc.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">The critical case to be made, however, is—or at least should be—that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Taiwan is strategically important to the United States.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">I believe there are two good arguments to be made for Taiwan’s strategic importance: One comes from looking at the history of the United States. The other from geopolitics.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">In December 1890, the United States Army won a battle against American Indians at Wounded Knee in South Dakota. This battle marked the end of the Indian Wars and meant that the United States could focus on external matters since it had finally consolidated its territory in the west.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">Within ten years of Wounded Knee, the United States was on the way to becoming a world power. In 1898, the U.S. Navy won the Spanish American War. It acquired the Philippines and Guam as a result. The same year, the U.S. incorporated Hawaii and signed a tripartite agreement on Samoa.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">In 1900, America made Wake Island its territory. Shortly after the United States started building the Panama Canal.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">The expansion of the U.S. Navy was vital to all of this happening. And it continued. By the end of WWI, the U.S. Navy was the world’s largest. It built aircraft carriers that were the game-changing weapon in the Pacific during World War II, and in 1945, the U.S. had a fleet of 1,600 ships; no other nation was close to competing with America.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; "><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">China’s reunification of Taiwan will be its Wounded Knee. It will no longer need to focus on territorial matters and will doubtless look to realize power ambitions further from its shores.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">This relates to the second argument, the geopolitical one.</p>

              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">To get into the Pacific Ocean, China’s naval vessels must go through one of various choke points between these islands. Its merchant marine (as well as its navy), in order to sail to the Middle East and Africa where China acquires most of its energy and natural resources, must go south through the Strait of Malacca, which is equally constraining.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">Some strategists refer to the island chain in East Asia as the “Great Wall in reverse.” China’s naval officers and strategists see China as “boxed in.” Clearly geography does not favor China in its goal of expanding its influence into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

China’s navy would no longer be hemmed in. </span></span></strong>As a matter of fact, it would be able to extend its reach to the “second island chain”—Guam, the Marianas and some other small islands in the central Pacific—not much of a barrier.</p>
              <p style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 1.125em; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; line-height: 28px; ">Very important, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Taiwan’s east-coast ports would give China’s submarines, which are a mainstay of its navy, a huge benefit.

              <p>If you say China is so peaceful, why should Taiwan be denied
                  weapons for deterrence and self defence? Reunification by force is
                  neither justified nor desirable for any party involved.</p>
              <p>Of course China or any country can invade Taiwan. But Taiwan can
                  hold PRC cities hostage the same way the PRC holds Taiwanese cities
                  hostage. And why should this not be the case? Why should the price
                  of invasion be worth it to China? This price has been suppressed by
                  refusal to sell arms to Taiwan.</p>

              <p>But you made the point that Taiwanese missiles are inferior to China's. Add to this the majority of Taiwan's weapons systems are obsolete or downgraded at point of sale, or both.</p>
              <p>Even Singapore maintains an overmatch relative to its neighbours and would not consider standing still for a decade, especially regarding the air force.</p>

              <p>I don't understand some of the others' pro-unification views here.</p>
              <p>The closest parallel to the issue is the Korean peninsula. It's like saying that North Korea's invasion was justified, or that American intereference in a future invasion is unjustified.</p>
              <p>The PRC and Taiwan were born of civil war over 50 years ago. There has been no internationally recognized claim by one over the other, or recognition of the right of use of force. Grievances and causes of division are not recognised, especially where hostilities have ceased for so many years. Only the principle of self determination has been upheld, whether it is for unification, independence or the status quo.</p>
              <p>Hosting American bases are a following and secondary issue for Europeans, Koreans, Japanese or Turks to decide on their own.</p>
