              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>TAIPEI: The United 
              States on Wednesday announced a $5.85 billion upgrade of Taiwan's F-16 
              fighter jets, leading to a swift rebuke by China even though the deal 
              stopped short of selling new planes.<br><br>Taiwanese and US officials 
              insisted that the upgrade would improve the island's defences as it 
              faces a rising China, which has ramped up military spending and has 
              widened its strategic edge over the self-governing territory.<br><br>"After
               the upgrade, the air force's combat capability will be advanced 
              hugely," Taiwan's defence minister Kao Hua-chu told a hastily called 
              press conference in Taipei.<br><br>China, which claims Taiwan as its 
              territory and has repeatedly warned the United States not to sell 
              weapons, summoned the new US ambassador to Beijing, Gary Locke, and 
              warned of repercussions.<br><br>"The wrongdoing by the US side will 
              inevitably undermine bilateral relations as well as exchanges and 
              cooperation in military and security areas," China's vice foreign 
              minister Zhang Zhijun said, according to the official Xinhua news 
              agency.<br><br>Zhang Yesui, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, also lodged a strong protest in Washington, Xinhua said.<br><br>The
               Pentagon formally notified the US Congress of the package for Taiwan on
               Wednesday, ending prolonged speculation over the extent to which 
              Washington would help modernise the island's air force.<br><br>Taipei 
              applied in 2007 to buy 66 F-16 C/D fighters, which have better radar and
               more powerful weapons systems than its F-16 A/Bs, in response to 
              China's growing military muscle.<br><br>The US offer to upgrade Taiwan's
               existing fleet of 146 US-made F-16 A/Bs falls short of that ambition 
              and is seen by some observers on the island as a "consolation prize".<br><br>US
               lawmakers across party lines had pressed President Barack Obama's 
              administration to sell new jets, saying that the move would both protect
               Taiwan and create badly needed jobs in the United States.<br><br>Republican
               Senator John Cornyn accused the Democratic administration of kowtowing 
              to China and failing to meet obligations under the 1979 Taiwan Relations
               Act, which requires Washington to ensure Taiwan's self-defence.<br><br>The
               arms decision "bestows upon Communist China a newfound sway over 
              American national security, and this capitulation should be met with 
              concern by US allies everywhere," Cornyn said.<br><br>"Taiwan must have the tools to defend itself against potential Chinese aggression," he said.<br><br>Cornyn
               has introduced legislation that would force the sale of 66 new F-16s. 
              The senator represents Texas, which would be expected to benefit 
              economically from arms production for Taiwan.<br><br>However, both the 
              Pentagon and Taiwan's defence ministry said that the upgrade, which 
              would take 12 years to complete, would give the island's F-16 A/Bs a 
              significant boost.<br><br>The jets will be equipped with radar capable 
              of detecting Chinese stealth airplanes and may also be armed with 
              precision munition, according to Taiwan's defence ministry.<br><br>The 
              Pentagon said that the retrofit of the aircraft, to be led by weapons 
              giant Lockheed Martin, "will greatly enhance the recipient's ability to 
              defend its borders."<br><br>"This proposed sale serves US national, 
              economic and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing
               efforts to modernise its armed forces and enhance its defensive 
              capability," the Pentagon's Defence Security Cooperation Agency said in a
               statement.<br><br>The Pentagon agency also said that Taiwanese pilots 
              would travel to Luke Air Force Base in Arizona for training in "disaster
               relief missions, non-combatant evacuation operations and other 
              contingency situations."<br><br>Washington recognises Beijing rather 
              than Taipei but remains the primary arms supplier to the island of 23 
              million inhabitants, providing a source of continued Sino-US tension.<br><br>Ties
               between China and Taiwan have improved since Ma Ying-jeou of the 
              China-friendly Kuomintang party came to power in 2008 on promises of 
              ramping up trade links and allowing in more Chinese tourists.<br><br>But
               Beijing has refused to renounce the use of force against Taiwan even 
              though the island has ruled itself for more than six decades since their
               split in 1949 at the end of a civil war.<br><br>- AFP/de</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Both Taiwan and China are same origin. Historically, their leaders cherished its people in view of the prayers and memorial for ancestors. Hope that they continue to cherish the people and not ignorantly on the line of political motivation on self glorification. I think taiwan should begin the journey to purchase arm from China or from where China purchased its arm from so as to regain back and develop its close relationship. Through this sincere cooperation, their cordiality and economy will gradually develop and benefit both their people, and the world at large <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Together, Taiwan and China can contribute a peaceful balance of super-power for a peaceful world. Lets hope for a blissful cooperation between Taiwan and China. The world is a better place for mutual cooperation between Taiwan and China. Theleaders of Taiwan and China have great teaching  like Taoism, Confuciusism and Buddhism, they should learn from them to build a better world for themselves and others. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p></div>

              <p>It is only natural for them to trade with China next door, just as we trade with Malaysia. It does not make them receptive to union with China or lose a Taiwanese identity. I think growing up in a country you would not want it to change into another country.</p>
              <p>The closest integration is visitors from both sides enjoying special visa status as Mainland/Taiwan Compatriots or tong bao.</p>
              <p>Yiou might note that KMT favours the status quo, the traditional opposition DPP favours independence, and there are no pro-union parties. Both have submitted applications for UN membership, vetoed by China. If there was a significant pro-union percentage, there would at least be a small party by now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may say China does not wage war. But the Chinese provinces were counquered and unified in the middle ages. Two non-Chinese regions, Buddhist Tibet and Muslim Xinjiang, were invaded by the communists in modern times. The government makes a show of calling them "Autonomous regions" because making them fully integrated provinces is not politcally acceptable. They make up a quarter of Chinese territory.</p>
              <p>While the US has been involved in many wars, their communist opponents came from somewhere (China or USSR). For some reason in these wars, defections seem to be one way and one side's POWs choose to leave their families forever.</p>
              <p>China has always been a continental land power, it has to maintain armies rather than navies. This explains why it did not colonise Japan, and the annexation of Taiwan came so late in the 4000 years of Chinese history. For the same reason, the French or Germans had few colonies relative to the UK.</p>
              <p>There is no reason two states cannot coexist. If China hates US presence so much, respect Taiwan's safety, both sides will flourish and the US will be without a role in Taiwan. But then Xinjiang and Tibet will be emboldened, and after 60 years of confrontation there will be massive loss of face.</p>
              <p>Anyway, all the pro-union arguments here are still based on the will of PRC's and overseas's Chinese population. It's not nice if somebody decides the future of your home for you, just because your colour and culture are the same.</p>

              <p>Your point 1: Yes, France and Germany had fewer colonies because land defensive needs took priority, unlike the UK whose navy could provide for defence and much greater colonisation.</p>
              <p>2: PLA invasions of Xinjiang and Tibet took place in 1949 and 1951. If you are not aware, you can look up the invasions. See "Incorporation_of_Tibet_into_the_People's_Republic_of_China" on wikipedia. During the middle ages (referring to about 400-1500), you will find that they had their own governments and were at times independent or under a tributary relationship with China. They asserted independence before the modern invasions. One example is the relationship in the Ming dynasty (1368 - 1644). There is a map of Ming China that excludes Tibet and Xinjiang and a section on "Relations with Tibet". Also I think you will also see a different map for each dynasty.</p>
              <p>3: Scholar or not, I hope I have given convincing grounds for Taiwan's right to choose. They do not force Taiwan to be independent. And if Taiwan can choose union, it should be able to choose the terms. I think your stand on Taiwan is based on virtual representation, meaning one group deciding on another's behalf because they are or claim to be similar.</p>

              <p>It probably costs more. The F-16s were originally Block 50 less air to ground capabilities, packed into a Block 20 airframe to appease China. The extra development incurred extra costs, this upgrade will cost too.</p>
              <p>The 14 year old airframe will have to be reset.</p>
              <p>This upgrade is expensive, and Taiwan will still have relatively few missiles of all kinds per aircraft. But it adds what is most sorely lacking, dogfight and strike capabilities.</p>

              <p>so what do vietnamese think about china rule?</p>
              <p>Vietnam became independent from China in AD 938, and its
              independence was only briefly interrupted by china in Ming Dynasty,
              around 1500. After that they fought among themselves, from
              dynasty to dynasty, and later colonized by the French. vietnam
              still still remember the brief war with China after Vietnamn
              invaded Cambodia in 1978, guess by then they forgot china had
              supported them in war with the French and the US. china withdrew
              from vietnam after the war.</p>
              <p>India, clashed with china over disputed territories in 1962,
              afther offering asylum to dalai lama, and china withdrew from
              the disputed territory. Since then china only went to war only once
              against Vietnam in 1978,</p>
              <p>but india continued to wage war with pakistan in 1965,
               1971 and 1999, and at the same time continue to supplied war
              materials to the tamil tiger in srilanka. and as you rightly
              pointed out, nepal is using china to fence off India, so the
              smaller nations around China, China is a greater friend than
              a foe against invading powers.</p>
              <p>And of course, talking about war with China, we should never
              forget Japan. China fought war with Japan in China to
              expand Chinese territory???????????</p>
              <p>China is a continental power, and if its mountains and desserts
              limits its growth, why it didn't expand by sea, to Japan, to south
              asia? The US and the european are continental power too, why are
              they expanding all the way to Asia?</p>
              <p>We should not judge a person by how big he is, but by
              looking at how he grow up, and eventually see how talll he
              stands. There is a lot in history that tells the story.</p>

              <p>the vietnamese were suspicious of the chinese aid once it happened, and were determined not to let the chinese stay. they definitely didn't think China was offering anything out of friendship.</p>
              <p>no matter how the vietnamese fought among themselves its still non of any foreigner's business. Besides the chinese civil wars were way bloodier.</p>
              <p>Nepal's friendship would only last as long as india's there. Once India backs off Nepal would start to China's friendship intolerable. Or when someone finds valuable resources there.</p>
              <p>And about Japan, you're just trying to be a prick just to argue the point that China's a big friendly giant.</p>

              <p>The closest integration is visitors from both sides enjoying

              <p>Yiou might note that KMT favours the status quo, the traditional
              opposition DPP favours independence, and there are no pro-union
              parties. Both have submitted applications for UN membership, vetoed
              by China. If there was a significant pro-union percentage, there
              would at least be a small party by now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may say China does not wage war. But the Chinese provinces
              were counquered and unified in the middle ages. Two non-Chinese
              regions, Buddhist Tibet and Muslim Xinjiang, were invaded by the
              communists in modern times. The government makes a show of calling
              them "Autonomous regions" because making them fully integrated
              provinces is not politcally acceptable. They make up a quarter of
              Chinese territory.</p>
              <p>While the US has been involved in many wars, their communist
              opponents came from somewhere (China or USSR). For some reason in
              these wars, defections seem to be one way and one side's POWs
              choose to leave their families forever.</p>
              <p>China has always been a continental land power, it has to
              maintain armies rather than navies. This explains why it did not
              colonise Japan, and the annexation of Taiwan came so late in the
              4000 years of Chinese history. For the same reason, the French or
              Germans had few colonies relative to the UK.</p>
              <p>There is no reason two states cannot coexist. If China hates US
              presence so much, respect Taiwan's safety, both sides will flourish
              and the US will be without a role in Taiwan. But then Xinjiang and
              Tibet will be emboldened, and after 60 years of confrontation there
              will be massive loss of face.</p>
              <p>Anyway, all the pro-union arguments here are still based on the
              will of PRC's and overseas's Chinese population. It's not nice if
              somebody decides the future of your home for you, just because your
              colour and culture are the same.</p>

              <p>its not possible, traditional chinese thought goes in a way where you must unite the country, and Taiwan is a thorn in the side as a breakaway province. With CCP recognised as the govt of Mainland it leaves taiwan as nothing more then a rebel province.</p>

              <p>2: PLA invasions of Xinjiang and Tibet took place in 1949 and
              1951. If you are not aware, you can look up the invasions. See
              "Incorporation_of_Tibet_into_the_People's_Republic_of_China" on
              wikipedia. During the middle ages (referring to about 400-1500),
              you will find that they had their own governments and were at times
              independent or under a tributary relationship with China. They
              asserted independence before the modern invasions. One example is
              the relationship in the Ming dynasty (1368 - 1644). There is a map
              of Ming China that excludes Tibet and Xinjiang and a section on
              "Relations with Tibet". Also I think you will also see a different
              map for each dynasty.</p>
              <p>3: Scholar or not, I hope I have given convincing grounds for
              Taiwan's right to choose. They do not force Taiwan to be
              independent. And if Taiwan can choose union, it should be able to
              choose the terms. I think your stand on Taiwan is based on virtual
              representation, meaning one group deciding on another's behalf

              <p>So much have been exchanged, there are different views how we see events in the past, I don't think we need to change each others views, but you brought out a few statements that can use for reading the current situation.</p>
              <p>"the situation doesn't allow it" = what is the situation that will allow China to take military action against Taiwan? I guess it is when some politicians in Taiwan unilaterally declare independence. What would prevent China from taking such action? not the might of the US 7th fleet, and definitely not the majority of the people on the island who would give up their life for the defence of a Taiwan Nation. we will likely see thousands of Taiwanese leaving Taiwan for the US, Australia, and even China, then China will act to prove a point, with the heat of chinese nationalism from the whole China, and many overseas Chinese. that bring us to your next statement,</p>

              <p>I should point out the Sino-Soviet split almost resulted in nuclear war. The Russians feared an invasion of their vulnerable Far East, the Chinese feared nuclear attack and had a few nuclear weapons of their own.</p>

              <p>So much have been exchanged, there are different views how we
              see events in the past, I don't think we need to change each others

              <p>"the situation doesn't allow it" = what is the situation that
              will allow China to take military action against Taiwan?
              I guess it is when some politicians in Taiwan unilaterally declare
              independence. What would prevent China from taking such action? not
              the might of the US 7th fleet, and definitely not the majority of
              the people on the island who would give up their life for the
              defence of a Taiwan Nation. we will likely see thousands of
              Taiwanese leaving Taiwan for the US, Australia, and even China,
              then China will act to prove a point, with the heat of chinese
              nationalism from the whole China, and many overseas Chinese. that
              bring us to your next statement,</p>
              <p>"it wasn't in china's interest" = a ruin taiwan with a dent in

              <p>how should taiwan declare independence? physically it already has de facto independence, and most of the world have already recognised there is only one china and taiwan is part of that, which is something that won't change even if you declare independence tomorrow, no country would recognise taiwan which would only make things worse for taiwan.</p>
              <p>China wouldn't even have to invade, the clout it holds now is enough to make the countries whose opinion counts in the UN, abstain or vote in her favour.</p>
              <p>China isn't a threat?</p>
              <p>tell that to the chinese and they'll probably laugh all the way to beijing. but like you said its a matter of personal opinion. For me, I think it unlikely for a country the size of China to have "friends" especially the size of us, if you believe there's such a thing as friendship between nations of course.</p>
              <p>that's like the americans invading in the name of truth justice and the american way. And how they hope to win the friendship of countries with bombs.</p>

              <p>Ok, I'm on the same page with you, just a little difference in some perceptions.</p>
              <p>mainland and taiwan were de facto independent of each other since 1949, today, despite to the different political government, the two places are closer now than ever, with Taiwanese plants all over China and Chinese tourists all over Taiwan. a status quo will give both parties the chance to develop and be fully integrated over time. any talk of independence would disrupt such peace progression.</p>
              <p>Put it another way, I recognize China as one country including Taiwan, one people, one culture, ....however, given the historical background, it is not wise for a quick unification, or by force, and such a unification has no meaning, a political status quo today is probably the best way for the two sides to develop for better coexistance, if a full integration is not possible. </p>
