              <p>it won't matter even if taiwan declares independence.</p>
              <p>only thing that would stop reunification is if something horrible happens to splinter china into different parts. or some next generation chinese leader actually declares china is no longer taking back taiwan.</p>
              <p>As the current process goes, by opening up ties and trading, China is slowly reclaiming taiwan. as long as the economy continues to do well, the taiwanese will keep going there.and encourage others to follow.</p>
              <p>Why pay to fight a war over something when you can get it for free or even get paid for it?</p>

              <p>Ok, I'm on the same page with you, just a little difference in
              some perceptions.</p>
              <p>mainland and taiwan were de facto independent of each other
              since 1949, today, despite to the different political government,
              the two places are closer now than ever, with Taiwanese plants all
              over China and Chinese tourists all over Taiwan. a status quo
              will give both parties the chance to develop and be fully
              integrated over time. any talk of independence would disrupt such
              peace progression.</p>
              <p>Put it another way, I recognize China as one country including
              Taiwan, one people, one culture, ....however, given the historical
              background, it is not wise for a quick unification, or by force,
              and such a unification has no meaning, a political status quo today
              is probably the best way for the two sides to develop
              for better coexistance, if a full integration is not
              possible. </p>

              <p>As for one nation....</p>
              <p>And I actually recognise taiwan as the true "chinese" nation compared to PRC china, with the cultural revolution, the mindset of the whole nation changed. As far as I'm concerned, an Indonesian chinese would be more "Chinese" in culture than people from PRC.</p>

              <p>You seem to have forgotten that 60 years ago, the chinese were fighting a civil war and PRC was born out of that, with the old regime, the ROC still exist on the other side.

              <p>the chinese in china have been ruled under communists, the taiwan under strong american influence, the HK chinese ruled by the british and have to fight for its own identity, the Malaysian chinese educated by the british and ruled by the sultan, and singapore chinese also educated by the brits and have to define its own identity, the indonesian chinese, the thai chinese, the ABC....which chinese is more chinese?

              <p>ROC as a "old" regime, never seem to have lasted too long either as an authority in China.</p>
              <p>Anyway you're still trying to sell the idea that I'm being biased towards PRC while thinking better of her neighbours. Something I already disagreed with.</p>
              <p>I'm usually even more critical of US' actions, but we're not really focusing on them now.</p>
              <p>But for China's current predicament, it only makes sense to follow your line of thought if China is the size of Singapore. But she's not, she's darn big, holds more than 1 billion of the world's population, an influential economy, a big army currently looking for ways to project power beyond her shores.</p>
              <p>Under such reasoning, what reasons does the current hegemon, the States have not to keep an eye on China. and not to use her allies in this?</p>
              <p>Russia/India's already made the silly mistake of testing China's resolve to use military means.</p>

              <p>identity yes, but culturally we do still try to follow what our fore fathers passed down. most of us anyway.</p>
              <p>Its like how Korea claimed itself to be the legitimate sucessor(Xiao Zhong Hua) to chinese culture when the Manchus conquered Ming. With hindsight, we know today the Qing embraced chinese culture and took it further.</p>
              <p>But that's for later generations to decide.</p>
              <p>Right now, even the PRC is trying to "reclaim" what they destroyed because they realised how influential it can be and benefits of having a society with its own identity.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 12px;">Just as China is ascending the world stage as an economic superpower, so too, is Chinese culture becoming increasingly visible in Indonesia. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Chinese New Year, banned during the repressive New Order period, is now a national holiday that sees almost every mall in the city festooned in red and gold lanterns in hopes of boosting sales. Students all over the country are learning Chinese language to get a leg up in an international job market where Mandarin is fast becoming as big an asset as English. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So why is it that, while this boom in Chinese culture is going on, so many young Chinese-Indonesians are slowly losing touch with their cultural heritage? </span></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Prisca Muljadi, 18, is Chinese by blood, but, when asked how much she knows about her Chinese culture, she was taken aback. It was as if she was being asked about something completely foreign. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">After a thoughtful silence, she said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">“To be honest, when I think about it, I don’t really know much about Chinese culture. </span></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“I’ve always wondered how Chinese people ended up living in Indonesia, but I accepted it as a fact and don’t feel curious or question it at all,” she continued. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">She confessed that she had never really thought about Chinese culture until the topic was brought up. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Muljadi neither speaks a Chinese language nor does she know which generation Chinese she is. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">She said that, if anything, she identifies more with Western culture. “I went to an international school, speak English, and go to college in the US,” she explained. </span></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Natasha Silfanus, a 19-year-old Chinese-Indonesian, said, “I cannot speak for anybody except for myself and my circle of friends. But I believe we lack an understanding and, more importantly, an interest in Chinese culture.” <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Silfanus’s parents urged her to study the Chinese language, but she said she was “just not interested.” She said she did not know her family history and thought that, although her parents practiced some Chinese traditions, they were not important to her personally. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">She put part of the blame on her lack of knowledge about Chinese culture on her family. “My family isn’t that Chinese culturally — we are very much adapted to the Indonesian way of life, with some Western influences,” she said. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">More bluntly, Jason Utomo, another 19-year-old student, said of Chinese culture, “Yeah, I’m definitely ignorant.” <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Although Utomo is fluent in Mandarin, he said it would be just “too much effort” to preserve his family’s Chinese traditions when he raises his own family. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The sentiments of these three Chinese-Indonesians are echoed again and again by young members of the minority group, forming a trend that experts say has clear historical causes. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Aimee Dawis, a lecturer at the University of Indonesia and the author of “The Chinese of Indonesia and Their Search for Identity,” said Chinese-Indonesians born after 1980 are prone to apathy when it comes to their culture. She believes that this particular generation is in a unique position because their parents grew up in a period where any displays of Chineseness were systematically erased by the state.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“Their ignorance may have to do with their parents,” Aimee said.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> “But you can’t really blame those parents, because they grew up in the Suharto era, when everything Chinese was discouraged and banned.” She added that many people hid the fact that they were Chinese due to the stigma once attached to it. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Chinese culture was banned in the Suharto era due to the alleged role of the Chinese in supporting the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). For 33 years, any expression of Chinese culture was banned, including celebrations, schools and Chinese languages. </span></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">After a substantial period of cultural repression, the prohibition of Chinese culture was lifted by former President Abdurrahman “Gus Dur” Wahid in the early 2000s. In what Aimee calls a “renaissance of Chinese culture,” Chinese language is now being taught in many national-plus schools, Chinese New Year became a national holiday, and there is no longer a significant sense of fear associated with being Chinese. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The Chinese in Indonesia currently make up about 2 percent of Indonesia’s 240 million people. Chinese culture is now legally allowed to thrive in Indonesian society. The question is, with so many Chinese-Indonesian families not being used to practicing their culture openly, is it too late for it to be revived? <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Angeline Ang, a mother of three young children, said that she considered Chinese culture important and was doing her best to keep it alive in her family. She said she wanted to teach her children to value and cherish Chinese ideals and traditions. Additionally, she said that she wanted her children to learn a Chinese language for cultural reasons. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“Even without the business and vocational advantages of speaking Chinese, I’d still encourage my children to learn the language,” Ang said. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">She said, however, that she hoped her children would still identify as Indonesian because they were born and raised here. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“But we can’t forget our Chinese heritage as well,” she added. “I’m proud to be Indonesian and I think Indonesian culture is valuable. At the same time, I will never forget my heritage, no matter what my citizenship is. You can’t throw away your heritage.” <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Likewise, Aimee believes Chinese-Indonesians should identify themselves primarily as Indonesians, without completely losing their connection to Chinese culture. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“Being a Chinese-Indonesian simply means being an Indonesian of Chinese descent,” Aimee said. “I think it’s very important to identify as an Indonesian first and foremost.” <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">As a Chinese-Indonesian mother herself, she wants her children to feel truly Indonesian — which means sending her children to a school where they have flag-raising ceremonies and giving her first daughter a distinctly Indonesian name, Putri, a practice that was enforced under the New Order. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Aimee agreed that many Chinese-Indonesian young people are increasingly ignorant about Chinese culture, but also emphasized that the Chinese community is extremely diverse. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“There is a big Chinese organization called the Chinese-Indonesian Social Association (PSMTI) which has a very active youth division,” she said. “They’re very aware of their identity and discuss issues of identity openly. So we can’t generalize this trend at all. Family backgrounds and history matter significantly.” <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The youth division of PSMTI, the Association of Chinese-Indonesian Youth (IPTI), is led by Andrew Susanto. It was created in 2007 and now spans the archipelago’s 33 provinces, with thousands of members from ages 16 to 35. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">According to Susanto, the main goal of the association is to instill a strong sense of identity in young Chinese-Indonesians. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“There are a lot of young Chinese-Indonesians that have grown indifferent [to their heritage], and that’s why the association was formed,” he said. “We want to give them lessons on Indonesian nationality that are specifically tailored to Chinese-Indonesians.” <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">He also believes that Chinese-Indonesians should see themselves as fully Indonesian. “I don’t even think it’s necessary for Chinese-Indonesians to speak a Chinese language fluently,” he said. “If they can, that’s great. But there is no obligation for them to learn a Chinese language when they need to see themselves as Indonesian first and foremost.” <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Susanto said a lack education had played a major role in creating a generation that was unconcerned about their cultural heritage and identity. He argued that because the history of Chinese-Indonesians was rarely touched on in schools, Chinese-Indonesians did not see themselves as vital parts of Indonesia. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“[IPTI] is trying to open up that history,” he said. “In every pivotal moment of Indonesian history, there were Chinese figures that fought for the good of this country. They played a role in the building of Indonesia. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“We need to teach young Chinese-Indonesians that we are not simply temporarily staying in Indonesia. If they can see themselves as playing a role in Indonesian history, they will eventually realize that this is our country and our home.” <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">For those like Muljadi, Silfanus or Utomo, who have not given much thought to their Chinese heritage, Susanto said it was only a matter of time before they started to question their identity. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“Sure, they might not ponder their identities now. But there will come a point, whether it’s when they settle down or have their own children, where they will ask pertinent questions about identity to ultimately decide what cultural legacy they will pass on for their children,” Susanto said. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Until then, Susanto said the subject of Chinese identity in Indonesia should be more openly discussed in schools, daily conversations, and the media. He said he hoped his association could offer support to young adults who were starting to think about the deeper questions of their identity as Chinese-Indonesians. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“I usually tell people I’m Indonesian because that’s what it says on my passport,” Muljadi said. “But when I really think about it, I don’t fully identify with Indonesian culture. Yet when I say I’m Chinese, I don’t truly identify with Chinese culture either. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">“Then I think that, perhaps due to my upbringing and experience studying in the United States, I may be more of a Westerner. But Western culture is not something I completely belong to either. So I guess, I really don’t know.”</span></p>

              <h1>Successor chosen by Dalai Lama 'illegal': China</h1>
              <p>BEIJING - China said Monday that any successor chosen by the Dalai 
              Lama would be "illegal" after the Tibetan spiritual leader announced 
              that he, and not Beijing, would decide whether he should be 
              reincarnated.</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama, who is 76, said on Saturday he would decide when he 
              was "about 90" whether he should be reincarnated, in consultation with 
              other monks, and that China should have no say in the matter.</p>
              <p>Under Tibetan tradition, monks identify a young boy who shows signs 
              he is a reincarnation of a late leader, but many predict China will 
              simply appoint its own successor to the Dalai Lama.</p>
              <p>"China adopts a policy of religious freedom which includes respecting
               and protecting the form of succession of Tibetan Buddhism," Chinese 
              foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told journalists at a briefing.</p>
              <p>"The title of Dalai Lama is conferred by the central government and is illegal otherwise.</p>
              <p>"There is a complete set of religious rituals and historical 
              conventions in reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and a Dalai Lama 
              identifying his own successor has never been the practice."</p>
              <p>Tibet's spiritual leader said he had decided to lay out "clear 
              guidelines to recognise the next Dalai Lama" while he was still 
              "physically and mentally fit" so that there was "no room for doubt or 
              deception."</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama made the statement in a 4,200-word document issued 
              after a gathering of leaders of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism in 
              the northern Indian hill town of Dharamshala, home of the exiled 
              government.</p>
              <p>He had earlier signalled a willingness to break with custom by 
              choosing a successor before his death or among exiles outside Tibet. He 
              had also said he might be open to electing the next Dalai Lama.</p>
              <p>China's stance raises the prospect of two Dalai Lamas - one 
              recognised by Beijing and the other chosen by exiles or with the 
              blessing of the current Dalai Lama.</p>
              <p>This happened in 1995, when China rejected the Dalai Lama's choice to
               be the next Panchen Lama, the second-highest ranking Tibetan Buddhist, 
              and picked its own reincarnation.</p>
              <p>The Chinese-raised Panchen Lama, Gyaincain Norbu, is now 21 and often
               extols Beijing's rule over Tibet. The Dalai Lama's selection, Gedhun 
              Choekyi Nyima, has not been seen since 1995 after he was detained by 
              China.</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama fled Tibet following a failed uprising against Chinese
               rule in 1959. He later founded the government in exile in Dharamshala 
              after being offered refuge by India.</p>
              <p>China vilifies him as a "separatist" who incites violence in Tibet, 
              while he insists his sole focus is a peaceful campaign for greater 
              autonomy for his homeland.</p>

              Chinese-Indonesians: Is a Once Forbidden Identity
              Fading?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif, Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 12px;">
              Just as China is ascending the world stage as an economic
              superpower, so too, is Chinese culture becoming increasingly
              visible in Indonesia. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Chinese New Year, banned during the repressive New Order period, is
              now a national holiday that sees almost every mall in the city
              festooned in red and gold lanterns in hopes of boosting sales.
              Students all over the country are learning Chinese language to get
              a leg up in an international job market where Mandarin is fast
              becoming as big an asset as English. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So why is it that, while this boom in Chinese
              culture is going on, so many young Chinese-Indonesians are slowly
              losing touch with their cultural
              heritage? </span></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Prisca Muljadi, 18, is Chinese by blood, but, when asked how much
              she knows about her Chinese culture, she was taken aback. It was as
              if she was being asked about something completely
              foreign. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              After a thoughtful silence, she said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">â€œTo be
              honest, when I think about it, I donâ€™t really know much about
              Chinese culture. </span></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œIâ€™ve always wondered how Chinese people ended up living in
              Indonesia, but I accepted it as a fact and donâ€™t feel curious or
              question it at all,â€� she continued. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              She confessed that she had never really thought about Chinese
              culture until the topic was brought up. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Muljadi neither speaks a Chinese language nor does she know which
              generation Chinese she is. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">She
              said that, if anything, she identifies more with Western culture.
              â€œI went to an international school, speak English, and go to
              college in the US,â€� she explained. </span></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Natasha Silfanus, a 19-year-old Chinese-Indonesian, said, â€œI cannot
              speak for anybody except for myself and my circle of friends. But I
              believe we lack an understanding and, more importantly, an interest
              in Chinese culture.â€� <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Silfanusâ€™s parents urged her to study the Chinese language, but she
              said she was â€œjust not interested.â€� She said she did not know her
              family history and thought that, although her parents practiced
              some Chinese traditions, they were not important to her
              personally. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              She put part of the blame on her lack of knowledge about Chinese
              culture on her family. â€œMy family isnâ€™t that Chinese culturally â€”
              we are very much adapted to the Indonesian way of life, with some
              Western influences,â€� she said. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              More bluntly, Jason Utomo, another 19-year-old student, said of
              Chinese culture, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m definitely ignorant.â€� <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Although Utomo is fluent in Mandarin, he said it would be just â€œtoo
              much effortâ€� to preserve his familyâ€™s Chinese traditions when he
              raises his own family. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              The sentiments of these three Chinese-Indonesians are echoed again
              and again by young members of the minority group, forming a trend
              that experts say has clear historical causes. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Aimee Dawis, a lecturer at the University of Indonesia and the
              author of â€œThe Chinese of Indonesia and Their Search for Identity,â€�
              said Chinese-Indonesians born after 1980 are prone to apathy when
              it comes to their culture. She believes that this particular
              generation is in a unique position because their parents grew up in
              a period where any displays of Chineseness were systematically
              erased by the state.<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œTheir ignorance may have to do with their parents,â€� Aimee said.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">â€œBut you canâ€™t really blame those parents,
              because they grew up in the Suharto era, when everything Chinese
              was discouraged and banned.â€� She added that many people hid the
              fact that they were Chinese due to the stigma once attached to
              it. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Chinese culture was banned in the Suharto era due to the alleged
              role of the Chinese in supporting the Communist Party of Indonesia
              (PKI). For 33 years, any expression of Chinese culture was banned,
              including celebrations, schools and Chinese
              languages. </span></span><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              After a substantial period of cultural repression, the prohibition
              of Chinese culture was lifted by former President Abdurrahman â€œGus
              Durâ€� Wahid in the early 2000s. In what Aimee calls a â€œrenaissance
              of Chinese culture,â€� Chinese language is now being taught in many
              national-plus schools, Chinese New Year became a national holiday,
              and there is no longer a significant sense of fear associated with
              being Chinese. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              The Chinese in Indonesia currently make up about 2 percent of
              Indonesiaâ€™s 240 million people. Chinese culture is now legally
              allowed to thrive in Indonesian society. The question is, with so
              many Chinese-Indonesian families not being used to practicing their
              culture openly, is it too late for it to be
              revived? <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Angeline Ang, a mother of three young children, said that she
              considered Chinese culture important and was doing her best to keep
              it alive in her family. She said she wanted to teach her children
              to value and cherish Chinese ideals and traditions. Additionally,
              she said that she wanted her children to learn a Chinese language
              for cultural reasons. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œEven without the business and vocational advantages of speaking
              Chinese, Iâ€™d still encourage my children to learn the language,â€�
              Ang said. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              She said, however, that she hoped her children would still identify
              as Indonesian because they were born and raised
              here. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œBut we canâ€™t forget our Chinese heritage as well,â€� she added. â€œIâ€™m
              proud to be Indonesian and I think Indonesian culture is valuable.
              At the same time, I will never forget my heritage, no matter what
              my citizenship is. You canâ€™t throw away your
              heritage.â€� <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Likewise, Aimee believes Chinese-Indonesians should identify
              themselves primarily as Indonesians, without completely losing
              their connection to Chinese culture. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œBeing a Chinese-Indonesian simply means being an Indonesian of
              Chinese descent,â€� Aimee said. â€œI think itâ€™s very important to
              identify as an Indonesian first and foremost.â€� <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              As a Chinese-Indonesian mother herself, she wants her children to
              feel truly Indonesian â€” which means sending her children to a
              school where they have flag-raising ceremonies and giving her first
              daughter a distinctly Indonesian name, Putri, a practice that was
              enforced under the New Order. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Aimee agreed that many Chinese-Indonesian young people are
              increasingly ignorant about Chinese culture, but also emphasized
              that the Chinese community is extremely diverse. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œThere is a big Chinese organization called the Chinese-Indonesian
              Social Association (PSMTI) which has a very active youth division,â€�
              she said. â€œTheyâ€™re very aware of their identity and discuss issues
              of identity openly. So we canâ€™t generalize this trend at all.
              Family backgrounds and history matter
              significantly.â€� <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              The youth division of PSMTI, the Association of Chinese-Indonesian
              Youth (IPTI), is led by Andrew Susanto. It was created in 2007 and
              now spans the archipelagoâ€™s 33 provinces, with thousands of members
              from ages 16 to 35. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              According to Susanto, the main goal of the association is to
              instill a strong sense of identity in young
              Chinese-Indonesians. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œThere are a lot of young Chinese-Indonesians that have grown
              indifferent [to their heritage], and thatâ€™s why the association was
              formed,â€� he said. â€œWe want to give them lessons on Indonesian
              nationality that are specifically tailored to
              Chinese-Indonesians.â€� <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              He also believes that Chinese-Indonesians should see themselves as
              fully Indonesian. â€œI donâ€™t even think itâ€™s necessary for
              Chinese-Indonesians to speak a Chinese language fluently,â€� he said.
              â€œIf they can, thatâ€™s great. But there is no obligation for them to
              learn a Chinese language when they need to see themselves as
              Indonesian first and foremost.â€� <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Susanto said a lack education had played a major role in creating a
              generation that was unconcerned about their cultural heritage and
              identity. He argued that because the history of Chinese-Indonesians
              was rarely touched on in schools, Chinese-Indonesians did not see
              themselves as vital parts of Indonesia. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œ[IPTI] is trying to open up that history,â€� he said. â€œIn every
              pivotal moment of Indonesian history, there were Chinese figures
              that fought for the good of this country. They played a role in the
              building of Indonesia. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œWe need to teach young Chinese-Indonesians that we are not simply
              temporarily staying in Indonesia. If they can see themselves as
              playing a role in Indonesian history, they will eventually realize
              that this is our country and our home.â€� <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              For those like Muljadi, Silfanus or Utomo, who have not given much
              thought to their Chinese heritage, Susanto said it was only a
              matter of time before they started to question their
              identity. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œSure, they might not ponder their identities now. But there will
              come a point, whether itâ€™s when they settle down or have their own
              children, where they will ask pertinent questions about identity to
              ultimately decide what cultural legacy they will pass on for their
              children,â€� Susanto said. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              Until then, Susanto said the subject of Chinese identity in
              Indonesia should be more openly discussed in schools, daily
              conversations, and the media. He said he hoped his association
              could offer support to young adults who were starting to think
              about the deeper questions of their identity as
              Chinese-Indonesians. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œI usually tell people Iâ€™m Indonesian because thatâ€™s what it says
              on my passport,â€� Muljadi said. â€œBut when I really think about it, I
              donâ€™t fully identify with Indonesian culture. Yet when I say Iâ€™m
              Chinese, I donâ€™t truly identify with Chinese culture
              either. <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              â€œThen I think that, perhaps due to my upbringing and experience
              studying in the United States, I may be more of a Westerner. But
              Western culture is not something I completely belong to either. So
              I guess, I really donâ€™t know.â€�</span></p>

              Aimee Dawis, a lecturer at the University of Indonesia and the author of â€œThe Chinese of Indonesia and Their Search for Identity,â€� said Chinese-Indonesians *born after 1980* are prone to apathy when it comes to their culture. She believes that this particular generation is in a unique position because their parents grew up in a period where any displays of Chineseness were systematically erased by the state.

                              <h1>Successor chosen by Dalai Lama 'illegal': China</h1>
              <p>BEIJING - China said Monday that any successor chosen by the
              Dalai Lama would be "illegal" after the Tibetan spiritual leader
              announced that he, and not Beijing, would decide whether he should
              be reincarnated.</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama, who is 76, said on Saturday he would decide when
              he was "about 90" whether he should be reincarnated, in
              consultation with other monks, and that China should have no say in
              the matter.</p>
              <p>Under Tibetan tradition, monks identify a young boy who shows
              signs he is a reincarnation of a late leader, but many predict
              China will simply appoint its own successor to the Dalai Lama.</p>
              <p>"China adopts a policy of religious freedom which includes
              respecting and protecting the form of succession of Tibetan
              Buddhism," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told
              journalists at a briefing.</p>
              <p>"The title of Dalai Lama is conferred by the central government
              and is illegal otherwise.</p>
              <p>"There is a complete set of religious rituals and historical
              conventions in reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and a Dalai Lama
              identifying his own successor has never been the practice."</p>
              <p>Tibet's spiritual leader said he had decided to lay out "clear
              guidelines to recognise the next Dalai Lama" while he was still
              "physically and mentally fit" so that there was "no room for doubt
              or deception."</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama made the statement in a 4,200-word document
              issued after a gathering of leaders of the four schools of Tibetan
              Buddhism in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamshala, home of
              the exiled government.</p>
              <p>He had earlier signalled a willingness to break with custom by
              choosing a successor before his death or among exiles outside
              Tibet. He had also said he might be open to electing the next Dalai
              Lama.</p>
              <p>China's stance raises the prospect of two Dalai Lamas - one
              recognised by Beijing and the other chosen by exiles or with the
              blessing of the current Dalai Lama.</p>
              <p>This happened in 1995, when China rejected the Dalai Lama's
              choice to be the next Panchen Lama, the second-highest ranking
              Tibetan Buddhist, and picked its own reincarnation.</p>
              <p>The Chinese-raised Panchen Lama, Gyaincain Norbu, is now 21 and
              often extols Beijing's rule over Tibet. The Dalai Lama's selection,
              Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, has not been seen since 1995 after he was
              detained by China.</p>
              <p>The Dalai Lama fled Tibet following a failed uprising against
              Chinese rule in 1959. He later founded the government in exile in
              Dharamshala after being offered refuge by India.</p>
              <p>China vilifies him as a "separatist" who incites violence in
              Tibet, while he insists his sole focus is a peaceful campaign for
              greater autonomy for his homeland.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>WASHINGTON: The US military expects high-level exchanges to continue with China, despite a recent arms sale to Taiwan.<br><br>China's Foreign Ministry said the almost US$6 billion sale will disrupt relations.<br><br>It
               has already cancelled high-level visits and joint exercises. But unlike
               with previous arms sales, it has not cancelled overall 
              military-to-military ties. <br><br>This latest arms deal will help 
              improve Taiwan's defensive capabilities, but will not alter the overall 
              balance of capabilities across the Taiwan Strait, according to Admiral 
              Robert Willard.<br><br>"I think it's important to recognise that 
              Taiwan's arms sales in and under themselves are not going to re-balance 
              the cross-Strait elements of combat power. Again, when we look at the 
              combat power from ballistic missiles to integrated air-missile defenses 
              to fighter aircraft and much more that exist across the strait, Taiwan 
              arms sales are not going to ever achieve that," said Admiral Willard.<br><br>US law obliges the Obama administration to provide arms sales sufficient for Taiwan's defence. <br><br>But China perceives such actions to be interference in its internal affairs. <br><br>Experienced former Asia diplomat Alan Romberg said he thinks the sale strikes the right balance.<br><br>Alan
               D Romberg, director, East Asia Programme at Stimpson Centre said:  
              "This has nothing to do with constraining China, this has everything to 
              do within the US view in maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan 
              straits and letting the two sides move ahead to adjust their 
              relationship in a peaceful and non-coercive fashion."<br><br>The deal involves high-tech upgrades of 145 Lockheed Martin F-16 models A and B.  <br><br>But the US has not agreed to sell Taiwan new and more advanced F-16 model C and D jets. <br><br>Former
               National Security Council official Jamie Fly said this failure to 
              replace elements of Taiwan's ageing fleet may erode confidence among 
              regional allies.<br><br>Jamie Fly, executive director of the Foreign 
              Policy Initiative said: "A sense that some of our allies in Asia have is
               that maybe the US is not as focused on Asia as it should be.  And I 
              think when we send half-hearted signals to allies like Taiwan, others 
              like Japan, Korea and Australia will interpret that as perhaps a lack of
               significant US commitment going forward. It might increase their 
              concerns."<br><br>The overriding interest for all the region's players 
              should be in breaking down strategic mistrust, according to veteran 
              diplomat and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.<br><br>"If we 
              have a cooperative relationship, then the nations of Asia do not have to
               choose between China and the United States," said Mr Kissinger. <br><br>China's
               Foreign Minister has urged Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to cancel
               the sale, warning that it will undermine trust and confidence.<br><br>But
               the White House has no intention of reviewing the decision and the 
              Obama administration hopes that Washington's long-term relationship with
               Beijing will recover from the short-term tensions the announcement has 
              created. <br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>
