              <p>you are here to grab attention. and im going to give you the attention you want. just simply not in the way you want.</p>
              <p>no. you are here to be a troll and the resident<strong> PAIN IN THE ASS. </strong>find me someone who disagrees and ild find you 10 who agree.</p>
              <p>i dont make life difficult for you. I simply dislike criminal behaviour here in the forum. you steal, you cheat somebody of what rightfully belongs to him/her and you think you can get away with it ?</p>
              <p>people treat me differently as i am reasonable. there is a logic behind my actions. a firm purpose behind a statement. a coherent form of response that represents my thoughts. this isnt being exceptional or due to having a better command of english. its because <strong>i am NORMAL</strong>.</p>
              <p>you are unreasonable, you spam to get attention, and you possess not even a shred of reason. Your points are incoherent gibberish. your sense of phrasing is non-existent. your logic has more holes than swiss cheese. your postings arent even thoughts. they are copy-paste paragraphs from somewhere else or repetition of mindless propaganda.<strong> you my dear lion, are ABNORMAL.</strong> (can substitute with freak weirdo or psychopath)</p>

              <p>well, i firmly believe in quality and not quantity. Brevity and eloquence usually go hand in hand. Trash is something that belongs to the dustbin and ought to remain there. if you dont have anything to contribute. dont post up trash.</p>
              <p>they simply end up making you a humiliating laughing stock. Your several photobucket accounts are a phathetic joke. stealing pictures, adding captions and scrounging up random bits of data to justify your threads ? i dont see how you can make swiss cheese whole by giving it more holes. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Whoa. you calling me a net police ? i wish i were, because if i would, you would be a serious victim of police brutality. im just a respectful citizen obeying the law. in particular, intellectual property rights and terms of use. Is obeying the law a bad thing ?</p>
              <p>so tell me lionnoisy, is stealing a good thing ? is wrongful use of property that dosent belong to you good ? does the law not apply to you just because you <strong>think</strong> you can hide behind a mask of internet annonymity ? think hard and think again.</p>
              <p>there are fair terms of usage and interpretations of usage. what you have done is no different from stealing from NTUC or shoplifting from the shopping mall. you are a thief, you are a criminal, you are a pirate. If someone denies you right to use content. you cant use it. if you willfully do so, when it explicitly states no, thats committing a crime (but you can get away on grounds of criminal insanity, you are bodering that anyway)</p>
              <p>if sex is not consensual, its rape</p>
              <p>if things are taken without paying , its shoplifting</p>
              <p>to use without consent, thats intellectual property theft.</p>
              <p>to use without consent and being explicitly forwarned NOT to do so, is sheer idiocity and stupidity. u deserve to face a lawsuit and go to jail.</p>
              <p>the next thing you might pull out of your bag of tricks is to say Injustice is a virtue and that virtues are sin. utter rot.</p>
              <p>People do share things and information. just that its not blatant theft like you. you can share the source, nothing wrong with that. its STEALING pictures and stuff from the source when it makes you declare not to that is illegal.</p>
              <p>i think the charges that may be levied against you would be</p>
              <p>breach of trust/contract/agreement of usage</p>
              <p>IPR- intellectual property rights</p>
              <p>malignant (knowing full well you cant use it, you still went ahead and did it) interest</p>

              <p>To say something more constructive instead of LN bashing: i thoroughly believe that  in order to manage the element of surprise better and more specific to our region, it would be much much better to focus in NOISE management. </p>
              <p>The use of advance sensors for armour hunting is unlikely to drift down to the soldier on the front line.  When it comes to avoiding AH, there just arent that many in the region to even consider such costs.</p>
              <p>So what if you cant see the tank coming?  In our AO, we can definitely easily hear and feel(tremors) the vehicles coming long time  before they can be visually identified.</p>
