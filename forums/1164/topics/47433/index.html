            <div class='col-md body'>hi joe, i have been living for the past 4 yrs in NZ.... I saw the local news abt this 'missile'. It is of crude design. very much different from the one build by the aussies couple of months back. I know what these kiwis are capable of. believe me i would not call that piece of junk metal build from one back yard a 'missile'...... don't read too much into kiwi ingenuity..... there isn't one to speak off in the 1st place..</div>
