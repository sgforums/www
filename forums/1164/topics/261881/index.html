            <div class='col-md body'>Saab Gripen fires first IRIS-T air-to-air missile<br>By Craig Hoyle<br><br>Saab conducted the first test firing of a Diehl BGT Defence IRIS-T short-range air-to-air missile from a Gripen fighter over Sweden's Vidsel test range on 12 June, during the 6,000th test flight of a JAS39.<br><br>Involving high-speed weapon release from a JAS39B test aircraft flying at around 2,000ft (610m), the unguided test was "a complete success", says Saab test pilot Fredrik MÃ¼chler.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=18170"><br><br>Saab will perform another unguided release of the IRIS-T and two guided firings against target drones at Vidsel later this year under a national test programme worth SKr150 million ($21.7 million). These are intended to prove the missile's operating envelope across more difficult flight conditions and at a higher load factor, says MÃ¼chler.<br><br><img src="http://www.flightglobal.com/assets/getAsset.aspx?ItemID=18165"><br><br>Also on order for Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway and Spain, the IRIS-T will replace the Swedish air force's inventory of Raytheon AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. The new weapon will be integrated with its frontline Gripens next year as part of the type's so-called "Version 19" software update, says Saab. This will also equip the aircraft with a Link 16 datalink to support international operations.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/18/214680/picture-saab-gripen-fires-first-iris-t-air-to-air-missile.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/18/214680/picture-saab-gripen-fires-first-iris-t-air-to-air-missile.html</a></div>

We can just get the version more suited for CAP  to cut cost. As it is not economical to use the F-15SG or the possible eventual JSF for that purpose.<br><br>Since it is multi-role it can easily be reconfigured to take over the by then aging F-16s. So the type of aircraft will still be kept to 3 types, Gripens,<br>F-15SG and F-35(should anything goes wrong with JSF, we can also consider  alternatives such as Typhoon and Rafale)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your feedback!<br><br>Yeah i'm looking into cost cuts - less taxes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Actually, i believe RSAF wants to have F-16C/Ds to replace the F-5s and JSF to replace the F-16C/Ds when the time comes. Maybe Typhoon then to replace the F-15SGs<br><br>However, like what you said. it's better to have 3 types of aircraft. The gripen is actually (while multi role) is still a light fighter its able to use mavericks, Amraam Ashms and rockets.  I dont think it can take over the complete role of our Vipers though. It's a little expensive to have so many F-16s doing all the footwork including CAP when a cheaper Gripen can do it too. I mean a F-16(Longrange)/Gripen(short range) CAP will fit better into our AA web than a F16/F16 combi.<br><br>Gripen also brings into our wings the use of canards - flight controls that our current planes may/may not have and a good step up to the Typhoon if we ever consider that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gripen to get AESA in mid-life upgrade<br><br>Keeping pace with the technology trend, SaabÂ’s JAS39 Gripen is to be fitted with a multi-channel active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, likely to be introduced under a planned mid-life upgrade (MLU) that could come along as early as 2010.<br><br>Development of the AESA radar for Gripen started out under the Saab Ericsson NORA (Not Only a RAdar) programme, and has been underway for several years, including test flying aboard a specially-retained Saab JA-37 Viggen testbed. One of the main benefits of the NORA concept was the provision of improved long-range tracking as a result of the combination of longer detection range and electronically-steered beam control. The AESA radar programme is directly linked to MIDAS (Multifunction Integrated Defensive Avionics System), which will also add electronic attack and advanced datalinking capabilities.<br><br>Radar upgrades for in-service Gripens are already underway and the AESA project is planned to follow the current Mk.IV upgrade for the typeÂ’s Saab Ericsson PS-05/A pulse-doppler radar, which adds precision strike modes and improved synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capability.<br><br>The AESA developments are being lined up for what is now being dubbed the Â‘Next Generation GripenÂ’ programme, notably including the proposed variants to meet F-16AM/BM replacement requirements for Norway and Denmark, known as Gripen N and Gripen DK respectively. An AESA version of its current PS-05/A radar, which, can reportedly track airborne targets at  distances of up to 120km would provide enhanced multi-mode capabilities for Gripen-NG, as well as extended range for beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles.<br><br>Looking further ahead, Saab Microwave Systems, Selex Sistemi Integrati and Elettronica are involved in the development of the next generation of microwave multi-function, multi-role systems under the multi-role active electronically scanned antenna (M-AESA) programme. The introduction of M-AESA technology will greatly increase the potential of microwave system performance, boosting the ability to detect, track and identify small targets even in the most confused battlespace.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/19/214853/gripen-to-get-aesa-in-mid-life-upgrade.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/19/214853/gripen-to-get-aesa-in-mid-life-upgrade.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More power and more payload for Gripen demo<br><br>By Jon Lake<br>Saab chose the Paris Air Show to reveal details of its new Gripen Demonstrator programme. The Gripen Demo aircraft will act as a technology demonstrator and testbed for an upgrade configuration for the Swedish air force, and as the prototype for planned Â‘Future GripensÂ’, including the Gripen N for Norway, the Gripen DK for Denmark, and perhaps even for a variant to meet IndiaÂ’s MMRCA requirement.<br><br>The programme is planned to Â“keep Gripen at the leading edge of fighter aircraft performance and capability, well beyond 2040Â”, according to Gripen InternationalÂ’s managing director, Johan Lehander.<br><br>The Gripen Demo aircraft will have a revised configuration, with a new forward-retracting main landing gear that frees up internal volume for extra fuel, and with distinctive bulged wingroot fairings underwing providing further increases in internal volume. The use of these fairings replaces the upper fuselage conformal tanks seen on previous  studies, and will provide an extra 38% of internal fuel, taking the total to 3,130 kg.<br><br>The relocated and beefed-up undercarriage will allow a 2-tonne increase in maximum take off weight, to 16t. This in turn will allow the aircraft to carrier heavier warloads (up to 6,000kg), and to facilitate this, the Gripen Demo will have new side by side under-fuselage pylons (augmenting the single centreline pylon) and underwing hardpoints capable of carrying twin pylons.<br><br>The aircraft will be powered by a new 22,000lb engine, provisionally dubbed the F414G. This is based on the General Electric F414-GE-400 engine that powers the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, with full authority digital electronic control software for enhanced safety and reliability.<br><br>The F414 engine is a derivative of the original F404 - the existing Gripen engine, the RM-12, is a variant Â– and combines proven reliability, maintainability and operability with advanced technology. The F414G will deliver some 4,000lb more thrust than the RM-12, giving a useful boost in performance. Some sources give the new engine a 26,000lb thrust rating Â– doubling the advantage.<br><br>The aircraft will also be fitted with an AESA radar, probably based on EricssonÂ’s long-running NORA and Saab/SelexÂ’ M-AESA programmes.<br>Sweden has a requirement to upgrade some 31 early Gripens to C/D standards, but it may now leapfrog a generation and be upgraded to a standard similar to the Gripen Demo.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/21/215035/more-power-and-more-payload-for-gripen-demo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/21/215035/more-power-and-more-payload-for-gripen-demo.html</a></div>
