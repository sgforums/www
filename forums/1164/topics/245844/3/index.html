            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>I find live firing a really personal kind of training. Much like playing golf. You have to battle yourself and its really an 'understanding' approach to it. It starts from the very beginning at the zeroing stage. Thats when you get to know your particular M16. Remember to be consistent in your approach during zeroing or its meaningless. I wouldn't stop zeroing until i get a really small group of shots. Once you've got it down to a small group, then you're confident the rife will fire the way you aimed. No more doubts later that will ruin your weekend.<br><br>Consistency is very important and stay calm. Use a methological approach of self-learning. Even during the close range shots, you should already be understanding your weapon. Don't just take it as the target is down, but notice where the shot lands and reflect after the shot if it was consistent to previous shots.<br><br>Hold your breath. Always hold your breath just before you take the shot. This will take away the little movements.<br><br>I like to find the best way to secure the rifle as much as possible. I always make sure my left forarm is touching the magazine itself. This way, you can limit the twisting of the rifle to the left.<br><br>Squeeze the trigger as slowly as possible. Feel the first click and let the actual fire scare you. (Someone already rightly pointed this point) I think its very effective. Especially at the 300m.<br><br>Follow through. This is very important. I make it a point to hold my position for that extra second after the shot is fired. Its like slow motion and my reaction alittle retarded, but it works.<br><br>Hope it helps! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
