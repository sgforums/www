            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm you from NCC and going for you live rounds shooting right? I just finished that a month ago I think...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>The sound is ok, not super loud untill cmi.. wear your ear plug all the time once you enter the range! Even if uncomfortable, just let it remain there as long as it covers your ear.<br><br>IMO, firing the live round is easier than the simulation. The target is damn big, impossible to miss. Just remember what the instructor told you in the past!<br><br>Breathe in a steady pace.. once you are about to shoot, hold only half of your breath. Don't snap, squeeze slowly. Make your your alignment of fore sight tip and rear sight apperture(Spell? lols) is properly alligned. After you fire remember to remember where you aimed at and follow through.<br><br>Before firing there is a "zeroing" phase. Where you get to shoot 4 rounds at the canadian bull and 4 rounds at the fig 12. Please bear in mind this is an extremely important phase if you still don't understand how to align the aiming tips. Remember where you aim and after you fire finish, you are to take down the board to replace it with the actual target board. Remember to look at your shots and "zero" it. I hope you know what I meant by zeroing?<br><br>If you still CMI and really want the badge arh.. there is a way. But if you get caught den die liao loh. After the actual target board is put up, just continue to fire. After firing when you are taking it down, tear away the black tapes they used to tape the holes where the pass firer has fired. Remember, 10 is enough!

PROTECT YOUR EARS!<br><br>Hearing damage is cumulative, and cannot be restored once the nerve cells are dead. Unfortunately due to the brain's ability to make up for hearing loss, you won't be aware of hearing damage until you have lost quite a lot of your hearing.<br><br>And this hearing loss cannot be restored.<br><br>On average, serving 2 years in a combat vocation where you see a lot of life firings and loud noises, even with earplugs the grunt loses <span style="font-style: italic;">8 percent</span> of his hearing. And this loss is for life.<br><br>If you don't use ear plugs, the damage done is far worse. You may not notice the effects at first but a few years down the road when you are older it will becoming extremely obvious as you start to lose hearing naturally as part of aging... since you have less of a  hearing nerve cell "buffer" to lose, you will suddenly experience a drastic loss of hearing within a few short years...  and then it's too late liao.<br><br>So don't follow your friends who think they macho can tahan blanks and life firings without hearing protection, while they think they are okay, actually they are damaging their hearing with every pull of the trigger. No matter how garang they are, the fact remains that the pressure waves generated by firearms, even with blanks, are well over the limit that can cause hearing loss and damage.<br><br>And factor in all the outfield, all the life firing and all the stuff... that's a lot of damage.<br><br>This one dun play play one... I notice that my hearing is less acute then it was before I entered NS, and I used hearing protection a lot.<br><br>NS is only for two years, don't lose sacrifice your hearing for it.<br></div></blockquote>Does that mean our boys in arty are really done for?

            <div class='col-md body'>tip: if your zeroing is off, and you tried but am unable to read your shots, aim lower, at the bottom of your target. Generally shots tend to go high. Moreover, if your shots hit the rock,sand below the target, they might richchet off and hit the target. Still consider 1 hit. hehe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope there is no nightshots. And yep, it's called the grouping exercise.. sorry bout that, I ain't really familiar with the terms used. And yes, it's nee soon for us.<br><br>Another tip is to bring the weapon to you instead of bringing your head to the weapon. The helmet is a good gauge on how many spacing is needed between the foresight apperture. Be confident. The target is very, very big. Enormous to be exact. Like what another forumer said, it's always better to aim down. Don't try to aim for headshot, did have some people who did that and they really regretted it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

People who were exposed to arty fire can get bleeding ears. Go arty firing without earplugs is foolhardly.<br><br>Actually, just try FIBUA without earplugs and you'll quickly discover the folly of your ways... even with earplugs the enclosed areas trap all the sound that it is still very loud even when you've stuffed them all the way it.<br><br>Cases of hearing damage do happen in the SAF, just go read about and you can find some cases. Got this MG commander who kenna a GPMG burst just beside his ear... just one burst was enough to burst his eardrum liao and he lost most of his hearing.<br><br>And of course, there was this guy who went life range without proper hearing protection, just one time was enough to damage his hearing for life, left with a constant ringing that never left him since that day.<br><br>In WW2, I read this account where this guy was standing on a tank trying to tell the commander something, suddenly the commander saw something and fired his main gun at it without telling the grunt. The grunt lost most of his hearing for life.<br><br>Not to scare anyone, but a smart grunt knows the right precautions to take... so protect your ears.</div>

The 8 x 57mm cartridge used in the M48 has a very, very loud report, and that single event resulted in a permanent case of tinnitus in his right ear.<br><br>Play it safe: use hearing protection at the range.</div>
