              <p>I am sorry but clearly you are missing a few points and facts in
              your history lessons:</p>
              <p>a) The bombing of Hiroshima/Nagasaki did not spark the nuclear
              race.</p>
              <p>Rather the nuclear race had already begun a few years earlier,
              with Nazi Germany engaging in serious efforts to build the A Bomb.
              The idea was to get it before them. The Russians also had already
              started its own programme towards the end of WW2.</p>
              <p>The bombing of the 2 cities did not spark the race, the race was
              already under way and would have continued nonetheless between the
              Soviets and the Americans.</p>
              <p>b) Killing of innocent civilians is abhorrent to all decent
              people the world, however in a war, they are always gonna be killed
              in far higher proportion than military personnel. That is an
              unavoidable fact, with or without the use of nucear weapons.</p>
              <p>c) After victory in Europe, the US still had to fight the war in
              Asia, with their Allies, many of whom were already a spent force.
              Britain, France etc all had to deal with a post war Europe and the
              task of rebuilding. The Soviets had become very dominant and now
              unchallengable in the East and Baltic States.  It was really
              up to the US to defeat the Japanese on it's own.</p>
              <p>d) The Japanese were determined to go down fighting to the last
              men and to scorch earth. There were very brutal and devasting
              battles in the pacific before the lead up to July 1945. It was
              clear to the Americans that the Japanese despite knowing they were
              losing would make them fight for every single inch.</p>
              <p>e) The decision facing President Truman in July 1945 was plain
              after Japan refused to surrender despite warnings. Invade Japan
              with a full force and fight sqaure mile after square mile and lose
              maybe 2-300,000 American soldiers, (also probably millions of
              Japanese citizens) or drop the bomb? An invasion would probably
              drag the war for another year, by the time it was done, the Soviets
              would then be the dominant power and a new threat to face all over
              again.</p>
              <p>It was a decision he agonised painfully over before finally
              giving the go ahead to General LeMay.</p>

              <p>We can survive and rebuild a place after it's being bomb by TNT, but not a nuke. And also, Virtually everyone within two miles of ground zero would perish, while those farther out would be extremely likely to suffer significant injury, radiation poisoning, etc.</p>
              <p>3) I don't quite understand this point.</p>
              <p>4) Japan is an island nation; just simply destorying their navy and aircraft and cut off trade,  they(USA) could have waited until a surrender was necessary by lack of supplies - Japan was almost empty of resources and in it's isolation would have eventually had to surrender. </p>
              <p>4) Why do they need to invade Japan? It's not a defensive move but rather an invasive one. Like what I said above, CUT OFF THE TRADE! The reason why Japan invaded Singapore is for the resources. Japans didn't go as far as the Americans, at least they didn't drop sooo many bombs on Singapore.</p>

              Japan never would have surrendered just through isolation. By war's end, Japan was still holding on to many territories including Singapore, Taiwan etc. Japan would have continued the policy of kamikaze pilots and constructing its war machines because that's their psyche. The 2 atom bombs compelled the emperor to force his military to seek terms i.e. surrender. Those are the facts. It was also because the Japs did not know that the US only had 2 atom bombs and Roosevelt threatened to carry on atom bombing the Japanese cities. Without the emperor's intervention, the military was prepared to continue the war indefinitely (or so they said). 
              
              In a way, the atom bombs, despite their devastation, freed Singapore earlier. The atom bombs killed far less people than the B-29 bombings and fire raids did but the latter did not force the emperor to seek peace.

              The blockade was working. Japan has never had the resources on the home islands to feed her people and fuel her industries. The people were slowly starving and industrial complexes had all but shut down. Even if Japan still had the will to fight, she lacked the ability. To be sure, plans for Operation Downfall (for the invasion of the Japanese home islands) had been prepared. Casualty estimates that ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous and been forecast. It is common sense to draw up battle plans and contingencies. It is another matter entirely to put them in motion. The Germans had plans for the Invasion of Great Britain but they never seriously considered going forward with Operation Sealion. The US had continuously revised the Rainbow Five, but no one in the Pentagon thought for a moment that the US would invade Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Ireland or India. Likewise, no one believed for an instant that the invasion of Japan would ever come to pass. It simply wasn't going to be necessary.

              <p>Like I said dont believe everything you read, even wikipedia which is essentially user input and edited. Even a respected source will always have the author's slant. But I'm not here to argue with view, just engage in exchange your views, which I will respect even if I disagree.</p>
              <p>1) I will concede the point to you based on your simple explanation, what I said was that 1945 wasnt the start, but as you put it, yes it was the trigger.</p>
              <p>2) You are right on point 2 as well. Not much was done to study the long term effects as opposed to the immediate damage it could caused.</p>

              The Germans had plans for the Invasion of Great Britain but they
              never seriously considered going forward with Operation Sealion.
              The US had continuously revised the Rainbow Five, but no one in the
              Pentagon thought for a moment that the US would invade Australia,
              Canada, Great Britain, Ireland or India. Likewise, no one believed
              for an instant that the invasion of Japan would ever come to pass.
              It simply wasn't going to be necessary.</p>

              <p>The Joint chiefs including MacArthur were prepared to invade Japan. In particular, one should consider MacArthur's 3 options which covered the scenarios discussed plus invasion (read link above, pp 397-398) and pertinent to note MacArthur's preferred option was to invade rather than bomb/blockade. It was Truman who decided to go ahead with the atom bomb after Okinawa showed how many casaulties could be caused by an invasion. The C-in-C has the last say.</p>

              <p>A arms race is like, in simpler terms, I own a kitchen chopper,
              you a bit scared of me, you go and buy a parang.</p>

              <p>We can survive and rebuild a place after it's being bomb by TNT,
              but not a nuke. And also, Virtually everyone within two miles of
              ground zero would perish, while those farther out would be
              extremely likely to suffer significant injury, radiation poisoning,
              etc.</p>
              <p>3) I don't quite understand this point.</p>
              <p>4) Japan is an island nation; just simply destorying their navy
              and aircraft and cut off trade,  they(USA) could have waited
              until a surrender was necessary by lack of supplies - Japan was
              almost empty of resources and in it's isolation would have
              eventually had to surrender. </p>
              <p>4) Why do they need to invade Japan? It's not a defensive move
              but rather an invasive one. Like what I said above, CUT OFF THE
              TRADE! The reason why Japan invaded Singapore is for the resources.
              Japans didn't go as far as the Americans, at least they didn't drop
              sooo many bombs on Singapore.</p>

              <p>it is impossible to cut off supplies in the occupied lands, If japan didn't surrender, their soldiers in the occupied land would vow to fight till the end. imagine the american had to fight to liberate Singapore....imagine the jap forced Singaporean to fight against invading, or liberating alllied soldiers....the bombs had to drop in Japan, should have been dropped in Tokyo.</p>

              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">It is generally accepted that of the total German military combat deaths in WWII, which numbered about 3.4 million,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> about 75% and possibly 80% were on the eastern front.</span></strong> Additionally, up to June 1944 (Normandy) the percentage was even higher since there was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">little combat elsewhere that generated large casualties.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">German material losses on the eastern front were also huge representing over 80% of artillery, tank and truck losses. Aircraft losses were about 50/50 on the eastern and western front. Of course, naval losses were almost exclusively in the west, even including defensive actions taken against Soviet attempts to massacre civilians on the open seas late in the war in the Baltic.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">It is said that, 9 out of 10 German soldiers killed in World War II were on the Eastern Front.</span></p>

              <p>The irony is that starvation might have killed more civilians esp children than bombs would. This esp when food always goes to soldiers first. And the top who makes the decisions end up always getting fed.</p>
              <p>Its easy to see things with hindsight. But in 1945, the US was looking for the quickest way to end the war. Starvation could have been a significantly longer process. I remember reading that an operations analyst commitee working for the joint chiefs calculated it might have taken 2 years from 1945 to force Japan to surrender thru blockade alone. Not everyone would know in 1945 how much impact the blockade would have had on Japan. People know now the blockade was working but did people know in 1945 that the blockade was working? Fog of war.</p>

              <p>Lets not say Nk agst USA. Agst south korea, the north stands ZERO chance. The south has an economy capable of sustaining a protraced war, an airforce tens of times bigger and more advanced than the paper planes the north boasts, a navy ten times larger and more advanced than the sampans north koreans have. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MOST IMPTLY, the south has far better combat engineering units than the north. Think of it this way: for every hundred tanks put out of action, the south can bring back 90 easily within 24 hours. The north's poor, stick thin engineers manage ten.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That and the fact the us army is already stationed in the south. Will the north dare? Dont forget the north's relations with china are at their worst. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a war with the south, the north's tiny tiny economy will collapse in a matter of months, that is if the south doesnt crush the ant army of the north first of course.</p>
