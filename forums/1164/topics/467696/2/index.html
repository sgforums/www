              <p><br> South Korea have a lot to lose in these war. Big cities, like Seoul when hit by a missile, can have many causalities and the economy will plummet. The north would have already dug some underground cities/bunker/hangar and even if the North Korea was hit by a nuke, it won't damage the underground cities. Of course, this place would need to be as discreet as possible.
                  
                  When the war breaks out, Pacific Asia economy will be greatly affected and economy will take a punch. Singapore will be greatly affected as MNCs pull out, leaving Singaporeans jobless and possibly, hungry.
                  
                  North Korea, is getting increasingly frustrated with US, after all, it takes two hands to clap but a hand to slap. USA, with it's highly-publicized game with NK, like sanctions and flying some jet over the South, is doing nothing but provoking NK to make the first move. South Korea, on the other hand, has a really stupid and naive government and shouldn't allow the US to take care of it's military affairs. (Obviously South Korean government knows that NK hates the US right?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">After all, USA doesn't really aims to promote world peace(look at Africa, who cares about the warlords?) and democracy, they are only serving their own interest. Asia, who has been prospering and developing so fast and US is afraid that it might fall from their positions as the world top economy. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">After the war, only the Koreans (both South and North) suffers the most devastating effects and their innocent lives getting ripped apart by war, and even if Asia didn't fully participate in it, their economy will take a down-turn, and once again, glorifying the most hypocritical nation in the world, the USA, who owned the most number of nukes then the world combined, who killed the Red Indians, enslaved the blacks, and still dares to talk about NK human rights and nukes. It's like having a teacher, who smokes and beats up people, and tell me not to smoke and beat up people. This feels a lot like the repeat of LON(league of nations), where France invades Germany, and the League did not take actions against them. If US interferes in the Korean war,  I will never support their side nor the other side. They only want to benefit their own economy, by selling weapons, at the cost of Koreans citizens.
                  
                  And at the end, who benefits from this? </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The USA. They do need to lose civilians in this war, (like the war in Iran) and they get all the economical benefits.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">People, brainwashed by the media, (look at the above google search), gets all hyped up by the fear being invaded by China, NK, Russia, etc
                  
                  My hope is that one day, even if NK didn't reunite with SK, will open it's borders one day have take part in the World Trade, which can drastically improve his citizen's quality of life. It's that line dividing between me and them, the borders, which have stunningly different effects. </span></p>

              <p>For all the noise coming out of North Korea it is clear to
              virtually every intelligence agency that they currently pose no
              threat to the US mainland, regardless of what they claim. Although
              South Korea faces real and serious threat if there is war, the
              military leaders in Pyongyang have to be aware they have no real
              chance at victory. This is all big show so the new leader can
              maintain power over his repressed people and to position North
              Korea to receive more aide when they “willing” come to the
              negotiation table in the future, after “easing tensions”.</p>
              <p>Although all out war is unlikely even if a military action
              against North Korea is taken, destabilizing that region would
              devastate US/China relations. That in itself is a much larger
              concern than Pyongyang’s grandstanding.</p>

SK will not allow any missiles near it and has been a long time in status quote with NK gurading borders and worrying about status of peace and war. its now than ever for a fight to break out and NK to wake up. stop idot worshipping expecially praying and worshipping a f**king communist war monger and its generations!</p>

              <p>It's doesn't matter if you think that North Korea owning nuclear bombs is good or bad, it seems to me that a strong military is the only way to deter a warfare. Nuclear weapons have prevented more wars than it created,( eg The Cold War and WW2. ), even they are generally dangerous, the one thing that's making it worse is going to war.</p>

              <p>I am sorry but clearly you are missing a few points and facts in your history lessons:</p>
              <p>a) The bombing of Hiroshima/Nagasaki did not spark the nuclear race.</p>
              <p>Rather the nuclear race had already begun a few years earlier, with Nazi Germany engaging in serious efforts to build the A Bomb. The idea was to get it before them. The Russians also had already started its own programme towards the end of WW2.</p>
              <p>The bombing of the 2 cities did not spark the race, the race was already under way and would have continued nonetheless between the Soviets and the Americans.</p>
              <p>b) Killing of innocent civilians is abhorrent to all decent people the world, however in a war, they are always gonna be killed in far higher proportion than military personnel. That is an unavoidable fact, with or without the use of nucear weapons.</p>
              <p>c) After victory in Europe, the US still had to fight the war in Asia, with their Allies, many of whom were already a spent force. Britain, France etc all had to deal with a post war Europe and the task of rebuilding. The Soviets had become very dominant and now unchallengable in the East and Baltic States.  It was really up to the US to defeat the Japanese on it's own.</p>
              <p>d) The Japanese were determined to go down fighting to the last men and to scorch earth. There were very brutal and devasting battles in the pacific before the lead up to July 1945. It was clear to the Americans that the Japanese despite knowing they were losing would make them fight for every single inch.</p>
              <p>e) The decision facing President Truman in July 1945 was plain after Japan refused to surrender despite warnings. Invade Japan with a full force and fight sqaure mile after square mile and lose maybe 2-300,000 American soldiers, (also probably millions of Japanese citizens) or drop the bomb? An invasion would probably drag the war for another year, by the time it was done, the Soviets would then be the dominant power and a new threat to face all over again.</p>
              <p>It was a decision he agonised painfully over before finally giving the go ahead to General LeMay.</p>

              <p>The closest the world came to nuclear war was in 1962 during the Cuban Missile crisis. Only cool heads in the White House and the Soviet Commnader in Cuba prevented it.</p>
              <p>I grew up in the 80s thinking nuclear war would be inevitable, fortunately now, it looks quite unlikely unless by rogue state which would then be swiftly destroyed.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 19px; line-height: normal;">After it was all over, Director of Military Intelligence for the Pacific Theater of War Alfred McCormack, who was probably in as good position as anyone for judging the situation, <strong>felt that the Japanese surrender could have been obtained in a few weeks by blockade alone: "The Japanese had no longer enough food in stock, and their fuel reserves were practically exhausted. </strong></span></p>

              <p>The U.S. made a deal with Stalin at Yalta summit in Feb 1945 that the Soviets would enter the war against Japan 3 months after Germany was defeated. But after the A bomb was tested in July, the americans changed their minds and wanted to block the Soviets from entering the war.</p>
              <p>They didn't want the Soviets to occupy parts of northern China or Japan and thus increase Soviet influence and control of those areas. They felt that the bomb would finish Japan off before the Soviets could enter.</p>
              <p>You can check out the story in below book:</p>
              <p><strong>The American Occupation of Japan: The Origins of the Cold War in Asia</strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://bookos.org/book/1038038/ec615b">http://bookos.org/book/1038038/ec615b</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The book also details the american strategy in asia and south east asia that is rarely admitted publicly. And that is that U.S strategy was not only about containment of China and USSR during cold war but also Japan. In order to do so, U.S. had to made sure that south east asia had to be free from communism and had to be secure to supply Japan with raw materials and also as a market for Japanese exports.</p>
              <p>They had to play this role, otherwise Japan would look towards the USSR for markets and raw materials and U.S. would lose their influence with Japan. </p>
              <p>This is the real reason why U.S fought the Vietnam war.</p>
              <p>Or better yet, listen to this interview:</p>
              <p><strong>Peter Gowan interview on U.S. foreign policy since 1945</strong></p>
              <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/PeterGowanInterview2009">https://archive.org/details/PeterGowanInterview2009</a></p>
              <p>Everything that U.S. does in the world becomes clear after you listen to it. I am very impressed with Peter Gowan's analyst of U.S. foreign policy.</p>

              <p>Actually that is U.S propaganda, a blockade without invasion would have finished the Japanese off. </p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">After it was all over, Director of Military Intelligence for the Pacific Theater of War Alfred McCormack, who was probably in as good position as anyone for judging the situation, <strong>felt that the Japanese surrender could have been obtained in a few weeks by blockade alone: "The Japanese had no longer enough food in stock, and their fuel reserves were practically exhausted.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">We had begun <strong>a secret process of mining all their harbors</strong>, which was steadily isolating them from the rest of the world. If <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we had brought this operation to its logical conclusion, the destruction of Japan's cities with incendiary and other bombs would have been quite unnecessary.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong>But General Norstad declared at Washington that this blockading action was a cowardly proceeding unworthy of the Air Force.</strong> It was therefore discontinued."</span></p>

              <p>Dalforce - you underestimated the japs in the days of the imperial rule. they were taught to hold their pee if ordered to by the emporer. so they will fiht to the last men., food or no food, weapons or no weapons. Aboobs was the only best quick and swift solution back then. so japs also moved on later and their economy overtook the rest of the world fast.</p>

              <p>One powerful reason why U.S. dropped the bomb was to display their military power to the USSR.</p>
              <p>Once the Soviets saw the power of the A-bomb, they had to move cautiously. They cannot suka suka occupy here and there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 19px; line-height: normal;">On the other hand, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if we had not used the bomb on Japan</span></strong>, we would have been <strong>quite incapable of preventing the Soviet ground forces from expanding</strong> wherever they were ordered in Eurasia in 1946 and later. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 19px; line-height: normal;">We do not know where they might have been ordered because we do not know if the Kremlin is insatiable for conquest, as some "experts" claim, or is only seeking buffer security zones, as other "experts" believe, but it is clear that Soviet orders to advance were prevented by American possession of the A-bomb after 1945. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 19px; line-height: normal;">It does seem clear that ultimately Soviet forces would have taken all of Germany, much of the Balkans, probably Manchuria, and possibly other fringe areas across central Asia, including Iran.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 19px; line-height: normal;"> Such an advance of Soviet power to the Rhine, the Adriatic, and the Aegean would have been totally <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unacceptable to the United States, but, without the atom bomb, we could hardly have stopped it.</span></strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 19px; line-height: normal;">Moreover, such an advance would have led to Communist or Communist-dominated coalition governments in Italy and France. If the Soviet forces had advanced to the Persian Gulf across Iran, this might have led to such Communist-elected governments in India and much of Africa.</span></p>
