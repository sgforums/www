            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldn't say this is a three pronged assault. The banning of sand is a mere hindrance to us, as sand can be bought from other places.  It'll cost us more but no choice lar.  The Thais, it will just take a little while for it to sink in that we are their friends.  Hurting their relations with us wouldn't benefit them either.<br><br>Singapore has no reason to survive and to become the leading economy in South East Asia.  The only reason I can imagine why the other SEA countries are not better off than we are is that they have more problems with corruption than we do.<br><br>There is hardly a reason why flights need to divert for transit in Singapore instead of Thailand, (except for flights to Aussieland).  Changi is actually quite out of the way.  Fortunately for us, Changi was not built on a river delta and hence its more viable than the alternative.<br><br>This is but one example of why Singapore is in the lead.  Because we are stable, we don't have coups, and corruption is low, compared to the rest of SEA.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, i hate to say this. The SW monsoon is coming soon. That means dry season gonna be upon this region. That means them Indos gonna sure as hell encourage a whole lotta burnin to choke us real good! Last year, one of them Indo minister remarked SG should'nt complain about them smoke if SG dun wanna sign them extridation treaty. WTF man  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Tat's why i said, we should lie real low and dun give a damn if these countries suffer enomous catastrophy. They dun give a shit to our well being, why should we so much as send peanuts to assist them in their hour of need?<br><br>BTW, have you guys ever wondered how, after the worldwide Sunami donations, which amounted to billiions of US$$, Indo gov suddenly can afford to plan and purchase offensive military weapons??<br><br>Where does the money come from? The Sunami dragged them treasures from the deep Indian Ocean and dump 'em on Sumatra shores?<br><br>We should keep our donations and help the unfortunate SG citizens instead.<br></div>
