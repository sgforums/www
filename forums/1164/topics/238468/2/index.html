If the batam hookers don't wana serve sg man, also see it as bully SG?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>since we are already getting sand from elsewhere, the indon should keep quiet... or try to think of something else maybe.<br><br>3. thailand shincorp? personnally I think temasek should take it as a lesson learnt. The Thai seldom make noise but this time we did step on their tail a bit. Of course ultimately the thai can't take back shin or the satellite by force or they will be digging their own grave..economically, .but is better to be more mindful when dealing with other country's sensitive property to avoid problem, especially third world asian country.<br><br>but these cases proves something... the leader of these country cannot control their subordinates, of course the thai is different cos the suborinate is now the leader behind the iron curtain.<br><br>just curious to know,  other than noise... what did we actually lose?<br><br>those so-called big country near us, other than bigger in land size and population... err... what else that is so threatening?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As most of you have pointed out, its just rantings. Just bear with it and leave the job to the government.<br><br>I think when they are in need we should help, because the world is our audience not just that country alone. If we can back up what we say with what we do it makes us WAYYY more credible than most around us.<br><br>Unfortunately for Singapore, being a small red dot, we HAVE to be staunch and be number one. Otherwise we really have nothing else to market. And about Changi being off route. i find that quite weird as its the first time anyone has ever said that. I looked at the map, and i really think Singapore's location is PRIME. its near to most countries in Asia. Not only geographically it makes our placement prime but also because of the infrastructure and support for Flights and Maritime vessels. Together it makes Singapore one of the best if not the best stops to stop over to re-sup and repair. Otherwise how do we win awards like busiest ports etc.<br><br>Went abit OT but the main point is we have to remain the top to compete with the rest because thats sadly what we only have. People and the ability to do great things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe we feel frustrated and bullied at time because our govt did not shout back at these country that make noise. So over time we don't feel "shiok" as we can't let go our anger. we can do the same to humiliate them by calling them names and reminding them that they are poor, backwards and useless ...but probably that will make the matter worst cos their leaders and ppl are less "developed" and may react animally...also that will tarnish our first world good name ......if they can't use their head properly then talk law and order is the best way out cos they will then know they are in the wrong and will eventually give up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .... they can't use force cos they have no capability. .....emm... they good at  terrorism ...goodness  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>unless we have invest and donate so much in these countries like Japan and threatening to pull out the funds and aid is enough to scare the shit out of them. can we use money "soft" power?<br><br></div>

Although the article did not state explicitly that they need singapore $$ to kick start investments it can be somehow inferred.<br><br>not sure if most of you realise this but since the new malaysian PM took over, there's less sg bashing frm the malaysian govt (except occasional rants from Dr M). I guess they realised the need to attract sg $$ and maybe thats why they want to have the SEZ in johor rather than somewhere further north. so i guess their govt is starting to see that its a win-win situation if they are more receptive to globalisation and sg investments. however not all the nationalistic, normal malaysian see this.<br><br>but i guess IF they manage to develop their johor SEZ and begin to reap the economic benefits, nationalism will slowly slip away and effects of globalisation will begin to seap in. they will then start to see sg as a friend and source of investments. in this case they gain and we also gain from having a larger investment zone in SEA benefitting both MY and SG with the combined larger market(so that we can compete with larger economies like china).<br><br>I guess SG govt already realised this long long ago and SG investors are ready to go to anywhere as long as it guarantee money flowing back into our pockets rather than just base our investments on nationalistic sentiments. MY must start to open up to us then we can become good neighbours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe the government can retaliate quietly and unofficially at times when an irresponsible foreign government or leader takes pot shots at Singapore.  Otherwise, what is there to stop them from committing these despicable acts repeatedly?<br><br>Perhaps the government is already doing this, by deliberately slowing customs/immigration procedures at the causeway and Tuas, such that Singaporeans are put off from visiting Malaysia. In this case, less Singaporeans visit Malaysia, thereby spending less money in that economy. Such retaliation can be unofficial and masked (like citing "security checks" in the example of customs clearance), so that we can be equivocal about denying that we are even reacting to the provocation. I have also suspected that certain Western governments indicate displeasure at other countries by the use of travel advisories against travelling to the targeted countries.<br><br>If we adopt such methods, Singaporeans shall not feel demoralized and helpless against irresponsible provocations from foreign leaders. And since such retaliation is informal, they are deniable and will not invite tit-for-tat reaction.<br></div>
