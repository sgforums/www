              <p>Ok, this is apparently not going anywhere. So let me share my darkest military secrets...</p>
              <p>I have a problem that has stuck with me till now since enlistment. I am at my rowdiest and crudest when I'm clad in camouflage uniform. I took my first puff shortly after BMT. I went through the usual <em>Rites of Passage </em>by learning my Foxtrot.U.Charlie.Kilo and Charlie.Hotel.Echo.Echo.Bravo.Y.Echo well.</p>
              <p>Then I became adventurous. Something I used to do a couple of years back at the kopitiam, when we didn't have our nametags and vocation sewn onto our uniform. I peeled off the velcro, had one or two smokes over my favourite kopi C, and even mounted my boots up on the chair. I recall one late night, when I met up an "ah beng" friend of mine after ICT for a beer cum smoking session. I even mounted my boots on the table throughout. Surely, I was behaving rowdily and giving SAF a bad name, but I actually enjoyed the astonishing looks of passerbys, who must be wondering what is up this cool soldier's sleeves.</p>
              <p>Well, you must be wondering if I have chanced upon any law enforcer. MPs in plain clothes? Have never bumped into one. For all those days when I smoked at the kopitiam in long four, kicking back my boots on the table top. Damn shiok! <br><br>Another confession. After our ICTs, a few kakis used to go to the movies in our long four. I was always the first one to hang my boots over the front seat. The rest would follow suit. Damn comfortable. And that was when people saw a row of military gangsters at the cinema, tarnishing the good name of SAF. Don't be overly shocked, guys. We picked the afternoon slots (as outprocessing was usually at 1pm) so we weren't exactly competing with Dennis the Menace. We made sure we didn't block anyone by taking the LAST row.</p>

              <p>Once, while having sex in a tractor-trailer, part of Rey Mysterio's sperm escaped and got into the engine. We now know this
                                      truck as Optimus Prime.</p>

              <p>You are one hell of a devil, either satanic, or lucifer incarnate. Scary stuff you write in your posts, though I'm not much of an angel myself.</p>
              <p>By the way, I have had lots of 'action' in full uniform, but wouldn't risk indulging in them on camp ground. Can you beat that, in a trailer of all places? Sounds sexciting perhaps, but with who? Yourself, I guess, since you are so damn narcissistic. The most daring I've done is jerking off in my camp toilet. Or once in the field, when I had such a hard-on I wished that faggot buddy of mine can give me a blowjob. My salute to you for either cooking up a big story or for being such a jerk.</p>

              <p>Sorry guys, my apologies for the crudeness, and the uncensored transparency in sharing my ugly misdeeds. Just for the record, I don't indulge in these anymore. Especially those uncalled for animal releases. Don't want to be caught in the act by my CSM, whom I detest to the core!</p>
              <p>Let's put a full stop here. But before that, an archive of my ugly fetish. This was taken two weeks ago, after I returned from a meaningless silent mob exercise. Fucking exhausted, and badly needed a smoke. So I kicked back comfortably at the kopitiam near my house, and took a pic of my boots resting on the table. Notice my white socks. We reservists don't care about matching colours, haha...</p>

              <p>And I beg of the first and only respondent to this post to stop posting disturbing stuff. Your satanic energy may be a momentary turn-on, but surely a put-off for the prim and proper. Spread some positivity here, little devil.</p>

              <p>1) we had an OC who was quite demanding on the officers and specs ( NCOs then). Was nice to the recruits but not so good to us. His nickname was "yah-tao" ( duckhead !). Somehow he heard about this nickname from a regular WO who snitched on us. After some months, a bunch of us decided to send him a signal. We got an uncooked duck's head and one of the NCOs hung it on his Honda Accord radio aerial, while he was away on exercise.

              <p>2) just before I ORD'd, I brought my girl friend into our company lines. I locked ourselves in the platoon office ( I was a PS then). We had a "great" time in the office ! This was after one of the regular NCOs in the camp was caught with a girl in the sgts mess.</p>

              <p>1) Took a german shepherd dog to the exercise ground. Then when i open the door, the dog rushed out and run around the whole dog camp. (still secured but ...) I cannot run as fast as the dog and can only shout loose dog loose dog. But there wasnt anyone around the exercise area for some reason. In the end, the dog run until sian so sit down and let me grab him back to kennel.</p>
              <p>2) Another case is i put dogs in dog van. I didnt notice that is a dog in one of the cages already. (the dog is very dark so same colour as interior of van). Then i tell the other dog to go up. Luckily the two dogs never bite each other. They only growl hard at each other. Normally the dogs will bite lor. I pull one of the dogs away. If not will see blood + sadness + dunno how many extras lor. Lucky</p>
              <p>3) Third case has nothing to do with dogs. I was a total blur f. I went to the NDP drill squad without bringing my rifle. I boarded the chartered bus without realising. I left the rifle in my cupboard. But luckily only 3 extras.</p>

              <p>Talking about dogs..... here's another episode from NSF days.</p>
              <p>We exercised regularly in the Ulu Sembawang area. Before the days of the great HDB flat building programme. There were a few abandoned villages with many stray dogs left behind.</p>
              <p>Someone came up with a "brilliant" idea ( very childish now that you think about it)... that we could "train" our own tracker dogs to track our soldiers during field exercise !!!</p>
              <p>So an Indian NCO friend of mine went to kidnap a mongrel puppy from Ulu Sembawang and brought it  back to company line. We "trained" it by letting it smell our soldier's belongings ( yes.... smelly socks and no. 4s). And then shouting at the puppy to "go find" !</p>
              <p>All this went on very nicely and every one seemed very pleased that the experiment was going well. Then came booking out day for the troops .....</p>
              <p>Our puppy decided that she had to track the troops going home. She left the camp with one of the platoons marching out of the gate and boarded the no. 174 bus from Sembawang Road and was never seen again <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> !!!</p>

If you were one such lucky trooper and recalled a stray dog following you after you booked out of camp, let the forum know !</p></div>
