            <div class='col-md body'>Came across this interesting bit of news at the following website<br>http://www.mggpillai.com/article.php3?sid=1724<br><br>This article, written recently, is long so i just took out the part that reported the following which describes what took place:<br><br>"When Singapore positions itself, with Israeli help, as a Chinese island in a hostile Malay sea, as Israel in the Middle East, and believes its military might could flatten its neighbours armed might at the onset of hostilities, and conducts its talks with its neighbours as it does, is it not inevitable that many in Malaysia believe that this issue must result in open hostilities? Especially when it was Singapore that began the military arms race with Malaysia when she bought tanks in the late 1960s. And continue to taunt the Malaysian armed forces by her military aircraft straying deep into Trengganu and Kelantan and back into international waters when the RMAF jets scramble from Kuantan.<br><br>Malaysia has quietly shown Singapore over how weak her security is. She has slapped the Singapore armed forces in ways that caused it to come unstuck. The most dramatic was when its commandos invaded its high security air missiles base in Bukit Batok overlooking the Straits of Johore and pasted Malaysian stamps on the missiles and replaced the Singapore flag on the commanding officer's table with the Malaysian flag. Several Singapore officers resigned or were reassigned or demoted. The major who carried it out, who is known by his nickame, Sam, is still around and in the business"<br><br>Anyone can confirm this? While i'm sure that Bt Batok does not overlook Johor, i do find this an intriguing and piece of news...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it shouldnt be difficult to infiltrate a base during peace time... afterall.. security aint really that tight...<br><br>and even if it is that tight... it aint infallible... given time.. a weakness is bound to appear...<br><br>in fact... i think most guys knew... but the SAF commandos also do alot of this kind of mischief... thus far.. i heard.. 46th SAR, 6th SIR have all kenna grafiti over their HQ block... compliments of the commandos...<br><br>but... i never heard that there is SAM base in bukit batok...... been there so many times.. never saw anything except those antennas?? are those SAMs?? or part of the installation belonging to the SAMs?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Doubt that those who executed the raid were adorned with camo gear and balaclava and guns ready to be ablaze...nothing of that sort. They probably entered the facility disguised as 'vendors' or 'contractors'..or other unconventional means<br><br>If such an incident did occur, s'pore spec ops warriors would have likely did a counter-'raid'...as any self-respecting military outfit would have done - a measured response. Guess it's natural for rival nations to resort to such tactics to probe for weaknesses. There are no babes or moral highground in this business<br><br>I guess there are many such 'hush-hush hanky panky' business going on - all in the realm of speculation for the lay person<br><br></div>

Especially when it was Singapore that began the military arms race with Malaysia when she bought tanks in the late 1960s. And continue to taunt the Malaysian armed forces by her military aircraft straying deep into Trengganu and Kelantan and back into international waters when the RMAF jets scramble from Kuantan.<br><br>Malaysia has quietly shown Singapore over how weak her security is. She has slapped the Singapore armed forces in ways that caused it to come unstuck. The most dramatic was when its commandos invaded its high security air missiles base in Bukit Batok overlooking the Straits of Johore and pasted Malaysian stamps on the missiles and replaced the Singapore flag on the commanding officer's table with the Malaysian flag. Several Singapore officers resigned or were reassigned or demoted. The major who carried it out, who is known by his nickame, Sam, is still around and in the business"<br><br>Anyone can confirm this? While i'm sure that Bt Batok does not overlook Johor, i do find this an intriguing and piece of news...<br></div></blockquote>When did this incident happen?

            <div class='col-md body'>Now about those Gundams.  We really should keep quiet about it.  I mean, if the Malaysian Intelligence, (if they had any) start looking into it, they may discover our VF-1 Valkryies also.  I mean, who likes you annoying neighbour to have kick ass jets that turn into robots to fight on land?  Who knows, they might start making Protons that turn into some kinda chimpanzee?<br><br>MAF Commandos can raid Singapore in their fat slobby dreams.  Which country would send special forces into another country during peace time just to help the base commander of a certain base in the country to paste stamps on missiles (probably to make sure the missiles DO reach M'sia), and change the interior decor of his office?  Risk getting caught and sent to jail for petty crimes. Nutcases.</div>
