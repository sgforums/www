            <div class='col-md body'>One look and one can tell that this story is yet another MULE Malaysian-military Urban LEgend. It fits perfectly into the Malaysian misconceptions, sterotypes and mindsets with little regard for logic or reason, probably the reason they even bought it in the first place.<br><br>Basically, this story is prefect for the Malaysian preception of Singapore as a proud and poweful neighbour who likes to intimidate them with its military, that needs to be cut down to size, and at the same time playing up the patriotic "Malaysia boleh" factor to make them feel a little better about themselves.<br><br>In reality such a raid is nonsense. It would be a sensless, diplomatic disaster in any case, and not even one Malaysia would be willing to make. Imagine the implications on its standing in ASEAN and the rest of the world when Singapore cries foul over what they did. Malaysia's standing and credibility as a country would hit rock bottom, lower then they already are, not to mention badly damaging ties with Singapore. There are so many reasons why such a raid would mess up themselves and hence there are good reasons why not to carry it out.<br><br>Only Malaysian internet camo clowns, with little regard for the logical and political implications will dream up this kind of nonsense and then propagate it. Unfotunately due to the innate Malaysian ability to buy half-truths, fiction rapidly becomes "widely-known fact".<br><br>The truth of the matter is, it hardly does either country good to mess around with each other's national security, either by raiding or sending jet incursions. Esp. when despite all their differences, they are basically still allies.<br><br>Don't buy a single word of the story at all. It reads straight from self-serving fantasy, which apparently some malaysians alien to logic like to live in.<br><br></div>

Especially when it was Singapore that began the military arms race with Malaysia when she bought tanks in the late 1960s. And continue to taunt the Malaysian armed forces by her military aircraft straying deep into Trengganu and Kelantan and back into international waters when the RMAF jets scramble from Kuantan.<br><br>Malaysia has quietly shown Singapore over how weak her security is. She has slapped the Singapore armed forces in ways that caused it to come unstuck. The most dramatic was when its commandos invaded its high security air missiles base in Bukit Batok overlooking the Straits of Johore and pasted Malaysian stamps on the missiles and replaced the Singapore flag on the commanding officer's table with the Malaysian flag. Several Singapore officers resigned or were reassigned or demoted. The major who carried it out, who is known by his nickame, Sam, is still around and in the business"<br><br>Anyone can confirm this? While i'm sure that Bt Batok does not overlook Johor, i do find this an intriguing and piece of news...<br></div></blockquote>sounds like fun..... so when we retaliate..... do we dump bak kua in their cookhouse?</div>

As a warning to their southern neighbour not to mess around, the IAF flew a C-130 (under radar) towards the nearest saudi airbase and air-dropped a bunch of 'live' squealing swines to their splattering deaths on the runway ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
