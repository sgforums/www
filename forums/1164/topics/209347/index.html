            <div class='col-md body'>There is a huge buildup of European war ships in the Mediterranean. And one source suggests that it could be an arms buildup aimed at Iran and Syria.<br><br>According to the usually flamboyant Debka.com: "The extraordinary buildup of European naval and military strength in and around LebanonÂ’s shores is way out of proportion for the task the European contingents of expanded UNIFIL have undertaken: to create a buffer between Israel and Hizballah."<br><br>Citing the usual anonymous sources Debka, who is often out on a limb, but does deliver occassional blockbuster information noted: 'Â“Lebanese securityÂ” and peacemaking is not the object of the exercise. It is linked to the general anticipation of a military clash between the United States and Israel, on one side, and Iran and possibly Syria on the other, some time from now until November.'<br><br>More interesting is the notion that "This expectation has brought together the greatest sea and air armada Europe has ever assembled at any point on earth since World War II: two carriers with 75 fighter-bombers, spy planes and helicopters on their decks; 15 warships of various types Â– 7 French, 5 Italian, 2-3 Green, 3-5 German, and five American; thousands of Marines Â– French, Italian and German, as well as 1,800 US Marines."<br><br>http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/duarte/2006/0908.html</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe this is an indirect show of force by the Europeans to Iran that they are 'very concerned' about the destabilising effect generated in the already volatile oil-rich Middle East should Iran succeed in developing and testing nuclear weapons.<br><br>At the same time they under the banner of UN are  indirectly showing to the Americans that the Europeans are still a force to be reckon with and warn US not to brush them and the UN aside such as in the case when some European nations voiced objections to the US invasion of Iraq.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, absurd as it might sound... I find it highly suspicious that the EU would actually follow the Americans on a military adventure of such a scale. And in a way, to "Israel's" defense.<br><br>The EU has never been fond of the Jewish state, and has many times called for sanctions against Israel.  Most EU nations polled showed that a majority of their population dislike Israel.  And most of that was over the issue of the Palestinian people.<br><br>In the recent Lebanese expedition, the EU accused the Israelis of "disproportionate use of force."  The only EU member to defend Israel's course of actions was ironically, Germany, who said that Israel had a right to defender herself.<br><br>IMO, the armada is not there, pointing itself at Iran in particular.  It is there as a symbol of the EU's interest and resolve for peace in the region.  And it would be as likely to intervene in the Iran situation as well as necessary deployments to prevent the Israelis from escalating conflicts again.</div>
