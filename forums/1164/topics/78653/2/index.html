Artillery has no longer hold any Motars as they have been decommissioned and hand over to the Manoeuvre Forces. Hence there is no more 120mm Motar Bn...

            <div class='col-md body'>Let me update the list.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Arty assets of SAF</strong><br><br>(I)Mortars</span><br>1) 81mm mortar :<br>Short range ,man portable Infantry Bn's arty . I believe  is still use in PDF formation, but no more in CAD's Infantry unit now.<br><br>2) 120mm Towed mortar : Max Range 13km with rocket assisted ammo, Infantry Bn's arty. There are a few such NS arty Bn for Bde's arty. In the future, there will be no more Bde level arty.<br><br>3) 120mm SP mortar on M113 chasis: Max Range 13km with rocket assisted ammo, Armour Bn arty. Likewise , there are also a few such NS arty Bn for Bde's arty.In the future, there will be no more Bde level arty.<br><br>4) 120mm SRAMS which has low recoil and high firing rate that could be mounted on a light weight veh like Bronco.<br>Not sure whether SAF has adopted this, but if they do , it will be most probably replaced the older 120mm SP on M113.<br><br>5) 160mm towed heavy mortar believe to be phased out .<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(II)155mm Howitzer:</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Towed</span><br>6) FH88 39 cal : Max range 30km<br><br>7) FH2000 52 cal : Max range 40km<br><br>8 ) M71S 39 cal : A few NS unit still operating them.Going to be phased out soon??<br><br>Above arty type are meant for Div level arty for the 3 CAD. Two Bn for each CAD.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">155mm SPH</span><br><br>9) Primus 39 cal SPH :Tracked, fully armoured, max range 30km.<br>Rumour to be meant for the fully mechanised Bde/Div ???<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(III) Rapid Deployable Arty</span><br><br>10) Giat LG1 105mm gun : Air portable using a medium helo like Super Puma. Max range 18.1km.<br>Becos of the air portability, they are meant to support our RDF Div.<br><br>11) LWSPH 39 cal 155mm : Air portable using a minimum a heavy helo like Chinook. Max range 30km.<br>Eventhough it weight only 7 tonnes , but it is not as portable as the LG-1.<br>If SAF going to adopt this weapon, iI believe it is most probably to complement the LG-1 rather than replacing them for support for the RDF Div.<br><br>For future acqusition, I think we should purchase item 4 , the 120mm SRAMS offer higher rate of fire and better FCS to replace our current 120mm SP.<br><br>Another acquistion should be a modern MLRS with GPS guidance for long range precision targeting to counter the MY's A2 and in line with our future 3G army.<br><br></div>
