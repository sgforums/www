I have to say, the following is my own opinion.<br><br>Whether SG would advance into M'sia to either aid in her defense, or just to secure her own resources are not mutually exclusive events.  DUH.  To not move in to aid M'sia in her defense is to abandon these resources completely.<br><br>Then comes the issue of being invited or not.  If we are able to justify that these resources are our national interests, we should be able to do so without kenaing too much repercussions from the international community.<br><br>And think about it this way, why would M'sia refuse military aid if we were to offer them?  We can supply them logistically, and provide additional security forces to their interests, enabling them to focus their forces on offensive operations.<br><br>This is all assuming that Singapore and M'sia are not actually against each other in the conflict.</div>
