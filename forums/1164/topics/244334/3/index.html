Both the Iraqis and Iranians agree on the border,  its a question of position. And then the GPS is a god help<br><br><a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/ModBriefingShowsRoyalNavyPersonnelWereInIraqiWaters.htm" rel="nofollow">MOD briefing shows Royal Navy personnel were in Iraqi waters</a><br><br><blockquote>"As shown on the chart, the merchant vessel was 7.5 nautical miles south east of the Al Faw Peninsula and clearly in Iraqi territorial waters. Her master has confirmed that his vessel was anchored within Iraqi waters at the time of the arrest. The position was 29 degrees 50.36 minutes North 048 degrees 43.08 minutes East. This places her 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi territorial waters. This fact has been confirmed by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.<br><br>"The Iranian government has provided us with two different positions for the incident. The first we received on Saturday and the second on Monday. As this map shows, the first of these points still lies within Iraqi territorial waters. We pointed this out to them on Sunday in diplomatic contacts.<br><br>"After we did this, they then provided a second set of coordinates that places the incident in Iranian waters over two nautical miles from the position given by HMS CORNWALL and confirmed by the merchant vessel. The two Iranian positions are just under a nautical mile apart Â– 1800 yards or so. It is hard to understand a reason for this change of coordinates. We unambiguously contest both the positions provided by the Iranians.<br><br>"I should just explain at this point that the boats remained connected at this point. One of the seaboats was connected via data link, which communicated its position continually to the ship where it was displayed, superimposed on an electronic chart, on a purpose built console. During the boarding this console was constantly monitored and indicated, throughout, that the boats had remained well within Iraqi territorial waters.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Brits in the Gulf and a doctored  British Map ?</strong><br><br><blockquote>Former British Ambassador Craig Murray is now challenging the legitimacy of the map just published by the British government in the current dispute with Iran over those 15 captured British sailors and marines.<br><br>Â“Fake Maritime Boundaries<br>I have been unpopular before, but the level of threats since I started blogging on the captured marines has got a bit scary. It is therefore with some trepidation that I feel obliged to point this out.<br><br>Â“The British Government has published a map showing the coordinates of the incident, well within an Iran/Iraq maritime border. The mainstream media and even the blogosphere has bought this hook, line and sinker.<br><br>Â“But there are two colossal problems.<br><br>Â“A) The Iran/Iraq maritime boundary shown on the British government map does not exist. It has been drawn up by the British Government. Only Iraq and Iran can agree their bilateral boundary, and they never have done this in the Gulf, only inside the Shatt because there it is the land border too. This published boundary is a fake with no legal force.<br><br>Â“B) Accepting the British coordinates for the position of both HMS Cornwall and the incident, both were closer to Iranian land than Iraqi land. Go on, print out the map and measure it. Which underlines the point that the British produced border is not a reliable one.<br><br>Â“None of which changes the fact that the Iranians, having made their point, should have handed back the captives immediately. I pray they do so before this thing spirals out of control. But by producing a fake map of the Iran/Iraq boundary, notably unfavourable to Iran, we can only harden the Iranian position.Â”<br><br>When I spoke with the former Ambassador he told me how dumbfounded he is by the way in which the mainstream media continues to treat this dispute.<br><br>The BBC for instance has already interviewed a supposed expert regarding the map, who vouched for its authenticity. But the point is, as Craig Murray, points out, how can such a map exist if the subject of boundaries has never been settled between Iraq and Iran? Turns out the expert had been referred to the BBC by the British Ministry of DefenseÂ–who also turned out the plan.<br><br>Sounds like the rerun of a bad movie weÂ’ve already seen.</blockquote><a href="http://barrylando.com/?p=136" rel="nofollow">http://barrylando.com/?p=136</a><br><br>Just like the McMahon Line serving India's claims on China's border... it was never signed.</div>

If US or UK whack Iran, must do it to ensure all the nuclear &amp; missile research and storage facilities completely destroyed (not just go in and rescue hostages). A superficial attack will result in ballistic missile attacks by Iran, or attacks by the Iraqi Shias allied with Iran on US/UK forces in Iraq, perhaps even missile strike on Israel from Iran or Hezbullah in Lebanon (which risks a much wider Arab-Israeli war). Also, many Iranian nuclear labs are either in residential neighbourhoods (ie. collateral damage, international outrage on the attackers) or too deep underground even for the latest "bunker busters" bombs.<br>2. Lack of political will. Blair's govt will face political revolt by his own Labour govt, even if if it is over 15 UK sailors, unless there are no other options for their release. US Congress is now Democrat-controlled, no stomach for another war after what has happened in Iraq.<br>3. The Brits have under 5000 soldiers in Iraq - not enough for any large-scale operation. US Forces (130,000) are severely depleted in Iraq theatre, most units, like retired Gen. McCaffrey said, at breaking point (under 50% op readiness). Air war alone is not enough to get rid of Iran's nuclear &amp; missile programmes, boots on the ground are seriously needed to ensure Iran won't have nuclear weapons in 10 years. An invasion and possibly occupation is required. And Iran is not like Iraq in GW2 - they haven't been weakened and revenues from recent high oil prices have allowed them to go on a shopping spree for Russian arms lately. An attack/invasion will require hundreds of thousands of troops (and very high casualties) that US cannot handle right now.<br>4. Gulf states like UAE and Bahrain will not allow USAF to stage attacks on Iran from their bases, which means planes may be limited to Navy carrier-borne aicraft or from distant Europe (limited number of flights due to air-refueling requirements).</div>
