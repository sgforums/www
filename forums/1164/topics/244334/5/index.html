While the Ang Mors screw a lot of things up, it would be unhelpful to pin them down as the source of all the world's problems.<br><br>Let's just say that we allow the ME to run itself...

Probably in a couple of days the air over Iran will be the US.<br><br>They can probably stage bases in Iraq then. A quick and short flight and you can even stage A-10s and AH-64 there. The F-22 also will their chance to prove their battle-worthiness although I suspect majority of the work will be done by UAVs.<br><br>Don't think US want to conquer Iran, probably just install a more favorable government.
