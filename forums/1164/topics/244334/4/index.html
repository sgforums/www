            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OldBird69:</div><div class="quote_body">Not a feasible option. Why?<br>1. If US or UK whack Iran, must do it to ensure all the nuclear &amp; missile research and storage facilities completely destroyed (not just go in and rescue hostages). A superficial attack will result in ballistic missile attacks by Iran, or attacks by the Iraqi Shias allied with Iran on US/UK forces in Iraq, perhaps even missile strike on Israel from Iran or Hezbullah in Lebanon (which risks a much wider Arab-Israeli war). Also, many Iranian nuclear labs are either in residential neighbourhoods (ie. collateral damage, international outrage on the attackers) or too deep underground even for the latest "bunker busters" bombs.<br>2. Lack of political will. Blair's govt will face political revolt by his own Labour govt, even if if it is over 15 UK sailors, unless there are no other options for their release. US Congress is now Democrat-controlled, no stomach for another war after what has happened in Iraq.<br>3. The Brits have under 5000 soldiers in Iraq - not enough for any large-scale operation. US Forces (130,000) are severely depleted in Iraq theatre, most units, like retired Gen. McCaffrey said, at breaking point (under 50% op readiness). Air war alone is not enough to get rid of Iran's nuclear &amp; missile programmes, boots on the ground are seriously needed to ensure Iran won't have nuclear weapons in 10 years. An invasion and possibly occupation is required. And Iran is not like Iraq in GW2 - they haven't been weakened and revenues from recent high oil prices have allowed them to go on a shopping spree for Russian arms lately. An attack/invasion will require hundreds of thousands of troops (and very high casualties) that US cannot handle right now.<br>4. Gulf states like UAE and Bahrain will not allow USAF to stage attacks on Iran from their bases, which means planes may be limited to Navy carrier-borne aicraft or from distant Europe (limited number of flights due to air-refueling requirements).</div></blockquote>It might not be so impossible. Might be a re-run of Afghanistan, with a bit more fireworks.<br><br>1.  The US has deployed more PAC-3 batteries to the region.  Last article I saw was approximately 200 batteries.  Hopefully, they may prevent an effective counter-strike?<br><br>2.  Politics, well thats not really my game.  But if the Brit government are convinced of the necessity and gains of the war, it'll be a shoot first, ask questions later.  Thats what happened in GW2.  With Sailors in Iranian hands... I think they will shoot.<br><br>3.  There are rebel factions in Iran that need opportunities to move in and topple the current government.  These Iranian rebels, formerly considered terrorists organizations were allowed refuge in Iraq by the Americans.   Iran already has a lot of problems on their own handling these buggers, and yes, they used terrorist attacks (car bombs etc) IN IRAN itself.<br><br>4.  Which is why the Command officer of CENTCOM, is now a swabbie.  What does a Navy officer know about fighting insurgency in the streets of Iraq?  Nothing.  This change of leadership in CENTCOM may indicate that the US is planning a Navy-centered operation in the region.  The current CENTCOM was one of the recognized officers who were involved in the air campaign in the Balkans as well.</div>

I just hope Adm Fallon (new CENTCOM commander), if he decides to attack, thinks it over very thoroughly.<br>I have some concerns, though:<br>The PAC-3 Patriot is still unproven in battle - there will be serious repercussions if they don't work. Iran may decide to fire missiles at every Sunni country in the neighbourhood + at Israel.<br>The rebel factions in Iran seem (to me) a way less capable force than the Northern Alliance or Karzai in Afghanistan. And Iran has an organised military, far stronger than Taliban. If US is aiming for 'regime change' Afghan-style, I foresee a lot of problems.<br>I agree having a navy man running CENTCOM does not make sense unless the Pentagon is considering a strike by the USN.<br>If US is thinking of conducting an air war based mainly on carrier-based assets, I think the current 2 carriers in the theatre, even with the support of B-2 (in US) and B-52 (in Diego Garcia), which do not need air-refuelling, is not enough and may not be sustainable for long. The NATO strike on Serbia a few years back, the only successful air-only campaign, was a multi-nation effort with a lot more aircraft and support. I don't know which NATO/Arab countries (aside from the Brits) are willing to support a strike even by just providing use of their bases (at risk of an iranian backlash), making it difficult to impossible to use USAF assets in UK, Germany or Italy.<br>Currently both sides (US/UK vs Iran) don't seem to want to talk to resolve this quietly, which makes an escalation to use of force more likely.</div>

I just hope Adm Fallon (new CENTCOM commander), if he decides to attack, thinks it over very thoroughly.<br>I have some concerns, though:<br>The PAC-3 Patriot is still unproven in battle - there will be serious repercussions if they don't work. Iran may decide to fire missiles at every Sunni country in the neighbourhood + at Israel.<br>The rebel factions in Iran seem (to me) a way less capable force than the Northern Alliance or Karzai in Afghanistan. And Iran has an organised military, far stronger than Taliban. If US is aiming for 'regime change' Afghan-style, I foresee a lot of problems.<br>I agree having a navy man running CENTCOM does not make sense unless the Pentagon is considering a strike by the USN.<br>If US is thinking of conducting an air war based mainly on carrier-based assets, I think the current 2 carriers in the theatre, even with the support of B-2 (in US) and B-52 (in Diego Garcia), which do not need air-refuelling, is not enough and may not be sustainable for long. The NATO strike on Serbia a few years back, the only successful air-only campaign, was a multi-nation effort with a lot more aircraft and support. I don't know which NATO/Arab countries (aside from the Brits) are willing to support a strike even by just providing use of their bases (at risk of an iranian backlash), making it difficult to impossible to use USAF assets in UK, Germany or Italy.<br>Currently both sides (US/UK vs Iran) don't seem to want to talk to resolve this quietly, which makes an escalation to use of force more likely.</div></blockquote>Just a shot in the dark.  I guess we may not see an outright regime change in Iran like what the US did with the Northern Alliance.  What I THINK they hope is to de-stabilise Iran sufficiently so that<br>1.  It cannot threaten Iraq directly.<br>2.  Cannot cohesively build up WMDs.<br><br>However, I cannot see how a military strike on Iran would aid in easing the violence in Iraq.<br><br>But at the very least, Iran would not be able to exert influence over fledgling Iraq with its military or WMDs.   They must avoid a shiite vs sunni open season in Iraq.<br><br>It maybe true that fixed wing asset build up in the region does not seem to match to what was seen in Allied Force.  However, I doubt this will be an Allied Force Rerun, where a President was literally bombed into submission.<br><br>If a war does break out, it will be a showcase of network centric warfare and information dominance using the latest UAVs, Satellites, Stand off weaponry and the latest GPS/INS munitions.<br><br>Latest rumors I saw on the net was that there was at least 1 converted SSGN.  Combine that with the number of TLAMs each US warship can carry, there is A LOT of existing firepower to provide the necessary shock and awe in the first strike.<br><br>Perhaps it might be wise to keep the minimize the amount of European involvement.  With exception to the Germans who still have excellent interoperability with the Yanks.<br><br>I'll still try to keep the faith in the PAC-3 given its latest upgrades and developments. Its been a long time since a patriot was launched against a missile. They may have improved. =D</div>
