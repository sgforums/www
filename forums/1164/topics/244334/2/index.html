            <div class='col-md body'>Guys....<br><br>Please note that there has been an increased war drumming on invade Iran by the govt of US, Israel and UK.. and their 'Fair and Balance' propaganda News agencies. Who is to say who is honest in their reporting. In these days and time, One cannot simply assume that the Western media is correct.<br><br>They have 2 Aircraft Carrier groups in the gulf, talks of US financing/supporting terrorist groups in Iran, surge of troops level in Iraq, and the blatant outright violation of the NPT by the west (for Iranian right to enrich their own Nuclear Fuel).. when it suit their fancy. Placing further financial and export sanctions. It has all the hallmark situation leading to the illegal invasion of Iraq.<br><br>The incident happened in the Shaat-al-arab waterway, which was in dispute for decades. The Captured British Personnel were engaged in routine boarding operations tp prevent Smuggling in Iraqi territorial waters under UNSCR 1723, and the government of Iraq. However, The british were actually and routinely boarded Iranian ships heading out to the gulf... in disputed waters... not in Iraq waters.. why would those Iranian ships travel in Iraqi waters to transit to the gulf ? The brits were not entitled to search Iranian ships there at all.. unless in Iraqi waters.<br></div>

Do remember, he is not a cleric, and the support from Qom is not exactly guaranteed. This kidnapping may be one element of a powerplay between the secular elected govt of Ahmedinejad, and the clerics.<br><br>He needs to see the reality for what it is, and that the actions of the theocracy will possibly push Iran to war, and take action as needed. You believe the youth of Iran want to live under such a clerical regime forever? There are signs of instability, and most of the hot air have come from the Revolutionary Guards.<br><br>If Ahmedinejad decides to play ball with the UN, perhaps he could still be a credible partner. Let's just say that Resolution 1747 was a unanimous one, and so there is no case for saying that it's a western crusade against Iran. Ahmedinejad either does not want to play by the rules of the international system, or he does not want/is unable to ensure that forces within Iran play ball. Either way, time is running out.<br><br>Much as I HATE to see another war, I don't see how the alternative could pan out, which could lead to less stable source of oil for us in the future. SM Goh was right, Iran's future relations with the world depend on her willingness to play in the international order. Absolute state sovereignty is dead, what is left is "negotiated" sovereignty that is subject to any infringement on the interests of the community of nations by a nation's own self-interest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps what Lazer Lordz said is right but we can only judge from afar. Nonetheless great insight. Ahmedinejad may be slammed for his aggressive tactics but thats probably how he came to power. Promising whatever the people wanted and showing the world how he means it through his agressive speeches. But like u said, some non-action has also caused him troubles.<br><br>I really do hope that Iran plays ball with the UN for I am in favour of Singapore strengthening ties with Iran because of the immense benefits it will bring for both parties.<br><br>I was very surprised that SM Goh called on Ahmedinejad in fact slightly shocked wondering what repercussions would befall on SG ie. Overreaction from the US. However, our govt tread very carefully and made an excellent move.<br><br>Back to the alledged kidnapping, after the latest news reports seems that any military involvement will be unlikely. Iran doesnt seem to be very agressive in this situation. There will be one more phase to go before any military action is considered. So war is still not in the picture... yet.<br><br>added source <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/27/news/iran.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/27/news/iran.php</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Goh trips was a good move. We are new to the region in the past we see it from far, if we were to engage politically n economically we need to be there personally to "Talk"<br><br>it is easy to see this incident or conflict as US, UK vs Iran. but alot of the regional politics we do not understand the true nature:  Heres what I mean:<br><br>1) Sunni Arab regime doesn't really see Iran as part of Arab. They don't get along together. they don't have the same ethnic background, etc.<br><br>2) Iranian had supported the Hezbollah during the last kinapping of the Israeli soldier, military equipment, funds were contributed thru Syria.<br><br>there is a implicit struggle within the region in itself. I think we tend to overrate the influence of the West too much.  If the west could influence easily Iraq would not be such a mess.<br><br>so while we take side we need to understand some of the existing relationship.<br></div>
