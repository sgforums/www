It was also the first time their bullpup rifle was openly shown to the western media. A big part of it was that they don't want to alarm the HKers by stationing troops in HK dressed in traditional PLA uniforms. Their number three with beret make them look like other HK uniformed personnels like police, ambulance etc.<br><br>But the PLA especially on HK Island, mostly keep out of sight and is not allowed contact with the locals without supervision.

After Soviet Union collaspe in 1990,Soviet provide plenty of assistance to help PLA design Type 96,98 and 98G.So no need to go into so much work in RE a capture T-72.<br><br>Abt the Tomahawk cruise missile,the Chinese bought a unexploded tomahawk from Pakistan who obtained it through Taliban when US take revenge for USS Cole by firing a couple of Tomahawk at Afganistan in 1998. At that time,US and Pakistan were still no allies! Chinese Embassy in Sarajevo was bombed by US PGM for Chinese keeping the debris of a down F-117/A after a split of 50/50 with the Russia.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another funny thing is that the T-64 is actually more capable than the T-72 according to many websites. The T-64 was made only for the Russian Army and was never exported. So, on other words, the T-72 is actually an export-version of the T-72.<br><br>But I'm sure the later improvements like the T-80 onwards must surely be better than the T-64. Any ideas, anyone?</div>

For the rest, even the russians, a major winner of the war, had their land scorched during the war.<br><br>9/11 was so shocking to the american. The destruction was only equivalent to 3 direct hits by conventional bombs, not nuclear, one each on the twin towers and one on the pentagon, but the impact has proven to be far more devastating, because it was american cities kenna hit for the first time. It changed the american way of life.<br><br>If war becomes unavoidable, never fight it on your own land, fight it on your enemy's land.</div></blockquote>In Falklands the Argentines surrendered officially, I think, all further claims to the Malvinas (Falklands). It also caused the president of Argentina to be toppled. The whole nation suffered humiliation and defeat. In terms of material damage andd casualty figures, Argentine losses were still much higher. Its air force was defeated by RAF carrier borne Harriers, its navy was soundly beaten with the sinking of their flagship the Belgrano and sever loss of lives onboard. And then, the infantry troopers - mostly conscripts - often surrendered or fled in the face of British assaults.<br><br>I think you can safely say the Argentines lost the war BIGTIME.<br><br>WW2 did reach the shores on America - remember Pearl Harbour? Yes, America did win big as the war kick-started her stagnant economy to make her once more the industrial giant of the Western world.<br><br>In WW2 the Russians did win big. Destruction of Russian land and cities meant nothing as they are capable of rebuilding as quickly as you can destroy. The Russians won WW2 BIGTIME cause they swallowed up the whole of Eastern Europe after the war which they continued robbing and exploiting for more than 4 decades.<br><br>Britain was one of the winners who fared the worst among the WW2 victors. Britain was nearly broke after WW2, and she didn't make any new territorial gains either. In fact, the British Empire crumbled thanks to WW2. Being so weak, Britain eventually lost her hold on all her possessions of in Asia with the exception of HK.<br><br>And now with HK gone, Britain is a country once again, no longer an Empire.</div>

They featured quite a few Chinese weapons, eg, the Chinese bullpup u all were refering to.<br><br>In the game it was called the Type-95, i think according to guns.ru, its actually the QBZ-95.  Their local version apparently uses a 5.8mm round, agains the 5.56 NATO.  They claim it to be better... *shrugs*.  I thot that rifle kicked ass in the game... felt like it had loads more punching power than the M-16 or M-8.</div>
