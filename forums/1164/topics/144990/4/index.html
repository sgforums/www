The transfer of missile and rocket technology was announced in Jakarta by Indonesian defence minister Juwono Sudarsono on 5 August 2005, but forms part of the technology co-operation agreements signed between China and Indonesia in April.<br><br>This announcement followed the statement on 28 July by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono that one of the major purposes of his recent trip to China had been to increase co-operation in defence technology, especially missiles and rockets.<br><br>Indonesia had announced the firing of nine indigenous rockets, built by its National Aeronautics and Space Agency (LAPAN), in west Java on 1 June 2005. These firings may have been related to the earlier statement that the Indonesia Navy would develop its own rockets and missiles in co-operation with LAPAN.<br><br></blockquote>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The present China as a unified country is of our best interest. Sg has accumlated billions dollars of investment into China for the past 2 decades. Any political fallout or disintegration of the centralised chinese gov, will surely lead to unrest in Asia.<br><br>As a matter of fact, China is a big country that consists of at least 50+ dialect groups. The chinese muslim has a sizable population in the country. In addition, they control the region that housed most of the Chinese nuclear research facility (there are also may plutomium mine in the region as well). Any collapsed of the central chinese gov will result in a rise of another nuclear armed islamic republic in the central asia. Given the geopolitical conditions, there are plenty of oil wells in the central asia, racial hamony is NOT a commodity in this region. The developement will be grave for India and Russia as well. Thus, it is not in the best option for India and Russia to see another Islamic republic to be born next to their common borders.<br><br>Jap and Korea will have to face the outbreak of the social-economical unrest if the central chinese gov break apart. There would be hardliners in these breakaway statelets looking at how to exploit the new-found freedom of projecting the nuclear power to the entire Asia Pacific region. Jap might be hiding under the Missile Shield, but that does not give any warranty against the threat of nulcear terrorism on jap mainland. In addition, due to the close proximity of China and Jap, the missile shield response time might not be adequate to provide cover over the entire Jap. Most frightening of all, Chinese refugees would flood the entire Asia Pacific regions and create soical unrest. The global supply chain of the MNCs would be disrupted. Commodities, fuel and food price in the world will skyrocketed due to political uncertainities.<br><br>I certainly do not wish to live in that type of future. Only mad man would want this scenrio to become reality.<br><br></div>

Japan's atrocities committed during WW2 is wider than China. It also includes civilians in Korea, SE Asia and many Allied POWs.<br><br>China is wrong to teach their children to hate Japan. But that doesn't give Japan the right to whitewash &amp; glorify their war histories. I don't expect much from Chinese govt in admitting their own wrong doings and this is up to the Chinese people to confront their govt.<br><br>But Japan as a democratic country shuld do better than that. They have the responsiblities to teach their future generation what worng they have committed in the past.<br><br>Japan's public schools don't have the freedom to choose. They got to use MOE approved's books which distort WW2 history. The Japanese govt had successfully raised a new generation of Japanese who are ignorant of their ugly past. They believed that Rape of Nanking was fabricated by the Chinese govt. But they are not aware that there is a long list of atrocities committed by their grandfathers 60 years ago.<br></div>

I visited bookstores in guangzhou, beijing, shanghai and Wuxi, history textbooks only highlight the role of ccp in PRC, under modern chinese history. I have not come across ONE single book that glorify the communist party "anything and everything under the sun", not even the Party newspaper, which i happened to read once.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sid_Vicious:</div><div class="quote_body">Distorted facts<br>It say that it is the country that beat Japan in WW2, there is no reference of the real victor which is America. </div></blockquote> The real victor of world war two are the communist, very sad to say. Half of europe came under communist after ww2 together with china mainland and half of korea c. and of course the countries that became independent since. America only conquered japan.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sid_Vicious:</div><div class="quote_body">It did not say anything about the cultural revolution where more than 20 million Chinese died under the leadership of chairman Mao. </div></blockquote> 20 million?? where did you get that figure? pls share the source. there is no china official death toll but generally recognised death toll is estimated between 2 - 7 million, compared to 13 million chinese death during the war with japan.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sid_Vicious:</div><div class="quote_body">Since young, the children in china has been taught to hate in Japan.

China has been supporting Jap in Han and Tang Dynasties era, then Jap turned aginst China in Song and Ming Dynasties. Later, Jap even want to makan the whole china in late Qing dynasty and WW2.<br><br>US should realized that Jap has been turning against US in the dawn of the WW2 and started the pearl harbour.
