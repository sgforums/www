But surprisingly what you said is remarkably true. I've lived in Shanghai for over 4 years.<br><br>But actually, city boys from Beijing and Shanghai are NOT drafted into the PLA at all, though they can volunteer. Or they may be drafted because they have s degree in some area the PLA needs like medicine or engineering. The other thing is that not EVERY country boy get drafted. Therefore those who wants to make sure their sons get in or get into a cushy job would resort to bribing.<br><br>It is true that many country parents feel that the PLA will be a good place for their sons to learn some discipline, grow up to be a man, and secure a better future.<br><br>One of my company's driver was a driver in the army.
