            <div class='col-md body'>Try firing holding onto the the darn M203 if you complain the carbine is loose.  On the usual M16 I usually get about 38 out of 40.  With the darn M203 on, I'm lucky if I get 30 out of 40.<br><br>I think scopes can work - an M16 with the sharpshooter scope can make a good shooter into a darn accurate one.<br><br>But if you bobo shooter... I think not much help unless someone sit down with you and correct everything lah.  And that is if you can actually be bothered.<br><br>I hear a lot of regulars complain the SAR is just too inaccurate and to give them an M16 any day.  But it's no surprise, after taking the SAR on SOC, field training and who knows what other knocks, the alignment on the scope will definitely shift.<br><br>Anyone know if ST Kinetics is doing anything to improve the situation?  And I don't mean just tightening the fastenings on the SAR.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think SAR21 zeroing is quite different from M16. In SAR21, the rifle is almost 1 piece concept. The Mounting sight and barrel alignment are calibrated and welded in the factory; so no movable parts and not prone to misalignment due to mechanical shock (eg dropping of rifle and firing). But SAR21 would need to calibrate the eyepiece, so that the firer can adopt to the rifle firing position.</div>

How is the zeroing different between the SAR21 and M16. If you want the M16 to be factory zeroed, it can be done. It is no big deal.<br><br>The mounting sight has movable parts. It is calibrated via a chart at 10 metres distance in the factory. If subject to enough mechanical shock, i.e., abuse, anything will misalign and move, even if it has no movable parts.<br><br>And the last line is pointless. What are you trying to say?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Safety ah.. im not sure.  Cos on the surface, the SAR-21 is a good rifle.  In fact, its one of the safer rifles around, since there is an extra kevlar plate that protects from chamber explosions.<br><br>Its easy to fire, easy to aim.  My gripe is that its HEAVY. Haha.</div>
