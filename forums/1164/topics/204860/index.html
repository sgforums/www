Each of Syrian teams consisted of between four and six men, armed with some of the best Western and Soviet anti-tank weapons of the time, including RPG-7s, RPG-18s (disposable 64 mm antitank rocket launcher), AT-4 Spigot ATGMs (only early-production 9P135 units), and MILAN ATGMs from France. Usually there were two shooters and two loaders in each team. Every six-man team had two additional members equipped with SA-7 MANPADS. Syrian anti-tank troops were older, more experienced soldiers of the SA, showing strong military skills and determination, and were later described by the Israelis as having a very professional attitude towards their mission. They operated with predilection in urban areas, where narrow streets of Lebanese towns and villages could easily be turned into shooting galleries for Israeli tanks."<br></span><br><br>After Lebanon 1982 the Israeli concentrated on building better Merkavas and heavily armoured APCs like the Nagmashot etc. But it would sppear they did not alter their tactics much.</div>

SAF is going into this 3G thinge where focus is on network centric warfare (ie, Scholar generals fighting war in front of computers much like playing C&amp;C   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  ).  While on paper, it works great, with low risk stand off attack cap, good air and arti cover for ground troops.  But looking at iraq and the recent Israeli experience, you cannot win a war without effective troops on the ground.<br><br>Dun get me wrong, I'm not against high tech warfare, it make us more efficient and reduces unnecessary risk for our troops.  But my opinion is that due to our focus on technologies, our troops are not as "tough" as some lower tech (non 3G) enemies are when it comes to close quarter combat.<br><br>For me, I have seen changes on how troops are trained.  Our current training are too "Humane".. our young troops are not exposed to battle like stress.. too much safety build in training and no battle experience.<br><br>I'm old school..

Ouch.<br><br>That goes to show one thing: when it comes to a head-on battle between infantry and armour, it's usually the infantry that wins.<br><br>And don't pooh-pooh the RPG as a poor man's anti-tank weapon. The RPG-29 is especially a weapon which is not to be dismissed. From the Wikipedia article on the weapon:<br><br><blockquote>The warhead is extremely powerful, and in tests conducted against T-80 and T-90 tanks it penetrated the tanks over their frontal arcs. If these reports are true about frontal penetration, the Russian HEAT (shape charge) weapons engineers have made an astonishing advance as a 105mm warhead is considered inadequate. The French with their ERYX short range antitank weapon stated that a HEAT warhead had to be at least 135mm in diameter to defeat the newer Russian main battle tanks frontally. Its average cost on the weapons market is around 500 US dollars per launcher and 300 US dollars per rocket.</blockquote>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG-29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPG-29</a><br><br>A dirt-cheap RPG-29 costing US$800 for a launcher and rocket is able to take out a T-90. So it's really not too much of a leap to presume that it can defeat a Merkava.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, I have yet to see the Israelis field a so called "Hi-tech" army in Lebanon. Their troops look conventionally equipped, no "3-g" systems etc.  Just some basic innovations like "Mushroom camouflage nets." Even the Israeli armored vehicles have not fielded the much "anticipated" TROPHY anti-missile/rpg system.<br><br>So far, on the surface, it looks like a conventional mechanised infantry + armored force with superior air-support.  Perhaps the most interesting weapon fielded so far is the FAE-mine-clearing thingy.</div>

Merkava III and IV tanks are considered among the most powerful in the world and have a reputation for extremely resistant armor and protective systems.<br><br>Merkavas boast 1,200 horsepower and are equipped with state-of-the-art electronic systems that should make them some of the safest and most mobile tanks in the world.<br><br>But IsraelÂ’s tanks, crucial for any ground operation in southern Lebanon, have proved vulnerable to the attacks of Hizbollah and ill-adapted to the hilly and heavily wooded terrain.<br><br>Israeli military officials have also admitted surprise at the level of resistance they are meeting from Hizbollah fighters, who are well-trained and have been firing at tanks from very close range.<br><br>The bulk of the Shiite militiaÂ’s anti-weapons are Russian-made models, although some were manufactured in Iran, said expert Yiftah Shapir from the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.<br><br>Â”The most efficient missiles are the Metis-M and the Kornet manufactured by Russia and delivered to Syria in the nineties,Â” he told AFP.<br><br>Â”They are very lethal because they have been designed to penetrate active armor on modern tanks such as those the Israelis were the first to introduce in the early eighties,Â” Shapir said.<br><br>Hizbollah also has the latest Sagger missile, a Russian weapon manufactured in Iran, as well as the Russian Spigot, the expert said.<br>These missiles have the ability to pierce armor as thick as one meter (39 inches) and have a range of 1.5 to five kilometers (one to three miles).<br>Â”The Israeli army knew that Hizbollah had a large arsenal of missiles, but maybe they didnÂ’t know they had the Metis-M and the Kornet,Â” Shapir added.<br><br>Yediot Aharonot quoted a senior military official as saying the armyÂ’s lack of preparedness for the threat of anti-tank missiles Â“is a bigger failure than that which preceded the Yom Kippur War.Â”<br><br>The Israeli army has dramatically underestimated EgyptÂ’s ground forces ahead of the 1973 Arab-Israeli conflict.<br><br>Â”The problem isnÂ’t technical,Â” said Shapir. Â“They will always end up finding the answer to the new generation of missiles just like they did in the past.Â”<br><br>Â”The most important thing is that the Israeli army finally understand that they are not up against a gang of terrorists but a real army.Â” <a href="http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/Anti-Tank_Weapons_Inflict_Heavy_Losses_on_Israeli_Army.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.defencetalk.com/news/publish/Anti-Tank_Weapons_Inflict_Heavy_Losses_on_Israeli_Army.php</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What kind of tanks were hit? There are many variants of Merkavas. There are also Sabras. The Israelis do not have the money to 'up-armour' every single Merkava; from the old Merkava 1 onwards. If thier intention was to smash the Hizbollah para-military units, I reckon they would reserve the majority of thier better tanks for a possible wider conflict with, say, Syria or even Iran...they have thousands for heaven`s sake. There are some meant to be cannon fodder anyhow.</div>
