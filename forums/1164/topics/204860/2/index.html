Various intelligence sources have told Jane's that the group which sparked a major crisis when it captured two Israeli soldiers on 12 July is deeply committed to developing its intelligence, as it believes that accurate information is an essential prerequisite for both military and political success.<br><br>Domestic intelligence<br><br>Hizbullah probably has the most effective intelligence apparatus in Lebanon. A Western intelligence official based in Beirut who asked not to be named told Jane's: "Hizbullah intelligence is strongly active in Lebanon and has infiltrated all the Lebanese factions and groups... if these factions decided to challenge them [Hizbullah], it would be a very difficult job." A senior commander with Jordan's General Intelligence Department confirmed the official's claims and added that Hizbullah's intelligence on the various Lebanese factions was better than Israel's.<br><br>The group has a 'preventative intelligence' department tasked with enforcing organisational security. This includes ensuring that members rarely use communications technology that can be monitored by Israel. It is rumoured that Hizbullah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has not used a telephone since he became the group's leader in 1992. Operational units are also said to have been restructured in recent years to increase the compartmentalisation of the organisation and minimise the risk of infiltration.<br><br>213 of 1,464 words<br>Â© 2006 Jane's Information Group<br><br><strong>2.Israel shoots down Hizbullah UAV<br>09 August 2006<br><br>[b]By Alon Ben-David JDW Correspondent<br>Israeli-Lebanese Border</strong><br><br>The Israel Air Force (IAF) intercepted an Iranian-made Ababil unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launched by the Islamic Resistance - the armed wing of the Lebanese Shi'ite Party of God (Hizbullah) - off the northern Israeli coastline on 7 August.<br><br>"The UAV was flying south, towards central Israel," Brigadier General Yohanan Locker, IAF Head of Air Operations, told Jane's.<br><br>"I can't say for sure whether it was armed with explosives, but I believe it wasn't."<br><br>The Ababil has a maximum operational radius of 150 km, a maximum ceiling of 14,000 ft (4,268 m), the ability to travel at a maximum speed of 300 km/h and is capable of carrying a 45 kg payload. It has a surveillance configuration, carrying a camera and digital communications equipment, but also an attack configuration, carrying a high-explosive warhead that would be delivered by the UAV crashing onto a target.<br><br>144 of 359 words<br>Â© 2006 Jane's Information Group<br><strong>3.Iran answers Hizbullah call for SAM systems<br>7 August 2006<br><br></strong>By Robin Hughes JDW Deputy Editor<br>London Additional reporting by Alon Ben-David JDW Staff Reporter<br>Israeli-Lebanese border<br><br>Iran is to supply the Islamic Resistance - the armed wing of the Lebanese Shi'ite Party of God (Hizbullah) - with a quantity of surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems over the coming months, Western diplomatic sources have confirmed to Jane's.<br><br>According to the sources, Tehran will supply Hizbullah with Russian-produced SAMs, including the Strela-2/2M (SA-7 'Grail'), Strela-3 (SA-14 'Gremlin') and Igla-1E (SA-16 'Gimlet') man-portable SAM systems.<br><br>Iran is also understood to have agreed to deliver its own version of the Chinese QW-1 man-portable low- to very-low-altitude SAM system - the Mithaq-1- developed by the Iranian Defence Ministry's Shahid Kazemi Industrial Complex in Tehran.<br><br>Iran launched a mass production line for an advanced variant, the Mithaq-2 - believed to be a short-range passive infra-red SAM - on 6 February.

            <div class='col-md body'>There are many differences with the American and Israeli armour battles, for one thing the Isrealis fought a more static, slower moving and hampered form of combat that gave their opponents time to scatter and regroup and hence gather enough chances to plink at them. This is not to mention they never managed to cut off the supply of weapons on their opponents side.<br><br>I don't think this was because the Isrealis were incompetent (despite what we might like to believe), but because they were heavily hampered by an ineffective policy and rescrictions on fighting to begin with.<br><br>In 2003 however, the Americans effectively overwhelmed the Iraqis with highly mobile warfare. The Iraqis didn't have much chance to put up much of an anti-armour defence in the war. Many of the Iraqis anti-tankers who tried to get off a shot at the Americans were hunted down and killed in short order and they usually didn't get a chance to fight another day. In fact it was only after the pace of combat did slow down and the war shift from battle to occupation did the Americans start to lose more tanks to attacks.<br><br>The Israelis certainly didn't do much of that in here. Armour is most effective and dangerous when it is fighting a mobile battle, pounding the enemy with extreme firepower from the most protected frontal arc while advancing to overrun them with armoured infantry.<br><br>Armour starts to suffer when the battle is static or advances at a snails pace, which what what happened here. Worse the Israelis were fighting exactly the kind of limited war that hampered their style and negated a lot of their firepower advantage.<br><br>I don't think they were ineffective against their targets- if anything I suspected they did a lot of damage that simply could not be verified as the reporting for the other side is a lot more lax and 'flexible'. Not to mention it's hard to tell if a person that died was a civillian or combatant when the person that shoots back is impossible to tell from the innocents.<br><br>I wonder, if the Israelis had attacked with more speed and far more conviction, with less heed to civillian losses... the whole result might be different.</div>

Among the many aspects to be investigated is the vulnerability of Israel's powerful armored corps to small, hand-held, wire-guided anti-tank weapons. Indeed, Hezbollah's innovative use of anti-tank missiles was the cause of most Israeli casualties and has given the small but powerful weapons a new importance in battlefield tactics.<br><br>In a recent statement, Hezbollah's armed wing, al-Moqawama al-Islamia (Islamic Resistance), described Israel's main battle-tank as "a toy for the rockets of the resistance" (al-Manar TV, August 11). Hezbollah's anti-tank weapons consist of a variety of wire-guided missiles (usually of Russian design and manufactured and/or supplied by Iran and Syria) and rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs). The missiles include the European-made Milan, the Russian-designed Metis-M, Sagger AT-3, Spigot AT-4 and the Russian-made Kornet AT-14. The latter is a Syrian supplied missile capable of targeting low-flying helicopters. Iraqi Fedayeen irregulars used the Kornet against U.S. forces in 2003. The most portable versions of these weapons are carried in a fiberglass case with a launching rail attached to the lid.<br><br>On July 30, the Israeli army published photos of various anti-tank missiles they claim to have found in a Hezbollah bunker (see: http://www.hnn.co.il/index.php?modul...sk=view;id=967). The weapons include Saggers and TOW missiles. The TOW (Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wire-guided) missile is a formidable weapon first produced by the United States in the 1970s. These missiles were of interest as their packing crates were marked 2001, suggesting that these were relatively new additions to Hezbollah's arsenal and not part of the shipment of TOW missiles from Israel to Iran that was part of the Iran-Contra scandal of 1986 (the shelf-life of the TOW is roughly 20 years). On August 6, Israeli Major-General Benny Gantz showed film of BGM-71 TOW and Sagger AT-3 missiles he reported were captured at one of Hezbollah's field headquarters (Haaretz, August 6).<br><br>The primary target of Hezbollah's battlefield missiles is the Israeli-made Merkava tank. The Merkava was designed for the maximum protection of its crews, with heavy armor and a rear escape hatch. The emphasis on crew survival is not simply a humanitarian gesture; the small country of Israel cannot provide an endless number of trained, combat-ready tank crews if casualties begin to mount. The tank is also designed to be easily and quickly repaired, a specialty of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The modular armor plating can be easily replaced if damaged, or replaced entirely with upgraded materials when available. The first generation of Merkavas was built in the 1970s and was soon deployed in Lebanon in 1982. The much-improved Merkava Mk 4 has been Israel's main battle-tank since its introduction in 2004.<br><br>Current battlefield reports suggest that Hezbollah fighters are well-trained in aiming at the Merkava's most vulnerable points, resulting in as many as one-quarter of their missiles successfully piercing the armor (Yediot Aharonot, August 10). Hezbollah attacks on Merkava tanks during the November 2005 raid on the border town of Ghajar were videotaped and closely examined to find points where the armor was susceptible to missile attack. While some of their missiles have impressive ranges (up to three kilometers), the guerrillas prefer to fire from close range to maximize their chances of hitting weak points on the Merkava. Operating in two- or three-man teams, the insurgents typically try to gain the high ground in the hilly terrain before selecting targets, using well-concealed missile stockpiles that allow them to operate behind Israeli lines (Jerusalem Post, August 3).<br><br>Without artillery, Hezbollah has adapted its use of anti-tank missiles for mobile fire support against Israeli troops taking cover in buildings. There are numerous reports of such use, the most devastating being on August 9, when an anti-tank missile collapsed an entire building, claiming the lives of nine Israeli reservists (Y-net, August 10). Four soldiers from Israel's Egoz (an elite reconnaissance unit) were killed in a Bint Jbail house when it was struck by a Sagger missile (Haaretz, August 6). TOW missiles were used effectively in 2000 against IDF outposts in south Lebanon before the Israeli withdrawal. There are also recent instances of anti-tank weapons being used against Israeli infantry in the field, a costly means of warfare but one that meets two important Hezbollah criteria: the creation of Israeli casualties and the preservation of highly-outnumbered Hezbollah guerrillas who can fire the weapons from a relatively safe distance.<br><br>It was suggested that the IDF helicopter brought down by Hezbollah fire on August 12 was hit by an anti-tank missile. Hezbollah claimed to have used a new missile called the Wa'ad (Promise), although the organization occasionally renames existing missiles (Jerusalem Post, August 12). At least one of Israel's ubiquitous armored bulldozers has also fallen prey to Hezbollah's missiles.<br><br>The Syrian-made RPG-29 was previously used with some success against Israeli tanks in Gaza. Hezbollah also uses this weapon, with a dual-warhead that allows it to penetrate armor. On August 6, the Israeli press reported that IDF intelligence sources claimed that an improved Russian-made version of the RPG-29 was being sold to Syria before transfer to the Islamic Resistance (Haaretz, August 6). In response, Russia's Foreign Ministry denied any involvement in supplying anti-tank weapons to Hezbollah (RIA Novosti, August 10). The IDF reports that anti-tank missiles and rockets continue to cross the border into Lebanon from Syria, despite the destruction of roads and bridges in the area (Haaretz, August 13).<br><br>The Merkava tank has assumed an important role as a symbol of Israeli military might. Their destruction in combat has an important symbolic value for Hezbollah. Hezbollah's tactical innovations and reliance on anti-tank missiles over more traditional infantry weapons will undoubtedly prompt serious introspection on the part of the IDF in anticipation of renewed conflict along the border. </blockquote></div>

I can't say the Trophy was there since where the sensors would have been mounted seems deliberately photoshopped and smudged away. Save the picture and open it with any imaging software, even windows viewer.  Zoom in and u will know what i mean but it was smudged.<br><br>It is possible that they have fitted some tanks with TROPHY in secret.  If the results were less than satisfying, they probably won't want others to know that.<br><br>The shower of sparks there looks like what the TROPHY would have done to an incoming missile, causing the missile to explode far away from the tank.<br><br>IMO, highly likely that it was the TROPHY.  But cannot confirm since the image has been edited at locations the "bulge" sensors would have been.</div>
