Among the many aspects to be investigated is the vulnerability of Israel's powerful armored corps to small, hand-held, wire-guided anti-tank weapons. Indeed, Hezbollah's innovative use of anti-tank missiles was the cause of most Israeli casualties and has given the small but powerful weapons a new importance in battlefield tactics.<br><br>In a recent statement, Hezbollah's armed wing, al-Moqawama al-Islamia (Islamic Resistance), described Israel's main battle-tank as "a toy for the rockets of the resistance" (al-Manar TV, August 11). Hezbollah's anti-tank weapons consist of a variety of wire-guided missiles (usually of Russian design and manufactured and/or supplied by Iran and Syria) and rocket-propelled grenade launchers (RPGs). The missiles include the European-made Milan, the <strong>Russian-designed Metis-M</strong>, Sagger AT-3, Spigot AT-4 and the Russian-made Kornet AT-14. The latter is a Syrian supplied missile capable of targeting low-flying helicopters. Iraqi Fedayeen irregulars used the Kornet against U.S. forces in 2003. The most portable versions of these weapons are carried in a fiberglass case with a launching rail attached to the lid.<br></blockquote> Errrrr.......Source is Andrew McGregor.....I tink u better read the article u quoted....AT-13 Metis-M same as Metis-M...Penetration somesay 950mm some 1000mm...Too many articles so its in between 900-1000mm...Tandem shaped charge warhead/Range 2000m. Wire-guided sys uses semi-auto command to Line of Sight  (SACLOS) missile . Firing unit consisting of launcher, thermal sight and a single missile container weigh 29.80 kg. Its a sys similar to the European Milan...As for RPG-29 penetration about 600mm+,TOW 800mm, AT3(improved) also around 800mm, Kornet 1200mm, Milan 1000mm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No CIWS is perfect, I don't think TROPHY can catch all the missiles, but I suspect it must have saved some of tanks.<br><br>From what I read online, many of the tanks were disabled when they were plinked from the roof where the armour was the weakest. Even if the tank was not seriously damaged the crew which was not sealed in was usually injured or killed and a tank isn't much use without the crew. And yes, the Isrealis were surprised by the density of ATGM fire, they haven't thought about that in their plans.<br><br>The ATGMs were even used in antipersonnel roles, where they were fired at Isreali troops in cover during a firefight. There were some losses to this rather creative tatic, and made them think more about what cover to take.</div>

Esp. if the explosives it can mail into enemy positions is a lot bigger then 40mm grenades.<br><br>The Americans used their AFVs a lot in urban combat with infantry, with great effect as well. It's hard to get a bead on a tank with an RPG when you will get gunned down by an infantry squad, and it's hard to fight infantry when you have a tank lobbing HE and beehives as you.<br><br>And on that Merk pic, I don't think Merks are in the habit of brewing up. These are not Soviet tanks by the way and their ammunition stowage was built to prevent this kind of event by venting the blast out of the tank safely should it be set off. Unless the crew were sway enough to leave the blast doors open when the ammo was hit... which is not that likely but I don't know.<br><br>It seems more like it was destroyed by their own forces after it was deemed unrecovable.<br><br>It's either that or the militants have some really heavy hitting ATGMs... like in the weight class of being platform carried missiles.</div>

But while soldiers told stories of deadly missile attacks on tanks, OC Armored Corps Brig.-Gen. Halutsi Rudoy revealed Tuesday that <span style="color: red;">out of the almost 400 tanks that operated in Lebanon, only a few dozen were hit by antitank missiles and only 20 were actually penetrated</span>.<br><br>"The fighting was fierce and they fired hundreds and possibly thousands of missiles," he told The Jerusalem Post in his first interview since a cease-fire went into effect. "But if I compare the number of casualties in this war to the first Lebanon War in 1982 and the Yom Kippur War in 1973; then <span style="color: red;">there were thousands killed in tanks and here only 30</span>."<br><br>Rudoy said the antitank missiles soldiers confronted in Lebanon were some of the most advanced in the world. He said Hizbullah had thousands of Soviet-built Sagger, Cornet and Fagot antitank missiles, the French MILAN and the US-built TOW, all supplied by Iran and Syria. These missiles are usually fired by a two- or three-man team, the IDF has said.<br><br>But the missiles are not only used against tanks, despite their official title. Aware that in close-range combat the IDF has an advantage, Hizbullah fighters set up positions kilometers away from Israeli forces and <span style="color: red;">also used antitank missiles against infantry forces. More than 70 infantry soldiers were killed in antitank missile attacks on the homes they had commandeered in Lebanese villages and as they moved throughout the hilly terrain.</span><br><br>Rudoy said it was possible new recruits might be scared to enlist in the Armored Corps, but he believed that when they were told the real numbers and how tanks were responsible for killing dozens of Hizbullah fighters they would come and serve.<br><br>"We were at war, and in war the soldiers and the tanks at the front are the ones that get hit the most," Rudoy said. "It could have been worse, and thanks to the high professional level of the tank crews, the damage was far less than what was expected in the beginning."<br><br>Referring to the Trophy, a Rafael-developed active protection system that creates a hemispheric protected zone around armored vehicles such as the Merkava 4 tank, Rudoy said he would demand that his tanks be fitted with the defense system once it was deemed operational.<br><br>----------<br><br>Cheers,<br>Sunho<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think the problem was that the tanks could not stand up to enemy fire, by any account they did a rather good job of it given the sheer volume of stuff shot at them.<br><br>The real problem is that they are taking more fire then they ought to have taken had they changed their tatics or went in with more awareness. After all this is war and while a Merk may be tough, it is far from being unhurtable. THe danger is that people start to think of it that way and expect them to be able to hold out to all kinds of fire without really thinking of how to best avoid getting hit altogether, reduce the amount of effect fire the enemy can return, and use the strength of armoured units to best effect.<br><br>Crawling across open ground or being blinded in urban areas with little support is hardly a way to do it.

But there seems to be a death of creative thinking when it comes to strategy these days. Very unlike the spectacular successes of earlier conventional wars even when Israel was outgunned, out-numbered and even out-manuevered.<br><br>As I have posted above, what's happening now in Lebanon 2006 seems to be a repeat of 1982, twenty over years ago: Armoured columns goes into town, get whacked by enemy infantry.<br><br>High tech is great but when ground war happens, high tech will often be the first thing to go out the proverbial window. Computers crash even in my comfortable aircon office while I am trying to send a leisurely email. In a battlefield? Good luck.</div></blockquote>Regarding the IDF troops; they called up many reservist troops to fight in the conflict,but the fact is that the reservists are not as good as the reservists of the past.While the regulars and active troops have maintained their standards, the population has changed with most reservists working in office jobs, factory jobs and other white-collar,gray-collar and blue-collar work.<br><br>In the past, they worked outdoors under harsher envrironmental conditions and were probably in a better mental and physical state, often working as outdoorsmen or in farms.<br><br>This is much like how our reservists do not possess as comparable a physical condition as our active troops,though they are without a doubt better motivated and possess better mental endurance than our current generation of NSFs.</div>
