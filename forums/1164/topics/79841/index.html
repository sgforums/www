            <div class='col-md body'>The Ultimax was in service in the former Yugoslavia even before Croatia and Slovenia declared independence in 1991. I was thumbing through a issue of TIME as a 14-year-old when I came across an article about tensions in the Yugoslav state of Croatia, and they had a pic of 2 Croatian national guardsmen with and AK and an Ultimax. It was used throughout the war in the former Yugoslavia by the Croatian army and their militias, and I also saw one carried by another Croatian soldier sitting on a M-84 (Yugo built T-72) during the 1995 offensive that overran the last of Serb-held Croatia<br><br>Sidetracking a little, the Croatians also used SAR-80s and Armbrusts.

They may be rogue to some but not to others.  To be rogue to all will simply mean they are not of this world.<br><br>Go according to the concept - "if I am in charge of what I have, be it owned by someone else or not, I have the right to do whatever I want with it"  and not "I can only do what other people like or want me to do".<br><br>The key word is "sovereign".  No one, not even the world, has the right to say things that would sway the interests of individual nations.  To do so is declare absolute war on the nation.  So, any united world effort to pinpoint violations of rights by one people against another can only be fulfilled by means of all-out war to mete out the so-called "justice" absolute.<br><br>And the essence and truth behind this scheme of things is contrary to the accusing parties' pre-occupation of "rights".  The fact is very clear - only the accuser has the right of everything.  And it is with this sickeningly injustice of the generic accusers, namely the Western world and their so-called organisations - e.g. WWF, UN, NATO, IMF etc that are actually de-stabilising the world and not the other way around.<br><br></div>
