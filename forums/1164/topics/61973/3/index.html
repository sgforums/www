Think lor, the highest ranking navy officer of a ship is usually a LTC or MAJ, equivalent to our battalion CO. This whole ship will fight the enemy mah. Then this skipper will go down with the ship. In army, where got the CO so willingly go down with the men one? Maybe he retreat to the brigade HQ first  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>In a bigger Navy, the highest ranking officer of a ship is a Captain (equivalent to army colonel). The highest ranking officer at sea, usually, is a Rear Admiral? The commander of the battle group sitting in the flagship or aircraft carrier. And they all go into action lor. So their lives are comparatively more dangerous than their army counterpart officers.</div>

So the danger of a stray bullet hitting them/the arti shells hitting them is highly probable ...<br>while for a naval officere like the flag commander, if a stray missile is to be aimed for him, they probably have to go thru first the aegis cruiser and then the carrier anti air weapons ... so effectively the probablility of the carrier getting a hit is almost zero.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not agree with the criticisms of officers who stay behind away from the frontline. I use to harbour these criticisms myself but i learnt that these are unhealthy criticisms that do no good except to disavow the trust and capabilities of the senior officers.<br><br>In any conflict scenario, there must be people with brains who must devise strategies that will outwit the enemies and destroy them with minimum casualties on our side. Likewise, we need competent officers on the frontline who understands such orders and are able to execute these orders by leading his men and risking his own life in the process. We cannot have everyone running up and getting shot and then declare those officers as the competent and brave one. Officers' responsibilities are towards his men and it's his job to make sure that each of them walks out of the battlefield alive.<br><br>Just because the people at the back do not risk their lives does not mean that they do not put in effort to ensure that their friends who are fighting do not lose their lives too. Of course not all officers are good but I feel that the best officers are those who understands that on the frontline, all soldiers are men of flesh and blood and should be treated like brothers so that they are not afraid to walk with him into the darkest forests</div>
