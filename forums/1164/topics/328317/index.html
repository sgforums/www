              <p>Is Roy Medevev the modern day Hitler by invading Georgia claiming that it was in the benefits of the South Ossetian people cuz the Georgians were massacraing them</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rewind back to 1940s and you will find that Hitler wanted the Polish Corridor because it mainly had a Majority of Germans and on his policy of Lebensraum</p>
              <p><br>Arguing on this claim, Hitler invaded Poland, not for the Polish Corridor, but to annex the whole of Poland and Czechsoslovakia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like Hitler, Medevev wanted to test the American,British,French resolve over the Poland crisis.When it was clear the Stresa front and Britain did not care and continuation of appeasement policy, he pushed for the rearmanation of the Nazi troops. And when he sent troops into the Rhineland ,Britain did no more than send official protests. As Each outrageous thing he did such as building a navy 35% strength of the British, the British were happy and say why not, since they violated so much of the Versaillies, never mind laaah</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Hitler got braver and braver and on 1 Sept 1939 he ordered the BlitzKrieg of Poland, and dragging the whole world into WW2</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Already Russia is threathening Poland with a nuclear crisis that could spark a Nuclear war that John Titor foreseen.</p>
              <p>If Roy Medevev also  orders the Russian Troops into Tbilisi , we can expect shit to hit the fan and start digging our Graves</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and dont forget , there are several nations that are waiting to jump on the bandwagon</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember Italy and Japan, aka the Pact of Steel??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>once the spark strikes, shit hits the fan and a inferno starts</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so, no appeasement pl0x<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Its no secret that the West has always treated Moscow
              with a large dose of cynicism and the battle in South Ossetia
              is nothing more then a flexing of muscles by the Russians. The US,
              if anything, is going to exacerbate the current situation further by inking a
              pact with Poland
              to construct a missile shield defence system in the country.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the current situation is not likely to escalate into an
              outright full blown WW3, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">more likely </span>a rather subtle resumption of
              the Cold War era that sees frosty ties between Moscow
              and the West. Cue a new arms race within the region to further stoke the flames
              of unrest.</p>
              <p>In addition, one does not have to fight a war with guns and soldiers in this
              modern era, and especially so if your competitor is a super power as well. Moscow
              has vast energy reserves and can yield an influence over the global economy
              with such ease that it will cause much more collateral damage to the
              energy-intensive then what a nuclear bomb can offer.</p>

              <p>The League of Nations can't be compared to our current UN. You must know that the LoN failed because they refused to intervene using force and have no peacekeepers of their own. Plus, because of America's policy of isolation, the LoN lacked the keystone to success.</p>
              <p>But I must agree things are getting abit tensed. The missle agreement between USA and Poland really pissed Russia off. But thats the same for Russia invading Georgia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But we all know that it's not very possible for the Western countries to start a war for Georgia, most of the acts are Prima Facie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT if Russia is to act violently against Poland because of the missle agreement, it's an entirely different story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IMO, Russia's invasion of Georgia is to "test water". See how the other countries react.</p>

              <p>Russia may be rich for now, but they are not rich nor powerful enough to start WWIII.</p>
              <p>FYI, many of the former soviet republics have nuclear tech, thanks to the soviet union. and they do have nuclear material at hand to make nuclear bombs, if necessary. no country in the world is prepared for nuclear war, even russia.</p>

              <p>The League of Nations can't be compared to our current UN. You
              must know that the LoN failed because they refused to intervene
              using force and have no peacekeepers of their own. Plus, because of
              America's policy of isolation, the LoN lacked the keystone to
              success.</p>
              <p>But I must agree things are getting abit tensed. The missle
              agreement between USA and Poland really pissed Russia off. But
              thats the same for Russia invading Georgia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But we all know that it's not very possible for the Western
              countries to start a war for Georgia, most of the acts are Prima
              Facie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT if Russia is to act violently against Poland because of the
              missle agreement, it's an entirely different story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IMO, Russia's invasion of Georgia is to "test water". See how
              the other countries react.</p>

              <p>As much as the doomsayers or the western media would like the rest of the
              world to believe in, threes no doubting the possibility of an escalated
              military conflict leading to WW3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but</span> it is highly unlikely. On the other
              hand, whats more likely would be:</p>
              <p>1) Prolonged occupation of South Ossetia by Russian forces despite the
              political rhetoric by Washington.
              There will be plenty of talk but no concrete action by them. (At least nothing
              military in the context of Afghanistan
              and Iraq)</p>
              <p>2) Resumption of cold war between Russia
              and western forces.</p>
              <p>3) Another arms race.</p>
              <p>4) 2 words: Energy reserves.</p>
              <p>All I can say is good luck to President Obama / McCain. The Russian bear is
              awake and demands the respect and attention that’s long overdue and left
              wanting. With some luck, hopefully a new foreign affairs expert, in the mould
              of Henry Kissinger, would step up and defuse the tension between Washington
              and Moscow.</p>

              <p>We've come closer to midnight before, and while the possibility of a new world war is never far away, this isn't one of those times when you would start imagining of a situation. I believe the appropriate term for it is 'damn random'.</p>
              <p>True enough, Russia does have a greviance with its <em>de facto</em> predecessor's territories having been chopped up and thrown free, while it had to sit and watch them leave. They also had to endure several secessionist attempts - in their opinion, at least - successfully put them to shame, with the western bloc expressing support for all these breakaways. So far Russia has been testing the limits of the threats from the western world, who so far come nowhere close to resorting to military action. However, it seems that Russia's only interest for the near future is to simply keep its borders where the Federation believes it should belong. There is no thirst for great conquest, and Russia shows itself to be more of a 'fixing' mood. Its economy may be growing, but it's far from being robust enough to survive anything more than minor theatres of war without falling apart. In a time of rising energy prices, it is more than obvious that it has more to gain from sitting put and maximising its profits from exploiting this turn of fortunes and newfound market power. Its future military power will stand to benefit from extra spending on research and upgrades while America's slows down from having to deal with the Middle East and their economic crisis.</p>
              <p>America is no state to get involved into any more military activities. It currently has its hands full with Afghanistan and Iraq, and the political sentiment at home is overwhelming against any future military action. Furthermore, with the two presidential candidates focusing on a progressive foreign policy, it is unlikely to take that step in the future. Its economy is furthermore in shambles and in no state to endure another major conflict. With rising prices, rising unemployment, massive slowdowns, and a series of stock market crashes thus far, the government is currently too busy trying to stabilise the economy and restore it to a steady, healthy state. If anything, I believe the defense budget is likely to be cut in favour of spending elsewhere. The current suffrages demand it, and in the case of a demoncracy, it is only a matter of time before the government gives in to their interests of dealing with the situation at home before going abroad.</p>
              <p>Europe is far too divided to act decisively as a single bloc, so we should not expect unified action. However, EU, or even NATO for that matter, do seem to agree on not intervening on the situation thus far, and have been actively looking for diplomatic solutions without any sabre-rattling. It has been clear so far that while Europe does heavily worry about Russia's rise to power, they know their sovereignty is not what is at stake as yet. What they do fear, however, is the amount of influence Russia will be able to wield as it gains in stature and presence. It may be able to greatly hinder their own political and economic strength, but not so to the point of destruction.</p>
              <p>China? Even more unlikely. It has come out from the 2008 Olympics with a new, clean image that it has no interest in tarnishing. It furthermore has stable political relations all round, even with both Koreas and Japan, and it is poised to further its economic reach rather than engage in any military conflict. Granted, of course, it is perfectly capable of doing so, but why choose expand, when there is so much of your own resources you have yet to exploit?</p>

              <p>Indeed my sentiments exactly, Ariedartin.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless however, the West ought to be wary for not forcing Russia's hand too much in this issue. Diplomacy would always be the better part of valor in this growing tension and hopefully the spark can be defused without it setting off a domino chain of unstoppable events.</p>
