And they are moving nowhere near top speed...<br><br>Given the choice, any smart person would take a track in an urban seneriao, you're a lot harder to take out. Sure you can run with a wheel, but you can never run fast enough to dodge bullets and rpgs might as well use a system that's almost as fast and can support the protection to stand up to these threats as well... LAVs just open up like a tin can whenever they are hit, it's mobility is hardly advantageous at all... assuming they dun flip themselves first from their high cg when trying to run away.</div>

The thing is, the amount of maintainence for tracks remains more or less little changed when the use increases, if a wheel gets put into actual field use (could be even driving extended preriods at speed), their reliability drops dramatically. US Marines found that out the hard way when they had to change the wheels of their LAVs once every two weeks in the field while a tracked Gavin treads could survive 2 months under the same conditions with little maintaince, though you officer would probably be after your butt by that time.<br><br>The idea of wheels being more combat survivable then tracks becos they can limp away after their running gear get  shot is pretty moot. After all, the unit is only useful when it is combat effective, so what if they can limp back after missing two tires and running on flats when their LAV suspension, superstructure and such is all screwed up by that abuse and the unit will not be ready till dunno when. In comparism, a Bradely, Abrams or even a Gavin will be back in the field quite quickly following such damage.</div>

What happen, cancelled? I've seen the Terrex and been inside. It has far more internal volume and space than the V200s. The sitting arrangement is also more comfortable. One has to be really carefull when closing the hatches on the V200. One slip and there goes your fingers. On the other hand, the Terrex has a large ramp like the M113 for easier access.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, the wheels aren't THAT vulnerable to small arms.  Really.  If you cut open those wheels for these wheeled APCs, you will realise why.  With 4 wheels, perhaps the vehicle will be pretty badly hurt if one wheel gets COMPLETELY Shredded.  Yes, thats what you have to do to disable those wheels.  In the case of the Terrex, u have 8 wheels!! They really aren't the regular kind of wheels that we have on every day vehicles.  How many really well place shots can you place on quick wheeling vehicles like a Terrex or LAV?<br><br>Sure, explosives will shred those things fine.  But they will damage the tracks of a tracked vehicle too.  So the question now is, WHICH is easier to replace?  Does one really want to spend so much time to fix an armored transport?  A units like an IFV should always be tracked, cos they are more likely to face heavy fire.  Armored transports, should be wheeled because you want to minimise the amount of time making these vehicles serviceable.<br><br>As for the US ARMY's light brigade, well.  Logistics will be easier  on them.  A brigade with a loose logistic chain would be more flexible and manueverable.  However, due to their LIGHT nature, they are not able to do the usual, "Few company of Abrams, up the middle." Tactics but rather focus on rapid manuevering and avoiding fronts. Therefore, they actually use up that logistic chain pretty quick too.  Then, they will be vulnerable again.<br><br>Its a very pro vs cons now.</div>
