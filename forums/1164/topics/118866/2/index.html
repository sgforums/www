Until now, the arms inspectors can't even find a single one and have decided to call off the search.</div></blockquote>Even before the current war most people in the world of the shadows knows that the CIA sucks.  And no one has a better view of how sucks they're then a disbanded SEAL team as a result of very bad intel from CIA on the strength of Panama's military presences at a targeted airport.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So I don't think Monkey was claiming CIA is good on the assumption that they already know where OBL is.  Rather he is only pointing out the possibility that the CIA already knows where OBL is, then again, the CIA might just get its info from MI-6 again.  In any case, the CIA is not the only source of intel that the U.S military relies on, it has its own intel-hunting groups watching OBL.  But probably political or some other reason, the green light isn't given for the take-out order.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Kalam's office denies this.<br><br>Singh insists he met Kalam, although some Indian newspapers say the meeting was cancelled as he waited to go in.<br><br>"It was really inspiring," Singh told Reuters by phone. "And let me tell you, he saw my certificate and praised me for the achievement, while you all are asking all kinds of questions and trying to dub me as a fraud."<br><br>The certificate, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, declared "You are the member of NASA" (sic) and is signed by Singh and "Chief of NASA, Cin K. Kif" -- NASA's former administrator was Sean O'Keefe. It also lists the name of Singh's father, common practice in Indian documents.<br><br>Singh says he flew to London on Indian Airlines -- which does not fly to the city -- and took a taxi to Oxford University and back every day for the exam from January 4-8, a round trip of about 230 km (140 miles).<br><br>Singh told Reuters he stayed in a hotel, but told a Hindi language newspaper he stayed at Buckingham Palace.<br><br>The Indian school where he says he sat the preliminary exam along with 200,000 others does not exist. The Bansal institute, where he says he studied mathematics, has never heard of him.<br><br>Singh cannot produce his passport to back his claim. That, he says, is with institute director P.K. Bansal.<br><br>"How can we possess his passport when we don't even know him?" Saturday's The Indian Express quoted Bansal saying.</blockquote>Actually all countries also have this similar fraud,nothing special but what this fraud stands out from other is 'IT MANAGE TO FOOL THE PRESIDENT AND MP OF WHOLE INDIA'.     LOL!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>This incident clearly show India desperate for international recognition and reporter will rush to publish any international achievement by India without proper authentication.<br></div>
