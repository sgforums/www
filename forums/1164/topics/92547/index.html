            <div class='col-md body'>Something small and stealthy to complement the Deltas and to replace our ageing Sea Wolf-class MGBs. Personally I like the Skjold and Visby... Been stealthy and small, they are able to hide in the numerous radar clutter that exists in busy straits... Furthermore, they do not require a large crew to maintain, which would certainly be beneficial to the RSN. While I do like the Arleigh Burgh and the Kongo class destroyers, I feel that they are not suited for use by Singapore, even their best weapon, their impressive anti-air coverage is more of a hindrance rather than help for it is likely to send a missile boosting into the extremely crowded aerial traffic that Singapore and its surrounding waters see a day...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I don't recommend Aegis destroyers although they are the most powerful surface warships in the world ( with SM-2 long range SAMs, and Harpoons, and Tomahawks.) </blockquote>Aegis is a combat system, it is not a destroyer or a frigate. The combat system consist of a command and decision computer with high processing capability and of course the phrased array AN/SPY1 radar.<br><br>A number of ships are equipped with the Aegis combat system that include the Arleigh Burke(s), Ticon-class Cruiser, Spain's F-100 Frigate. The system will be equipped in future ships such as the DDX and the Australian future combatant.<br><br>Thus it is not true that all Aegis equipped ships are armed with SM-2 Long ranged SAM and Tomahawks. For example, i do not see either of these weapon in the Nansen Frigate.<br><br><blockquote>I recommend DD-42 destroyers from UK .<br><br>( Can carry fair share of naval arsenals and 2 naval helos.)</blockquote>Actually, i do not see why do we need a larger ships such as a destroyer in which we can carry more weapons and naval helo.<br><br>In future naval warfare, certain roles of naval helo will be eroded by VTOL UAVs and UCAVs which can be as efficient as it's predecessor. In the context of Singapore where we dont have alot of manpower, i predict that the navy will go for more UAVs onced it is mature than to go for more helos. In my perspective, a frigate equipped with one naval helo, 2 VTOL UAV/UCAV and 1 Unmanned PV is enough.<br><br>I see that our current Delta Class is enough for our consumption currently and also for the future (maybe 30s years from now). If the strategic environment will to change then i will like to see a Delta with more punch, perhaps equipped with the A70 launcher which is capable of accomodating with Aster15/30 and Stormshadow cruisemissiles. Looking at the superstructure of the ship, the middle section which currently house the Harpoon certainly have space of 2 more quartart cells, i dunno would the RSN want to fill that up, but certainly it can be filled by with wire-guided anti-ship missiles while the current harpoon is replace by new generation ram-jet missiles. I believe that will be enough to accomodate any threat that will evolve in 15 years to 30 years time.<br><br>I believe the next class of ship to be replace will be our Challenger Class Submarines and the Patrol Vessels. For the case of the submarines, i will say it wont be replaced so soon, but it will be supplemented by new class of submarines in 10 years time and gradually then be replaced. The RSN show interest in the Viking and perhaps we should be looking forward to that.<br><br>Many of my friends from this forum as well as others, would want the MCV to go, however i do not see a need for it. The MCV can still provide a hell lot of letal punch and it certainly still have lots of value in littoral warfare up to 15 years time. By examining the Indonesian and Malaysian modernisation plan, the MCV still have it's place in the RSN.<br><br>I do see a need for the PV to be replace in perhaps 10 years time. I do not see that Visby as a good candidate because by that time, the Visby itself would be an old model already. Perhaps the PV will be replace by a new stealth class of PVs designed by STmarines. Their current design include a 21m Stealth Interceptor and a 81m Stealth patrol vessel, for which i find that the former is too small while the latter is too big. If im the head of STmarine, i will try to come out with a blueprint of a PV in-between the two current design to see the reaction of the navy. If the design is good, i do see that in the long run, the MCV might be replaced by it too.</div>

refering to , the commandos fast insertion craft together with the mini boats together..<br><br>If your saying that the mini boat is vulnerable, wouldn't the fast insertion craft be more vulnerable?<br><br>And re:Shore artilery , im saying that the craft is meant to deploy FAST before any enemy got time to react..<br><br>Furthermore , a shore artilery takes time to aim and reload and u wanna hit a super fast moving craft at sea which is also at the same time firing bullets at you?<br><br>The concept ive mentioned about is a new style in which u eject the naval crewmen into the water..through the opening of a gap..<br>rather then to inflate a lifeboat slowly and jump inside when a 1 mach missile is heading towards u..<br><br>Yup and regarding the engine , we can always use fuel-saving stuff and noiseless stuff.. , regarding thie engine..don't think we will be deploying over 200km.. so i think it would be more deployed for speed ..<br><br>you mentioned about the small boat returning back to base,<br>Who the heck cares about the small boat after it has done it's mission??<br>Regarding returning to base , it will be a concept whereby when it has done finished it's mission and a rapid insersion naval force by the 4 LSTs, will berth inside the LST and re-fuel offshore.<br><br>In this case here, we're assuming we're taking first strike , if we take 2nd strike after enemy has mobilized and etc.. i think this concept is totally off..<br>cause its meant to be STEALTHY and invisible on the enemy's coastline..<br><br>So thereby assuming the vast area of the enemy's coastline and how tough it is to be spotted before a real war starts, i think the possibility is less then 20%<br><br>Just imagine, a small LITTLE boat going through over hundreds of islands..<br>i mean those closer to us 1 lar..<br><br>HaHaHa...Even a fighter pilot would have difficult spotting..somemore in dark grey naval and regarding helicopter, think we just throw in a stinger and some missiles together with it to settle it<br><br>If enemy has over 1000km of coastline..each PV has radar to detect about 50km of coastline..enemy will need to SPREAD out over 20 boats..<br>considering which idiot would actually deploy all simutaneously.!<br><br>1. If any of our Seawolf-class PV faces a much heavily equipped<br>Russian or American Naval ship for example<br>Kidd-Class Destroyers or Soverenmmy-class destroyers..<br>1:1.., to fight the enemy we might lose<br><br>2. Thereby assuming that we would be sending about 4:1<br>to outnumber the enemy we would win<br><br>In a open match of our navy , the airforce and land is pretty good<br>not considering the stealth frigates which our navy has<br><br>We are quite at a dis-advantage in comparison to their electronics and fire control system..<br><br>Therefore , even if we use our SeaWolf-Class PV it is even worser when it comes to dealing with more sophisticated ships..<br><br>1. They can detect us.<br>2. They got much more advanced anti missile missile system.<br>3. They paid about 7-8 times more for each vessel.<br>4. Advanced Radar<br><br>Considering we lose about 100+ lives in exchange for a whole destroyer..<br>Why not adopt the concept of mini boats?<br><br>if the mini boats rush..only about 1 or 2 destroyed lesser lives lost ..meanwhile the miniboat can choose to destroy the enemy..thru it's C4 or<br>astros, firing on the weak area<br><br>In any way , which u choose to face off the enemy "destroyer"<br>There will surely be ways in which u might lose..<br><br>For example , the Seawolf PV might get hit by a tactical nuke sunburn..<br>and whether is it small or big..all the crew also gone..<br>it also reduces casualties...<br><br>The mini boat likewise has it's pros and has it's vulnerabilities..<br><br>Like for example people might fire RPG at it..<br>But considering today's ship which used missile system more..<br><br>in about 20 years time..no one will use gun..<br><br>Then we will make use of a navy's which doesn't use any naval gun..<br>to charge and test it's missile system<br><br>The reason why the mini boats will win is that simply<br>Humans assume, they assume enemy always come in another large size destroyer..hence they are not ready to deal with another tiny threat..<br><br>and btw..when a boat about 5km away which u spotted reaching about 2-3 minutes..is 1 minute before aiming the astros at you..would you have enough time to react ?<br></div>

Faster, more versatile, and packs a heavier punch.</div>

The DD(x) is a future ship program which include new cruisers, destroyers and also ships for littoral warfare. The DD(x) is a rather interesting ship. Equipped with the Aegis Combat system, it is armed with 2 helicopters, 80 VLS cells, 2 155mm Cannon and run by  gas turbine generator and magnetic driven propulsion system. The large stealthy ship only require a crew of 95.<br><br>The LCS is a littoral combat concept project for the USN . Currently there is 3 plateforms available for the project contributed by General Dynamics, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.<br><br>The USN requirement for the LCS is rather different from the requirement by the RSN. The USN-LCS plateforms are designed to work rather independent of other elements, away from a centralised base or mother ship. While the Singapore's concept allow a greater level of dependence of other plateform. The operation radius of our ships for littoral combat is also much smaller.<br><br>As i said that the LCS do not fit our requirement, i do not see a need of it within the RSN.<br><br></div>

WTF?! you've high speed boat makes a freaking big and long wake man.....see the wake....then whack the front of it can liao!!!<br>At night leh? ur wake would glow.....even better! ahahah<br><br><blockquote>Then we will make use of a navy's which doesn't use any naval gun..<br>to charge and test it's missile system<br><br>The reason why the mini boats will win is that simply<br>Humans assume, they assume enemy always come in another large size destroyer..hence they are not ready to deal with another tiny threat..<br><br>and btw..when a boat about 5km away which u spotted reaching about 2-3 minutes..is 1 minute before aiming the astros at you..would you have enough time to react ?<br></blockquote>The US naval people also though that.......then they realised......if got no gun....how to give fire support!!! hence one of the DD(x) concepts is to deal with this!!!Besides a guided gun round is way cheaper<br><blockquote>and btw..when a boat about 5km away which u spotted reaching about 2-3 minutes..is 1 minute before aiming the astros at you..would you have enough time to react ?</blockquote>Horizon is around 80NM or 130km there abouts....and believe me....naval people have a good eye for spotting things that arent suppose to be in the sea<br><br><blockquote>Just look at USS cole..just 1 hit on it's hull..the whole ship disable..<br></blockquote>Big bomb....small ship without armour.<br><br>Next up let's talk about battleships.<br>They have been known to crash and saw off half a ship.Also ammo expolsions inside does not sink them often enuf.You see the thing is....a battleship is a floating hunk of steel....it wont be so easy to sink them even with a harpoon.I mean if lightly armoured crusiers can take 1 or 2 harpoon hits.....why cant a BB take more then that!?!</div>
