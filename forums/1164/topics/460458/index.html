              <p>Comparing AV8 with terrex = different roles. Terrex = battlefield taxi. It transports troops to frontline then sitback and act as network node. The dismounted troops then use ACMS to ID targets for the big boys. Bionix = IFV. It fights with troops.</p>
              <p>Some armies prefer tracked IFVs to wheeled IFVs as the latter has mobility issues on certain terrains. Wheeled battlefield taxi = effective where supporting road networks are excellent.</p>
              <p>The 168x25mm/30mm cannons are needed for Malaysian army. Prior to the AV-8, only 31 Adnans are sharpshooter equipped. The 12.7mm armed remaining KIFV and Adnans = lightly armed. The much older condors (with 20mm cannon) are barely able to keep in service. Malaysia will take awhile before an ACMS equivalent enters service.</p>
              <p>There are already many hundreds of bionix 25 and bionix Mk 2 in SAF service.</p>

              The Malaysian AV8s are used as battlefield taxis. 
              With 30 mm cannons,  ATGMs  &amp; 120 mm mortars, the battalion already has the organic firepower to overmatch any Terrex they encounter.

              <p>got taxi now so don't need to go battle in buses or on foot, good match.</p>
              <p>as for firepower, with 30 mm, ATGM and 120 mm mortar, you overmatch? it is over estimate yourself and under estimate others.</p>

              In addition to the  AV8s with 30 mm cannon/ATGMs/120 mortars, there will also be PT91s with ERA, Adnans,G5s, FH 70s, 36 Astros II launchers, various ATGMs and SHORADS, F18s etc. and a professional full time army. Definitely a very serious force to reckon with. Definitely not a pushover.   
              SAF also has no holding power.

              <p>8 x 120mm vehicles out of 257 is not a lot. Only 8 more in the Adnans = 16 total. The mortar platoon of a MAF battalion generally uses the 81mm incl 14 adnan/KIFV mounted. The SAF battalion's mortar platoon uses 120mm, whether towed, bronco or LSV. 120mm ER munitions even outrange the 105mm M56 gun, not to mention SRAM's high fire rate.</p>
              <p>The brigade or division arty assets is even more sparse. G-5/worn out FH-70s, 1-2 regts of unguided Astros MLRS and very old 105mm model 56s. In contrast, XX number of SA battalions comprising primus, FH88/2000, pegasus and himars. With ST producing its own howitzers, no surprises on that many number.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, the AV-8 will fight alongside Terrex than against it.</p>

              Agreed that it shud be Terrex alongside AV8s. 
              
              Hardware quality &amp; quantity comparisons always do not tell 
              whole story &amp; is only theory. Many real events show that 
              hardware advantages never guarantee victory.
              
              SAF will outnumber any opposing force only when fully mobilized. 
              And for how long can SAF stay fully mobilized for a worst case scenario ?

Singapore's government debt is higher at 108.3% (as at end 2011) with zero foreign debt. SG higher % is partly due to short term T-bills issued that skews the percentage. MY issues under 1% T-bills.

              The Singapore air force and navy is fully operational 24/7. As for army, I think most SAF personnel know how long (or rather short) it takes to get mobilised.The point about the SAF is that it enjoys concentration. 70+ thousand soldiers is maintained 24/7 (regulars plus 2 years of NSmen) within the little red dot.
                  
              Malaysia has bigger deployment issues for its army. 1st division is kept in East Malaysia. 2nd div is in the North. 4th div is in the middle (KL area) whilst the most deployable 3rd div is in the south (Melaka). Even to drive from KL to JB will take several hours. How long will it take a reservist to report to camp in puny Singapore?
                  
              No one, not even Malaysia, can deploy 70,000 troops within the combat reach of Singapore before Singapore mobilises. So the SAF already enjoys numerical advantage 24/7. 
              
              The Malaysia deployment clearly illustrates why its MY+SG. 3rd div can deploy to any other parts of Malaysia fastest (esp as it has 10th para bde and 4th mech). The only reason I can think of why it would deploy like that is because Singapore can cover the rear end i.e. free 3rd div.

                      <p>Good point except there is no evidence of any other variants (other than one used as a welcoming doormat). For bridging, there are the M3G, FLB, M60 AVLB and AMX-13 AVLB. In particular for bridging, the new M3G is MLC85 and suggestions are that these was acquired for the L2. For recovery, none noted except for the bionix. For CE, many are still wondering what will replace the M60 variant. I believe that at least 99 L2s will be used to form a brigade worth (add 33 if another battalion). Possible to have 4 x L2 battalions. 1 each for each of the 4 Arm brigades.</p>

              Yes tan. In very small amounts and not included in the MBT count. The pinzarbruck and the Buffalo recovery vehicles are sold under engineering vehicles, so they won't add to the MBT count.
              
              What's the point of all this? If you're out to try saying the AV8 is Malaysian made and can destroy MBTs by sneezing on it, you're looking at the wrong audience. If you want to compare, you might as well compare with Thai equipment since they are the ones that have border disputes with you.
              
              And even then, comparing APC vs APC is a stupid thing. If you have an APC, I won't be sending another APC against you. I'll drop a JDAM or run an MBT against you, let your APC driver's balls shrink seeing a 60 ton monster against his taxi.
