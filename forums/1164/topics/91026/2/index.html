It's the small things that count, not the big showy acts yeah.<br><br>Regarding gays, I'm not too sure about that but I do know that they are not supposed to stay in.They can be PES C1, C2 or C9 if I'm not wrong and there are different types of 302 which I'm not at liberty to say.Whether they are in BMTC, I'm not sure either.<br><br>One more thing, the instructors you meet might be nice to you or vice-versa.When you are posted to a unit, you might see different kinds of sergeants, ranging from nice, to power-hungry demons.I happen to be one of the former, cannot raise my voice for nuts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> .Anyway, you might also end up in SISPEC , OCS or any other training schools.So..the road is still long.</div>

I feel its quite unfair sometimes becoz most these people are screwed up by CMPB since most people are posted to the wrong appointments and should be doing something else which they are better at. Take for example, I know of a Captain who's a real capable company commander but when posted to a staff appointment lacks the ability to generate good papers or "suck up" to superiors and ended up having low rankings till he got fed up and left service.</div>

Can vaguely recall the school being located in Khatib Camp when I was on-course there in the mid-80s (I think), &amp; even then they were kinda obsolete. Academic dropouts had a competitive ITE route to turn to learn a trade, as opposed to signing on for 8 years or 10 years or something with the SAF Boys' School programme.<br><br>My old NSF Signals Sergeant was a product of that system. He wasn't always forthcoming with info when we asked him about life, but did reveal that military officers was in charge of regimentation &amp; teachers from MOE prepared them for the O Levels. The school was also militarily-organized around separate wings (combat, service &amp; technical, if I'm correct), so that trainees can become specialized regulars.<br></div>
