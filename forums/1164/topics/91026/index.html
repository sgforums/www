Of course the government trust you or else would they trust you with the security of the country?<br><br>However how sure u are that human can be trusted to the fullest extent without doubt?

How many politicians in Singapore actually took Arts in JC and went on studying Public policy in the U? How many good doctors out there whom dont even study Biology in JC? How many good actors out there aint from drama college?<br><br>No subject taught in schools are relevant to military training, only military trainings are related to military training. If you say the skills learned in History are related to military trainings then i shall say there are skills learned in sciences  that are helpful not only in military trainings but in life.<br><br>If other developed countries do not see a need to set up a military junior college just inorder to produce good thinking soldiers, i do not see why Singapore should take up the step. I see that JC students in Singapore are better off being taught with general studies, before choosing what they want to do in life. After JC, whether are they welcomed to military college or not, thats another story.<br><br>I do not see the relevence of  a soldier cursing like a farm boy as a good soldier. I do not see why a scholistic soldier who do not curse is a lousier soldier. One day when you reach the level of a scholistic soldier, u are welcome to change the system.<br><br>Until that day come, stop whining.</div>
