              <p>æ´ªä»²ä¸˜ (Hong Zhong-Qiu), a ROC NSF army corporal who was serving his compulsory 
                          military service,  was put in confinement from 1 July 2013, and tortured to 
                          death on 3 July 2013 just 3 days  before honorary discharge (ORD).</p>
              <p>Hong's punishment was far more 
                          serious than he  deserved. Why was that? Why did Hong’s superiors want 
                          to torture him so  badly?<br> <br> Comments on Superiors Lead to Hong’s Death?<br> <br> According  to local media, Hong and other soldiers were invited to a 
                          gathering by  his Brigade Commander, Major General Wei-Zhi Shen, to 
                          share their  thoughts before they were discharged. The gathering was 
                          supposed to be  confidential, but Hong’s comments on his direct 
                          superiors, Master  Sergeant Chen and Staff Sergeant Fang, were 
                          leaked. And this is  believed to be the cause of Hong’s torture, and 
                          eventually death.<br> <br> A Gang of Conspirators<br> <br> When  Chen and Fang learned about Hong’s comments, they decided to teach
                           him a  lesson, and Hong happened to be found carrying a camera phone. 
                          Chen and  Fang followed the “proper” procedure: convening an internal 
                          review  meeting, submitting the case for their Company Leader’s approval
                           before  sending it to the Brigade Commander for final decision. The 
                          procedure  appeared to be followed, but in fact it was manipulated.<br> <br> First,  the internal review meeting was reported to include career 
                          soldiers  only, and Hong was not given the chance, which he should be 
                          according to  law, to respond to the charges, and he did not sign on the
                           meeting  minutes, which is also required by law. The case was then sent
                           to the  company leader, who was reluctant to approve at first. As a 
                          result,  Cheng and Fang went to the Deputy Brigade Commander, Colonel 
                          Jiang-Chung  He, and asked him to push the company leader. According to 
                          the press,  He said to the company leader: “I want Hong in confinement 
                          tomorrow.  It’s either you or him.” Failing to resist such pressure, the
                           company  leader signed off, and finally the Brigade Commander approved,
                           too.<br> <br> Even  so, under normal circumstances, Hong should not have been put in  
                          confinement. As a rule of thumb, it takes around 7 days to process a  
                          soldier for confinement. The process includes mental assessment and  
                          physical examination. And, by the way, Hong was supposed to be  
                          discharged and became a civilian three after the Brigade Commander’s  
                          approval. However, Hong’s assessment result came out less than one work 
                           day, and he was put in confinement immediately. The local news said 
                          that  the military hospital that conducted Hong’s assessment was also  
                          reluctant to “expedite” Hong’s assessment results, but, once again, the 
                           Deputy Brigade Commander He made a phone call, and all of a sudden, 
                          Hong  was sent to confinement. Right now, it is suspected that the 
                          hospital  did not follow the protocol and was bribed by Chen and Fang.<br> <br> Last Hope of Life Diminished as SOS Message Not Responded<br> <br> After  Hong was put in confinement, he was tortured with excessive 
                          physical  workout under the sun, and was not given sufficient amount of 
                          water.  Hong sent text messages to Brigade Commander Shen and asked for 
                          help,  but no response. After three days of torture, Hong finally 
                          collapsed. He  was rushed to a nearby hospital, and the doctor who tried
                           to  resuscitate Hong later said that when Hong was sent to the 
                          hospital, his  body temperature was 44 degrees Celsius. To put it in 
                          perspective, 45  degrees Celsius is the highest temperate that a normal 
                          person can bear  when you take a hot shower. And now imagine such hot 
                          water running  around in Hong’s body.<br> <br> The  autopsy report confirms Hong’s cause of death was disseminated  
                          intravascular coagulation, or DIC, which was caused by a severe heat  
                          stroke in Hong’s case. All of which could’ve been prevented if Hong had 
                           been given sufficient amount of water intake. In fact, there were a  
                          couple of other soldiers in the same confinement room with Hong, but  
                          none of them were “trained” as much as Hong.<br> <br> Court Martial Not Trusted by Hong’s Family<br> <br> Right  now, the military prosecutors are investigating Hong’s death, and
                            Colonel He is now in custody. However, will they be impartial? During 
                           the autopsy, Hong’s family insisted to have an outside coroner present.
                            Besides, some people demand the military prosecutors and court martial
                            should recuse themselves, and DA’s office or even the Special  
                          Investigation Division should take over. Others believe the military  
                          prosecutors are acting too slow, as the crucial part of the surveillance
                            tape in the confinement room- which is 30 minutes before Hong dropped 
                           dead- is suspected to be erased. Right now, the hard-drive is sent to  
                          Investigation Bureau to restore the data.<br> <br> In  the meantime, more and more Hong’s teammates are sharing information
                            with the press, either anonymously or not. It seems that the press is 
                           providing the lead for the military prosecutors, instead of the  
                          prosecutors looking for evidence themselves.<br> <br> Hong Is Not the Only Victim<br> <br> Since  Hong’s death, other victims’ family came out and demanded  
                          re-investigation of the deaths of their beloved ones. These family  
                          members believed their sons were bullied, physically and mentally, in  
                          the army, and most of the cases were closed with suicides. Over the past
                            few decades, Taiwan’s army has not been involved in major wars, and  
                          still soldiers die every year. According to the law, adult males are  
                          obligated to serve in the army, but for many people, their only hope is 
                           to leave the army in one piece. Most of them share experience similar 
                          to  Hong’s, though to a very different degree. That’s why Hong’s death 
                          has  aroused such a widespread reaction from the public.<br> <br> Right  now, what people fear most is that the Ministry of National 
                          Defense  will try to cover things up and pick a few lower-ranking 
                          soldiers as  scapegoats – such as the only person in the case who tried 
                          to save Hong,  Lieutenant Meng-Ying Liu, a resident-doctor-to-be after 
                          his compulsory  military service. He is now being investigated by the 
                          military  prosecutors.<br> <br> Take the Streets on July 20<br> <br> Now,  not just Hong’s family, but the general public are demanding for 
                          truth  and to hold Hong’s superiors responsible. The protest organized 
                          by  volunteers will be held on July 20 in front of the Ministry of 
                          National  Defense. However, more pressure is needed, especially from 
                          international  news media, to force the government to take further 
                          actions and prevent  the Ministry of Defense to cover things up. Truth 
                          must be told, and  more lives must be saved. - CNN</p>

              (AFP) - Taiwanese prosecutors indicted 18 military officials on 
              Wednesday over the death of a young conscript who had been subjected to 
              "cruel and abusive" punishment, in an incident that has sparked 
              widespread anger.</p>
              <p>Corporal Hung Chung-chiu died of heatstroke on July 4, just three 
              days before the end of his compulsory year-long military service.</p>
              <p>His family said he was forced to do excessive exercise as punishment for taking a smartphone onto his base.</p>
              <p>Chief military prosecutor general Tsao Chin-sheng said the
