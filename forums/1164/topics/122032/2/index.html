            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I was in 2PDF, 173SIR Bravo company, up till ten years ago. We had a "familiarisation ride" on the V200. But I was absent from that training as I had other duties to attend to.<br><br>The 2PDF is indeed the rubbish dump for old equipment and men as well. Guys like myself who are deemed not good enough for other combat units or simply just available when 2PDF needed men to form up units. SAF loses many reservists each year. For example I have been living and working overseas for almost 9 years. This is for economic reasons and I missed army life very very much.<br><br>The scariest thing was that we were issued with 20 round magazines. Even our new webbings had pouches tailored only for the 20-round magazines.<br><br>I asked the RSM why we were given 20-round magazines and he said it was becos "SAF has lots of them".<br><br>I was the platoon runner and my radio was the PRC-77 set that was probably older than I was. Real Vietnam-era stuff and the damn thing weighed 12kg and the spare battery another 2kg! It was like carrying a GPMG.<br><br>The only good thing was that the esprit de corps was very high and we were voted best battalion and best company a couple of times.<br><br>Us men were all rejects and we knew it.<br><br>But somehow, our company were led by very capable officers and all of us were motivated to prove we were as capable as any other units. The training was unbelievably tough which was completely not what we thought 2PDF was supposed to be. It was FIBUA, FOFO and jungle warfare all the time. We only had one excercise where we dig in for static defense. And that turned out to be the toughest one yet as living in a trench was hell.</div>

It will be used until they cannot move anymore or until they know what to replace it with. Right now they are just being used as an anti-aircraft platform and easy troop carrying duties. You won't see them tackling rough terrain etc as it is a well-known risk.<br><br>Why?<br><br>The V-200 has a serious problem. It is known to flip over easily on inclines because of its high centre of gravity and the fact that it is a wheeled vehicle.<br><br>That's why they were taken out of service as troop carriers and the job given to M-113.<br><br>Furthermore, I think the 4 wheels do not give very good cross country performance and the vehicle can get stuck in small ditches etc. Most countries in the world now go for at least 6 wheels for armoured cars.<br><br>Our Terrex for example has 8 wheels. The US Stryker also has eight wheels.<br><br>Anyway, there is a great debate going on regarding wheels vs tracks, The US and Canada seems to be moving towards more wheels and some people feel this is a great mistake.<br><br>(Just type in "stryker wheels vs tracks" and you can find a lot of debate for and against.)<br><br>But wheels or tracks, all is in agreement that 8 wheels might be good, but 4 wheels definitely not good.</div></blockquote>If one is looking for wheeled vehicles.....I don't think it's realistic to expect it to do the things that tracked vehicles do.<br><br>But for LIC.....MOUT it has proven to be rather effective as seen in Iraq.<br><br>Otherwise just go for M113s......cheaper than Terrex......much much cheaper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the 60's/70's, the V-200 was intended to be used just like a tracked vehicle. The rationale back then was that tracks are bad for our roads and the wheeled vehicle seemed to be an excellent choice for both road and cross country.<br><br>Besides, wheeled vehicles are cheaper and easier to maintain. And wheels were all the rage in SE Asia at that time. I think Thailand and Malaysia also had the same type of armoured vehicle as us though theirs might be the V-150. Our V-200 I think is slightly longer and was made specially for Singapore. They are both made by Cadillac Cage.<br><br>It is only later that they realised that this is not possible and so in came the M-113 as replacement.<br><br>V-200 for PDF makes sense as we are homeland defense and there should be enough roads in Singapore for the V-200 to use even in the event of war.<br><br>On roads, the V-200 must be faster than most tracked vehicles. Still good for convoy or installation protection.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For those whom advocate wheeled APCs... food for thought...<br><br><strong>Study Faults Army Vehicle</strong><br>Use of Transport in Iraq Puts Troops at Risk, Internal Report Says<br>By R. Jeffrey Smith<br>Thursday, March 31, 2005;<br><br>The Army has deployed a new troop transport vehicle in Iraq with many defects, putting troops there at unexpected risk from rocket-propelled grenades and raising questions about the vehicle's development and $11 billion cost, according to a detailed critique in a classified Army study obtained by The Washington Post.<br><br>The vehicle is known as the Stryker, and 311 of the lightly armored, wheeled vehicles have been ferrying U.S. soldiers around northern Iraq since October 2003. The Army has been ebullient about the vehicle's success there, with Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, telling the House Armed Services Committee last month that "we're absolutely enthusiastic about what the Stryker has done."<br><br>Soldiers emerge from a Stryker during a battle with insurgents in Mosul, Iraq, in February. An Army study criticizes the vehicle's performance. (Jim Macmillan -- AP)<br><br>But the Army's Dec. 21 report, drawn from confidential interviews with operators of the vehicle in Iraq in the last quarter of 2004, lists a catalogue of complaints about the vehicle, including design flaws, inoperable gear and maintenance problems that are "getting worse not better." Although many soldiers in the field say they like the vehicle, the Army document, titled "Initial Impressions Report -- Operations in Mosul, Iraq," makes clear that the vehicle's military performance has fallen short.<br><br>The internal criticism of the vehicle appears likely to fuel new controversy over the Pentagon's decision in 2003 to deploy the Stryker brigade in Iraq just a few months after the end of major combat operations, before the vehicle had been rigorously tested for use across a full spectrum of combat.<br><br>The report states, for example, that an armoring shield installed on Stryker vehicles to protect against unanticipated attacks by Iraqi insurgents using low-tech weapons works against half the grenades used to assault it. The shield, installed at a base in Kuwait, is so heavy that tire pressure must be checked three times daily. Nine tires a day are changed after failing, the report says; the Army told The Post the current figure is "11 tire and wheel assemblies daily."<br><br>"The additional weight significantly impacts the handling and performance during the rainy season," says the report, which was prepared for the Center for Army Lessons Learned in Fort Leavenworth, Kan. "Mud appeared to cause strain on the engine, the drive shaft and the differentials," none of which was designed to carry the added armor.<br><br>Commanders' displays aboard the vehicles are poorly designed and do not work; none of the 100 display units in Iraq are being used because of "design and functionality shortfalls," the report states. The vehicle's computers are too slow and overheat in desert temperatures or freeze up at critical moments, such as "when large units are moving at high speeds simultaneously" and overwhelm its sensors.<br><br>The main weapon system, a $157,000 grenade launcher, fails to hit targets when the vehicle is moving, contrary to its design, the report states. Its laser designator, zoom, sensors, stabilizer and rotating speed all need redesign; it does not work at night; and its console display is in black and white although "a typical warning is to watch for a certain color automobile," the report says. Some crews removed part of the launchers because they can swivel dangerously toward the squad leader's position.<br><br>The vehicle's seat belts cannot be readily latched when troops are in their armored gear, a circumstance that contributed to the deaths of three soldiers in rollover accidents, according to the report. On the vehicle's outside, some crews have put sand-filled tin cans around a gunner's hatch that the report says is ill-protected.<br><br>Eric Miller, senior defense investigator at the independent Project on Government Oversight, which obtained a copy of the internal Army report several weeks ago, said the critique shows that "the Pentagon hasn't yet learned that using the battlefield as a testing ground costs lives, not just spiraling dollars."<br><br>Asked about the report, Army officials who direct the Stryker program said they are working to fix some flaws; they also said they were unaware of some of the defects identified in the critique. "We're very proud of the Stryker team," said Lt. Col. Frederick J. Gellert, chief of the Army's Stryker Brigade Combat Team Integration Branch in Washington, but "it hasn't been something that's problem-divorced."<br><br>According to the latest Army figures, 17 soldiers in the Stryker combat brigade have died in Iraq in 157 bomb explosions, but no delineation is made for those who perished inside the vehicle and those who were standing outside it; an additional five soldiers have died in two rollovers. No current figure was provided for those who perished in grenade attacks, although one officer said he thought it was fewer than a handful.<br><br>Neither the lessons-learned report nor more recent Army data state how many soldiers have been wounded while inside the vehicle. The report states that in one case, a soldier was struck by shrapnel that penetrated both the vehicle's armor and his own body armor; in another case, an entire crew escaped with minor injuries after a vehicle sustained nine grenade hits.<br><br>The criticisms of the Stryker's first performance in combat seem likely to give new arguments to critics of the Army's decision in 1999 to move away from more heavily armored vehicles that move on metal tracks and embrace a generation of lighter, more comfortable vehicles operated at higher speed on rubber tires.<br><br>Senior Army officers in Iraq, like those at the Pentagon, have been surprised by the intensity of hostilities there since mid-2003, and lately some officers have said they depend on heavy armor to protect their soldiers in urban warfare, even though tanks in Iraq have also suffered unexpected damage.<br><br>But Maj. Gen. Stephen M. Speakes, the Army's director of force development, said that when he rode in the Stryker for the first time, he "marveled at how much nicer it was" than riding in a Bradley vehicle or an older troop transport, the M113, which he likened to being inside an aluminum trash can being beaten by a hammer. He said the Stryker was "amazingly smooth" and quiet by comparison.<br><br>In a report completed at the time of deployment, the Pentagon's operational test and evaluation office rated the Stryker vehicles sent to Iraq "effective and survivable only with limitations for use in small-scale contingencies." Congressional auditors at the General Accounting Office in December 2003 said the first brigade "did not consistently demonstrate its capabilities, indicating both strengths and weaknesses."<br><br>Independent groups and a loose-knit group of retired Army officers who dislike the Stryker vehicle have alleged that the Stryker's 2003 deployment was motivated partly by the desire of the Army and the manufacturer, General Dynamics, to build congressional support for buying additional brigades. But Speakes said that was nonsense and that the brigade was deployed in Iraq simply because the Army needed it.<br><br>Researchers Bob Lyford and Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.<br></div>
