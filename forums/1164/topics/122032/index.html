            <div class='col-md body'>The V-200 will not be upgraded in my opinion. It will be used until they cannot move anymore or until they know what to replace it with. Right now they are just being used as an anti-aircraft platform and easy troop carrying duties. You won't see them tackling rough terrain etc as it is a well-known risk.<br><br>Why?<br><br>The V-200 has a serious problem. It is known to flip over easily on inclines because of its high centre of gravity and the fact that it is a wheeled vehicle.<br><br>That's why they were taken out of service as troop carriers and the job given to M-113.<br><br>Furthermore, I think the 4 wheels do not give very good cross country performance and the vehicle can get stuck in small ditches etc. Most countries in the world now go for at least 6 wheels for armoured cars.<br><br>Our Terrex for example has 8 wheels. The US Stryker also has eight wheels.<br><br>Anyway, there is a great debate going on regarding wheels vs tracks, The US and Canada seems to be moving towards more wheels and some people feel this is a great mistake.<br><br>(Just type in "stryker wheels vs tracks" and you can find a lot of debate for and against.)<br><br>But wheels or tracks, all is in agreement that 8 wheels might be good, but 4 wheels definitely not good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about hauntings...I am previously from SG as well. I swear that this is a true account.It is between end of 2002 to mid of 2003,can't remember very well. There is this time where I was Guard 2IC in SG camp. 2 prowlers were prowling near the entrance of the old ATC place(its part of the prowling route),now i think belong to the SCE people.<br><br>They reported seeing a taxi turning into the old ATC complex and went in to check. That time is just after midnight. When they went in they can't find the taxi anywhere! If you guys can remember the only way in and out of old ATC from within the camp is only one gate. They immediately radio back to me in the guardroom and ask if any taxis came in. I thought they were fooling around as taxis are never allowed to enter the camp unless they belonged to reservists. At that time there was no ICT at all and certainly no taxis will be allowed to come into a camp at this time.<br><br>I waked up the Duty driver and i went to check for myself.leaving the Guard 3(supposed to man the gate) to man the guardroom.GuardComm sleeping at that time. I went with them around the same place with the driver and saw nothing. The prowlers are seriously white with fear. Now i am also a bit worried. I questioned them a few times and they told the same time again and again.I trusted them as i knew them personally and that they are reliable men.I radioed back the Guard 3 to double check if any taxi did enter or left the camp before and after i left and of course there was none. I immediately asked the Guard 3 to wake up the GuardComm. Basically what happened later is that he did more or less what I have done again.<br><br>We finally feel that this is serious enough to wake up the DO(2WO Singh from AHQ at that time), he did the exact same thing as what we have done before. The men were now very worried so they were ordered to cease prowling for a while.Later prowling resumed but with 4 prowlers per group and at every 4 hours instead of 2 men per group every 2hours now.The DO comforted the 2 prowlers, excused them from duty and brought them back to Guardroom. We were told by the DO not to spread this as not to cause unnecessary panic.I can still remember the look on the 2 prowlers faces now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, SG camp 1 have three gates if I am not wrong, the main gate you have just mentioned, another gate near the old 38SCE HQ and lastly the rear gate for training troop to move out into the training area.<br><br>I heard stories when I was there but never experienced it myself, the most dirtiest place in ATC (in the 80s RATC) was actually certain floor in one the  reservist bunk.<br><br>Then the next is the rear gate area.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats right, the M113 is only introduced later due to the unsastifactory cross contry performance of the V200. The V200 is also prone to overturning as they are quite high,so they largely stick to flat roads now such as in FDS in airbases. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
