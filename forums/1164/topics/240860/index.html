            <div class='col-md body'>nice long argument that u wrote. whichever way i look at it, it all seems to sum up with the statement, that wars are fought with money only.<br><br>i feel it's not possible to make such a sweeping statement. granted, it is not possible to fight a mordern war without proper logistics and equipment. we all agree on that point, but i feel that it is also not possible to fight any war without the moral courage and heart that every soldier has to bring with him if he's to fight for Singapore/his nation.<br><br>that's something that money can not buy.<br><br>peace <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

But you are way off the mark.<br>Yes, Indon commandoes did infiltrated SG and managed to bomb Macdonald House, which is near to the current Plaza Singapura.<br>Yes, the 2 Indon bombers were caught in Singapore.<br><br>No, the 2 Indon bombers were not "<strong>release back to Indonesia without being prosecuted due to diplomatic pressure from Indonesia</strong>".<br><br>In fact, the 2 bombers were prosecuted in SG court, found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Indon gov did put tremendous pressure onto SG gov to get the 2 bombers released. SG gov stood firm, and the 2 bombers were hanged.<br><br>But you are also right, SG gov did release the 2 bombers back to Indonesia. In 2 coffins and after they have been hanged.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
