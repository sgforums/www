We can expect the F15 to exceed the F18 in almost aspects. Pls note that only KEY US Allies operate F15.

No other aircraft I watched from my home could ever climb almost vertical save F-16s. In fact, after the F-15s have flown off, and the F-5s follow, the F-5s seem lousy in comparison.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Sure the F-15s fly slower bcos of the loud sound they create....but the sound is POWER. You can still hear it from far. In fact the engines seem to be growling for more speed.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

They call it the largest air show (strict air show, not aviation trade show) in the world.<br><br>Look at the site below for the aircraft that participated in the 2005 show.<br>http://www.airtattoo.com/airtattoo/showcontent.asp?CollectionID=@0000000312<br><br>I was at the 1999 show and they had a B-2 on static and flying display. It was silent until it passed over you. After that, it was still fairly quiet.<br><br>The Mig-29, SU-27, Mirage 2000, F-104 and Viggen made some of the loudest screams.</div>

They've got major airshows and the largest fireworks display on earth.<br><br>Their airshow sees the participation from USAF, USN units from all over the country.  Be it Thunderbirds or Blue Angels.  While I was landing  at their domestic airport, I even saw a B1B lancer, and B-52 parked on the tarmac.  Amazing stuff.  No sign of the elusive B2 tho.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The RIAT is best of both worlds, large contingents from USAF Europe, RAF and paricipation from many European air forces. Each year's show usually have 3 or 4 aerobatic display teams, plus lots of solo aircraft aerobatics.<br><br>Having watched the Thunderbirds, Red Arrows, Frecce Tricolori, Patrouille de France, Patrulla Aguila, Roulettes, RMAF display team and Black Knights in person and Blue Angels on video, my verdict is the big European teams have much more spectacular displays.<br><br>The American teams' routines are very predictable and lack real variety, always doing variations of the diamond and 2 opposing solos.<br><br>The British, French and Italian teams have more aircraft and have much more varied and visually pleasing formations. A real treat!<br><br>Roulettes? Disappointing! They have Hornets but pick the PC-9, what a waste.</div>

Its latest radar could detect more than 25NM compared to our F16. And if they combined to fly together, they conquer the sky. Try to search for the Wall of eagles!<br><br>BTW, its true that the F5-T model are so few as they are ideally for intel ops not for combat ops.<br><br>Even if the F15 and MIG29 were to compared together at abt 1km,  one could still spot the huge diff, especially the huge fuselage that the mig has</div>
