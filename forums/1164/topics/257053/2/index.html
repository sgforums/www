            <div class='col-md body'>For the grenades SAF uses, the pin needs to be twisted and pulled, and even then its pretty tight. I reckon you could use your teeth, if you had a jaw like a pit bull and teeth made of steel. If not, I think you're better off using your hands. It took me a good ten seconds of wringing, twisting and grunting to get the pin off the first time I threw a SAF grenade. Then again, I am quite skinny, so it could have been a case of muscle (or lack of).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>As for the deformation of a bullet hitting a target (or body), I suppose a projectile might just avoid deformation provided that most of the energy has been dissipated, but there is just enough for it to embed itself in the target. So, I suppose a possible scenario which may apply is if the target is hit just outside of the effective range of the bullet, where the projectile is almost out of steam, and doesn't have the speed/energy to smash itself into the target. Having said that, I leave you to figure out the the odds of finding someone who has gotten a non-deformed projectile dug out of them.<br><br>My 2 cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Edit: Btw, we are talking about assault rifle rounds (e.g. 5.56), right?

He himself owned several revolvers and he was shot during a gambling dispute by a 9mm pistol-wielding guy - another Filipino. He had no chance to return fire and was hit 3 times at pointblank range. Not only did he survive, he was fit as a fiddle - still hard drinking and hard living. He was hit in the neck and 2 in the torso.

This effect drops out with range and eventually the round behaves like your classic bullet.<br><br>The AK 7.62mm will not fragment or deform in flesh unless it hits something solid like bone, after penetrating to a sufficent depth it will start to yaw coming to rest eventually base first, and it is during the yawing where it causing a much larger wound track.<br><br>BTW, the NATO 7.62mm will behave like the 5.56mm in fragmenting if you drive it fast enough using non-standard powder loads.
