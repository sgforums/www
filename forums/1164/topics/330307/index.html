              <p>KUALA LUMPUR: A 25-year-old man, detained since July 28 last year under the 
              Internal Security Act on suspicion of being a<strong> foreign spy,</strong> was released on 
              Tuesday.</p>
              <p>This follows a recent visit by the Human Rights Commission of 
              Malaysia to Kamunting detention centre to investigate allegations of 
              ill-treatment of K. Sanjeev Kumar. The allegations were made by his wife, 
              Sharmila Uthiakumar.<br> <br> Suhakam commissioner Datuk Siva Subramaniam said at a press conference here they 
              found that Sanjeev Kumar, whose left arm and leg were paralysed, did not receive 
              the treatment he required.<br> <br> He said the Abolish ISA Movement had referred Sanjeev Kumar's case to Suhakam 
              through a memorandum on June 4.<br> <br> Sharmila had on May 20 lodged a police report against the Home Ministry, police 
              and the Kamunting detention centre claiming her husband had been tortured.</p>
              <p>She had also claimed her husband had become wheelchair-bound 
              because of the torture</p>

              <p>A Singapore Spy story : A British traitor who spied fir the Japanese is honoured at the Kranji War Memorial :</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Japanese spy listed on Kranji war memorial</strong></span><br> <strong> By Alec Marsh</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.newasia-singapore.com/images/stories/world_war/kranji_war_memorial.jpg" alt="" width="408" height="261"></p>
              <p>THE family of a soldier who served in the Second World War has called
              on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to remove the name of a
              Japanese spy from a memorial stone of British dead in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The request followed the discovery of the traitor's identity and the
              revelation that his name was engraved just inches from their
              relative's, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and was an
              acting brigadier when he was killed in action in South-East Asia.</p>
              <p>The identity of the spy, Capt Patrick Heenan, who passed secrets about
              British air bases in northern Malaya to the Japanese, remained largely
              unknown until the publication of a book describing his role in the
              defeat of the Commonwealth forces in the Far East.</p>
              <p>Robert Moorhead, from Kent, learned that the name of a traitor had been
              placed just two names from his father's, and next to a George Cross
              holder.</p>
              <p>Mr Moorhead, 70, said a letter had been written to the commission
              asking for the traitor's name to be struck off the memorial in the
              Kranji War Cemetery but it had said the name would not be erased.</p>
              <p>The spy Heenan, who was found guilty at a court martial, was never executed
              because the Japanese invasion broke the lines of communication and the
              death warrant was never signed. He was killed by a military policeman
              as the Japanese closed in to prevent him being freed by the invading
              forces.</p>

              <p>you seem like someone very familiar. same modius operani.</p>
              <p>1) raise some obscure/sure to be contested point which stinks to high heaven of a strong element of bias to create controversy</p>
              <p>2) wait for people to respond and point out the logical flaws in your construction of what is deemed the basis of an argument (for better want of a term)</p>
              <p>3) and when you respond, you usually dont address the issues. you simply ignore your fatally flawed/insipid/outright ridiculous "argument" and dig up new stuff in the same vein.</p>
              <p>all due credit to you for your digging up of constant new sources of controversy and unfaltering ability to tease us with your posts</p>
              <p>but things wear thin after a while. come on, do get serious and grow up. if you wanna post. post serious. this is reminding me of a very badly pwned lion somewhere in this forum.</p>

              <p>Well trolling in forums is usually an indication of a larger problem with the person in whole, it could stem from feelings of inadequacy or the person in real life is extremely dominated by other parties in their social circles hence the need to gain some "power" by dictating the responses of people in online forums.</p>
              <p>But all in all, trolls usually don't realize that engagin in trolling behaviour actually locsk them more into this vicious cycle of control by others, hence they actually end up weaker and smaller persons then they were  before they took this course of action.</p>

                                      are<br> continuing, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng disclosed on
                                      Wednesday in a<br> written response to a question from Nominated MP Simon Tay.<br> Under the Internal Security Act, those suspected of being involved
                                      in<br> activities that might threaten national security can be arrested
                                      without trial<br> and detained under an Order of Detention by the Government.<br> Details on the identities of those arrested were not released. Two
                                      were<br> arrested in 1997, and have since been released. <strong>One of
                                      them, a male Singapore<br> Permanent Resident, was a deep-cover operative of a foreign
                                      intelligence<br> service, and had used the other, a female Singaporean, as a
                                      collaborator.<br></strong> Of the other four male Singapore
                                      citizens detained last year, three were<br> agents in another intelligence service. One had recruited the
                                      fourth to<br> collect intelligence on and to subvert an unidentified local
                                      community<br> organisation, according to the minister. Two of them have been
                                      released.<br> Said Mr Wong: "This followed Internal Security Department's<br> recommendations that their preventive detentions were no<br> longer necessary for reasons of<br> continuing investigation, or of their posing an active<br> threat to national security."<br> The four who were released from custody had been<br> detained for between four and 11 months.<br> <br> Since 1965, 591 people have been detained under the Internal
                                      Security Act.<br> Most were arrested in the 1960s and 1970s in the struggle against
                                      communist<br> groups. The number fell to 39 in the 1980s. The six detained in the
                                      last two<br> years were the only ones in the 1990s.</p>

              <p>the best example i can think of is lionnoisy is exactly like chicken little.</p>
              <p>an acorn drop on his head and its armageddon. sky is falling, we are all going to die.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you REALISE that pretty much everything that you say that is so general ? and how much of that is actually perception vs. reality ? gee, you'd make a good puppet, regurgitating everything thats fed to you.</p>
              <p>the oldest spy agency in the world is owned by whom, make a guess. its not a secular government.</p>
              <p>spies go for intelligence or information. spies are not necessarily political or are they employed at the level of nation state. they are basically the tools that someone uses to obtain the end product. the means by which they use while they are employed are the ones that are different and varied.</p>
              <p>very often , economic spying is so much more prevalent than "spying" by your definition.</p>
              <p>Spies arent all cloak and dagger people. there's also the analysts, the bureacrats , the support staff. and it isnt exactly your james bond environment with your "kill your family, dont sleep around with young women" kind of reality. even with your field operatives, there's a huge variation in terms of style and options.</p>
              <p>my beef with you is that you are basically describing something out of context and u perpetually have this sensationalism about it. you are describing a toyota corolla as a monster truck. totally inappropriate. totally bullsh*t.</p>
              <p>and what's your beef with the aussies ? they declared some kinda blood feud with you and your family ? you seem to drag them and sling mud at them at every single opportunity. every country has spies. even before the advent of the nation state and in the age of fedualism there were also spies. </p>
              <p>and technically, by your standards of definition, you are a spy.</p>
              <p>1) you infil the forums and this thread</p>
              <p>2) you go around demonstrating subversive intent and spouting disinformation</p>
