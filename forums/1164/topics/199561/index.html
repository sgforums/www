            <div class='col-md body'>There are actually jammers to be used against GPS which is developed by the Russians. Since our SAF is so heavily dependant on GPS for targeting, it may be a good idea to have the ability to use an alternative satellite navigation system as back-up such as the European Galileo.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>GALILEO:<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/energy_transport/galileo/index_en.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/energy_transport/galileo/index_en.htm</a><br><br>Russian GPS jammer: <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/Article120517.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.computerweekly.com/Article120517.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, GPS jammers are nothing new. The US with a switch of a button could deny anyone with it's use. Think Gulf war.. even allies were denied.<br><br>So the Galileo as a back up is great but can be jammed just as well.</div>

Older ones are unlikely to get through the screen of advanced jammers available on most modern combat platforms such as ships and aircraft. Even newer ones such as the Russian AS-17 will be countered in time to come. Its a never ending race to produce advanced radar muntions which emit signals powerful enough to burn through heavy ECM or able to frequency hop to render older jammers ineffective against them. Alternatively, many missiles use inertial guidance before switching to active radar guidance in the terminal phase to give the defending forces minimal time to react. But the RSAF does not seem to have weapons of this class yet, at least from official sources.</div>

Else are GPS guided.<br><br>SAM.. are largely radar guided and if terminate at ECM homing.. else it's still is affected by radar jamming.. even under it's own active guidance<br><br>If you're talking about ASM, they are largely radar guided.. GPS guidance is nearly impossible. Cruize missle depends largely on GPS...<br><br>Disable the US GPS.. will render the US strike capability to a more conventional advantage.<br></div>
