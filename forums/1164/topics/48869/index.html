            <div class='col-md body'>The aircraft drill is mostly to be used against helicopters. It is very unlikely for a fast mover to spot infantrymen on the ground. Based on the experience in Iraq, small arms fire is quite deadly to helicopters, since they are easy to hit and have lots of fragile bits. I would not discount the aircraft drill. Of course, it won't save you from an airstrike (the bombs will be coming from way outside your range anyway), but you might get lucky against helos that cross your path.<br><br>Note that aircraft do not carry cluster bombs around all the time. If they do they are either on CAS (which means that they will be flying low so as not to accidentally hit their own troops whom you are probably fighting at the same time), or performing an interdiction airstrike (in which case they know you are there and you are finished). I would be more concerned about their cannon, which they always have and will gladly use to strafe you before radioing your position for an airstrike or artillery attack. And their cannon still have longer range than you. Sigh.<br><br>I wonder why we do not deploy more MANPAD systems. That would be a lot better, though I do not relish carrying even more weight. There seems to be a direction toward dual-use missile systems, which can attack both ground and air targets, like Starstreak. However, these systems are still too large for individual infantrymen. Maybe in some years time, we will have guided LAWs that double as MANPADs. That would really put some bite into the PBIs (poor bloody infantry).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps its really just meant to shoot combat helicopters or helos.  Cos it would definitely not kill a fighter, they move too fast, and can't be bothered with infantry anyway.  Also, dedicated CAS aircraft tend to be well armored enough to resist such "wall of lead" tactics.<br><br>*shrugs*<br><br>Play dead still sounds better to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for shooting at CAS planes, it's usually a bad idea unless they already know you are there and are coming after you... besides that, hide!<br><br>Anyway now with FLIR, it's impossible to hide. Saw that clip of the American AC-130 using 105mm shells on individual man targets in Afganistan? Reminds you that air superiority makes all the difference here. If we achieve air superiority, we dun have to worry about that and can use our airpower to swat the soldiers of Country M where they hide.</div>
