            <div class='col-md body'>Don't forget ground attack helicopters - I think we have the Apache Longbow.

I read a lot about Korea and Vietnam and napalm bombs is always what saved the day as not only is it obviously very destructive against ANY form of ground targets, it is also extremely demoralising for enemy when faced with the prospect of being burned alive.<br><br>In fact, in Korea, the North Koreans (NKPA) warned the allies against using phosphrous grenades as they fear this the most. They told the allies that anyone caught with WP grenades will be die a terrible death by being killed with their own WP grenades. (The NKPA killed any allied prisoner anyway but they consider death by shooting to be an act of kindness.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Airpower is "expensive" relative to other sort of indirect fire support like mortars, howizters(spelling) and direct firepower support like ATGW, RR, 75mm Gun and 25mm cannon.<br><br>As such, I think in most cases, airpower should be directed at strategic targets like division level CP, fuel dumps, tank parks and strategic bridges etc....  This could be out of range of other types of firepower .<br><br>Also can be used against mobile targets such as tanks. This is because it is not very effective to use artillery against tanks as only a direct or near miss will result in damage.

The people in these units mostly come from all branches of the army but work under the air force.  This ensures that "fratricide" is prevented because the guys who call in the air support (be it close air support or just a simple re-suppy drop)  know what is going on/ needs to be done, from their previous experience, and secondly , it provides for more intact liaison work within the formation.<br><br>I was in such a unit.  So don't worry....  training is very often and regular, to the extent that I was usually recalled for reservist training/ exercises at least 3 times a year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fuel Air Explosive would be great. Better than napalm.<br><br>The problem with "iron bombs" are that they don't usually do the job against well-dug-in infantry or MG nests.<br><br>With airburst munitions, Fuel Air Explosives or napalm, the enemy is not even safe in his foxhole or behind sandbags.<br><br>Wonder if we have all the other goodies like Cluster Bomb Units or smart bombs etc.<br><br>What were the best ground attack plane in Vietnam, Falklands, Iraq and what was the most effective ground attack ordnance? I'm not talking about tank busting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We do have Cluster Bombs and Smart Bombs.We have a unit which can be fitted to conventional "dumb bombs" which makes them smart as it is guided by GPS.<br><br>And yes its true,napalm and FAE(fueal Air Explosives) bombs are truly effective against troops even if they are in foxholes or tunnels,when the explosives explode,it will suck in all the oxygen in its effective radius so as to fuel the spread of the flames during the explosion.And the entire area will lack oxygen for like 5-10 seconds or more before there is oxygen again.But when you inhale is petroleum jelly which will scorch your lungs and kill you.<br><br>Napalm was used effectively in Vietnam and Korea,you can see the devasting effects of the weapon.Clothings and kit scorched off,skin peelin and whole bodies turning black.Wanna have a look of the effects of Napalm?Watch We Were Soldiers Once and Young.The cries of the troopers are indeed the same as the cries from hell.</div>
