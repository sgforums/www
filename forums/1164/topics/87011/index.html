            <div class='col-md body'>Just read from the mindef site that :<br><blockquote>NSmen who are pursuing full-time tertiary education in Local Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) and at approved private institutions are not disrupted from National Service. They can be called up for National Service activities such as IPPT and mobilisation manning. Those who are posted to units can be called up for ICT during their vacation period.<br></blockquote>For those guys who wish to go on to NTU , NUS or any local polytechnics after full time national service, won't that be a major disadvantage compared to those who don't have NSF or whom disrupted and went overseas to study.<br><br>ICT during vacation is fair enough i guess.<br>But how many times per year can MOB be carried out? How many times per year can they ask you back for IPPT? Excuse my ignorance because i still don't know much about reservists' related stuff.<br><br>If they ask you back for say 3 MOB per year, a few IPPTs and then vacation time they ask you back for ICT. If you fail IPPT have to attend RT  2-3 days per week.Then how the hell are you still expected to focus on studying i wonder <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Any tertiary students who completed NSF  (and were called back liao) here care to comment? How many times/days per year or even per semester you have to waste generally? Did it affect your grades or even  saboed you to fail on the whole?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dude, MINDEF have reached an agreement with the institutes that you guys will only be recalled during your holidays and will not disturb your studies, especially during exams.

But how about if they recall you often in a year for mobilisation? That will sorely affect your studies. Just recalling you 3 or 4 times before your exams (not during but before.) will basically finish a person off.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unless you have ICT for that workyear, otherwise you have to go for non-ICT IPPT.<br>As for mobilisation, can't say much for the rest. For me so far, I dun rem having being activated more than once per year even though there are multiple manning periods.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not anything new; I went thru the experience while at NUS between '89 &amp; '92. The "arrangement" mentioned earlier is informally termed - I dunno about official terminology - as "being in an IHL unit" (Institute of Higher Learning). One implication is that the relevant CO must design his ICT schedule around the local vasities' term holidays, nominally March-June back then, for the 1st 4 years or so of the training cycle (until the relevant NSmen presumably graduate).<br><br>There's why I suggested in a previous thread that you could technically end up doing 2 ICTs in a calendar year, with one being a "make-up" one. The window of opportunity is already limited with the IHL thing, then there's also IHL exams &amp; national holidays like CNY &amp; Hari Raya. A March ICT could thus be pushed forward to April or May, but be counted as the previous SAF workyear's.<br><br>Dunno about RT; it was a different regimen then. Also, all of us were still quite young/fit to pass the IPPT during the ICTs.<br><br>As for mob manning, it's not any more inconvenient compared to out in the working world. I stayed in the hostel, without a personal TV or table phone but I carried a pager - in other words, roughly same-same with the non-office workers out there - &amp; I recall my unit even particularly "arrowing" the IHL students to be Area I/C's too! (We could claim cab fares with a silent mob activation.) The word on the streets was - is? - that mobilization recalls tended to happen on weekends, so it's really not much difference with the rest of the NSmen.<br><br>What I can vividly remember, however, was being part of a contingent to perform for this SAF Tattoo event. It "counted" as one ICT; we ended up burning 9 consecutive weekends in parade rehearsals. That means booking in at 7:30 on Sundays (latter-ly Saturdays too), hanging around the camp until 15:30 before being transported to the National Stadium, &amp; not booking out until 23:45 or later. Luckily, I was largely vacationing as a NUS student then, but it was super-siong for the other NSmen, having to sacrifice their weekends time &amp; again after a long workweek ... &amp; being "imprisoned" in camp for half the time - with the canteen unopened, only training-shed concrete for naps, no proper bathrooms for washing up or showers, &amp; no gradual winding-down after each parade "high" prior to the new workweek.<br><br>The numbness &amp; disgruntedness boiled over into a memorable argument during the final sending in of rifles - partly cuz the IHL men were to out-process a day earlier (start of new school term), but some also jumped queue in desiring to catch the last bus/MRT, &amp; others wanting to return home to catch a soccer-tournament telecast. In the end, the SI cell people didn't even stamp my participation stint into my reservist booklet for that call-up.</div>
