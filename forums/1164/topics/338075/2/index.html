              <p>This is funny when the F-15C was designed with the expressed purpose of air superiority. It is actually a much heavier aircraft than the F-15A/B because they wanted it to carry more weapons and range. While it isn't as maneurverable as the Su-27 and its derivatives, fighter dogfighters these days are about who shoots first and not the who gets closer to each other. And the AIM-120 last I checked as pretty decent range vis a' vis against the R-77. Certainly not as great range as the Novator KS-172, but that missile was designed in mind to destroy AWACs and I'm not sure if it is agile enough to tackle a fighter.</p>

              <p>The Su-30's vaunted dogfight ability didn't seem to help much when it fought the F-15Cs at Nellis this year.  The F-15Cs with full A2A combat load, 2 fuel tanks, out fought the Su-30's in CLEAN configuration.  </p>
              <p>Apparently, the Su-30s turning capability is more greatly hampered by its own external stores and fuel load than the F-15s.  Bad load balancing, bad turning. </p>

              <p>i think shotgun is referring to the 08 red flag.</p>
              <p>yeap. the Su-30s had thrust vectoring apparently but thrust vectoring nozzles caused the Su-30 to be slow in turning (or so as far as i understand of it, dont quite get all the bits ) .</p>
              <p>The F15 pilots exploited this and forced the Su-30 into a turn which caused it to lose speed and be vulnerable to attack.</p>

To increase lifting effectiveness and enhance maneuverability of the aircraft, <a title="Canard (aeronautics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canard_%28aeronautics%29">canards</a> are installed.

              <p>Edit: Last check, performance of the F-15C is still better than
              that of the SU-30......but then what's the point of comparing that
              when much fighting these days is BVR.</p>

              <p>Haha, no lar, its not really comparison.  Cos at the end of the day, its not even BVR that triumphs.  Theres still factors like command n control, experience, logistics, etc to consider the true potential of a first class air force.</p>
              <p>The point about the Su-30 was not that it was not less manueverable, but that the F-15C STILL CAN compete against Su-30 in the WVR arena despite a slight manueverability advantage.  </p>
              <p>The TVC problem discussed on the youtube video of Red Flag 08 with the IAF, was really an issue of experience.  Inexperience from the IAF pilots, relied too much on their TVC to go "fangs out", causing loss of lift as the aircraft now pivots around its nose or  more forward CG.   When that happens, the aircraft not only loses altitude (due to loss of lift), but is in an crucial energy disadvantage, where relatively high T/W ratio fighters without thrust vectoring can take advantage of. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Firstly to clarify...my definition of canards..is that the indian Su-30MKI have canards and the malaysian MKM have them as well because the airframe is basically the MKI itself as for the what planes the vietnamese are fighting they are the Su-30MK2V which is a modified chinese MKK fighter...Personally the Su-35BM or 37 is still the best...in my opinion</p></div>

              <p>From my personal view, it look like an arms race between Malaysian and Singapore. If Singapore buy new weapon, Malaysia will also buy such weapon. Different weapon, but on the same class. Such as F-15SG for Singapore, Malaysia then buy Su-30 MKM.</p>
              <p>Well, Singapore is wealthier than Malaysia. How long Malaysia could take this way??? Until her economic collapse? Ha...ha...ha... I dont think so.</p>
