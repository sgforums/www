As such, they choose the safest and easy way out by giving the instruction on THERE WILL NOT BE LEFT HANDED FIRER FOR THIS WEAPON. The same situation happened to our Ultimax100 as well.</div></blockquote>Left handers already cannot handle the GPMG, 84, LAW, SAW. Add in SAR and you might as well make them all clerks.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by quivalen:</div><div class="quote_body">just wondering what you mean by it not being a 'field weapon'?<br><br>fibua-wise i think it's too long - a carbine'd be better.</div></blockquote>SAR was designed for the infantry i believe (correct me if i'm wrong). But it's a tad too heavy. Infantry move to contact for 3-5 days out in the field and by the 5th day you just want to chuck the SAR away in a deep hole. FBO + SAR in brunei for 4 days straight was pure hell.<br><br>Another major problem is night firing. The scope is totally useless at night, and the LAD lights only solve part of the problem. There WILL always be blur idiots that misuse it, cocking up the whole show by reavealing your platoon/coy position, no matter how well they're trained. Even if no one cocks up, during the fire fight, you will reveal your positions to the enemy and that makes you easier to pick out. Furthermore, if your LAD is zeroed at 100m, it's useless at 75m or 125m as the spot you're pointing at is NOT what your is round hitting. Hence, your LAD is only useful under 2 conditions 1) within 10-20 m of whatever range you zeroed it at, and 2) if the target is 5 meters away, it's so close it won't make a difference anyway.<br><br><strong>But</strong> the SAR is a well balanced weapon, meaning the CG of the weapon is somewhere near the trigger. That, combined with the light recoil (that some complain makes it feel like a toy gun) helps you aim better and ensure that you maintain your fire at the same spot continuously.<br><br>Hence my opinion is that the SAR is better suited for static deployment like guard duty, POI, Ops bacinet and so on. Defending a BUA could be another option, but SAF hardly does that.<br><br>Maybe if they further improve the design/weight of the SAR, we could use it effectively in the field.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just converted to the SAR21 during my ICT recently. Basically, I find the overall performance of the weapon to be better than the M16. Sure it has its limitations, but in terms of handling and firing, its still better than the M16.<br><br>As for some of the comments on this thread, I agree with some of it, but others are plain ridiculous so as to speak....here are some of my views<br><br>Point 1<br>This weapon was not meant for left-handers. Unfortunately this is the sad truth, but you can't please everyone, esp. when they had factored in the safety aspect in the event of a chamber explosion, and designed a kevlar protection plate opposite the ejector port to protect the firer's face.<br><br>Point 2<br>Fire selection switch. Its inconvenient, but I don't believe any soldier would bother to switch fire in the middle of a fire-fight with the enemy, cos he/she would have fire in auto mode anyway!!!!<br><br>Point 3<br>Night firing, AFAIK its still better when you're using the sight compared to the M16, although adding a tritium sight would be an added bonus.<br><br>Point 4<br>It pointless comparing to the carbine as this is totally different. ST could simply shorten the barrel if they want to replace the carbine for FIBUA. But then the same soldier who had fought using the carbine during FIBUA would probably have curse and swear when he has to shoot the enemy at 300m!!!<br><br>Point 5<br>Much easier if you need to bash thru dense vegetation. Period.<br><br>Point 6<br>Easier to maintain and clean than M16<br><br>Point 7<br>less recoil than M16 due to CG of the weapon, which means you don't have to take so long for follow-up shots.<br><br>These are my thoughts. Comments welcome.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what i have to say is that every weapon is always built with some good advantages and those bad ones. althought m4 carbine barrel is short and shoot range is not really good but it is good in the CQB assault. and SAR 21 is much lighter in weight and shoot range better than m4, but is not good for the lefties.<br>what i have to say that every weapon is built to help the user to shoot better and move faster of swiftly. but it all depends on the user itself, how he use it, how he get use to his weapon, it all depends on him/her.</div>

The M4 is as accurate as the normal M16. Just becoz it's shorter dun mean its less accurate, especially if you know how to use it. It was once believed that no-one in our coy could get marksmanship using the M4/Carbine but a few proved them wrong. Even our CSM did it in style, shooting straight sets of figure 15s from 300m out.</div>
