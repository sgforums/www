            <div class='col-md body'>Apperently they did not go though with the plan to put VLS on the BB's and decom all the ships.But they have kept 2 on in mothball state just incase they needed firepower.And the Arsenal ships has been cancelled meaning the US lacks ships with a big OMPF!!Too bad they will just have to use their carriers more i guess.</div>
