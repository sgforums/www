Imagine simply 6 of these missile at Suntec City.....anyway comments?</div></blockquote>Alrite just to dispel a few notions about any MLRS in service worldwide. Powerful conventional weapons? No doubt. But no weapon is ever invulnerable. MLRS systems have their weaknesses too. Long reload times make them vulnerable to air strikes and counter battery fire by friendly artillery. MLRS systems form part of a delicate system of locating radars, supply and reload vehicles and well-trained crew. The destruction of any one component will make these MLRS as effective as a child throwing stones in foggy weather.<br><br>In any case, a few hundred rockets, maybe even thousands, landing on Singapore will cause heavy civilian causalties. But it is impossible to wipe out our hardened bases and sheer number of armour and artillery with just that one salvo. Singapore is small, but not small to the effect that rockets armed with only 50-100lb warheads will raze it to the ground. I am tired of hearing the same old story of how just a few bombs can destryo Singapore. A few buildings... possible... But the whole nation? It will take more than a half-baked effort by just some over zealous commander with his battalion of MLRS to take us down.<br><br>Btw, to take out a building as large as Suntec, you need at least 6 bombs with blast fragmentation / incendiary 2000lb warheads to do the job. 6 rockets might just manage to blow a few holes in the rooftops.</div>

But one must remember also that yep the rocket look big, but 80-90% of it carry rocket fuel and guidance system - thus the warhead is almost like a artillery shell only . Thus the destruction power is not really much more of our 155mm arty.<br><br>Never hit suntec city !!! It will do some damages, but the enemy will die the most horror death.

            <div class='col-md body'>"There are 4 warhead variants for the ASTROS launchers; the 32-round SS-30, 16-round SS-40, 4-round SS-60 and the 4-round SS-80. The difference in the variants is dependent on the weight and size of the rockets they fire. The numbers used in the variants indicates the range of the rockets; an example would be the SS-80 which has an impressive range of 80 km."<br><br>The pros of the MLRS is that it can fire all its ammo in under a minute.<br><br>All these units can be individually located in diverse locations but ranged and timed to hit the same target at the same time. For example, they can have 1 launcher in Kluang, 1 in Malaccca, and 1 in Muar but they all fire at, say PL Airbase - and timed so that the rockets all land at the same time. This means that within a span of a couple of minutes, PL Airbase will receive 48 incoming rockets from just 3 launchers.<br><br>Another 3 launchers can be ranged in on C Airbase, S Airbase, air defense missile and radar sites and so on. This will immobilise our airforce long enough for their airforce and artillery to bring further destruction to our runways and other installations.<br><br>It won't destroy our airforce and some planes will already scramble as soon as the firing is detected. But it will have the effect of limiting our air capability if used effectively.<br><br>A battery of conventional howitzers will take a much longer time to deliver this same amount of ordnance, giving important seconds, even minutes, for people to take cover, for more jet fighters to scramble etc.<br><br>Then after firing they'll all scoot.<br><br>This dispersion as well as the shoot and scoot method will make counter battery fire or airstrike to Search &amp; Destroy these launchers harder. (This method of dispersing launchers was practiced by Cold War ICMB units).<br><br>The cons of the MLRS is that they are less accurate than our howitzers.</div>
