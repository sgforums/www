            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for a 50 MLRS salvo sneak attack to succeed on Singapore, it would probably mean we lost the intelligence war.  If that happens, we are screwed anyways.<br><br>But if that didn't happen, and we know they are coming with us with MLRS, I think chances are most of the MLRS will be taken down, minus a few that actually get to launch.<br><br>Reason for not killing them all:  It gives us a damn good case on the UN to have some press coverage of MAF MLRS rockets barraging suntec city, with all the women and children shopping innoncently there.  Of course, its also an excuse to open a huge can of whoop ass.<br><br>MLRS: I'm not impressed by it.  Its not an artillery asset that is easily available. Nor can it sustain fire.  An MLRS maybe able to get off a large wave of initial fire, but we can shoot all day long with howitzers, provided we don't run out of shells. At more than 4 rounds per minute, with ICMs,  and the amount of Howitzer we have, its a steel rain.</div>
