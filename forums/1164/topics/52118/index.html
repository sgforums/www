            <div class='col-md body'>Lats pulldowns are of limited use because they do not precisely replicate the movement in a chin-up.<br><br>The most effective way of doing it is to keep going until you can do no more, take a short break, and do it again, and to keep repeating this cycle until you get onto the bar and cannot complete a single chin-up.<br><br>You ought to get results fairly quickly following that routine on a daily basis - I started from doing one at the beginning of secondary school and worked my way up to 28 by the time I enlisted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>push ups mainly target the triceps, chest n shoulders whereas pull ups mainly target ur lats (upper back), biceps, forearms, shoulders, chest n a bit of abs.<br><br>when doing lat pull downs, u will train more of ur shoulders if u pull the bar back. when doing pull ups, try not to cross ur legs as u r using more of ur lower back instead of targeting the right muscles which is supposed to b the upper body. when doing intervals, try to limit the resting time to b within 1.5 - 2 mins, or there would b of liitle effect if ur muscles haf recovered fully. as u get stronger, reduce the resting time btwn the intervals progressively until below 1 min.<br><br>doing isometrics oso helps, juz pull urself up till ur arm form a 90-degree angle n hang there if u still cant pull urself up fully.</div>

It's very reliable. The only thing is the spongy pad which is supposed to help in your grip on the bar. It will sort of 'dehydrate' up after a while and tear.

            <div class='col-md body'>My pull up got some problem. You have to sort of turn the bar so that it lengthens and fixes to the doorway right? You have to lengthen the bar tightly else the bar will come off. But i duno why my bar can't lengthen until its tight. I tried to lengthen it but it stil becomes super loose.</div>

Girls are really light mah. So they don't have so much weight to carry when they pull. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
