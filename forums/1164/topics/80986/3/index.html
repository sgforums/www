The Sovremenny destroyers are marvellous vessels and would present an American Carrier Group with a dangerous threat.<br><br>The PLA Air Force is also catching up to the US.. they are acquiring more and more next-generation fighters from Russia that could challenge the supremarity of America's best fighters. Heard their pilots are also becoming on par with that of the US in terms of skill.<br><br>China is no Iraq. The US will have a very tough fight against China if war ever breaks out. I pray it doesn't, but if it does, the scale of the conflict will be bigger than the two Gulf wars, perhaps the biggest thing since WWII, as it will drag countries such as Japan and South Korea into this. It will be nothing short of a disaster for East Asia if such a thing happens.<br><br>So bai bai to your tua pek kong that such a war would never break out, even if it does mean that Taiwan has to forget about independence to avoid the loss of the lives of thousands. </div></blockquote>True true. But then the Chinese would still need a couple more years to acheive full operational status and integration of the Soveremmys into their navy right? Though they bought alot of fanciful stuff in recent years, they still dun have much experience in using these stuff and I believe skill-wise they still lag behind the Americans and the Taiwanese.<br><br>But I agree with you and our Ah-Goh. Any war would be a big thing.</div>

Bloody effective tactic. But what about the US's response then? The latest Arleigh Burke destroyers are also Aegis equipped right? Plus Japan's own Aegis cruisers which would likely be deployed to support any US military operation, perhaps the US would be able to pay the Chinese back in their own coin: an overwhelming number of Aegis-equipped crusiers and destroyers.<br>Not sure about the layer of anti-missile defence provided by the fighters though. The AIM-54 Phoneix is probably outdated already and the AMRAAMs dun seem very good too. Still, I have faith that the US should be able to think of something up. As one of the previous articles on the PLA reveal, the Chinese always like to 'tua pao' i.e. talk big, and a PLA general himself commented that the Americans are more pragmatic.<br><br>The EU's move is pretty surprising. They have always been very famous for their excellent human rights policy, which is even better than that of the US  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . E.g. they refused to sign a FTA with ASEAN because of Myanmmar's repressive government. Really dunno why they lifting the arms embargo with the full knowledge that the arms would be used by a Communist bully to suppress a democratic Taiwan. Hope that the left-wing elements in the EU would prevail and prevent such a scenairo from happening.      </div></blockquote>Japan would not take part in any move to protect Taiwan. Their own constitution does not allow it, nor would their economic interests in China. No JMSDF ship would escort any CVBG against Taiwan. Being an active participant would result in Chinese missiles raining on their heads. At the most Japan would allow US to conduct offensive operations from their soil, but even that would require lots of arm-twisting of the Japanese from the Americans, since the Status of Forces Agreement only extends to US forces in Japan protecting Japan from external attack. Same for S Korea. All 3 economies are too intertwined.<br><br>As for EU/Myanmar vs EU/China, its all about the money. Theres a lot more to lose from EU sanctions on China than on Myanmar.

But Koizumi's redefinition of Japan's so-called 'peace constitution' by sending troops to Iraq symbolizes just how far the Japanese mentality has changed. Previously they were content with just making money. But with the emergence of North Korea's nuclear threat, they have rallied behind the US and became more gung-ho in security. Japan now wants to be a complete power i.e. with politico-security as well as economic power. If I remember correctly, the US-Japan security alliance, which was renewed in 1997, outlined a role for Japan's SDF in any conflicts in East Asia. Remember China made a big fuss about it coz it could be interpreted to allow Japanese involvement in Taiwan.<br><br>Yeah, politics is mostly driven by money. But it can also be driven by ideals. I'm just hoping that the latter would prevail loh. What's good abt China? But Taiwan, now that's different. Got democracy, got chio bu, got lotsa fun stuff and I haven't even visited it yet! So I definitely dun wan it to be attacked by China.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the Russians claim that the SS-N-22 Sunburn anti-shipping missiles will be able to penetrate through any Aegis-defence... While nobody has actually been there to see it happen so far (I for one wouldn't want to witness such an event for it would mean full-scale war), the Russian has shown a proficiency in producing missiles that are technologically more advanced than their Western counterpart, especially in the area of anti-shipping missiles, so an overwhelming number of Aegis cruisers might not be the answer to the threat posed.<br><br>Furthermore, while China is no saint, it is Taiwan that is upping the ante right now and destabilizing the region at the same time. That is something that is extremely risky and have a high possibility of backfiring on everybody concerned. For Japan to come in on the side of Taiwan is also a 50-50 possibility, especially in actual military intervention. Japan can expect itself to be devastated by the crusie missiles and SRBMs that China has, for she is very much closer to China than the US is. Furthermore, even with a anti-missile shield in place, it is highly unlikely that such wil prove sufficient to keep out all of the Chinese missiles. And the one thing that Communist countries have proved very adapt at is esponaige and it is guaranteed that Japan's home island has its fair share of Chinese agents...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>China and US are unlikely to face war if China play with the right card. The only way war will break out is China attack Taiwan. If China dont attack Taiwan, Taiwan can never get independence. Why i said this is becos China has international backing that Taiwan is part of China. If Taiwan declear independence and China juz complain to UN, Taiwan will be sitting duck. Every countries (that will include USA)  in the world wont recongise Taiwan as a country. Trade may decrease from it and Taiwan will be a lone ranger with no other countries to support her. Wat can Taiwan do when economy collaspe, high unemployment rate,etc... Mayb quitely go back to China arms and cry lor.</div>
