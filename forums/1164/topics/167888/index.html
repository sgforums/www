Apache attack<br>helicopters, F-16 fighter aircraft and artillery platforms fired their weapons<br>in a precise attack coordinated by a datalink network to destroy an 'enemy'<br>armoured column.<br>For 12 days, the 329 SAF officers and men had been carrying out a series of<br>exercises to validate the three core capabilities of the 3G SAF - precision<br>strike, unmanned warfare, and Integrated Knowledge Command and Control (IKC2).<br>IKC2 employs electronic technology to transmit information received by<br>sensors like unmanned aerial vehicles to military commanders and weapons<br>platforms like the Apaches so that they can act swiftly and decisively.<br>The culmination of all the exercises was yesterday's live-fire operation.<br>The scenario began with SAF commandos and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)<br>detecting and tracking the movement of enemy armour while simultaneously<br>relaying information back to their command headquarters.<br>This flow of real-time data gave command HQ the critical situational<br>awareness to coordinate attacks in a dynamic battlefield environment.<br>Once the 'enemy' armoured column entered a designated 'kill box', Command HQ<br>activated weapon platforms that included the Apaches, F-16 fighter aircraft and<br>artillery.<br>The outcome: Precise and overwhelming fire finished off the armoured column.<br>The heart of the third-generation, or 3G, SAF, is the use of new technology<br>to give it a more deadly punch. This includes integrating weapons, sensors and<br>other systems into a network to multiply their combat power.<br>In contrast, the critical task facing the first generation SAF was<br>developing into a credible fighting force, while the second generation one<br>focused on systems that gave it better capabilities with fewer men.<br>Later, at the Strategic Expeditionary Landing Field, used by the SAF Apaches<br>and Chinooks, Dr Ng met the personnel of all the SAF elements involved in the<br>exercise.<br>Asked for his impressions of the exercise, he said: 'It has been very<br>impressive and I'm happy with the outcome ... We would be constantly building<br>our capabilities. There is a lot of work to be done. But we are on the right<br>track.<br>'The fact that men and machines, coming from thousands of miles away, have<br>performed well gives us great confidence in the capabilities of the SAF. It is<br>a complex technology that we're putting together. All in all, the exercise has<br>been successful in meeting our objectives.'<br>He also expressed his appreciation to the US government for allowing the SAF<br>to conduct the exercise on American soil. 'We have excellent ties with the US<br>government. On the ground, relations between our soldiers and the US Marines<br>have also been excellent,' he commented.<br><br>felix@sph.com.sg(FELIX SOH)<br><br>2.This ex break a new ground for  SAF.</div>
