            <div class='col-md body'>RSK MiG is discussing with Malaysia upgrade options for its fleet of MiG-29s. MiG says it has offered an upgrade to the MiG-29SMT configuration, but acknowledges it is likely to be too expensive. The more basic MiG-29SM is also being offered and MiG says it is still waiting for a specification from the Malaysian air force. Irkut, meanwhile, says deliveries of the 18 Sukhoi Su-30MKMs Malaysia ordered in 2003 are due to begin in 2007.<br><br><a href="http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/12/13/Navigation/177/203609/MiG-29+upgrades.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/12/13/Navigation/177/203609/MiG-29+upgrades.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In case some of u dunno M'sia's Mig29 history, here it is.<br><br>In June 1992, Russia decided to clear the MiG-29S (but not the MiG-29M) and R-77 (NATO: AA-12 Archer) active radar-guided missiles for export. The export version proposed was the MiG-29SE 9.13SE, although this type was never built. It was basically the MiG-29S with some equipment downgrades and provision for Western navigation, communication, and IFF equipment. This program was to include a downgraded N019ME Topaz radar, a semi-active flight control system, strengthened internal wing structures and "wetting" to allow 3,000 kg of ordnance or three fuel tanks to be carried, and provision for R-77 missiles. At the time, no customer could be found because all potential buyers wanted more air-to-ground capabilities than those provided by the simple unguided weapons the aircraft could carry.<br><br>Due to the failure of MiG-29 export efforts since 1993, even when offered as a modernization of existing MiG-29 9.12 airframes, plans for a further improved variant were developed for the export market. It was called the MiG-29SD 9.13SD. The main difference between this aircraft and the MiG-29SE was the addition of a mid-air refueling probe on the left side of front fuselage. The aircraft's principle shortcoming of limited air-to-ground capability was not addressed, but all avionics and equipment were up to Russian Air Force standards with no downgrades. The only foreign customer for this version was found in June 1994, when contract for delivery of 16 MiG-29SD and 2 MiG-29UB for the Royal Malaysian Air Force was signed. The aircraft were locally called MiG-29N and MiG-29NUB, respectively<br><br>An interesting aspect of this sale was that the Royal Malaysians apparently thought they were purchasing MiG-29 9.13 version aircraft, which is distinguished from the 9.12 by having the Gardenya RF jammer. However, the delivered MiG-29SDs were based on 9.12B and lacked the jammer, which had not been cleared for export by Russian authorities. These aircraft were delivered in March-June 1995 and entered service with the No 17 and No 19 Squadrons of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF). They differed from Russian 9.12 versions by their English cockpit markings; instruments scaled in feet, knots, and miles; and some Western navigation and communication equipment, including the AN/ARN-139 tactical air navigation system, GPS, an instrument landing system, and an IFF system.<br><br>Malaysia was not very impressed with the aircraft. The biggest problem was the low serviceability rate, caused mainly by the country's hot and wet climate. Initially, no change had been made to the avionics bay environment control systems. Russian service support was very poor and Malaysia decided not to buy any more MiG fighters. But the RMAF did decide to upgrade its aircraft to the "real" MiG-29SD standard and a contract to this effect was signed in October 1997. All single seat aircraft received a N019ZM Topaz ZM radar set, a reinforced airframe with 4,000-kg load capability (centerline and inside wing pylons with 1,000-kg load capability and outer wing stations with 500-kg load capability), provision for two under-wing fuel tanks, the ability to carry R-77 missiles, and a mid-air refueling probe. The aircraft rebuilt to this specification flew in April 1998. The upgrade of the remaining machines was conducted at Aerospace Technologies Systems Corporation at Kuantan, Malaysia, through late 1999 with Russian delivered kits.<br><br>And there u have it.  Barter trade.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks to Shotgun for the info above.<br><br>So Malaysia's MiG-29N is in fact an export MiG-29SD. This means that even after the 1998 upgrade it is not likely to be as capable as the cancelled MiG-29M or the current production variant MiG-29SMT.<br><br>The latest MiG-29SMT-II and the MiG-29OVT are even more capable warplanes and they were offered to India to meet its 126 warplane requirement. Interesting note that the MiG-29OVT is also known as the MiG-35, probably an attempt to boost future sales.<br><br>The latest naval variant MiG-29SMTK has already been ordered by the Indian navy, comprising 16 orders with 30 options.</div>
