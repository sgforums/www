It is quite possible the Flanker and co. can do such a feat as well, given they all have pseudo lifting bodies that can generate lift when the wing is gone.<br><br>That is if you fight control computer has not been shot up by the damage or critical systems compromised by the loss of the wing.</div>

All are heroes in my opinion, the buddies who brought him to the doctor and the medical crew. I suppose the EOD guys ain't far away from the medical crew in this case, so they deserve credit too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The funny thing is that it doesnÂ’t even seem like they are making an effort to be realistic at all, but they happily believe their own press anyway.<br><br>It seems to me that propaganda and journalism are basically the same thing with them, though they canÂ’t really beat the Iraqi Information Minister, who was so bold in making his claims that some people simply found it hard to believe he was lying because the things he said were so incredibleÂ… Many Iraqis soldiers and foreign fighters had the impression the Yanks were stalled far down south even until Abrams tanks started rolling up to them and shooting them up, and even then they tried to explain it away as Â“4-5 tanks that made it all the way upÂ” (mysteriously without any form of support or supplies).<br><br>One officer was told to investigate the claim that Â“4-5 American tanksÂ” were moving around in Baghdad airport and reported back Â“Are you out of your mind? The whole American army is there!Â”. Speaks a lot about their accurate information sharing capability.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though while we are on the topics of military feats, other nations arenÂ’t that far behind as wellÂ… that is if their accounts are to be believed.<br><br><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=tH5RR4DNsuQ" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=tH5RR4DNsuQ</a><br><br>Like for the Yanks they had a marine squad pinned down on a roof by two insurgent snipers, the squad managed to pull off an amazing shot with their M203 to take out one with a direct hit, and then the other with an AT4. All this was done at extreme range (300 yards) under sniper fire, where they only had a split second to fire their weapons while they broke cover. The M203 was fired by the operator while he was lying on his back! He was either very lucky or very good to blow out the window at such extreme range.<br><br>Though it did help them that the insurgent snipers were of the inexperienced kind who thought that not relocating after every shot and firing their SVDs continually to give off their position was good sniper practice.<br><br>And of course, we did have the Scotts who bayonet-charged a bunch of insurgents and killed them all after getting frustrated by their harassing hit-and-run ambushes. If I had a wild Scottsman charging me with foam at his mouth and wanting to stick cold steel into my belly I would be very afraid too...<br></div>
