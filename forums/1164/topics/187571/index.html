            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think the americans will find it easy to fight the iranians, the iranians fought the numerically and technologically superior iraqi's into a stalemate in the 8 year war, is not so easy lah. Somemore there is no basis to go to war with iran, iran is not harboring any terrorists that the americans are after.<br><br>I think what will happen is like this. The iranians will do a nuclear test on their own soil that will be picked up by amercian satelites. Americans and UN will vote for embargo against iran, maybe moscow and china will not vote. If bush want to press for war, the iranians will do a long range missile test that can fly over vew thousand kilometers, the americans will take the hint and back off.<br><br>Then after a few years and maybe under a new american administration they will find an excuse to friend iran again and make money by selling them everything from F16 jet fighters to tanks to commercial development etc ...<br><br>just like what happen to pakistan and india lor... under clinton admin both did a nuclear test both kanna embargoed by americans and allies then shortly under bush admin 9/11 happened pakistan became useful ally again and indian intelligence was roped into the war against terror ... both convieniently resumed relations with USA ... aiyah no war one lah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally believe a full scale war with Iran will not be possible.<br><br>Bush already is in deep trouble for getting US into Iraq based on false allegations that they have WMD. Now they are basically stuck there as they cannot pull out before a credible and friendly Iraqi governmnet which can maintain law and order in Iraq is in place. This Iraq war is getting too many US soldiers killed and is increasingly unpopular in US and in the international community. Blair is against getting UK into Iran. At this point of time starting another war will almost definitely be political suicide of the Bush administration. Iran can easily increase US's problems coverty by training Iraqi insurgents, supplying weapons and explosives and even send in their own men disguised as terrorists to create more chaos in Iraq. US knows they are already doing so but, this sort of thing very hard to find concrete evidence.<br><br>I think they will try to resolve this diplomatically but its not going to work because Iran knows that US already got its hands full in Afganistan and Iraq. International embargoes also have little effect as China and Russia will exercise veto. Even is passed enforcement is going to be a problem due to lack of resources. I think at the very most will be air strikes but that runs the risk of retaliation by Iran on coalition troops and Israel with ballistic missiles possibly armed with nuclear weapons or chemical and biological ones.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The launching took place in the Russian Far East.<br><br>Shimon Eckhaus, the firmÂ’s chief executive, told Reuters earlier on April 25: "The capabilities of the satellite speak for themselves. I do not need to say anything about what the purpose of its use might be."<br><br>A report in Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth said the Eros B satellite has a camera which can distinguish objects on the ground as small as 70 centimeters (about two feet) across.<br><br>Eckhaus confirmed the accuracy of the published details to Reuters.<br>The report said Eros B will join an earlier version of the satellite, launched in December 2000. Both are set to augment the work of IsraelÂ’s declared spy satellite, Ofek 5, which regularly passes over Arab territory.<br><br>The Yedioth report said Israel was planning to send up another spy satellite with the ability to view objects in all weather conditions and in darkness. The Eros satellites are effective only in daylight and in clear visibility.<br><br>The launch comes at a time of heightened tension over IranÂ’s nuclear program.<br><br>The United States accuses Iran of seeking to build nuclear bombs and has refused to rule out military options if diplomacy fails to curb the Islamic RepublicÂ’s atomic ambitions.
