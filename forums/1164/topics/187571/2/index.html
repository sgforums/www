You know that US Presidents comes and Goes, but the Backbenches remain mostly the same and they holds the real power.<br><br>Look at Rumsfield, Cheney, Albright etc... they spans a career more than thirty years regardless who's elected... they accumulate power like eunuchs. and simply continue their legacy they left off.. when their party gets elected... which sadly are only two noticable ones in the US.<br><br>Unless the both teams are thoroughly replaced. The PNAC plan will continue. Then Again they could could influence thru proxy.... because good campaign contributors are more or less that same old few. Military and Oil companies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There wont be war after all.<br><br>"The UN Security Council mulled a binding Franco-British draft resolution demanding a halt to Iran's uranium enrichment work as Paris ruled out using force to end the standoff with Tehran.<br><br>Envoys of the council's five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- met behind closed doors to review the text as technical experts of the full 15-member council met separately to pore over it for possible changes.<br><br>"We had a very frank discussion and we understand better our positions," French ambassador Jean-Marc de La Sabliere said as he emerged from the gathering. "We will propose another meeting tomorrow. I still believe we can have things move swiftly."<br><br>"We had a good discussion," British ambassador Emyr Jones Parry concurred. "We (the P5) are going to meet again tomorrow morning.'<br><br>"I hope the full council will meet in the afternoon (Friday) to consider where we are," US Ambassador John Bolton said.<br><br>Council ambassadors meanwhile awaited instructions from their capitals ahead of a vote which US officials now say is not expected before Monday's New York meeting of foreign ministers of six major powers working on the Iran nuclear issue.<br><br>The six countries are Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- the five veto-wielding council permanent members -- plus Germany.<br><br>In Washington, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said ambassadors of the "P5" plus Germany would discuss the draft over dinner in New York on Monday.<br><br>"I don't really expect it (the resolution) to come to a vote before the dinner," a senior US official, speaking on background on condition of anonymity, said in Washington.<br><br>In his first public reaction to the draft, Iran's UN envoy Javad Zarif said that "if it is an attempt to get Iran to agree, it is not a good one ... Iran does not respond to threats and intimidation."<br><br>Iran insists its nuclear ambitions are strictly peaceful. But Washington and its European allies accuse Tehran of using its civilian programme as a cover to build atomic weapons.<br><br>The Franco-British draft invokes Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which can authorize economic sanctions or even military action as a last resort in cases of threats to international peace and security. It needs at least nine yes votes and no veto from any of the council's five permanent members to pass.<br><br>It demands that Iran suspend "all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, and suspend the construction of a reactor moderated by heavy water".<br><br>It also calls on all states to "exercise vigilance" in preventing the transfer to Iran of equipment that could assist its nuclear and missile programmes.<br><br>The text, drafted in close consultations with Germany and the United States, did not set a specific timeframe for Iran to comply, but France's UN Ambassador Jean-Marc de La Sabliere said Tehran was expected to do so "no later than early June".<br><br>Russia and China have already indicated that they have a problem with the reference to Chapter 7, because it had been used by Washington to justify going to war in Iraq even though there was no explicit UN authorization.<br><br>Beijing and Moscow, which have close trading ties with Tehran, are cool to sanctions and adamantly oppose resorting to military action against Iran.<br><br>In Paris, French Premier Dominique de Villepin also said Thursday that military action was not the answer, drawing on the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq as an example.<br><br>"We know that not only would it not solve anything, but that sometimes worsens, further, the situation. We saw that in a clear way with Iraq," he noted.<br><br>Meanwhile Washington rejected a call by one of its key allies, Germany, for one-on-one US-Iran talks on Tehran's nuclear programme. Iran and the United States have not had direct relations since 1980, which many experts say is a major factor in the current diplomatic impasse.<br><br>In another burst of defiance, Iran claimed Thursday it had made more progress in ultra-sensitive nuclear work.<br><br>"Iran can now mass-produce centrifuges. This is an important success, because no other country was willing to sell us this technology," a deputy head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Hossein Faghihian, was quoted as saying in Iranian media.<br><br>Centrifuges are used to enrich uranium for either nuclear reactor fuel or atomic bomb material. - CNA<br><br>US no support.</div>
