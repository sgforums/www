            <div class='col-md body'>Just some pictures of the SH-60 Helos the RSN is currently evaluating...<br><br>The Seahawk is a twin-engine helicopter. It is used for anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, drug interdiction, anti-ship warfare, cargo lift, and special operations. The Navy's SH-60B Seahawk is an airborne platform based aboard cruisers, destroyers, and frigates and deploys sonobouys (sonic detectors) and torpedoes in an anti-submarine role. They also extend the range of the ship's radar capabilities.<br><br>The U.S. Navy plans to convert all SH-60Bs, as well as 18 SH-60Fs, to multi-mission SH-60Rs. The new version will feature advanced radar, missiles, low frequency sonar and a host of other improvements.<br><br>Hopefully we might get the SH-60Rs instead of the older SH-60Bs.The "Rs" are more mission capable for our use, especially network centric warfare capability.<br><br>The SH-60R will help advance the Navy's Network Centric Warfare (NCW) mission; avionics upgrades will make the Hawkeye more NCW-friendly. And as crucial battles become more and more concentrated on the shores of the world's bodies of water instead of on the open sea, the upgrades are aimed at optimizing the Hawkeye for littoral operations. The modifications being effected are substantial. It's getting a new cabin, the tail is being given a service life extension, and the helo's avionics have gotten a significant upgrade. The new glass common cockpit (which it will share with the SH-60S) and the other modifications will reduce logistics and life-cycle costs. Major upgrades to both flight and mission avionics, as well as offensive and defensive weapons and countermeasures will occur during theconversion.  These upgrades will include:<br><br>* Upgraded Mission and Flight Displays<br>* Improved Advanced Flight Control Computer (LECP)<br>* Radar upgrade<br>* ESM Upgrade<br>* Improved Integrated Self Defense<br>* Dipping Sonar upgrade (ALFS)<br><br><strong>Additionally, the non-mission specific (flight) avionics are designed to be the same as the new CH-60.  The goal is that a pilot can shift from an ASW mission to a SAR mission to a Cargo mission and be looking at the same cockpit.</strong><br><br>Although the airframe itself is not new, the SH-60R program has considerable risk due to the reliability problems with ALFS, higher than expected false alarm rates on the Advanced Radar Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD) program of the MMR, anticipated additional problems with the MMR and incorporation of a new cockpit that will be common to the CH-60.<br><br>More upgrades for the SH-60R<br><br>The SH-60(R) Multi-Mission Helicopter Upgrade (formally called LAMPS MK III Block II Upgrade) brings improvements to the SH-60 B/F helicopters now in the fleet. The SH-60R program will give Seahawks a life extension to 20,000 flight hours, to provide a multi-mission platform capable of conducting undersea and surface warfare for the next 20 to 25 years. This upgrade improves the capability of the LAMPS MK III Weapons System to provide battle group protection and to add significant capability in <strong>coastal littorals and regional conflicts</strong>. The SH-60RÂ’s systems will be able to deal with high numbers of air and sea contacts in a confined space, in shallow water. It will operate with a carrier group, or with a surface action group, where no air cover is available. To fight and survive in this environment, detection systems will be added to the SH-60R that include a new multimode radar, FLIR sensor, ESM system and a retrievable, active, low-frequency sonar with significantly greater processing power.<br><br>Improvements include the addition of two stores stations, a data bus, advanced low-frequency sonar, acoustic processor, multimode radar, Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor, upgraded ESM system and integrated self-defense system. The MAD gear will be deleted. Cockpit mission system improvements include the addition of an upgraded mission computer, improved communications suite, high-resolution displays, programmable keysets and tactical aids. The SH-60R will carry AGM-119 Penguin antishipping missiles and AGM-114 Hellfire anti-armor missiles, as well as the current MK 46 and MK 50 ASW torpedoes and a door-mounted 7.62 mm machine gun. <strong>The SH-60R will also incorporate new Light Imaging Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) laser technology. LIDAR is an ASW/Mine Warfare laser targeting system.</strong><br><br>SH-60B Seahawk<br><img src="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/images/sh-60b-lamps-406lg2.jpg"><br><br>SH-60F Seahawk with Hellfire missiles<br><img src="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/images/SH-60F_Hellfire.jpg"><br><br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I hoped RSN will get the latest version of SH-60<br><br>because this SH-60 R is mutli-purpose , therefore , it can be used by both RSAF and RSN.. to maximise the potential of this helo.<br><br>SH-60 R can be used by RSAF for normal helicopter operation.<br><br>It also can be used by RSN to support ship operation..<br><br>This way , maximisation of purpose can be achieved. Remember that helos are manned by RSAF pilots.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, no point getting the SH-60B as all hvae been discarded by the USN, and we may end up having to upgrade it again.If we have SH-60R, it is almost the same as  a MH-60K Nighthawk, and you're right, the RSAF does man the helos and who knows, they could be converted to inland SAR duties if needed be too.</div>
