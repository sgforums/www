These guys are as professional as soldiers are going to get, more than head and shoulders than what many of us can ever aspire to be. They were both combat veterans, do you think that what they did is simple clear cut case of a rush of blood to the head?<br><br>The way I see it, they looked at the situation down below, saw 2, maybe four injured friendlies a few minutes away from a terrible death, and decided they would try to do something about it. They would have known that their chances were slim, but they decided to give it a go anyway. The way I see it, they took a calculated risk, and failed in this instance. Yet I would not go as far as to say that their mission was doomed to fail, nor that they were hasty, emotional or irrational about it.<br><br>I do admire their courage, but I've never gone as far as to say that they were right or wrong. This is due to the fact that I have considered the odds at hand, their psyche, the situation down below, their indoctrination, their confidence in their training, their judgement of the opposition. So your analysis of me being emotional is off the mark. I've already said that if one were to look purely at a military standpoint, going in was not the right thing to do. But when all other factors are considered, then the picture becomes a lot muddier and a less hasty judgement about the rights and wrongs is required.<br><br>As for their "tangible achievements" or lack thereof, as I've said before, its not an excuse for any military man to shirk his fellow soldiers in a time of need. They did not achieve their aim, but things could have quite easily turned out differently.<br><br>As for the MOH awarded to them, the US military does not hand them out for fun. The criteria for them to be handed out is very strict, and if there's any reasonable controversy about the decision, it would be downgraded to a lesser honour at the drop of a hat. To simply say that MOH is handed out for bravery not intelligence is simply not true, because if the brass regards what someone has done is brave but not too smart, they will give you something else, simple as that. The US military has no lack of lesser medals (as opposed to the MoH, not that these medals are easy to win themselves) to hand out if they feel that you have not displayed intelligence AND bravery (among others) to deserve a MOH.<br><br>Nice try at making it look like I'm the one who's notbeing objective before making a judgement, but you can't do that to me when I haven't made a judgement on their actions. All I've been doing throughout this thread is presenting alternate trains of thought to show why your judgement is wrong and premature.<br><br>As for whether you've called them stupid or hinted at that, heres the passage from you,<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>And thingy abt the MOH, they are awarded for their bravery not their intelligence. I dun think any panel in the world will award them for that!!!<br></strong></blockquote>No panel will award them a medal for intelligence? Seems pretty clear cut what you meant with that remark.</div>

I wonder what he would think if he was right there, right then in that Blackhawk with them as they mulled the issue.<br><br>I seriously doubt they were highly emotional soldiers who would throw themselves over a grenade to save a comrade, there were plenty of factors why their action failed. If you did read the book, the ground convoy almost reached the second downed bird (Gordon's), but due to the fog of war and the situtation, they made the error of turning away for the first crash, which was much further away. Who knows what might have happened if they decided to reach the second bird?<br><br>There was plenty of stuff that was happening right there and right then, and their choice can hardly be distilled down to sucidal and unintelligent emotionism. I propose that they were more unfortunate then unintelligent, for if any of a number of hinge factors did tip their way, they would have easily survived the encounter, but they didn't quite happen that way. A large part of war is about luck and chaos theory as well.<br><br>Emotion? I doubt it.

Read my initial statement again carefully:<br><br><blockquote><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Reading through the book, it is doubtful if M16 variants would be more useful in their situation, as there were much dissatisfaction with the ammo used in the battle, since it was designed to defeat body armour and the mobs didn't use any, there were several occasions when the Rangers and Deltas found that their 5.56s went right through without doing much damage and each target required several rounds before being stopped for good.</strong></span><br></blockquote>As Nathan has said, the book Black Hawk down had several references to how several rounds were needed to stop each Somali. And also several references to how targets hit by a round continued running or picked themselves up under their own steam. More tellingly, at least one veteran of Mogadishu interviewed by Mark Bowden recalled how he felt stupid for mocking Randy Shugart for carrying the antique rifle before the mission, and wishing he had the M-14 and its 7.62mm stopping power after seeing the Somalis he had hit with the 5.56mm pick themselves up or simply continue running.<br><br>Theres no need for the scope, the M-14 is not a dedicated sniper's rifle, it has effective, built in iron sights.<br><br>If I was a shooter in a real battle, especially when the numbers are stacked against me, I would want a rifle/ammo which is the most effective at stopping the enemy when I hit him, instead of having to worry about him picking himself up and continue shooting even after being shot by me. Anything else, weight/auto fire etc etc are honestly, secondary concerns in such a situation. Especially if I'm a Causasian Delta trained SpecOps operator.<br><br>Go read the book, as well as In the Company of Heroes by Michael Durant. It'll change a lot of the perspectives on the battle that dervied from just purely watching the Hollywood movie. Really.<br><br>As someone has mentioned on the recent SAR21 thread, the 5.56mm is on it's way out too, and is being replaced by the 6.8mm rounds, albeit slowly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Viper52,<br>you left out the important point "armour-piercing" rounds from the start of your posting. If you put "not suitable bullets" to a M16, you cannot use that case to say my point that M16 is more suitable in that situation.<br><br>If normal 5.56 round are put in, the for distances below 300m, the 5.56's velocity make up for its short coming of the 7.62. So in a way it is still as capable a round to take down anyone. The only problem is for further distance, then, the 5.56 is disadvantage.<br><br>By the way, I don't memorized or put too much faith in facts on rifles and bullets from novels from pilot and journalist.</div>
