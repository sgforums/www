And also several references to how targets hit by a round continued running or picked themselves up under their own steam. More tellingly, at least one veteran of Mogadishu interviewed by Mark Bowden recalled how he felt stupid for mocking Randy Shugart for carrying the antique rifle before the mission, and wishing he had the M-14 and its 7.62mm stopping power after seeing the Somalis he had hit with the 5.56mm pick themselves up or simply continue running."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Nathan,<br><br>If you don't even know what the ammos the guys are carrying whether they are suitable for anti-personnal, how it justify to say it is correct to send them in ?

Is it not the job for professional commanders to know their ammos and their purpose, even viper52 and other like you, read about it from books ! Oh so the commander who send them in may not read enough books on guns and ammos, or we presume he have amnesia and forgot what rounds they are all issued.

            <div class='col-md body'>The issue we're all debating about is why the commander sent the 2 snipers down to rescue the pilot. Now, quoting from the book,<br><br><blockquote><strong><span class="large">"This was not a hopeless mission. One or two properly armed, well-trained soldiers could <span style="font-style: italic;">hold off</span> an undisciplined enemy indefinitely. Shughart and Gordon were experts at killing and staying alive. They were career soldiers trained to get hard, ugly things done."</span></strong></blockquote>"Hold off" in the quote here does NOT mean "shoot em all to pieces". It means "keep yourselves and the pilot alive".<br><br>The snipers' mission was NOT<br><span style="color: red;">"Engage and try to kill 1 million sammies and die to get a MoH".</span><br><br><span style="color: black;">Neither was it</span><br><span style="color: red;">"See sammy dude, shoot sammy dude, kill sammy"</span><br><br><span style="color: black;">The snipers' mission were to </span><br><span style="color: red;">"Rescue the pilot"</span><br><br><span style="color: black;">Rescue missions are covert. As ST said, they were supposed to either </span><br><ul><span style="color: red;">(1)sneak the pilot to safety if possible, then extract quietly or<br>(2)hole up somewhere, wait for support, then get the extract the pilot to safety</span></ul><br><br>They were not trying to herd 300 civilians to safety in broad daylight waving the american flag in the process. They were trying to extract survivors with 2 men as quickly, and as quietly as they can.<br><br>It is always best NOT to engage if doing so will interfere with your mission. Imagine a 300+ strong Infantry Battalion on foot en route to some objective when 3 snipers shoot the middle of the column. Going by gary's gungho RoE, the entire battalion should engage because they are just there for them to shoot at.<br><br>Please get it into your head that "The snipers weren't there to take on X enemies." If possible, I am very sure the snipers would prefer to hide somewhere and wait for the mob to go somewhere else searching for the pilot.<br><br>As the cliche goes "The best plan in the world survives only the first minute of battle", so did their plan. It went to hell, they got surrounded by sammies and we all know the rest.<br><br>Sh!t happens. Always does during war and the 2 brave snipers got killed.<br><br>And I reiterate that <span style="color: red;">"<strong>Col Harrell was an experienced commander. But more importantly, he, more than anyone one of us in the entire forum, knew his own guys and the Mogadishu ground. He knew the situation, knew what the enemy was capable of, and what his own men can do. If he felt his guys can take the heat, who the heck are we to say no?</strong>"</span><br><br>If you wanna argue about why rescue the pilot <span style="font-style: italic;">at all</span> because of the risk involved, please read my earlier post with the nicoll highway analogy (page 3).<br><br>Lastly, IMO the ammo and gun are slightly out of point. It's like saying they shouldn't have used Black Hawks in Mogadishu, but (correct me if i'm wrong) Black Hawks were all they had. Same case with the rescue, the snipers and their equipment were all Mike Durant had.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SingaporeTyrannosaur:</div><div class="quote_body">Gary is indeed the one who is caught up with emotionism here.<br><br>He can't get it out of his mind that the D-boys didn't go down there to fight 100+ skinnies or establish a perimeter. They were going down there to get the aircrew. Unlike Gary, who is mad enough to dream up such ideas, professional D-boys avoid firefightrs unless they really have to. Gary just can't get it out of his head that they weren't going in on a sucide mission. The outcome nevertheless.<br><br>Unfortunately, things did not turn out quite that way for them, and one thing that Gary has failed to prove, despite his exausive attempts to fit a square peg into a round hole, was that the D-operatives chose their actions based on emotionism and irrationality.<br><br>What's obvious is that they weren't going in there to fight sammies off (even the most irrational would know they didn't stand a chance), they were going in to get the crew otta there, and probably to some safe area they could hold out for a while until help arrived. It was a dangerous undertaking that went wrong. Could their plan had worked? Certainly, but it was risky and could go wrong, and it did.<br><br>How would they be considered irrational? If they decided that they could acomplish their mission by fighting off the mob on their own, and that was their main action plan. Which is nuts and certainly wasn't in their decks. They were forced to fight the mob, they certainly didn't camp out and wait for the mob to come to them while they sniped away.<br><br>Of course, need I mention after the battle one of the operatives actually went into the enemy zone for three days and three nights to recover the bodies of his comrades, and he did it. Now, 1 guy against a hostile city. I wonder what that reflects on his rationality.<br><br>The best I can determine is that Gary suffers from a bad case of hollywood logic, where the only solution he sees to the problem is by force and action alone. While they ended up using up all their ammo and having to fight to the finish. One wonders if that was their actual intention or plan when they went in. And if that wasn't their intention, their undertaking certainly wasn't irrational, or emotional. It was a calculated risk that went wrong.<br><br>If Gary's logic is to be followed, every soldier who died when the odds were against him is irrational or emotional.</div></blockquote>So ST, from your post ,  I believe you are saying that 2 snipers cannot hold the perimeter against a large mob of with automatic weapons and RPG, right? I think we certainly agree on this point.<br><br>Now , you also speculated that they a have plan to move to a more defendable location to increase the odds.That is your basis or your argument to increase their survivability. Yes very logical, every soldier we always try to improve their cover.<br><br>But even b4 they landed, they were already a small mob near the crash site, this was indicated in the citation, the book as well as  the movie. i.e. the area was already hot, therefore they need to fight their way out if they were going to more defendable location!<br>Now,was any more defendable location near crash site in the first place?<br><br>The problem with this speculation, from the book, the movie as well as the citation as indicated otherwise, when they reached the crash site , checked the injured, pulled Durant to one side and started to defend.<br><br>No indication at all that they even attempt to carry Durant out of the crash site. No indication from any sources as well abt any plan to move to a more defendable location. But certainly the crash site was already hot with skinnies even b4 they have landed.<br>Pure speculation from your part, ST.<br><br>Now ST , you did not even think it  thru, let assume that you are right, they going to fight thru the blockade carrying the casualty to a more defendable location.<br><br>In the actual senario, it was only  one casualty and three dead, so one sniper would have to carry Durant, making him combat ineffective, for example fireman lift, he has only one free hand, unable to aim well, unable to reload as well as run fast enough becos of additional weight and fight thru the blockade!!!<br>Therefore even this questionable!<br><br>Now what would have happened if that were two or more casualties?<br>Two would have made both snipers even more combat ineffective.<br><br>Three would have been a problem, take two and leave one to die? Nah , all 5 would be on the crash defending against the mob.<br><br>If you have thought thru the casualty factor , it will not so rational afterall!!!!<br><br></div>
